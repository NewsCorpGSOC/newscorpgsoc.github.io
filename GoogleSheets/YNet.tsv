Brazil probes Israeli tourist for alleged war crimes	Brazilian federal court orders an investigation after Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) issues complaint including video, photographs showing IDF soldier during Gaza war A federal court in Brazil ordered an investigation into a visiting Israeli, who served in the IDF, for possible war crimes after the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) provided the court with documentation of the soldier's activity in the war in Gaza. The foundation that was named for a six-year-old Palestinian girl that was claimed to have been killed by IDF fire during the war, said that the Brazilian government decided to take action after a complaint was filed against the Israeli who arrived in Brazil a week ago. In their complaint the foundation said his actions were part of a broader effort that included genocide and crimes against humanity, according to international law. The foundation provided video clips, geographic locations and photos allegedly showing the Israeli placing explosives and participating in the destruction of 'entire neighborhoods' in Gaza that were claimed to have been housing displaced Gazans, last November. 'These materials prove beyond doubt the direct involvement of the suspect in these despicable acts,' HRF said. According to a report in the Metropoles online newspaper, a Brazilian lawyer explained that the investigation in Brazil was initiated because the country is a signatory of the Rome Statue. 'Any country that has signed the statue is compelled to ensure that crimes such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide must be investigated and their perpetrators must be brought to justice,' she said. It called on Brazil to immediately detain the suspect before he flees the country and 'destroys evidence,' adding that the families whose homes were destroyed have joined the complaint. The IDF last month, warned Israelis who had served in the fighting in Gaza that they could be subjected to criminal proceedings abroad and urged them to remove any social media posts they may have had, showing them during the war.

IDF downs Yemeni missile before reaching Israel, alarm triggers i...	Alarm sounds in Talmei Elazar following missile launch from Yemen, which was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace; residents in central Israel report hearing explosions due to interception The IDF intercepted a missile launched from Yemen early Sunday before it entered Israeli airspace. The interception triggered an alarm in Talmei Elazar in northern Israel, and residents across central Israel reported hearing explosions, including in Jerusalem, Tel Mond, Rishon Lezion, Kfar Saba, Ganei Tikva, Petah Tikva, Hod Hasharon, Kokhav Yair, Lod, Tayibe and the West Bank settlement of Sal’it. On Friday morning, alarms sounded in multiple areas, including the Dan region, Sharon Plain, Shephelah and Jerusalem, following another missile launch from Yemen. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF confirmed the interception of that missile, marking the first time a single missile launch led to alarms in both the Dan region and Jerusalem. Hours later, the IDF intercepted a drone launched from Yemen. Earlier in the week, on Monday evening, a ballistic missile fired from Yemen also triggered alarms across central Israel. The IDF later clarified that the missile was intercepted before entering Israeli territory and that the alarms were activated due to concerns over falling debris. During that incident, an 18-year-old woman in Yavne sustained minor injuries while running to a shelter, and pieces of the interception fell in Beit Shemesh. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1e8f8vi1l	2025-01-04T15:39:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/rkhs7grU1g/rkhs7grU1g_141_91_676_381_0_small.jpg

Israeli national killed in car turnover in Tanzania	Foreign Ministry says woman was alongside five of her family members, who were also injured, in a trip to a local safari; body to be delivered to Israel A 30-year-old Israeli woman was killed on Saturday in a jeep turnover accident during a family trip to a safari in Tanzania. Five other family members suffered minor injuries in the accident and were airlifted from the scene to a local hospital with various injuries. The woman’s body will be flown to Israel in the coming days. The Foreign Ministry was informed of the fatal accident and said, 'The Department for Israelis Abroad at the Foreign Ministry and the Israeli Consul in Nairobi are aware of the incident and we are working to assist the family and the medical team sent to the site.'

Tragic irony': Two Israelis injured in New Orleans attack fought...	The two reservists decided to travel to the U.S. together following a year of war and were injured when the terrorist rammed them with his car; one's condition remains critical The two Israelis in their 20s who were seriously and moderately injured in the ramming and shooting attack in New Orleans this week had previously served together in reserve duty during the war, taking part in battles in both Gaza and Lebanon. Recently, they left on a six-week trip to the U.S. to recover from the past year's events. It appears they were injured by the vehicular ramming rather than the gunfire by the terrorist. They’re currently hospitalized in New Orleans and will only be flown back to Israel once their conditions stabilize. The two have known each other since their compulsory military service and had planned to conclude their U.S. trip with a visit to a relative of one of them in Florida. The Foreign Ministry aided their families to fly to Louisiana. One of them remains in critical condition due to head trauma and limb injuries, undergoing two life-saving surgeries so far. He's still in a life-threatening condition. His friend’s condition is more stable, though he sustained severe limb injuries and internal trauma. He's no longer in danger but has undergone two major surgeries as well. On Friday, his breathing tubes were removed and he was able to communicate with his family for the first time, recounting what he remembered of the attack. Israel's Deputy Consul General to the U.S. Elad Shoshan, told the New York Post: ' That’s the tragic irony. They left the terror of one country and never expected to be victims of it in another. They came here to relax, to travel. Now that’s interrupted in the most horrific way.' Shoshan mentioned that he managed to briefly communicate with the critically injured Israeli before his first surgery: 'He pressed my hand. He’s in severe pain all over his body. When people chant, ‘Globalize the intifada,’ it means importing violence from one region to another. 'And that’s exactly what’s happening. They want to bring violence and terror to America. Israel and the U.S. are fighting the same ideology, the same enemy, as on October 7. Hamas acted like ISIS, that was its inspiration—just like this terrorist.' The New Year’s Eve attack in New Orleans, which left 12 people dead and 35 injured, was carried out by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Texas resident and former U.S. Army serviceman. The FBI confirmed reports that an ISIS flag was found in his car and is investigating his ties to the terror organization. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The attack took place around 3:15 a.m. local time on Bourbon Street in the heart of the city’s French Quarter, a well-known entertainment district. Jabbar was armed with an assault rifle and fired at his victims during the ramming. At one point, he exited his vehicle and engaged in a shootout with police officers, injuring two of them before being neutralized. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syszumwlje	2025-01-04T12:40:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/HydujRz8Je/HydujRz8Je_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
U.S. pessimistic on ongoing hostage deal talks in Qatar	Officials stress talks are still ongoing despite sounding skepticism amid widening gaps and release of video showing hostage Liri Albag in captivity U.S. officials briefed on the ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas in Qatar, where the Israeli delegation arrived on Friday, expressed skepticism about progress on Saturday, saying, 'It'll be difficult to reach a deal by January 20,' the date of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Despite the pessimism and following Hamas’ release of a video showing IDF lookout Liri Albag who’s been held captive in Gaza since October 7, the officials clarified: 'Efforts are still ongoing. According to the Americans, reports from Doha indicate skepticism and significant gaps that hinder progress before the set deadline. Trump issued a warning to Hamas last month notifying the terror group of serious consequences should the hostages not be released. The reported skepticism is unusual, as the Americans have typically projected optimism during the negotiations. However, all involved on the U.S. side appear doubtful at this time. Still, one U.S. official suggested that the skepticism could be a positive sign, noting that negotiations often fail when optimism is high. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden’s envoy to the Middle East Brett McGurk is expected to join the talks in Doha, likely to make a final push to secure a deal before Trump’s inauguration. In response to the U.S. skepticism, senior Israeli officials said, 'There’s still a chance for a deal,' though no guarantees exist. An Israeli source noted, 'Progress has been made but it’ll take more time. The outcome of the negotiations is unpredictable.' Additionally, Israel views Hamas’ release of Liri’s video at this time as an attempt at psychological warfare and public opinion manipulation aimed at extracting further concessions from Israel. The Israeli delegation, composed of Mossad, Shin Bet and IDF Military Intelligence officials, arrived in Doha on Friday morning. However, their mandate to conduct the talks was granted only in the afternoon, following a phone consultation between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team. Netanyahu 'approved the continuation of the negotiations,' giving the delegation a mandate to advance. Nonetheless, gaps remain, despite Israel describing the process as 'slow progress.' The disparities between the parties center on several issues, the most pressing being the number of hostages to be released in the deal. Hamas is willing to release a very limited number of live hostages and refuses to provide a list of names upfront, which Israel insists on as a basis for progress. Currently, the gap between the number of hostages Hamas is prepared to release and Israel's demands for a humanitarian hostage release phase is substantial. Disagreements also persist over ending the war and the military presence along the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors.

Syria's international airport to reopen in bid to show stability	De facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa announces international flights to the country will resume soon as more countries decide to open routes to Syria Syria's main airport in its capital of Damascus will reopen for international flights for the first time since the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime next week, the country's new government announced on Saturday. The airport’s reopening, which was targeted multiple times by Israel according to foreign reports, is seen as an attempt by Jihadist rebel leader and de facto authority in Syria Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), to project stability. 'We assure Arab and international airlines that we've begun the reconstruction of the airports in Aleppo and Damascus with the help of our partners so they can receive aircraft from around the world,' state news agency SANA cited Syria's Civil Aviation Authority head as saying. International aid planes have already landed in Syria since the coup and domestic flights within the country have resumed. According to the AFP news agency, the first flight since Assad's escape occurred on December 18, when a plane flew from Damascus Airport to Aleppo. Qatar Airways was quick to announce its return to flying to Syria for the first time in 13 years. Meanwhile, Egypt's Foreign Ministry reported that an Egyptian cargo plane landed at Damascus Airport on Saturday, delivering humanitarian aid from Cairo to Syria for the first time since Assad's ousting. The plane carried 15 tons of supplies and food as part of Egypt's 'commitment to support our brothers, the Syrian people.' The shipment, provided by the Egyptian Red Crescent Society, was handed over to its Syrian partners and included tents, blankets, food and medical supplies. Last week, Saudi Arabia launched a 'humanitarian airlift' effort to Syria, delivering food, tents and medical equipment.

Hezbollah chief: 'Our patience may run out before the cease-fire ...	Terror group's Secretary-General Naim Qassem warns in speech organization is ready to resume hostilities if cease-fire conditions aren't upheld including IDF withdrawal from Lebanon Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem claimed on Saturday that his terror organization successfully repelled Israel's actions in Lebanon during the war. 'For 64 days, Israel tried to advance into our territory but only managed to move hundreds of meters,' Qassem said. 'Israel failed to penetrate deeper into our land thanks to the strength of the resistance. The resistance is powerful, deterrent and effective, disrupting the enemy's objectives despite the extensive destruction and Israeli aggression,' he added. Regarding the fragile cease-fire, Qassem said, 'The resistance wielded significant power during the cease-fire. Israel was forced to request a cease-fire due to the resistance's capabilities. We faced unprecedented aggression, stood firm and broke Israel's strength. Sacrifice is the path to dignity and the resistance will continue.' 'There’s no specific timeline dictating the resistance’s actions — not in the agreement, nor with the 60-day timeframe,' he added. 'Our patience may run out before the 60 days, or it might last longer. The resistance's leadership will decide. Our patience hinges on our judgment about the right timing to confront aggression and its violations.' 'The cease-fire agreement obligates Israel to withdraw south of the Litani River. The Lebanese state is responsible for implementing the cease-fire agreement with Israel.' Qassem compared the current scenario to the 1982 Lebanon War. He noted that Israel reached Beirut easily back then, but 'during the 2024 aggression, Israel paid a heavy price without managing to advance more than a few hundred meters south of the Litani. This serves as a deterrent.' Talking about the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, Qassem said, 'What happened in Syria could have happened in Lebanon and I believe the Syrian people will play a role in the future confrontation with Israel. Resistance is our choice — to liberate the land, defend sovereignty, support Palestine and confront the spread of Israeli occupation. The resistance's leadership decides when and how to resist, using its methods and weapons of choice.' At the end of the month, the 60 days stipulated in the cease-fire agreement for the IDF’s withdrawal from Lebanon will expire. The IDF has already declared that the date wasn’t 'set in stone.' Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, cited a 'source,' on Saturday saying that the Lebanese army’s leadership claimed Israel is 'gradually imposing new rules of engagement and trying to establish its freedom of movement which will remain even after the cease-fire ends.' According to the source, Lebanese army officials received signals from General Jesper Jeffers, head of the U.S.-led cease-fire monitoring mechanism in Lebanon, during his visit to the country, about 'Israel’s intention to extend the cease-fire from 60 to 90 days.' The Lebanese outlet claimed this depended on Israel achieving its goals — ensuring that Hezbollah can’t initiate and launch attacks against the country. IDF officials have recently been considering staying in Lebanon beyond the period set in the cease-fire agreement. However, no decision has been made according to official sources and the matter remains undecided. The IDF is preparing for this possibility, explaining that the decision will depend on the Lebanese side, their conduct and whether their army achieves full control over southern Lebanon. Israel has made it clear that its decisions will be based on developments in Lebanon. If, at the end of the 60 days, the other side fails to uphold the agreement, there would be no reason not to remain deployed in the area. Israeli officials hope the Americans will understand their stance that a timely withdrawal, without Lebanon fulfilling its part, would be problematic. It’s likely the U.S. won’t allow this initiative to collapse. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Two key questions are on the table as the cease-fire deadline approaches: whether the IDF will extend its stay in southern Lebanon and whether residents will be allowed to return to their homes in the south.

His visit is partly driven by U.S. interest in ensuring Lebanon's presidential elections and supporting the continuation of the cease-fire. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1nuuxvuyx	2025-01-04T09:56:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/04/rk946yDU1l/rk946yDU1l_173_40_951_535_0_small.jpg

IDF detains two Israelis crossing into Syria	Police report that two northern Israeli suspects were taken in for further questioning to determine the reason behind their attempted passage Two Israelis living in the northern part of the country were arrested by IDF forces on Saturday after crossing into Syrian territory in a vehicle, the Israel Police reported. They were apprehended driving on a road not far from the border. The two were detained for questioning and taken to the police to continue their investigation. The reasons for their crossing remain unclear, though it is possible they entered Syria out of curiosity or a desire to 'explore.' The possibility that the crossing was for the sake of criminal purposes is also being examined.

Security forces report foiled drug-smuggling attempt across Gaza border via UAVs ready to ferry drugs; troops arrest Israeli suspect The IDF and police reported on Saturday foiling a drug-smuggling attempt from Israel into the Gaza Strip using a drone. Overnight, security forces stationed in the sector apprehended a suspect attempting to flee the site where he operated the drone. A search of his vehicle revealed another drone loaded with drugs, prepared for smuggling into Gaza. The suspect, an Israeli citizen of Bedouin descent, was taken into custody along with the confiscated evidence. He has been transferred for investigation by the police’s central unit in the southern district. Smuggling trends escalate Security officials disclosed that this incident is part of a broader trend observed in recent days. While overnight Saturday's attempt was successfully intercepted, 10 smuggling operations succeeded earlier this week. Officials estimate that the contraband likely included drugs or cigarettes, though the exact contents remain unclear due to the smuggled items not being recovered.

Blinken recounts Gaza war, reveals threat that made Netanyahu app...	Outgoing secretary of state in interview recounts October 7, disagreements with Netanyahu, efforts to complete hostage deal and how he thinks the war might end On Saturday, the New York Times published an interview with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken before his end of term on January 20. In it, he spoke among other things on disagreements with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, difficulties in reaching a hostage deal in Gaza and his disappointment of the world that he said forgot what happened on October 7, 2023, too fast. When Blinken assumed office, he believed he'd mediate a historic agreement—normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 'On October 6 we were very much pursuing normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. And in fact, I was scheduled to go to Saudi Arabia and Israel on October 10. Obviously, that didn’t happen.' Blinken told the outlet. 'The purpose of that trip was to work on the Palestinian component of any normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, because we believed and the Saudis also said it was hugely important to make sure that if there was going to be normalization, there was also a pathway toward a Palestinian state.' That trip never took place. Instead, Blinken arrived in Israel during the war's early days to support the embattled ally. 'Since October 7, we’ve had some core goals in mind. I was there. I was in Israel and then in the region five days later. I saw horrors beyond anyone’s imagination inflicted on men, women and children. And we were determined to do everything we could to help ensure that October 7 would never happen again.' Blinken noted that the U.S. aimed to prevent the war from spreading to other countries and fronts, a goal that, in retrospect, has seen limited success. ' We also wanted to make sure that the war wouldn’t spread, the conflict wouldn’t spread to other fronts, to other countries, because that would mean more death and destruction.,' he explained. He added that the U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration wished to protect civilians caught in a war they didn't start and had no power to stop, ensuring they received the aid necessary to survive the terrible conflict. Regarding the effort to prevent a recurrence of October 7, Blinken added, 'I think we’re in a good place. Israel has destroyed Hamas’s military capabilities. It’s eliminated the leadership that was responsible for October 7.' When the interviewer raised criticism of Israel's campaign against Hamas, Blinken responded, 'No one needs to remind me of the suffering, because it’s something that drives me every single day. It’s exactly why we’ve done everything in our power to find a way to get an end to the conflict through getting the hostages back and getting a cease-fire.' When asked if he believed Israel was complying with international law, Blinken noted, 'We, as you know, have looked and continue to look at that in depth. And we put out our own reports on this with our own assessments.' He added, 'When it comes to the actions that Israel has taken, in its just defense in trying to make sure that October 7 never happens again, we’ve said from Day 1 that how Israel does that matters.' 'An entire society that didn’t want any assistance getting to a single Palestinian in Gaza' Blinken recounted his first visit to Israel, just five days after the massacre, and how he 'convinced' Netanyahu to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza despite harsh domestic criticism. 'I spent with my team nine hours in the I.D.F.’s headquarters in Tel Aviv, six stories underground with the Israeli government, including the prime minister, including arguing for hours on end about the basic proposition that the humanitarian assistance needed to get to Palestinians in Gaza.' He explained that the heated debate stemmed from the Israeli public being in a state of total trauma in the days following the massacre. 'You had in Israel in the days after October 7 a totally traumatized society. This wasn’t just the prime minister or a given leader in Israel. This was an entire society that didn’t want any assistance getting to a single Palestinian in Gaza.,' he said. Blinken then shared the ultimatum he gave Netanyahu: 'President Biden was planning to come to Israel a few days later. And in the course of that argument, when I was getting resistance to the proposition of humanitarian assistance getting in, I told the prime minister, I’m going to call the president and tell him not to come if you don’t allow this assistance to start flowing. And I called the president to make sure that he agreed with that, and he fully did,' Blinken said. When he was asked why the U.S. continues to supply Israel with arms that harm Palestinians, especially since Hamas no longer poses a significant threat, he said, 'We have been and we remain fundamentally committed to Israel’s defense.' 'And that means that the support that the United States provides over many administrations, Republican and Democrat, over many years, that support is absolutely vital to making sure that Israel is able to defend itself, that it can deter aggression coming from many other quarters, whether it’s Hezbollah, whether it’s Iran, whether it’s the many Iranian-backed proxies, whether it’s the Houthis, you name it.' Obstacles on the way to a hostage deal Blinken added the fastest way to end the ongoing fighting in Gaza is through a cease-fire agreement that includes the release of hostages. 'There have been two major impediments, and they both go to what drives Hamas.' 'One has been whenever there has been public daylight between the United States and Israel and the perception that pressure was growing on Israel, we’ve seen it: Hamas has pulled back from agreeing to a cease-fire and the release of hostages. And so there are times when what we say in private to Israel where we have a disagreement is one thing and what we’re doing or saying in public may be another.' When asked whether he viewed Netanyahu as a partner — amid reports that he blocked a cease-fire deal in July that could have led to the release of hostages — Blinken responded, ' No, that’s not accurate. What we’ve seen time and again is Hamas not concluding a deal that it should have concluded.' He acknowledged, however, 'There have been times when actions that Israel has taken have, yes, made it more difficult. But there’s been a rationale for those actions, even if they’ve sometimes made getting to a conclusion more difficult.' Alongside his criticism of Israel’s conduct, Blinken also strongly condemned the global community for quickly forgetting what happened on October 7 and who was primarily responsible for the current situation. 'One of the things that I found a little astounding throughout is that for all of the understandable criticism of the way Israel has conducted itself in Gaza, you hear virtually nothing from anyone since October 7 about Hamas. Why there hasn’t been a unanimous chorus around the world for Hamas to put down its weapons, to give up the hostages, to surrender — I don’t know what the answer is to that.' 'Israel, on various occasions has offered safe passage to Hamas’s leadership and fighters out of Gaza. Where is the world? Where is the world, saying, Yeah, do that! End this! Stop the suffering of people that you brought on! Now, again, that doesn’t absolve Israel of its actions in conducting the war.

Blinken added he believed the war would end under conditions outlined by Biden last year. ' If we don’t have the opportunity to start to try to implement it through a hostage cease-fire agreement in the next couple of weeks, we will hand it off to the incoming Trump administration, and they can decide whether to move forward with it,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2tm08iyg	2025-01-04T07:09:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/12/SJZwuoErWa/SJZwuoErWa_1_21_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Hamas releases video showing sign of life from hostage Liri Albag	Terror group releases clip as attempts at psychological warfare after previous footage of the IDF lookout was released in May; Family prohibits publication of video Hamas on Saturday released a video on Saturday showing a sign of life from IDF lookout Liri Albag, who was abducted on October 7, 2023. At her family's request, Ynet isn’t publishing the video, an image from it or the statements made in it at this time. Liri was abducted from the Nahal Oz base during her first Saturday on duty after completing her basic training, alongside four other lookouts: Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy. Liri’s mother, Shira Albag, shared the moments of terror at the base and the last messages she received from her daughter in a previous interview with Ynet. 'At 6:30 a.m., she called me and said, 'Mom, there’s a crazy rocket attack here. We jumped out of bed, there wasn’t even an alarm. We’re in the shelter.' I also heard the explosions in the background; no one here knew anything yet. I asked her if she was okay and she answered, 'Everything's fine, people are alive here. We’re in the shelter.' 'She sent me a picture and I saw it was open on both sides. I told her it wasn’t a proper shelter. Liri responded, 'Mom, it’s fine. Everyone’s here, all the girls. Don’t worry.' In hindsight, I learned that most of the girls were saying their goodbyes to their families during that time. She didn’t say goodbye — she reassured everyone that everything was fine.' Last May, the hostages’ families allowed the public release of footage from the Nahal Oz base, as recorded by the body cameras of Hamas terrorists on October 7. The released version was edited, shortened and censored from the full footage. It shows the five lookouts being handcuffed by their captors. Later, the terrorists filmed themselves leading the five to a vehicle amid the sound of heavy gunfire in the background. The video released by Hamas, which the family has declined to authorize for publication at this stage, follows a series of footage and proofs of life shared by terrorist organizations in Gaza in recent weeks.

Biden's last hoorah: $8 billion weapons package to Israel is in t...	The U.S. plans to approve an arms package for Israel, including artillery shells, precision bombs, and GPS systems, though production and delivery could take years; Meanwhile, heavy bombs and bulldozer shipments face delays due to concerns over impact on civilians in Gaza In what may be one of President Joe Biden’s final actions before leaving the White House, the Biden administration announced its intention to approve an $8 billion arms deal with Israel. On Saturday morning, The New York Times reported that the U.S. State Department had 'informally' notified Congress of the proposed deal. The deal reportedly includes artillery shells, small-diameter bombs, munitions for fighter jets and helicopters, and GPS-guided bomb systems. However, many of the munitions in the package are not intended for immediate use, as production is expected to begin soon. Delivery to Israel could take years. In the coming weeks, congressional committees are expected to review the deal and raise questions with the U.S. State Department. If concerns arise, these committees have the authority to delay the arms transfer. Despite this announcement, the U.S. is still withholding the shipment of approximately 1,300 heavy bombs for the Israeli Air Force, which Israel had purchased from Boeing with Israeli funds rather than U.S. aid. Each bomb weighs close to a ton. The U.S. has expressed concerns that the Israeli military might use these bombs in ways that could harm civilian populations. While half of the shipment—previously frozen by the Biden administration—has been delivered to the Israeli military, the other half remains in storage in the United States. Just over a month ago, and less than 24 hours after a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon was announced, President Biden approved a $680 million arms deal with Israel. At that time, American officials informed Congress of plans to supply additional Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits to Israel, which convert unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, as well as small-diameter bombs. A week earlier, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected three proposals introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, a Jewish progressive leader in the Democratic Party (Technically independent, but caucuses with the Democrats) and a prominent critic of Israel. These proposals called for halting weapons transfers to Israel following the war in Gaza, including tank shells, mortar bombs, and JDAM kits. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: All senators who supported the proposals were Democrats, while members from both parties voted against them. The Biden administration opposed the measures, stating in a letter to Democratic senators prior to the vote that 'providing military equipment to Israel is an investment in its long-term security as it faces threats from Iran and elsewhere.' The letter also noted that 'the administration is continually working to improve conditions in Gaza.' Around two months ago, Ynet revealed new details about the freeze on U.S. arms shipments to the Israeli military. One of the items requested for ground forces—a shipment of 134 D9 bulldozers—has been delayed at Caterpillar factories in the United States, awaiting an export permit from the State Department in Washington. Israel had already ordered and paid for the shipment. The use of these bulldozers, primarily for demolishing structures in Gaza, has prompted significant internal criticism in the U.S., protests, and immense pressure on the Biden administration. As a result, the shipment has been frozen for several months. The impact is already being felt on the ground: according to Ynet inquiries, dozens of existing D9 bulldozers—heavily used in Israeli military operations in Gaza between November 2023 and mid-2024—are now in urgent need of maintenance. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r14mw888jx	2025-01-03T21:56:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/04/H1PSgL8L1g/H1PSgL8L1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

General Jeffers, who heads the cease-fire mechanism in Lebanon, praised the Lebanese army's dedication; Hezbollah announces it would refrain from escalation American General Jasper Jeffers, who heads the mechanism for supervising the cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, visited the south of the country on Friday and expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the Lebanese army. 'I am incredibly impressed by the professionalism and dedication of the LAF. They are working around the clock to provide security and dismantle unexploded ordnance so Lebanese citizens can safely return home.' In the last few weeks, the LAF cleared over 9800 pieces of explosive ordnance from more than 80 locations,' he said. Meanwhile, Lebanese media outlets reported an expected visit by the American envoy, Amos Hochstein, to Beirut on Monday. According to the Qatari newspaper 'Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed', Hochstein will be engaged in a dual mission: monitoring the implementation of the cease-fire agreement alongside discussions regarding the presidential elections in Lebanon. According to the Lebanese newspaper Al-Jumhuriya, an important meeting of the committee supervising the cease-fire agreement will be held this coming Monday in Naqoura. Sources said that the meeting will be chaired by Hochstein which may send a message of seriousness regarding the implementation of the agreement. At the same time, parliamentary sources told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that Hezbollah will continue to maintain self-restraint and will not be drawn into a military escalation against Israel. On Thursday, Air Force fighter jets destroyed Hezbollah medium-range rocket launchers in Lebanese territory. Arab media outlets reported three attacks in southern Lebanon. Earlier, an Iranian plane was reported to have landed at Beirut airport with money intended for Hezbollah and was detained by local authorities.

The Prisoner’s Dilemma: The question of Marwan Barghouti	Amid the ongoing hostage and cease-fire negotiations with Hamas, Israel considers to release Marwan Barghouti in the prisoner exchange despite his deep involvement in Palestinian terrorism 'We are not familiar with the information provided by the media on the possibility that Marwan Barghouti will be released as part of the deal and exiled to Turkey', stated his son, Qassam in an interview. One week since his return from Qatar, where his family reportedly discussed the possibility of including his father in the deal with senior Hamas officials, he shared: 'We are comparatively more optimistic. As a family, we don’t care where he is released to, it can even be to Kuala-Lumpur'. An 'Israeli senior official' responded to the media reports on the subject swiftly and decidedly, stating: 'There is no discussion of Barghouti being released'. The dilemma whether or not to release Barghouti - One of the senior leaders of Fatah - has been deliberated for over two decades, and has received greater attention since October 7, as the chances of his release as part of a deal for the release of security prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza seem to be growing. Over the years, it has been argued among in Israeli politics and media that Barghouti is a leader with considerable clout, and that, despite his involvement in terror attacks during the Second Intifada that killed 5, for which he has been sentenced to life in prison, he remains true to the peace negotiations, and is expected to pursue a two-state solution. Others claim that he is a 'mini-Arafat', whose loyalties lie with militarism, and who will surely advance a violent struggle upon his release. Barghouti is both a national symbol and a mystery. This 65-year-old leader, who was born in Kufr Kobar, a village near Ramallah, represents the generation that grew up in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the 1970s and 1980s, forming a defiant alternative for the founding generation headed by Arafat, who came from Tunisia and took over the Palestinian Authority. Like many of his peers, he too knows Israel well, speaks Hebrew, and has held many meetings with Israelis prior to the Second Intifada. The mystery stems from the fact that, although he has been absent for over two decades (nearly one third of his life), Marwan Barghouti remains the most popular candidate for leading the Palestinian system. Public opinion polls conducted over the past decade have consistently shown him to beat any other candidate in any election scenario, including Hamas representatives. Many Palestinians explain this strange phenomenon by claiming that the people look up to 'Barghouti the symbol', despite being unfamiliar with 'Marwan the man'. The public at large, and particularly the younger generation, born after he had been incarcerated, view him as the epiphany of national ideals, primarily resistance and sacrifice. Hamas is equally aware of the potential Barghouti harbors, and it is no surprise, therefore, that they, too, insist that he be released. In their view, this could yield two gains for the terror organization: establishing an image of the war spurred by Hamas as a national campaign that has led to achievements for all Palestinians; and the return to the playing field of a beloved leader who, unlike most senior Palestinian Authority officials, shares similar views to those of Hamas, and with whom reconciliation may be reached, which would enable the terror organization to gain much-coveted presence in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority is fostering a more ambivalent approach toward Barghouti. Publicly, its senior officials support his release from Israeli prison, yet many in Ramallah are concerned about the possibility that he would become a dominant rival in the race for Abu Mazen’s throne, and worry that he will promote a reconciliation with Hamas. 'Barghouti’s release will be bad news for Israel, but also for many who enjoy his very presence', remarked a senior Fatah official in Nablus Hussam Khader sardonically, while Fadwa, Barghouti’s wife, chose her words carefully: 'The Palestinian Authority itself is interested in Barghouti’s release, but some parties are not so inclined, and are not true Palestinian patriots'. Israel’s primary concern over Barghouti’s possible release is that he will use his freedom to promote violence. The assessment that he will do so is based, inter alia, on statements he has issued while in prison glorifying the armed struggle. His son, Qassam, however, said: 'They are scaring you for nothing. My father is the ultimate partner for Israel, he is true to the two-state vision, has garnered support across the Palestinian public, and can serve as a stable, uniting, and agreed point of contact for the Palestinian side'. Although Israel denies it, Barghouti may indeed be released, and reintegrated once more into the Palestinian system very soon, whether he is exiled overseas, returns to the West Bank, or, in the less likely turn of events, ends up in Gaza. Israel fears that, upon his release, Barghouti will advocate violence, while pursuing reconciliation with Hamas, forcing Israel to take action, particularly if he will be back in the West Bank. Yet a more complex scenario will generate a second 'Jolani dilemma', meaning an attempt on Barghouti’s part to appear moderate like Syria`s current ruler - including engaging in direct talks with Western and Israeli officials - while keeping them wondering whether it is merely a smokescreen masking an extremist’s vision. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even if Barghouti will not be included in the deal, he is expected to affect the Palestinian sphere, and, in turn, Israel too. He is determined to run for the presidency in any future Palestinian elections, even from within prison walls. In the seemingly likely event that he will win them; Israel will be subject to heavy international pressure. Such a development could also lead to protest and confusion within the Palestinian Authority as it finds itself being led by a man who is being imprisoned by the very country against which he is calling his people to fight, while engaging in close civil and security coordination with Israel. Be it from prison or the squares of Ramallah, it seems the name Barghouti will be on the lips of both nations, the Middle East, and the international community for a long time to come.

How Hamas uses hospitals for its benefit and the ensuing criticis...	Hamas uses Gaza hospitals as base of operations and interrogations as a tactic, 'They can suddenly take over a ward,' testifies a Gazan resident; Gazan reporter criticized Hamas Recently, Hamas' use of hospitals in the Gaza Strip has made headlines after the IDF exposed the terror organization. During the operation at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, about 240 terrorists were arrested, the largest arrest throughout the war, including the hospital director, Hussam Abu Safiya, who according to the IDF is suspected of being a Hamas operative. In a particularly unusual step, Israel decided to seal the hospital after the operation and put it out of use, preventing it from being used again by Hamas. On previous occasions when the IDF raided hospitals in Gaza, it allowed the continuation of operations there afterward. For example, on November 15, 2023, the IDF raided Shifa for the first time and found weapons, a tunnel shaft, explosives, and evidence that hostages were held there in the first days of the war. After the IDF withdrew from the site, the hospital returned to being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad members. Immediately after the IDF withdrew for the first time, sources in the Gaza Strip say, Hamas called on a very large number of civilians to return to the hospital buildings and its courtyards, promising to distribute aid. During this time, hundreds of weapons were brought in under the assumption that IDF forces would not return to the complex. 'Specific rooms in the hospital buildings became military and security management centers,' sources in the Gaza Strip said. 'Daily meetings were held for Hamas and Jihad members in the hospital corridors. The Israeli forces monitored all these movements from the air, but Hamas continued military activity from the hospital.' On March 18 2024, IDF forces returned to Shifa in a surprise raid, in which more than 200 terrorists were eliminated and hundreds more were arrested. According to the IDF spokesperson, weapons were found hidden between patient beds in the maternity ward, along with mortar bombs, IEDs and sniper weapons. Since then, Hamas has reportedly restored the hospital which has resumed operations. Hussam Yahya, a presenter for the Qatari Al Jazeera network, admitted that Hamas used Shifa, but claimed that it emboldens the population. 'It is a living nightmare for Israel's goal of emptying Gaza and the north. The hospital miraculously returned to work after its destruction. A meeting of clan leaders was held there, which resulted in a 'statement rejecting cooperation with Israel.' In short, the very presence of Shifa is a defeat for Israel,' Yahya stated. In the comments, some wondered: 'Why gather in a hospital? You idiots.' There are currently 23 hospitals operating in the Gaza Strip, including 13 field hospitals established by the international community, in coordination with the COGAT unit. Also, 10 additional hospitals in the Strip receive supplies from Israel, including equipment and food. Hamas's use of hospitals was not limited to medical treatment. Throughout the war, the terror organization has repeated the transgression, without regard for the population that increasingly needs medical treatments that have been reduced in response to IDF raids. In Gaza, this fact is well known, but there is no one to rise up, for now. 'There are medical personnel who are related to terrorists. These are Hamas' key people in all the hospitals. On any day they can arrive, take over an entire ward without anyone objecting to it. They arrive, close a ward, and the doctor is one of their own,' a Gazan resident told Ynet. 'Before the war, everything was open to them, but the takeover of the hospitals was noticeable. At any given moment, it was possible to shut down an entire hospital without regard for mothers, the sick or the wounded. This is how a terrorist organization behaves, and there is no one to stop it.' 'Most government institutions have been destroyed and the hospitals are used for meetings of police, security and aid personnel. 'Everything is done there, it's the safest place.' Recently, the IDF disclosed Hamas has used Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. About a year ago, Hamas police summoned a man who heads an aid-smuggling gang in the Al-Qararah area of Khan Yunis for questioning. The summons was issued on October 16, and it was clearly stated that the place of questioning was the hospital. On social media, Fatah supporters wondered: 'Why does the enemy bomb hospitals or schools that house refugees? There are people in the Gaza Strip who give them an opportunity and an excuse. Summoning people to the Nasser Hospital is just a call for the enemy to bomb the patients.' These days, the use of hospitals has become more necessary for Hamas which has lost government infrastructure one after another. 'From Hamas' perspective, the air force will not bomb a hospital full of displaced and sick people. The population inside must first be evacuated, and Hamas knows this very well,' said sources in Gaza. 'Now that most of the government institutions that Hamas used before the war have been demolished, it is also using them for meetings of police officers, security personnel, and for aid matters. Everything is conducted there. This is the safest place for them.' Israeli security sources commented. 'The terrorist organizations, led by Hamas, are trying to deflect public criticism of the organization's cynical exploitation of civilian institutions and hospitals onto IDF forces,' they said, and claimed: 'Hamas fears public criticism and protests against it, and therefore it is spreading misleading and false narratives on social media to pressure Israel through the international community.' Unprecedented criticism from a journalist: 'People are dying of cold in tents' The IDF's activity at the Kamal Adwan Hospital began to sway Hamas supporters in the past week. In a recording published on social media, Al-Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, who is considered one of Hamas's top aides, criticized the organization's negotiators, saying: 'The public could have prevented what is happening in the northern Gaza Strip and prevented the destruction and damage to the hospitals. But Hamas, which is conducting the talks, is not interested in the public, and the organization continues to use slogans.' Sharif criticized the ongoing rounds of negotiations, and mentioned the suffering of the residents of the Gaza Strip. 'Hamas' claims about being flexibile in the talks are not at all interesting to the public. It is impossible to continue dragging out the ceasefire talks. The public is suffering, stop haggling over the terms of the deal. We express opposition and protest against Hamas, which is making cynical use of the situation leading to the invasion of the IDF forces into the region.' In a tweet he later published, Sharif wrote: 'The war must end immediately. We do not want what happened in the north of the Gaza Strip to be repeated in Gaza City.

UNRWA reportedly preparing to cease activities in Gaza, West Bank	U.N. officials say they are preparing to shutter UNRWA operations,' the New York Times reports Friday; Decision comes after Knesset passed two pieces of legislation that bars the agency's activities on Israeli territory, such as coordinating with the IDF; UNRWA supports say this will deal a fatal blow to the Palestinians UN officials told The New York Times that UNRWA , the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, is preparing to cease its activities in Gaza and the West Bank. The report comes about two months after the Knesset passed two pieces of legislation banning the organization's activities in its territory, and which went into effect this month. After the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023, there was criticism in Israel against UNRWA over the involvement of some of its employees in the deadly attack. A UN investigation confirmed that nine of the organization's employees did indeed take an active part in the events and cooperated with Hamas. In light of the findings, the Knesset approved laws prohibiting UNRWA from operating in its territory. These laws, which will come into effect this month, prevent any cooperation with the organization. This will limit the organization's ability to continue its activities in the West Bank and Gaza, which require coordination with the IDF. 'It would be a massive impact on an already catastrophic situation,' Jamie McGoldrick, who oversaw the U.N. humanitarian operation across Gaza and the West Bank until April, told the New York Times. 'If that is what the Israeli intention is — to remove any ability for us to save lives — you have to question what is the thinking and what is the end goal?' UNRWA supporters claim that the cessation of operations would be a fatal blow to the Palestinian population. 'The world has abandoned us. We have nothing but the aid we get from UNRWA to survive,' Sami Abu Darweesh, 30, who lives in a refugee camp in southern Gaza run by UNRWA, told the newspaper. 'If that stops, what will we do?' 'We gave the government 90 days, and, actually, the entire world 90 days,' said Yuli Edelstein, the chairman of the parliamentary committee that drafted the UNRWA bills. 'Whoever truly cares about the population, let them bring about the groups that would help.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In Israel, support for the move to shut down UNRWA is growing. Knesset lawmaker Dan Illouz of the Likud, who was one of the initiators of the law against UNRWA, said: 'We succeeded! The historic law that I initiated to disconnect UNRWA from Israel is proving itself. The world is beginning to understand that UNRWA is an arm of Hamas and not an aid organization. Its employees were complicit in the October 7 massacre, its institutions hid weapons, and it educated generations of terrorists. Now, with its collapse, we are striking at the heart of the terror apparatus.' 'Israel has taken the first step – now the world must complete it. UNRWA must not only be reduced, it must disappear. This is a huge achievement for Israel’s security and the fight against terrorism!' said Illouz. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjpid8sike	2025-01-03T04:24:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/02/S1ec6Gj7kl/S1ec6Gj7kl_0_165_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The attack, which missed the helicopter, set off sirens at Kibbutz Be'eri for the first time in 10 months; 2 rockets also were launched from Gaza at Sderot and the vicinity; It is the eighth day in a row that sirens warning of rocket attacks have sounded in the Gaza envelope Rocket alert sirens sounded in Kibbutz Be'eri for the first time in 10 months on Friday following surface-to-air missile fired from Gaza; the shoulder-launched missile was fired at an Israeli Air Force helicopter over Gaza. This was followed Friday morning by two rockets launched at Sderot around noon. One of them exploded near Kibbutz Nir Am, the other fell in an open area. The Sderot municipality said that residents reported shrapnel on a local streets, and noted that there were no reports of any injuries or property damage. Footage from the municipal soccer stadium shows the explosions as many people watch the match there. An hour and a half before the sirens in Sderot, the alarms were sounded in Be'ari. They were triggered by a shoulder-launched missile fired by Hamas terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip at an Israeli Air Force helicopter. The missile did not hit or endanger the aircraft, which continued its operations, but since the missile was fired toward Israeli territory the alarm was sounded in Be'eri. This is the eighth consecutive day that an alert siren has sounded in the enclave. The last time there was a siren in Be'eri following rocket fire from Gaza was in March, almost 10 months ago.

Greenland's leader steps up push for independence from Denmark	Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede emphasised his desire to pursue independence from Denmark, its former colonial ruler, during his New Year speech, marking a significant change in the rhetoric surrounding the Arctic island's future. Egede's speech, which comes on the heels of comments by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressing his wish for 'ownership and control' of Greenland, also expressed a desire to strengthen Greenland's cooperation with other countries. 'It is about time that we ourselves take a step and shape our future, also with regard to who we will cooperate closely with, and who our trading partners will be,' he said. An independence movement has gained traction in Greenland in recent years in part due to revelations of misconduct by Danish authorities during the 20th century, including an involuntary birth control campaign launched in the 1960s. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953 but is now a self-governing territory of Denmark and in 2009 achieved the right to claim independence through a vote. In 2023, Greenland's government presented its first draft constitution. While a majority of Greenland's 57,000 inhabitants support independence, there is division over the timing and potential impact on living standards. Greenland's government has twice rejected offers by Trump to purchase the island, in 2019 and again last year, with Egede asserting that 'Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjxkciblje	2025-01-03T03:37:49-08:00	
German, French foreign ministers meet Syria's new rulers in Damas...	The foreign ministers of Germany and France said they wanted to forge a new relationship with Syria and urged a peaceful transition as they met its de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus on Friday on behalf of the European Union. Germany's Annalena Baerbock and France's Jean-Noel Barrot are the first ministers from the EU to visit Syria since rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8 and forced President Bashar al-Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family's decades-long rule. The French and German ministers met Sharaa in the Damascus People's Palace, but so far no details of their talks have been made public. Barrot similarly expressed his hope for a 'sovereign and safe' Syria that would leave no room for terrorism, chemical weapons or malign foreign actors, during a meeting with representatives from Syrian civil society organisations. Germany and France plan to offer their technical help and advice to Syria as the country drafts a new constitution, Barrot told journalists, saying that hope for the country's democratic transition was 'fragile but real'. He called for a political solution for Kurdish fighters in Syria to be integrated into the Syrian state, adding that a permanent ceasefire must be achieved, but he did not respond when asked when the EU could lift sanctions on Syria. Barrot also visited the French embassy, which has been closed since 2012, where he said France would work towards re-establishing diplomatic representation in line with political and security conditions, diplomatic sources said. As part of their visit, the ministers took a tour of Syria's most notorious prison, the vast Sednaya complex. 'Now it's up to the international community to help to bring justice to the people who have suffered here in this prison of hell,' Baerbock said.

Take me, al Golani: New Syrian leader wooed by many	Ahmad al-Sharaa is least likely to align himself with Russia, and he needs legitimacy and funding from the West including the lifting of sanctions to allow trade and foreign investments Nearly one month after the fall of the Assad regime, the new leaders of Syria are facing many challenges as they prepare for the establishment of a committee for national dialogue that will compose a new constitution and government that they hope will unite Syria's fractured society. Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, is well aware of the need to present a clean image to the West if he hopes to receive legitimacy for his rule. But while he exhibits himself as someone who seeks peace, his past in al-Qaida still overshadows many of his promises for the future. Many countries are still involved in events in Syria and the flow of leaders to Damascus continues. On Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived after representatives from Ukraine, the U.S., Turkey and Qatar, among others, visited the Syrian capital. Russia, which alongside Iran had propped up the Assad regime and was directly responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of Syrians, has also been trying to woo the new leadership even though it is hosting the deposed Syrian dictator in Moscow. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier this week that Syria is a 'sovereign nation' and has the right to end agreements signed with international partners, but added that there has been no request from the new leadership for Russia to remove its bases in Syria. He said the establishment of the Russian bases were agreed through international treaties and in accordance with international law but there was no doubt that the regime change in Damascus would require certain adjustments regarding Russia's military presence in Syria, which could be negotiated by the parties. Al-Sharaa said in an interview to Saudi media that Syria has strategic interests with Russia and that he hoped Moscow would not leave in a manner that was not compatible with the bilateral relations. But it does not appear that the new Syrian leader has doubts whether to align himself with the West or the Russians. Moscow is not a real option for him. Professor Eyal Zisser, an expert on Syria and Lebanon and the vice rector of Tel Aviv University, said he believes Al Sharaa will not lean on Russia but does not want a fight with the Russians. 'He wants to project himself as moderate,' Zisser said. 'He does not want confrontation and has enough troubles. Israel has deployed troops in Syria, Iran and Hezbollah are lurking in the corner. He wants to end things with Moscow on a positive note.' Zisser believes there is an open historic account for the Syrian opposition forces with Russia, which was quick to provide a sanctuary for Bashar Assad. 'The United States can more easily reach agreements with Al Sharaa than Russia, which is still weary of Islamist groups, can. The new regime needs money to rebuild and rehabilitate Syria. Assad relied heavily on revenue from the drug trade and a new source of income is now needed. 'He needs Qatar, the Gulf nations, the U.S. and the West,' Zisser says. 'He needs sanctions lifted so that there can be trade and investments as well as financial assistance.' Qatar, aware of those needs, began establishing its position in Syria soon after the Assad regime fell, by transferring funds and ensuring its involvement in any future process. Al Sharaa's rebranding as a moderate has been helpful to portray Islam as more than terrorism. As in its dealings in Gaza, Doha appears to be providing assistance, but has other interests as well and is using its close ties to Turkey to achieve them. Turkey, which has been fighting the Kurds in northern Syria for years, has two main interests. One is the return home of Syrian refugees that have sought shelter within its borders, and the other is the fight against the Kurds who under the auspices of the U.S. and Syrian opposition forces (SDF) have taken control of large areas in northern and eastern Syria. 'Our goal is to solve the crisis in the northeast,' Al Sharaa said in the interview. 'The Kurds are an inseparable part of the Syrian population and their forces will be incorporated in the Syrian defense forces.' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Ankara would not accept the Kurds from the PKK Party – identified as a terror group, and a majority of Kurdish fighters in SDF as legitimate representatives of Syria. This will challenge Al Sharaa to decide where his alliances lie. 'The new Syrian regime is heavily reliant on Turkey to rebuild the country after Assad,' said Dr. Galia Lindenstrauss, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). 'Al Sharaa would likely choose to establish his leadership before he takes on the Kurds in a fight. ' Turkey has financial problems of its own and cannot allot funds for the Syrians, but may rely on its alliance with Qatar, she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saudi Arabia is also working on its ties with the new regime. 'Riyadh wants stability in Syria and has a central role to play,' Al Sharaa said. 'I hope Iran reconsiders its involvement in the region. We are seeking balanced relations with everyone and Iran must align itself with the Syrian people.' Whether or not Al Sharaa has really changed is unclear even to the many diplomats who met with him. Officials in Israel are concerned that he may be fooling the West and insist Israel's hold on the Syrian part of Mt. Hermon and the buffer zone on the Golan Heights will continue until things become clear. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk08x8sljg	2025-01-03T03:30:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/S1IlMNrLyg/S1IlMNrLyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

How Israel’s biotech ecosystem is pioneering drug development	Noam Solomon: 'We have so many startups and IT companies succeeding, and we can tap into this, source amazing talent' Israel is not the global leader in biotechnology, but it is a major player in the field. According to two biotech entrepreneurs and experts, there are compelling reasons why people turn to the Jewish state for innovation. What sets Israel apart was a key theme of the 'Light of Innovation' panel at the Lights of Hope virtual event, presented this week by ILTV and Ynet News. One factor is Israel’s exceptional engineering talent, according to Noam Solomon, Co-founder and CEO of Immunai. 'We have technological units such as 8200 that create an amazing ecosystem. We have so many startups and IT companies succeeding, and we can tap into this, source amazing talent,' Solomon said. Another advantage, he explained, is Israel’s culture. Israelis have a strong mentality of 'getting things done.' The panel also featured Karin Noy, who leads the Emerging Science & Innovation in Israel portfolio for Pfizer. She highlighted Israel’s robust academic research and a well-integrated healthcare system. This system links medical providers and health insurance companies, creating a comprehensive and valuable patient data set. 'If you think about the drug development process, it's so complicated,' said Noy. 'We are starting from the discovery of new targets and then for those targets we need to validate them, we need to identify molecules and design them. And then on the translational side, to find how to match them to the right patients and then to take them to advanced clinical trials' until they are eventually commercialized. It’s a complex process, she emphasized, which is why Pfizer collaborates with small, innovative companies in Israel to address these challenges. Developing a drug today can take more than a decade and cost over $2 billion. Furthermore, 95% of investments fail. According to Solomon, the primary reason is that human immune systems respond differently to therapeutics than mice. Immunai addressed this issue by mapping and building an AI model of the immune system, allowing it to predict immune responses to therapeutics. AI, Solomon said, is unlocking insights that were previously unattainable in drug development and patient care. Using its model, Immunai has been able to determine the optimal dosage for drugs. 'Just knowing that a molecule could work is not enough; it's not a therapy. You need to decide what is the dose, what is the schedule [for taking it],' Solomon explained. 'With AI and our predictive modeling, we're able to optimize those.' For example, Immunai has used its model to find the best combination agent for oncology drugs. This includes determining which chemotherapy or anti-drug conjugate to pair with an immune agent. Pfizer is also involved in another groundbreaking AI initiative: AION Labs. AION Labs is an Israeli venture studio formed in partnership with AstraZeneca, Merck, Pfizer, Teva, the Israel Biotech Fund, Amiti Ventures, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Supported by BioMed X and the Israel Innovation Authority, its mission is to develop AI technologies that revolutionize drug discovery and improve global health. Since October 7 and the start of the regional war, eight companies have been launched through AION Labs. 'The majority are already in partnership with Pfizer, and we’re working on validating the technology,' Noy said. 'It's very impressive, especially in a small country like Israel… It's the only place where competitive companies like this could get together.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byg2aes8jl	2025-01-03T01:45:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/HJB5yBBUkl/HJB5yBBUkl_20_0_777_437_0_small.jpg

Israel's war in Iran's planetary mixers, producing solid rocket f...	Planetary mixers critical for Iran's missile production, averts the need for on-sight fueling of projectiles, enhances precision and range of missiles; IDF images of mixers in destroyed facility in Syria reveals them for the first time to the public The IDF's revelation of the Israeli commando raid on the Iranian missile production facility used by Hezbollah in Masyaf, located in Syria’s Hama province, was the first time an image a planetary mixer, a vital component used to blend solid rocket fuel components together, was exposed to the public. Solid rocket fuel enables missiles to be launched without the need for on-site fueling, a process requiring them to be removed from underground shelters and raised upright for nearly an hour—making them easily detectable by satellites and other intelligence tools. Solid fuel also significantly enhances a missile's range and precision. The planetary mixes precisely combine materials into a homogeneous compound for solid rocket fuel production. In the raid involving 100 commando special forces, the facility that was intended for the production of hundreds of precision missiles a year, was destroyed and with it, industrial mixers. Initially the forced did not plan to completely destroy the facility but only the planetary mixers without which solid fuel could not be produced. Israel has been on the hunt to destroy Iran's planetary mixers since 2019, when a drone attack was carried out on the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut where it was awaiting transportation to one of the missile production sites the terror group had built in the area. According to Lebanese reports, a year later, the IDF navy attacked a vessel that was delivering an alternative planetary mixer to replace the one that was destroyed. Planetary mixers, that were almost exclusively in the possession of superpowers – have become some of Israel's main targets in its war against the Shiite axis. After Israel's strike on Iran on October 26, at least a dozen of them were destroyed, pushing Iran's missile production back at least two years. Each planetary mixer costs in the area of $2 million. Currently there are one or two planetary mixers estimated to be in use by members of the Shiite axis and are in the possession of the Houthi rebels.

The department said Molloy returned to the U.S. in late 2024 and continued making attempts to join Hezbollah. He had also promoted hatred and violence against Jews, the Justice Department said, adding he was formerly enlisted as an active-duty soldier in the U.S. Army from mid-March to late April in 2019. The Justice Department said Molloy lied to the FBI about his intentions to join Hezbollah when questioned upon his return to the United States in late 2024. It said he was arrested on Dec. 6 in Chicago. If convicted, Molloy faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for a material support charge. For false statement charges, he faces a maximum penalty of eight years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or both. A representative of Molloy could not immediately be contacted.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhx4wr81e	2025-01-02T21:52:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/Hyl2g3EQJe/Hyl2g3EQJe_0_277_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The ground trembled': IDF unveils detail of heroic IDF commando ...	With heavy aerial cover and amid intense danger, 100 IDF commandos landed in Syria in order to dismantle an Iranian missile production facility that was on the verge of becoming operational The IDF’s daring commando operation to destroy a newly constructed underground missile production facility in Syria was revealed in full detail on Thursday. The IDF disclosed new and extensive information about the heroic operation carried out on the night of September 8. In a rare ground raid, Israeli Air Force (IAF) commandos from the Shaldag Unit targeted the massive facility built by Iran near the town of Masyaf, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Israel, deep inside Syria. 30 Syrian guards eliminated The facility was on the verge of full industrial production, capable of manufacturing 150 to 300 large, precision-guided missiles annually for Hezbollah, Bashar Assad’s regime and pro-Iranian forces in Syria. This development aimed to bypass the weapon smuggling routes from Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, which the IDF frequently targeted. Commandos discovered eight preliminary rocket engines already produced on-site but, as the facility had yet to begin full operations, its destruction at this stage was critical to prevent it from becoming a fortified and much harder target. On the night of the strike, approximately 30 Syrian soldiers guarded the facility. Most were eliminated in preliminary airstrikes by IAF fighter jets and helicopters seven minutes before the Shaldag commandos landed. Four more soldiers were neutralized at close range by the commandos on the ground. None of the IDF operatives were injured and the mission was deemed a resounding success. The mission was personally presented by Lt. Col. B., the Shaldag Unit’s commander, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. After approval from IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, the operation was launched. Lasting three hours under the cover of night, the takeover of the underground complex was executed in precisely 18 minutes from the moment the helicopters touched down in Syria. Dozens of additional Syrian soldiers were deployed to the site an hour later but were either attacked or fled after realizing the area was secured by a formidable force. Reinforcements included motorbike riders and troops in jeeps. Hundreds of additional Syrian soldiers arrived approximately an hour after the Israeli forces had withdrawn. That same night, the IAF carried out additional strikes on multiple targets across Syria including at nearby Syrian military industry sites. The IDF assessed that it took several days for the Syrian army and Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) to realize the magnitude of the attack on this strategic site, codenamed 'Deep Layer' by the IDF. Its construction began in 2017 as a safer alternative to similar above-ground industrial sites targeted by the IDF over the past decade. The fall of the Assad regime in the last month likely contributed to the IDF's decision to declassify and share the operation's details. IDF intelligence's critical realization The mission was meticulously planned over a year of war in which Shaldag commandos executed over 800 operations in Gaza and Lebanon, even during the war's first month, suffering the loss of 13 operatives and officers. Preparations and modeling were accelerated in the three months preceding September after senior military and political officials were convinced of the mission's importance, despite the risks involved — such as helicopters flying at dangerously low altitudes over Lebanon and Syria — sometimes as low as 60 feet — carrying over 100 Israeli soldiers. In recent years, the IDF Intelligence Directorate monitored Iran’s construction of the 'Deep Layer' facility. Last year, as attacks on Hezbollah intensified, the unit concluded that the facility would be central to restoring Hezbollah's firepower capabilities post-war. Left operational, it could have enabled Hezbollah to produce advanced precision missiles with ranges of 40 to 300 kilometers (25 to 186 miles), capable of accurately targeting central Israel in significant numbers. The intelligence team accurately predicted the facility's layout, which included 16 production rooms, laboratories, an assembly hall, offices and storage units. Constructed in a horseshoe shape, with raw materials entering from one side and completed missiles exiting the other, it maximized security and efficiency. Eight fuel mixers for rocket engines have already been installed in the production halls, but the plant has yet to be declared operational. Consequently, security was relatively low, with only dozens of guards stationed at various posts. At night, when the underground facility was empty, the entrances were locked. Only a simple rope marked the entrance at the compound's shabby gate, still under construction. This weapons factory was unique in Syria, as it was built underground, shielded by natural concrete and layers of 60 meters to 120 meters (197 feet to 394 feet) of rocky soil. Excavation work was completed in 2021 under the close supervision of Israeli military intelligence. The IAF waited weeks for favorable weather conditions to carry out the operation, as even a minute of low cloud cover could jeopardize the mission. The Masyaf area is one of the most heavily fortified in Syria after Damascus, protected by advanced Russian-made SA-22 air defense systems and other anti-aircraft measures, including shoulder-launched missiles. Helicopters nearly touched water The helicopters flew extremely low, along carefully chosen routes, with diversions and close escort by two Apache attack helicopters, allowing them to evade the Syrian radar systems deployed in the area to protect the site. 'The entire Air Force was on high alert that night, but it wasn't enough — intelligence personnel and the Navy provided operational support, fire cover and the most precise intelligence possible for every phase of the mission,' according to the IDF. The IAF skillfully coordinated the operation with the Russians, who are stationed at their major base in Syria and with their nearby S-400 missile batteries, ensuring there were no misunderstandings or early detection that could disrupt the mission. The helicopters carrying the troops flew very low over the Mediterranean Sea, almost skimming the water, and maintained this altitude over enemy territory en route to the target. 'We practiced numerous scenarios and responses, dealt with the topography and used the area's valleys to our advantage, despite the risks of flying through them,' the military described. 'We knew a full Syrian division might respond, so speed was essential. The most critical aspect was breaching the facility's locked doors quickly. The IDF Chief of Staff constantly stressed reducing the operation’s duration,' according to the IDF. The operation was directed on the ground by Lt. Col. B. and the highest-ranking officer to set foot in Syria that night —Col. G., commander of the IAF’s 7th Squadron. The Israeli Air Force allocated four control rooms to manage the operation and synchronize all its components. 'Scenarios like a drone failing to secure an infiltration route for a few minutes require immediate backup,' the IDF noted. 'Every extreme scenario was rehearsed in advance.'Shaldag operatives landed at two preplanned temporary landing zones, 700 meters and 1.5 kilometers (0.4 miles and 0.9 miles) from the target. Just minutes before their landing, they saw explosions resulting from fighter jet strikes that isolated the compound and eliminated dozens of its guards. Inside the facility, they found weapons-casting machinery, rocket fuel imported from Iran, Iranian avionics equipment and materials that reinforced assessments that the plant was on the verge of becoming operational. According to the IDF, a former officer who headed a Military Intelligence unit had advocated to take action against the facility for years. In the years leading up to the operation, the target became a high priority for decision makers. 'We avoided opening a front against Assad for strategic reasons for a long time,' the IDF said. 'But it was clear this was part of Iran's vision — encircling Israel with a ring of fire supported by advanced manufacturing capabilities in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.' Initially, the mission seemed impossible: flying into a missile-laden, heavily fortified area, landing troops and safely extracting them. 'The critical phase was the extraction,' the IDF noted. In preparation, daily intelligence reviews were conducted on the site and its surroundings for months before the operation. When the ground shook In the nearby town of Masyaf, residents remained unaware, assuming the events were routine Israeli airstrikes elsewhere, as the IDF had conducted during the war. Four attack helicopters deployed no fewer than 100 Shaldag soldiers on the ground, equipped with heavy gear, explosives and a utility ATV left behind to facilitate the force's extraction at the mission's end. Additionally, 20 operatives from 669th Unit were deployed near the target, accompanied by an intensive care team and a mobile field operating room. This ensured immediate treatment for severe injuries without the need to evacuate troops to Israel mid-operation. The rescue unit's medics were prepared to stabilize the wounded on-site, enabling the mission to continue without jeopardizing its success. Within 90 minutes of covert, low-altitude flight, 100 Shaldag soldiers, most of them reservists, landed at the two sites. The first group swiftly breached the compound, clearing the remaining Syrian soldiers and breaking through the armored doors to the underground facility, while the second group simultaneously deployed explosives inside the factory. The first team sprinted 700 meters from the landing zone to the locked gates leading into the underground compound. 'Fifty minutes after landing, the forces were already inside,' the IDF described. 'The troops used Syrian forklifts found inside to expedite the placement of explosives. This was pre-planned and practiced back in Israel, knowing those forklifts were there,' the statement added. IDF combat engineers had meticulously prepared a special demolition plan to ensure the site's complete destruction: a quarter-ton of Israeli explosives was strategically placed, augmented by roughly 700 tons of local rocket fuel that completed the task. As the demolition expert, S., activated the trigger, the troops took cover and say they could swear that 'the ground beneath them trembled at that moment.'

In total, 49 munitions were fired, with 70 aircraft in the air for over three hours, supported by thousands of officers and soldiers on the ground in Israel. Upon the mission’s completion, IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar said: 'Amid this justified war, this was a crucial event for the nation's security. As we return safely, we can take pride and tell future generations about the significant step we took for Israel's security.' 'The Shaldag Unit’s operation deep inside Syrian territory joins a series of courageous missions the IDF has conducted over the past few months in Gaza, the Dahieh in Beirut and Iran, with the goal of destroying the Iranian Axis’ missile manufacturing capabilities,' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said.

Israeli delegation to leave for Doha to continue hostage deal neg...	Israeli officials express careful optimism following Netanyahu's approval to send the team to Qatar; Arab media reports Hamas willing to complete 'one-phase' deal Israel is set to send a delegation to Doha, Qatar, on Friday to continue negotiations on a hostage deal with Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement Thursday evening that he approved dispatching 'a professional delegation from the Mossad, Shin Bet and the IDF to continue the negotiations.' Earlier, Israel's envoy for hostages and missing citizens Gal Hirsch told the hostages’ families in a meeting that reports of an alleged 'deadlock' in the talks were inaccurate and that negotiations were ongoing under strict confidentiality and extensive efforts. Hirsch, who left the room during the conversation to take an urgent call regarding the negotiations, stressed that the current agreement being worked on aims to bring all the hostages home, despite Israel's refusal to meet Hamas' demand to end the war in Gaza. Senior Israeli officials reported slow progress in the talks but clarified that 'there's no breakthrough yet and gaps still remain.' They noted that mediators are increasing pressure on both sides and are pushing for an Israeli delegation to attend talks in Doha or Cairo. However, Hamas continued to refuse to provide lists with the names of the living hostages. Earlier on Thursday, Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo on Wednesday, met with senior Egyptian intelligence official Major General Ahmed Abdel Khalek and discussed the negotiations for the hostages' release and 'the new conditions set by the Israeli government.' According to the report, these conditions allegedly include replacing the names of 12 elderly, ill civilian hostages with those of 12 soldiers. Israel consistently claimed that Arab media reports regarding the negotiations are distorted. The Qatari newspaper further reported that the Hamas delegation's meeting with Egyptian officials included discussions on deferring contentious points to a later stage after the first phase of the agreement. The proposal will reportedly be presented to the Israeli side in an attempt to reach a resolution before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20. Egyptian sources told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Hamas is open to a 'one-phase' agreement for all hostages on the condition that Israel withdraws from Gaza and ends the war within an agreed timeframe. According to these sources, Egyptian mediators aim to implement the first phase of the agreement, believing that 'the opening move' is the most challenging, after which remaining obstacles can be addressed and the war could conclude. The outlet also noted that a Hamas delegation traveled to Doha on Thursday to discuss recent developments in the negotiations. Hamas politburo deputy head Moussa Abu Marzouk told the newspaper that 'there’s a significant opportunity for the negotiations to succeed this time.' 'The delegation's visit aims to overcome obstacles and conditions recently set by the Israeli side to continue its aggression in Gaza,' Hamas spokesperson Jihad Taha added. 'Hamas approaches all matters positively and openly, prioritizing the needs of the Palestinian people and will spare no effort to halt the aggression in the Strip. We hope for an agreement but Israel refuses to compromise on its recently imposed conditions.' The remaining gaps in the negotiations mainly concern the number of hostages to be released. Hamas is willing to release a double-digit number of live hostages, while Israel is pushing to increase the figure. The terror organization is receptive to closing the gap by returning hostages already declared dead in the first phase. Sources familiar with the details estimated that if a deal is reached, fallen Israeli soldiers and murdered civilians also will be returned early in the process. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Territorial disagreements concerning the IDF's positioning along the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors also were discussed. Hamas demanded a more significant Israeli withdrawal in the initial phase, while Israel is only willing to consider withdrawal in subsequent negotiation stages.

Despite cease-fire, IDF destroys Hezbollah rocket launchers in so...	IDF said the attack on the medium-range rocket launchers was carried out by the Israeli Air Force under the direction of the Intelligence Directorate only after the Lebanese Army did not respond to a request to neutralize the weapons Israeli Air Force fighter jets destroyed Hezbollah medium-range rocket launchers in Lebanese territory Thursday evening, with the direction of the Intelligence Directorate. Arab media outlets reported three attacks in the Jbaa area and Jabal ar-Rihan in southern Lebanon. Watch the footage: There have been reports coming out of Lebanon in recent days of IDF attacks that are being carried out intermittently in the south of the country, but the footage from Thursday evening seems unusual compared to those attacks in recent weeks. An IDF spokesman said in a statement that 'The Israeli Air Force, with the direction of the Intelligence Directorate, struck Hezbollah medium-range rocket launchers at a military site belonging to the terrorist organization. Hezbollah rocket launchers adjacent to an additional military site in the area of Nabatieh were also struck..' The IDF Spokesperson's Office also stated: 'As part of the enforcement of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, prior to the strike a request was sent to the Lebanese Armed Forces to neutralize the launchers that posed a threat to Israeli civilians and IDF troops. The launchers were struck only after the request was not addressed by the Lebanese Armed Forces. The IDF continues to act to remove any threat to the State of Israel in accordance with the ceasefire understandings.' Even after the cease-fire began in late November, the IDF continued its ground operations to remove terrorist infrastructure from villages in southern Lebanon. On Saturday, the IDF announced that the 300th Brigade Combat Team, under the command of the 146th Division, together with engineering forces, destroyed a 100-meter-long underground tunnel leading to a Radwan force position. 'With the assistance of the Yahalom Unit, who investigated and cleared the tunnel route of explosives and threats, the troops located rifles, machine guns, anti-tank missiles, and observation systems inside the tunnel. All the equipment was confiscated and destroyed, as well as the underground tunnel route itself. An anti-tank missile stockpile and heavy machine gun positions aimed at IDF posts were also found in the vicinity of the tunnel,' according to the IDF.

The launchers were struck only after the request was not addressed by the Lebanese Armed Forces.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1h11kl4uje	2025-01-02T09:23:26-08:00

Hezbollah launches 'reconstruction campaign' with Iranian backing	Terror group announces start of official efforts to fix war damages of in southern Lebanon while thanking Tehran for its extensive funding of the project; Iraq and Yemen also provided support; Among the benefits: $400 for each displaced family, $8,000 for furniture, and an annual allowance for rent On December 5, Hezbollah's Secretary-General Naim Qassem delivered a relatively brief televised speech lasting about half an hour that was meant to give hope to the average Lebanese citizen suffering from the lastest war with Israel. Behind him, on a blue backdrop, was a portrait of the terror group’s former leader Hassan Nasrallah, accompanied by the slogan 'Promise and Commitment - The Reconstruction Campaign,' a campaign aimed at assisting Lebanese residents whose homes were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. During the speech, which followed the implementation of the cease-fire on the Lebanon border, Qassem expressed gratitude to those who hosted displaced Lebanese individuals during the conflict and to various parties that supported the government and citizens. 'We thank Iran, under [Ali] Khamenei's leadership, its government, its people and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for providing this generous aid,' he said. He announced Hezbollah's decision to grant displaced families financial aid ranging between $300 and $400 and elaborated on the reconstruction campaign. 'If a home was completely destroyed and served as the primary residence, the owner will receive $8,000 for furnishing a new home and $6,000 for one year's rent if they reside in Beirut or the Dahieh district. Outside Beirut, the rental aid amounts to $4,000 annually.' Qassem thanked Tehran, 'as most of this funding was provided by them,' as well as support from Iraq and Yemen. He called on 'Arab brothers and friendly countries to assist in the reconstruction.' According to a Lebanese report, however, only Iran appeared to have answered his call. Lebanese outlet Al-Diyar reported on Wednesday that Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati informed the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea that Iran was the only country offering reconstruction aid. According to the report, he advised the ambassador not to obstruct the process, asserting that the funds would reach Hezbollah via other channels if they weren't processed by the state. Shea reportedly promised to present the matter to American officials. In recent months, numerous reports have surfaced about aid shipments arriving in Lebanon from various countries, though these don’t appear to involve reconstruction efforts. It seems that Iran, despite its own need for donations, is the primary donor to the reconstruction efforts which Hezbollah officials claim are progressing. Diplomats commented on the reconstruction issue, telling Lebanon's Al-Jadeed outlet that Arab countries including Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in aiding reconstruction efforts but won’t transfer funds without oversight or control. Hezbollah's Deputy Executive Council Chair Ali Daamoush addressed the stages of the reconstruction campaign this week, saying: 'The secretary-general established a committee tasked with supervising the reconstruction.' 'Technical teams are conducting surveys in affected areas, prioritizing families whose homes were completely or partially destroyed and allowing them to return as quickly as possible,' he added. 'To our people along the border, we say: We will rebuild the villages. Aid will promptly reach everyone in need.' 'I assure the people that the funds for the reconstruction are secured,' he promised. 'Misleading campaigns will not shake public trust in the resistance — the funding is guaranteed by the Iranian people, who extended a helping hand to the Lebanese people. Thanks to Khamenei for his love and affection for Lebanon. Thanks to Iran, its citizens and its leadership, as well as to Iraq's leadership and people and to all nations willing to assist in reconstruction.' 'The project has begun and we will complete it. We’ll return to our homes with our heads held high. We’re demonstrating the victory of reconstruction over destruction and the triumph of resistance over aggression. Those who doubted Hezbollah's ability to compensate the victims were mistaken,' he concluded. Hezbollah's Deputy Political Council Chair Mahmoud Komati also addressed the reconstruction campaign this week, stressing the terror organization's dedication to it. 'There are red lines we won’t allow to be crossed, including the resistance's weapons, finances, reconstruction and shelter,' he said. 'We don't want the help of anyone offering aid to Lebanon with conditions that affect the resistance. The residents of southern Lebanon will return to their homes and no one will stop them. We pledged patience for 60 days. The 61st day will be different,' he warned. 'The situation will change, existing forces will be treated as occupiers and we will address them accordingly.' Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese outlet Al-Manar has been covering the reconstruction campaign extensively, documenting the distribution of funds and providing updates on its progress. Over the weekend, the channel's website reported that Hezbollah's real estate organization, Jihad al-Binaa ('Jihad of Construction'), identified 185,000 damaged housing units. 'The Jihad al-Binaa Development Fund, in line with Hezbollah and Nasrallah's promise, continued its efforts to identify structures damaged by Israeli aggression through its teams, swiftly working to restore residents to their homes,' the report read. An accompanying graphic shared on the channel's X account detailed the affected buildings' locations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even before Naim Qassem's speech earlier this month, the UK-based Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat reported on Iranian support for reconstruction. The report mentioned the reopening of Hezbollah's bank, Al-Qard al-Hassan, while a Hezbollah source clarified that reconstruction and housing subsidies would not come from the bank's funds, but from Iranian money recently delivered to Hezbollah. According to the source, Iran transferred $1 billion to Hezbollah via a regional state on the first day of the cease-fire with Israel, which then began assessing damages in preparation for compensation payments. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sku7aqeuye	2025-01-02T08:13:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/BJfMFXE8ye/BJfMFXE8ye_0_0_649_366_0_small.jpg

Finland power grid operator asks court to seize tanker over cable...	Finland's national power grid operator said on Thursday it had asked a Helsinki court to seize the Eagle S oil tanker in a bid to secure the company's claim for damages related to the breakdown of the undersea Estlink 2 electricity interconnector. The cable between Finland and Estonia was damaged on Dec. 25 along with four telecoms lines, and Finnish authorities the next day boarded the tanker, which carries Russian oil, on suspicion that it caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. NATO said last week it would boost its presence in the region. Fingrid said in a statement on Thursday it had asked the Helsinki District Court to formally seize the Eagle S to help secure its financial claim. Finland's customs service has said it believes the Eagle S is part of a shadow fleet of tankers used to circumvent sanctions on Russian oil, and has formally impounded its cargo although the cargo is still on board the ship.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjnlhr4lke	2025-01-02T07:57:54-08:00	
Italy summons Iranian ambassador, demands release of journalist	Italy's foreign ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador on Thursday to demand the immediate release of reporter Cecilia Sala, who was seized in Tehran on Dec. 19 while working under a regular journalistic visa. The ministry said in a statement it had relayed 'serious concern' over Sala's detention and stressed the need for humane treatment and respect for her human rights. The Iranian embassy in Rome later said Sala was being given all the humanitarian care necessary and, for the first time, linked her case to that of an Iranian national, who was arrested last month in Milan at the request of the United States. Italian media have reported that Sala is in solitary confinement in a freezing cold cell with a neon light left on night and day. Her glasses have been confiscated and she has had hardly any contact with the outside world.

Netanyahu released from hospital, but corruption trial testimony ...	Four days after successful prostate surgery, the prime minister was released from Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital; Doctors recommend two-week rest, which may lead to changes in the testimony schedule in the corruption trial against him; 'He still has a recovery period ahead of him' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was released from Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital late Thursday afternoon after undergoing successful prostate surgery on Sunday, and has remained hospitalized since then - although he left the hospital on Wednesday to cast a vote in the Knesset. The hospital said in a statement that 'the prime minister's doctors reported upon his discharge that his condition is stable and he is recovering satisfactorily from the surgery. He still has a recovery period ahead of him. Medical monitoring as necessary after such surgery will continue as usual. Upon his release, the prime minister expressed his 'deep gratitude to the Hadassah specialists and the entire team, to specialists from Assaf Harofeh hospital, and his personal physician, Dr. Zvika Berkowitz, who cared for him with dedication.' Doctors have recommended that Netanyahu spend two weeks recovering and resting at home following the surgery. Therefore, those close to Netanyahu estimate that his defense attorney, Amit Haddad, will file a request with the court to cancel all or part of next week's hearings. Netanyahu and Haddad have not yet made a final decision on the matter. On Tuesday, when the prime minister realized that the coalition did not have a majority to pass the trapped profits law, which is critical to approving the budget, Netanyahu decided to leave the hospital while he was recovering from surgery and vote in favor. In the end, the law was approved by a narrow margin, with, among others, Itamar Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit faction voting against and members of Agudath Israel not participating. The doctors at Hadassah strongly opposed Netanyahu leaving the hospital for the vote, and a doctor at Hadassah told Ynet: 'It's not healthy for him.' His personal physician was present at the plenary session.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1d4mnelje	2025-01-02T06:52:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/B1mq11ObLJl/B1mq11ObLJl_0_75_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Musk planning to host German far-right leader for online chat	Elon Musk looks likely to host the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party ahead of Germany's Feb. 23 national election in a live interview on X, his social media platform. In December, the Tesla mogul endorsed the AfD, an anti-immigration, anti-Islamic party labelled as right-wing-extremist by German security services, causing consternation in Berlin, where all other parties have ruled out working with a party they regard as dangerous and undemocratic. A spokesperson for the AfD said on Thursday that party leader Alice Weidel was in touch with Musk's office, but said he could give no further details at present.

How are these Israeli organizations helping drive change for olim...	Eilon Gilad: Making Aliyah is 'essential' for securing Israel's future Making aliyah is a life-changing decision, but according to Eilon Gilad, CEO of Belong, it’s also essential for securing Israel’s future. To support new olim, Belong works to remove as many obstacles as possible and ensure they feel embraced. 'We're here to support them with any aspect of their life, whether it's housing, employment, or learning Hebrew,' Gilad told ILTV during its Lights of Hope event. Gilad explained that his organization helps bridge the gap between a new immigrant’s culture and Israeli culture. For example, if someone is looking for housing, Belong will connect them with an Anglo-centric agent to assist. If they’re searching for a job, Belong helps them identify their strengths, refine how they present themselves, and showcase the value they bring as new immigrants. These are just a few of the ways Belong supports olim. Gilad participated in a panel at the event called 'The Light of Community,' which highlighted organizations helping individuals navigate significant life changes. Another organization featured was Nechama and Hatzala, which focuses on supporting Israeli soldiers. For over 15 months, Israel has been at war, and soldiers are struggling in numerous ways. Nechama and Hatzala has stepped up to meet their needs. Nechama and Hatzala is dedicated to making a meaningful impact by providing essential resources and emotional support to those on the frontlines. Through their initiatives, they help soldiers face challenges while building connections that strengthen the broader community. Shmulik Moskowitz, board member and co-founder of Nechama and Hatzala, shared how his organization 'brought as much IDF gear as we could' to the country immediately after October 7 to help save lives. Since then, their mission has expanded to include small but meaningful gestures, like delivering ice cream or soup to soldiers on the frontlines. A warm bowl of soup on a cold day can 'warm the hearts' of IDF soldiers, Moskowitz said. 'It is also a symbol of our support.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjijjxn8yx	2025-01-02T05:19:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/HJe8gQNLJl/HJe8gQNLJl_218_0_658_371_0_small.jpg

What Is judo star Peter Paltchik’s real dream?	Peter Paltchik: 'I have a dream that Olympic athletes will not struggle any more' Israeli Olympic medalist Peter Paltchik has one clear dream: that Olympic athletes no longer have to struggle financially. Judo star Paltchik immigrated to Israel with his mother as a baby. At just 23 years old, his mother worked tirelessly to make ends meet, eventually traveling to the U.S. to earn a living. During her absence, Paltchik was raised by his grandparents. It was his grandfather who introduced him to judo. However, Paltchik recalls the early days of his career being incredibly challenging due to the financial strain of pursuing sports full-time. 'It does not matter if you come from a rich family or from a poor family,' Paltchik said. 'At the end of the day, the individual Olympic athlete is poor because he needs to finance himself, he needs to support himself financially. It's flights to training camps, even to some championships, and it's full time – food, psychologists, everything in the first year is the toughest.' To address these challenges, Paltchik recently launched a foundation aimed at supporting athletes across multiple Olympic sports. He described the initiative as the 'light of my life,' adding that he feels like he is 'all of a sudden, able to give back.' The foundation raises funds to provide sports scholarships, helping young athletes achieve their dreams without the financial burdens he faced. 'I have a dream that Olympic athletes will not struggle any more,' Paltchik said. Paltchik was interviewed by ILTV as part of its Lights of Hope event.

What role does higher education have in driving the AI revolution...	Prof. Ami Moyal: Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize teaching and learning in higher education, according to Prof. Ami Moyal of Afeka Academic College of Engineering in Tel Aviv. Moyal highlighted four key roles that higher education institutions can play in this transformation: 1. Training Engineers, Computer Scientists, and Data Scientists Universities must provide education at all levels—bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees—while focusing on research and technology transfer to the industry to develop advanced products. 2. Training Skilled STEM Teachers Higher education must prepare educators who can implement the necessary changes in the classical education system. 3. Providing Lifelong Learning Opportunities 'When engineers enter the industry, they need updates with regards to their skills or areas of knowledge,' Moyal said. 'Academia can play a major role here.' 4. Strengthening Connections with the Education System This includes collaborative courses and partnerships between high school teachers and college professors. Speaking at the Lights of Hope event alongside David Perlmutter, Chairman of the Israeli High-Tech Human Capital Committee, Moyal emphasized the importance of the high-tech sector as Israel’s primary economic growth engine. He stressed that its role in post-war recovery will be critical, ensuring Israel has the human capital needed to sustain growth. This preparation, he said, begins with education—specifically the national STEM education continuum, which feeds the technology workforce both in quality and quantity.

High Court curtails Ben-Gvir’s police oversight powers	Justices uphold law expanding national security minister’s authority over police but issue restrictive interpretation, effectively hollowing it out; 'Once again, the court positions itself as the sovereign, trampling on the will of the voter,' Ben-Gvir protests The High Court of Justice unanimously upheld on Thursday a law that expands National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s authority over police operations but struck down, in a narrow 5-4 decision, a key provision allowing him to delineate general policy on police investigations, ruling it unconstitutional. The majority of justices ruled the clause posed a significant risk to suspects’ rights and failed to meet the legal standards for restricting fundamental rights. A minority dissented, arguing the clause did not violate constitutional principles. The broader legislation, which places police under the government’s authority and requires the police commissioner to follow the minister’s policy guidelines, was upheld. However, the court imposed strict limits, clarifying that the law permits only general policy directives and prohibits any operational interference by the minister. The court emphasized that its interpretation ensures no shift in the balance of power between the government and the police, effectively maintaining the status quo before the law’s enactment. Critics have argued that the law, a cornerstone of the coalition agreements forming the current government, undermines police autonomy and risks politicization. The court’s decision represents a compromise, preserving most of the law while addressing concerns over excessive government control in police investigations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ben-Gvir sharply criticized the ruling, accusing the court of overstepping its authority. 'Once again, the court positions itself as the sovereign, trampling on the will of the voter. This grave decision to neuter the Police Ordinance is designed to strip the minister of his authority and give control of the police to the attorney general and state prosecutor. In a democratic state, the minister in charge sets policy for the police, but the court obviously doesn’t care about that,' he said. Justice Minister Yariv Levin also condemned the ruling, describing it as undemocratic. 'In what other country can judges, who appoint themselves, strike down a law passed by parliament in three readings by a single-vote margin? Only in Israel is democracy being replaced by the rule of a handful of judges,' he said, calling for urgent judicial reforms. The law has faced legal challenges since its passage. A coalition of organizations and Knesset members petitioned the court in January 2023. The petitioners, backed by Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, warned that the law effectively turned Ben-Gvir into a 'super commissioner,' allowing undue political interference in police decision-making. They warned that a politically controlled police force is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. In June 2023, the court issued a conditional order requiring the government to justify the amendments. Baharav-Miara said in January 2024 that Ben-Gvir had overstepped his authority, including directing police actions during public protests. The court later issued an interim injunction barring him from giving operational directives to the police, particularly regarding protest management. Despite these rulings, petitioners alleged that Ben-Gvir continued to interfere in police operations, including efforts to suppress anti-war protests. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkspt1e8kx	2025-01-02T02:24:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/04/03/BkEc00jBdWn/BkEc00jBdWn_312_203_1009_569_0_small.jpg

IDF releases official casualty numbers from war: 891 fatalities, ...	Military reports most fatalities in single conflict since Yom Kippur War and expresses concerns with upward trend in suicides, recruiting hundreds of mental health professionals to address crisis The IDF announced Thursday that 891 soldiers have been killed since the Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, marking one of the deadliest conflicts in Israel’s history. The toll includes deaths from combat, accidents and suspected suicides and is the largest since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Of the 891 fatalities, 528 occurred in 2023, with 512 attributed to operational activity. Most deaths happened around October 7, when 329 soldiers were killed, including local rapid-response teams. Another 226 deaths were recorded in 2024. Suicide cases have also surged, with 17 suspected cases in 2023—seven conscripts, four career soldiers and six reservists—compared to 14 in 2022. In 2024, suicides increased to 21 cases, including seven conscripts, two career soldiers and 12 reservists, all men. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Accidental deaths also rose during the war. Nine soldiers died in traffic accidents in 2023, including five on duty and four in civilian incidents. By 2024, 20 more soldiers were killed in traffic accidents, 17 in civilian settings. Operational accidents claimed 65 lives, 60 in Gaza and five in Lebanon, involving incidents such as friendly fire and weapon mishandling. To address the mental health crisis, the IDF has recruited 800 mental health officers, established a new mental health center with clinics nationwide, and expanded psychological support for soldiers, especially combat units. However, challenges remain, particularly in assessing the mental and physical readiness of older reservists, many aged 40-60, returning after years away from service. 'The strain of war has created unprecedented burdens on soldiers, levels we haven’t seen in decades,' an IDF official said, adding that the military expects a long-term rise in mental health challenges as the war ends and combatants transition back to civilian life. The war's toll far surpasses the decade before it, which saw 152 fatalities, including those during the 2014 Gaza war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk6zi1e8ke	2025-01-02T01:24:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/16/B1ELBq00Xm0/B1ELBq00Xm0_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg
As world focus shifts to Gaza, what is happening in Ukraine?	Ukraine’s chief rabbi describes Jewish resilience amid Russian attacks, with many displaced or making Aliyah to Israel; community continues to aid those remaining, providing food, medicine and Hanukkah events for children, elderly and soldiers With global attention focused on the war in Gaza, Ukraine continues to endure relentless Russian attacks, including missile strikes and drone assaults targeting critical infrastructure. 'Just a few minutes ago, Just now a few minutes ago there were a few explosions in Kyiv—ballistic rockets and other missiles,' Ukraine's Chief Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman told Ynet in an interview. He described how daily strikes by Iranian drones have further exacerbated issues with electricity and heating, creating dire conditions as winter sets in. Despite the war, Ukraine’s Jewish community marked Hanukkah with events for children, the elderly and wounded soldiers. 'We continue our obligation to bring light to the people during the war and bring help—humanitarian, spiritual and other kinds to the people in depression and darkness,' Azman said. According to Azman, many members of the Jewish community remain displaced, with some having made Aliyah to Israel, others relocating to Europe, and a few returning to Ukraine, often at great personal risk.

Iran rejects claims of supporting Houthis as Israeli propaganda	Iranian UN ambassador denies accusations of Iranian involvement in Yemen and accuses Israel, US and UK of destabilizing region; he criticizes alleged support for attacks on Yemen and calls for accountability, urging UN to resist 'Israeli propaganda' Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the president of the Security Council this week, rejecting accusations of Iranian involvement in Yemen and accusing Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom of destabilizing the region. 'The unsubstantiated allegations made by the representative of the Israeli regime and supported by its closest ally, the United States, are an obvious attempt to scapegoat Iran to justify their own illegal actions and malicious activities in the region,' Iravani wrote ahead of a Security Council hearing on Yemen's Houthi rebels' recurring attacks on Israel. 'It is not Iran but the belligerent regime of Israel that has relentlessly pursued a policy of provocation and destabilizing activities, which poses a grave threat to peace and security in the region and beyond.' Iravani denied any violation of arms embargoes or involvement in fueling Yemen’s civil war, saying that Iran has 'always adhered to its obligations under international law and the United Nations Charter.' The ambassador accused Israel of targeting Yemen’s sovereignty and infrastructure, including Sanaa airport and the Hodeidah port, which are critical for humanitarian aid delivery. 'These illegal actions, carried out with the direct backing and complicity of the United States and the United Kingdom, constitute egregious violations of the UN Charter and international law, including international humanitarian law,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He further criticized the U.S. and UK for providing 'political cover and military support for Israel’s reckless actions,' adding that such complicity 'has emboldened Israel to act with impunity, fueling regional conflicts and undermining any prospects for lasting peace in Yemen under UN leadership.' Iravani reiterated Iran’s longstanding support for a political resolution to the Yemen conflict, calling for a comprehensive ceasefire, inclusive dialogue, and respect for Yemen’s sovereignty. He also rejected claims of Iranian interference in the Red Sea, calling them 'baseless fabrications designed to inflame tensions and serve as a pretext for further destabilization of the region by the United States and its allies.' The ambassador urged the Security Council not to be influenced by 'Israel’s propaganda,' which he said aims to distract from 'ongoing atrocities and ethnic cleansing' in Gaza. He accused Israel of illegal occupation, aggression and territorial expansion, including 'its recent occupation of over 500 square kilometers of Syrian territory and ongoing illegal occupation of the Syrian Golan.' Iravani concluded by calling on the Security Council to 'act decisively to hold the occupying regime of Israel and its enablers accountable for these grave violations of international law,' warning that failure to do so would undermine trust in the UN’s ability to maintain peace and security. Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said in response 'I’m not surprised the Iranian representative is under pressure after we exposed Iran’s terror machine operating in Yemen. Iran is the last regime that can preach morality—it funds, arms and operates terrorist organizations that ignite the Middle East. We will not be deterred by threats or remain silent in the face of Iranian incitement and lies. While Iran creates chaos and operates terror puppets, we will continue to protect our citizens and confront every threat with determination and strength.' The Houthis consider themselves an integral part of Iran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' alongside Hamas and Hezbollah. Their ideology is encapsulated in the slogan on their flag: 'Allah is the Greatest, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews and Victory to Islam.' In recent years, Iran has significantly increased its support for the Houthi rebels. While the Houthis previously had a modest arsenal, they now possess cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and long-range drones. Estimates suggest the group has around 20,000 fighters. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcyspm8je	2025-01-01T23:28:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/By5CFXhSye/By5CFXhSye_0_73_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Dr. Einat Wilf's three takeaways from 2024	Wilf says Israel is fighting for the idea of Jewish sovereignty, for 'the ability to be masters of our own fate' Israel has just concluded one of the most turbulent years in its history. In 2024, the nation fought a multi-front conflict, facing Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iran, and more. But what lessons can Israel take from this challenging year? Dr. Einat Wilf, a former Knesset member and renowned author, shared her insights with ILTV this week, identifying three key lessons from 2024: 1. Israelis Are Willing to Fight for Their Country 'The first takeaway is that the Israelis are willing to fight, to sacrifice for the State of Israel,' Wilf said. She explained that former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar likely underestimated Israelis’ resolve, believing their dissatisfaction with the government would prevent them from fighting back. Instead, Wilf emphasized, Israelis are not fighting for a specific government or leader but for the principle of Jewish sovereignty. 'They're fighting for the idea of Jewish sovereignty, for the ability to be masters of our own fate. They're not fighting for a particular government or person, and that's why people are willing to fight,' Wilf said. 'To the extent that anyone thought that Israel is a divided society that will not be willing to sacrifice, I think that is clearly gone.' 2. Israel’s Enemies Are Devoted to Its Destruction Wilf stressed that Israel’s enemies remain committed to its destruction. 'We are facing enemies, whether it is the Palestinians in Gaza, but more generally, Hezbollah, who...they don't want a negotiable thing. They're not looking for statehood. They're not looking to achieve something that we can discuss. They want us not to be here, certainly not as a sovereign people,' Wilf said. 3. Israel Has Fallen Short of Its Grand Goals Wilf’s final takeaway is that Israel has failed to achieve its broader objectives for the war. She argued that Israel made a strategic error by framing the war as solely against Hamas, rather than addressing the underlying Palestinian ideology that rejects Jewish self-determination. 'We needed to make clear that the war needs to bring an end to Palestinianism,' Wilf concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkmxuoqu1g	2025-01-01T20:44:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/SJOKwo7LJx/SJOKwo7LJx_38_0_668_376_0_small.jpg

Palestinian sources reported early Thursday that an Israeli strike in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis, designated as a humanitarian zone, killed two individuals, including Mahmoud Salah, Hamas' police commander in the Gaza Strip. According to the reports, another high-ranking Hamas figure, Hussam Shahwan, whose rank is equivalent to brigadier general, was also killed in the attack. In addition, Gaza health officials reported that 11 people were killed in a separate strike on what they described as a 'displaced persons camp.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjdozjquyg	2025-01-01T20:19:10-08:00	
Who is 'Hamas doctor' Hussam Abu Safiya?	Kamal Adwan Hospital is classified as a military hospital under Hamas's Military Medical Services Directorate Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, along with leaders from Amnesty International and other organizations, has called for the release of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya. Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in Gaza, was arrested over the weekend during an IDF raid on the facility. Advocates claim that Abu Safiya is an innocent doctor, vital to providing medical care in the Gaza Strip. But is he? What do we know about his arrest and the allegations against him? Open-source evidence confirms that Abu Safiya holds the rank of colonel in Hamas. According to a statement released by the IDF on Saturday, he was arrested on suspicion of terrorism. The IDF also asserts that Kamal Adwan Hospital was being used as a command and control center by Hamas. What do we know about Kamal Adwan Hospital? During the raid, the IDF arrested 240 individuals, 15 of whom have been confirmed as participants in the October 7 Hamas massacre in Israel. The IDF emphasized that civilians were evacuated from the hospital before the operation began, countering claims that Israel deliberately targeted non-combatants. Additional evidence of Hamas activity at the hospital comes from a Kurdish doctor who volunteered there in the spring. After leaving Gaza, the doctor released a video describing his interactions with Hamas operatives actively operating within the hospital. In December 2023, Israel arrested and interrogated the previous director of Kamal Adwan Hospital. During his interrogation, he admitted that the facility was used by Hamas for storing weapons and housing personnel involved in actions against Israel. Kamal Adwan Hospital is classified as a military hospital under Hamas's Military Medical Services Directorate, distinct from the Hamas-run Health Ministry. This classification was confirmed in a December 2023 CNN report and supported by photographs shared on social media. One photo from 2016 shows the opening of the hospital complex, describing it as 'equipped to serve military personnel in the Ministry of Interior and National Security.' Is Kamal Adwan Hospital Irreplaceable? Contrary to claims that the loss of this facility severely impacts Gaza's healthcare system, COGAT reports that 13 field hospitals and approximately 10 local hospitals continue to operate in the region, providing essential services to the population.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkcngjqljl	2025-01-01T20:16:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/ryJOMVJ8kg/ryJOMVJ8kg_1_614_1024_577_0_small.jpg
After a year of war, what does 2025 hold for Israel?	With a new US administration and changing dynamics across the Middle East, security experts see 2025 as a year of challenges and opportunities alike for Israel As Israel prepares to ring in 2025 after 15 months of war and with 100 hostages still held in Gaza, many Israelis are unsure what the new year will hold. The Media Line asked three security experts about their predictions for Israel in 2025. Researcher Kobi Michael best summarized the consensus: '2025 will not be a less challenging and turbulent year than 2024, but it will be less bloody.' Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies and the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy in Tel Aviv, noted that Israel is entering the new year 'in a much better situation' than the previous year. Similarly, Israeli author, thought leader, and former Member of Knesset Einat Wilf told The Media Line that Israel’s enemies are in a worse position than they were one year ago. 'We have been able to recover at least part of our mojo, and people are coming back to see us as the capable, winning nation we are,' she said. 'And we have an incoming U.S. Congress and president that seem very favorable to Israel.' The perception of Israel as a respected regional power that has successfully weakened Iran could be crucial to Israel’s survival and growth in 2025. After the attacks of October 7, 2023, Israel’s regional partners began to perceive Israel as vulnerable. Allied countries in the region, particularly the Abraham Accords countries, had not anticipated Israel being caught off guard by Hamas, suffering such heavy losses, or appearing unprepared to respond. Israel had built a reputation as the region’s leader in countering the threat posed by Iran, and the attacks raised doubts about the value of normalizing ties with Israel. But despite significant challenges and mistakes, Israel’s military strategy ultimately proved effective, Michael said. Israel has had successful military achievements in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria, and mainly with Iran, a country that has now been stripped of many of its capabilities and assets. It is now exposed and in a very embarrassing position. Brig. Gen. (res.) Amir Avivi, founder and chair of the Israel Defense and Security Forum, told The Media Line that Israelis and Jews worldwide perceive Israel as moving toward a decisive victory. Avivi said that the pessimism and anxiety of the war’s earlier days had lifted. 'I see a completely different vibe,' he said. 'People feel we are winning.' He added that with President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, many Israelis feel they will once again have a strong partner in the U.S. A change of administration in the U.S. gives me even more hope. I believe there will be a much more resolute administration that shows leadership, provides moral clarity about who the good and bad guys are, and understands the need for decisive victories on all fronts to pave the way for big visions, like regional and global peace agreements. The majority of Israelis apparently share Avivi’s sentiment. A February poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that nearly two-thirds of respondents believe Trump is better for Israel’s interests than Harris would have been. Last New Year’s, Israel was fewer than three months removed from the attacks of October 7, in which Hamas fighters killed nearly 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in the bloodiest massacre to strike the Jewish people since the Holocaust. By December 2023, 117 hostages had been returned alive to Israel, including 105 in a prisoner exchange deal. At the end of the exchange, more than 130 hostages remained in Gaza. This year holds glimmers of hope that some of the hostages still held by Hamas might return home, although negotiations for a deal between Israel and Hamas appear to be faltering. This week, Israel engaged in a bloody battle against Hamas in the Gazan cities of Beit Lahia and Jabalia, two areas in which it has fought repeatedly in the past. International actors widely condemned this week’s fighting. Israel claims to have destroyed 80% of Hamas’ military infrastructure, but the Israeli military has said it controls only about a third of the Gaza Strip. As such, Hamas still appears to maintain a stronghold in some capacity, even after Israel assassinated several of its key leaders. Avivi said that in 2025, Israel needs to destroy Hamas as a governing and military entity, bring back the hostages, and make sure that a terrorist force is never again able to gain power in Gaza. 'This is achievable in 2025 and will bring a completely new reality into the Gaza Strip,' he said. According to Michael, though, there is 'no real or reasonable probability' for any reconstruction process in Gaza for the next several years. Instead, he warned, Israel may find itself stuck trying to manage the situation—either as an occupying power with temporary military control over the coastal enclave or as an army that withdraws completely, leaving Hamas to reconstitute itself. Michael added that supportive entities such as the U.S., Abraham Accords countries, or European nations are unlikely to enter Gaza until Hamas is eradicated. This challenge will, therefore, rest solely on Israel’s shoulders. Outside of Gaza, Israel faces various military challenges and opportunities in 2025. All three experts who spoke to The Media Line expressed hope for the collapse of the extremist Shiite axis, starting with its leader, Iran. If we are able to act together with the United States and a coalition and deal decisively with Iran’s nuclear sites and military capabilities, this can be a huge change and take out the biggest threat Israel has. Trump has already hinted that he would support an Israeli attack on Iran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program. Michael suggested that Trump may even expect such an action before his inauguration on January 20. 'He wants to fight Iran, which is much more vulnerable, and negotiate on his terms to bring Iran to an agreement,' Michael said. He said that such an agreement would be 'much better' than the 2015 Iran deal. Wilf noted that the Iranian people might overthrow their regime, much like the people of Syria did earlier this month. A lot depends on how we handle them. They will be a test for us as to whether we again slide into a kind of comfortable closing of our eyes or will we actually remain vigilant. Developments in Syria pose questions for Israel, Wilf said. 'A lot depends on how we handle them,' she noted. 'They will be a test for us as to whether we again slide into a kind of comfortable closing of our eyes or will we actually remain vigilant.' On one hand, the leader of Syria’s most powerful rebel faction has signaled that his forces do not want a conflict with Israel. On the other hand, Turkey—a country with a president openly hostile toward Israel—is expected to play an active role in the new regime. If Turkey establishes a military presence in Syria, it could increase the likelihood of friction between Israel and Syria, Michael said. Several wild cards remain in Lebanon as well. The cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah, signed on November 27, is technically valid for only 60 days. Hezbollah has repeatedly breached the agreement, and there is little indication that it will hold beyond Trump’s inauguration. Developments in the West Bank are another source of concern for Israel in the new year. Avivi warned of rising extremism in the territories, suggesting that the army will eventually need to shift its focus to the Palestinians living there. Terrorist groups may attempt to mobilize Palestinians in the West Bank as well as Palestinian citizens of Israel to carry out attacks, Avivi said. I sincerely hope that we will not waste the opportunity to really change course both with the Palestinians and Lebanon and make it clear that we will not go back to previous arrangements, Wilf emphasized that much of Israel’s fate remains in its own hands. 'I sincerely hope that we will not waste the opportunity to really change course both with the Palestinians and Lebanon and make it clear that we will not go back to previous arrangements,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: If Israel manages to overcome Palestinian intransigence, a new era of peace and security may be possible as early as 2026, Wilf said. 'The ideology and identity of the Palestinians that is obsessed with the nonexistence of Jewish sovereignty on any part of this land has to end,' she said. 'When that ideology dies, we can discuss anything.'

Palestinian Authority suspends Al Jazeera operations, accusing ch...	PA bans Qatari network's broadcasts, citing 'incitement and interference in internal affairs,' and freezes its operations following coverage of terror crackdown in Jenin, which PA calls 'incendiary' The Palestinian Authority (PA) officially announced Wednesday its decision to suspend Al Jazeera’s broadcasts and freeze the network’s operations in PA-controlled territories. A ministerial committee comprising the Palestinian Ministries of Culture, Interior and Communications said that the suspension will remain in effect until Al Jazeera rectifies its legal standing. The PA accused the channel of violating Palestinian laws by broadcasting 'provocative content' characterized by 'deception, incitement to rebellion, sabotage and interference in internal Palestinian affairs.' The move follows the Qatari network's critical coverage of PA security forces, particularly during its counterterrorism operation against Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) operatives in the Jenin refugee camp. The channel alleged that PA forces were responsible for the death of a journalism student during clashes, a claim the PA denied, asserting its forces were not present in the area. The PA noted that the student’s brother was a wanted Hamas operative, and she had ties to PIJ and Hamas-affiliated groups. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas condemned the PA’s decision, calling it 'a blatant violation of press freedom' and accusing the PA of silencing dissent. 'This oppressive move is part of a series of arbitrary measures the Palestinian Authority has lately adopted to restrict public rights and freedoms and strengthen its security hold over the Palestinian people,' Hamas said. Last month, PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement banned Al Jazeera’s activities in the West Bank, citing its 'incitement' during coverage of Jenin’s events, particularly against PA security forces. Fatah officials also called on Al Jazeera journalists to resign, accusing the channel of 'destroying the Arab world.' Under the new directive, Al Jazeera staff caught broadcasting from PA territories could face arrest and legal penalties. This decision echoes a similar move by the Israeli government, which previously banned Al Jazeera operations in Israel, citing its broadcasts as a direct threat to national security. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkr19xmlkl	2025-01-01T12:01:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/13/S1cVq9v8p/S1cVq9v8p_0_154_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Experts warn of Israeli intelligence lapses after seized document...	Captured Hamas documents reveal years of meticulous intelligence gathering on Israeli border towns, exposing blind spots in Israel’s security and intelligence efforts that experts say were exploited during the Oct. 7 attack In a recent reveal, Israel’s Channel 12 News exposed documents that were found during the ground operation that showed years of effort on Hamas’ part to gather intelligence about border towns and villages in Israel, including the movements and habits of leading local figures and security officers. Through meticulous information-gathering, Hamas was not only able to execute a surprise offensive but a precise one. 'It was clear for a long time that with the aid of Iran, Hamas had been collecting intelligence methodically and doing so in a professional manner,' Prof. Kobi Michael, a researcher at the Institute of National Security Studies and the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, told The Media Line. 'This also shows Israel’s great permeability; it wasn’t too hard of a job.' On Oct. 7, 2023, thousands of Hamas terrorists stormed Israel’s border with Gaza and carried out the largest single-day terrorist attack against the Jewish state. Approximately 1,200 Israelis were killed and thousands more were injured. Hamas took 250 people into captivity, 100 of whom are still being held in Gaza, though many are presumed dead. The attack stunned Israel, and as the shock subsided, many questions were raised about Israel’s preparedness, the extent of the intelligence it had, and what could have been done to prevent such a tragedy. According to the Channel 12 News report, documents and sensitive information were collected for years. Hamas hacked surveillance cameras throughout southern Israel, and the organization managed to infiltrate sensitive systems, allowing them to diligently monitor the movements of critical security figures in the border area. Hamas did an excellent job using OSINT (open-source intelligence) and gained access to CCTV cameras, which are so prevalent today. Together, this was an endless source of intelligence. Since the attack, Israel launched a massive war against Hamas in Gaza. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed while the Israeli army has conducted thousands of airstrikes and a massive ground operation. Israeli troops are still on the ground in Gaza, though to a lesser extent than at the beginning of the war. 'In order for Israel to prevent a terrorist army to exist on its border, it needs full security control in Gaza,' Brig. Gen. (Res.) Amir Avivi, founder of the Israel Defense and Security Forum (IDSF), told The Media Line. 'These abilities, developed by Hamas, grew as a result of Israel’s lack of control on the territory.' Michael added that the Israeli army and its soldiers also lack operational discipline, often disregarding directives about information safety and the usage of social media. The defense establishment was indifferent in a sense. The local authorities also didn’t attach much importance to this issue, and it became a blind spot that widened. Hamas took advantage of the growing blind spot for years. Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, 38 years after it captured the territory from Egyptian hands during the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel maintained control of the border crossings it shared with Gaza and also its airspace and territorial waters through a strict naval blockade. Egyptian soldiers and Hamas operatives manned Gaza’s border with Egypt until Israel took control of the border town of Rafah and the crossing several months ago. 'From 2005 until October 7, with the absence of Israeli presence on the ground, there was an exponential growth of Hamas’ abilities, including its intelligence capabilities,' said Avivi. 'They developed very advanced surveillance systems which are akin to systems the Israeli intelligence holds and also operated human intelligence operations, while significantly hindering Israel’s ability to use human sources to gather intelligence.' Over the decades, the number of work permits fluctuated, often symbiotic with the rise and ease of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. These circumstances demonstrate the complexity of Israel’s relationship with Gaza and the Palestinians. Gaza residents have entered Israel to work since 1967. More work opportunities and higher wages made Israel a lucrative work destination for Palestinians. This trend continued even when Israel disengaged from the territory. This arrangement, together with Israel’s hold on most of Gaza’s borders, meant Israel and the Gaza Strip were still deeply connected, both dependent on each other. For Israel, Palestinians provided cheap labor in certain fields, such as agriculture, in which most Israelis no longer work. For Palestinians, employment in Israel was the key to improving their standard of living in one of the world’s most impoverished territories. Over the decades, the number of work permits fluctuated, often symbiotic with the rise and ease of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. One clear example of this fluctuation was in the days leading up to Hamas’s stunning attack. Days before the war, Gaza residents approached the security fence with Israel, demonstrating against the blockade. In response, Israel barred the entrance of Gaza laborers into the country for a short period. In an attempt to diffuse the tension, Israel then lifted the sanction, allowing Palestinian workers in. However, tensions were not diffused. Instead, war broke out that would change the face of the region. The economic interdependence also exists in the West Bank, territories which Israel also captured in 1967 and refers to as Judea and Samaria. Some of the territories are fully controlled by the Palestinian Authority (PA), Israel fully controls others, and some are under Palestinian civil control and Israeli military hold. In response to the war in Gaza, Israel also drastically reduced the number of Palestinian workers allowed to enter from the West Bank. From over 100,000 workers a day, the number has been lowered to a few thousand, citing Israeli security concerns and the potential for further tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. From Gaza, where the war is ongoing, there has been no entrance of workers since the fighting began. Before Oct. 7, 2023, the Israeli defense establishment and much of the political echelon believed that the entrance of Palestinians to work in Israel, both from Gaza and the West Bank, defused tensions and decreased motivation to engage in terrorism while creating an incentive to maintain the quiet between Israel and the Palestinians. 'This presumption was wrong,' said Michael. 'In Gaza, it didn’t cause Hamas to change its ideology or reduce its motivation to carry out such an attack; it didn’t create a positive impact but also created an intelligence platform for Hamas.' It was clear that work permits for Palestinians would create extensive intelligence for Hamas. According to Avivi, 'It was clear that work permits for Palestinians would create extensive intelligence for Hamas.' Throughout Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank are Palestinians who share familial connections, another vulnerability that is believed to have been used by Hamas in Gaza to collect intelligence in and on Israel. Israeli forces carry out daily raids in the West Bank against terrorist activity, detaining tens of suspects every day, making for a clearer intelligence outlook. Consequently, Israel’s ability to thwart attacks from those territories has been consistently better, and the chances of an attack similar to Oct. 7 being carried out from the West Bank are slimmer, though not non-existent. This is due to the existing familial connections and the current flow of workers into Israel. One cannot rely on technology alone for intelligence, and in the disengagement, Israel lost the critical ability to gather intelligence through human sources. While in Judea and Samaria, Israel has complete freedom to operate and control the arena through massive settlements, in Gaza, this was not possible, making the ability to generate quality intelligence non-existent. Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 made it almost impossible for Israel’s secret service to recruit Palestinian agents. The withdrawal also saw an Israeli commando unit charged with recruiting agents unable to operate from within Gaza. While Israel’s security grip on the West Bank is much stronger than it has been in Gaza, it is not immune from a similar Oct. 7 scenario. 'Israel must presume that the Palestinians are capable of gathering such intelligence on Israel from the West Bank as they did from Gaza, even though Hamas’s capabilities there are much more limited,' said Michael. 'But in the end, geography has little significance in such cases where surveillance cameras can be accessed remotely.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For now, Israel remains in Gaza, with the government vowing to retain control over security matters in the territory indefinitely. With 100 remaining hostages waiting to be released from the hands of Hamas terrorists, making up for years of little intelligence is critical. Israeli intelligence control is therefore increasing, but there are still gaps. There is a lot of intelligence about the hostages, but in order to release them, that is not enough. It is very rare that the operational conditions that allow for rescue operations exist.

Shadow students': Training the next generation of Israeli spies	Using code letters instead of full names, students from across Israel converge at a high school in Katzrin, preparing for future roles in Mossad and Shin Bet—the country’s elite intelligence agencies As early as ninth grade, students destined for Israel's primary intelligence agencies Mossad and Shin Bet are identified and enrolled in the elite Odem program, where they adopt code letters in place of full names. Jointly run by the Defense Ministry, Education Ministry, IDF, Mossad and Shin Bet, the program is described as 'the jewel of leadership in the technological arena,' created by the architects of other elite initiatives for future military recruits like Talpiot and Psagot. The first cohort in the specialized high school that was established in the town of Katzrin in the Golan Heights is now completing matriculation exams, and registration for the next class has begun. Graduates will pursue electrical engineering degrees at the Technion, alongside specialized training, exposure to security forces and participation in cutting-edge technological projects. Following this, they will undertake six years of military service, preparing for leadership roles in technology within the Shin Bet and Mossad. The program aims for gender and geographical equity, with 38% female participants and 40% from northern and southern Israel. The defense establishment seeks to raise both figures to 50%. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Roy Shefer, head of the elite programs division, said the Odem program addresses a critical shortage of technological and managerial talent in Israel’s top security units. 'Instead of waiting until the end of 12th grade for students to reach the required level, Odem begins training in 10th grade, focusing on academics like math, physics and English, as well as leadership skills,' he said. 'The goal,' he explained, 'is to give boys and girls the chance to close gaps, expand technological knowledge and develop personally during a formative stage—before decisions are made and opportunities are closed off.' A., a 12th grader from Kiryat Shmona and a member of Odem’s first graduating class, said the program aligns with his aspirations. 'I want to serve in a meaningful role where my skills can contribute to my country. After October 7, it’s clear how essential this program is. In the Shin Bet and Mossad, you rarely get credit for your actions, and no one may ever know it was you who acted. To me, that’s the beauty of it.' S., a 12th-grade student from a Gaza-border community, echoed those sentiments, tying her ambitions to her upbringing centered on service and Zionism. 'The people behind technological developments saved my life,' she said. 'Even in the current war, the critical role of technology is undeniable. I’ve always wanted to understand the work of those in the shadows and find where I can contribute. My ambition is to be one of them—protecting others quietly, ensuring no one even realizes there was ever a threat.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkxne1xujg	2025-01-01T08:52:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/yk14208247/yk14208247_1_56_1251_705_0_small.jpg

FBI investigates New Orleans shooting and ramming attack as terro...	After hours of conflicting statements, FBI officially announces investigating New Orleans attack that left 10 dead and 35 injured as act of terror; attacker killed, but identity and motives remain unknown; most victims were locals, not tourists The FBI announced Wednesday afternoon that it is investigating a ramming and shooting attack in New Orleans that killed 10 people and injured about 35 others as an act of terrorism. The official statement, which confirmed the attacker had been killed, came after conflicting earlier comments from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who declared the attack a terror incident, and senior FBI official Althea Duncan, who initially said it was not terrorism. The attack began around 3:15 a.m. local time (11:15 a.m. Israel time) on Bourbon Street, a historic road in the heart of New Orleans’ iconic French Quarter, known for its vibrant nightlife and global reputation as a New Year’s Eve celebration hotspot. According to officials, most of the victims were local residents, not tourists. Many had gathered to ring in 2025 when the attacker drove through the area, armed with an assault rifle, wearing a helmet and body armor. Authorities said the suspect fired at victims during the ramming attack and later exited the vehicle, engaging in a gunfight with police. Two officers were injured before the suspect was fatally shot. The attacker’s identity and motives remain unclear. New Orleans Police chief Anne Kirkpatrick described the suspect as 'determined' and said his goal was to 'kill as many people as possible.' CBS News reported that investigators recovered a long rifle at the scene. Mayor Cantrell was quick to call the incident an act of terrorism, while FBI official Duncan initially dismissed it as such, sparking confusion. Analysts explained that the discrepancy likely stemmed from differing definitions of terrorism: while the mayor may have referred to the broad psychological impact of the attack, the FBI adheres to its stricter definition of terrorism as an act of violence committed to advance ideological, political or religious goals, often inspired by foreign terror groups. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Later in the day, the FBI clarified that the incident was being investigated as a potential act of terrorism. Law enforcement officials also reported ongoing efforts to neutralize and safely detonate improvised explosive devices found at the scene hours after the attack. Texas license plate and rental apartment set ablaze Few details are currently known about the attacker. According to reports, the vehicle used in the ramming bore Texas license plates. On the rear of the truck, authorities found a stick or pipe holding a piece of fabric, possibly resembling a flag, which is being examined for potential messages. A security source told The Guardian that the suspect recently stayed in a short-term rental apartment about two miles from the attack site. That apartment caught fire early in the morning, forcing the evacuation of nearby residents amid suspicions it contained explosive devices. CBS News reported that investigators are examining whether the attacker had ties to foreign terror organizations or was inspired by them. Police said that 300 officers had been deployed to secure the New Year’s celebrations in New Orleans, which likely enabled the quick response. Police chief Kirkpatrick said the attacker bypassed barricades to target pedestrians, using a white pickup truck. Authorities declared the incident a mass casualty event and urged residents to avoid the area. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry condemned the attack as 'a horrific act of violence.' The White House said outgoing President Joe Biden is being updated and that he called New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell to offer 'full federal support.' Graphic footage from the scene circulated online, showing injured victims lying on the road. One witness wrote on X that they saw a vehicle accelerating through the crowd, 'knocking people down.' Another woman told local TV station WLWT that she fled the ramming and was saved 'by the grace of God.' She added that several police officers fired at the vehicle before the attacker exited, attempting to stop him. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skgdhj7ukx	2025-01-01T07:37:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/H1IzUTfIJl/H1IzUTfIJl_0_134_800_451_0_small.jpg

One of the riskiest operations': Inside Israel's high-stakes com...	In September, Israeli commandos raided an advanced Iranian underground missile facility near Masyaf, used for precision missile production; troops eliminated guards and retrieved key documents before destroying site with explosives This past September, reports emerged worldwide about an extraordinary IDF commando operation in Syria. During the mission, commando troops raided and destroyed an Iranian missile production facility used by Hezbollah in Masyaf, located in Syria’s Hama province. The world marveled at the operation, which involved landing Israeli forces deep inside Syrian territory, dozens of miles from the border. The commandos not only demolished the facility but also extracted significant intelligence material from it. However, the operation was met with official silence in Israel. Now, nearly four months later, the IDF has detailed the sequence of events during the raid. 'This was one of the most daring and riskiest commando operations the IDF has conducted outside the country in recent years — heroic, high-risk and meticulously planned by the Israeli Air Force,' an official said. 'The operation achieved its objective: neutralizing a critical strategic capability of Iran in Syria, located dozens of kilometers from Israel.' The elite Shaldag unit of the Israeli Air Force carried out the high-risk operation targeting an advanced underground missile facility near Masyaf used by Iranian forces to produce precision missiles for Hezbollah. Supported by dozens of fighter jets, helicopters and drones, the commandos neutralized guards at the facility, known as 'Deep Layer,' before rigging it with explosives and detonating it remotely. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The operation, which deployed ground forces deep in enemy territory, incurred no Israeli casualties. Troops also retrieved key documents from the site. American and Western officials later confirmed to The New York Times that Israeli special forces had rappelled from helicopters during the raid to gather intelligence. The use of ground troops was reportedly necessary due to the mission’s complexity and the need to secure materials from the secret facility. Israel had briefed senior U.S. officials ahead of the operation, which included airstrikes on the facility. On Sunday, U.S. Central Command chief General Michael Kurilla visited the IDF’s Northern Command, where he reviewed Israeli operational plans for Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjxhj6f81g	2025-01-01T06:42:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/12/BybbaWQlaA/BybbaWQlaA_0_179_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Citing security, cost of living and lack of religious freedom, one woman says she has chosen a life in New Zealand where she would not have to live in danger and paycheck to paycheck; child of Israeli parents says knows in her heart her home is here A record-breaking number of Israeli citizens left the country in 2024. Of the 82,700 who have left, only 23,800 returned. Some cited security concerns and the high cost of living as reasons for their decision to leave. At the same time, others have decided to move to Israel and build their lives here. Yael Eltzur, 24, who moved to The Netherlands with her family when she was 13, says she always knew she would be back. 'I came to volunteer last year and that motivated me to move back and work in Israel,' she tells Ynet. 'I had just broken up with my Dutch partner a couple of months earlier and felt our cultural differences played a large part in that. I decided the best thing for me was to build a home in Israel although my parents were less enthusiastic about the idea.' She says the Hamas-led October 7 massacre strengthened her resolve. 'I've always felt that Israel would ultimately be my home but did not have the chance to leave. After October 7, that feeling intensified,' she said. 'I was single, between jobs so the timing was perfect to begin the process.' Eltzur says antisemitism also played a role in her decision. 'Europe feels unsafe for me. Antisemitism is growing and Europeans are not prepared for it. At least in Israel, the IDF is protecting us,' she says, adding that she had missed the local food, culture and society. She has family in Israel as well. 'I am sure I will miss everyone in Holland, but I feel in my heart that here is where I should be. I grew up here and would want to give my children the same childhood.' Natalie Dela, is a 31-year-old veteran of the Air Force who decided to leave for New Zealand last October, because of religious extremism, the cost of living and the security situation. 'After the October 7 massacre, I understood that war and terrorism are an inseparable part of life in Israel,' she says.

Can Israel block a Palestinian State forever?	MK Simcha Rothman: The idea of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict has 'poisoned the minds of the entire world' The idea of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict has 'poisoned the minds of the entire world' and will never solve the conflict, according to MK Simcha Rothman, a member of Israel’s National Religious Party. Speaking to the ILTV News Podcast last week, Rothman called the two-state solution the 'first step toward the destruction of the State of Israel' and vowed to do everything in his power to prevent it. Last month, the Knesset Land of Israel Caucus began promoting the 'Israel Security Law.' This law requires a special majority of at least 80 MKs to approve any agreement involving territorial concessions, including in Judea and Samaria. If enacted, it would effectively block the establishment of a Palestinian state in any future arrangement. This marks the third piece of related legislation introduced since October 7. The first two were passed with overwhelming support. In February, the Knesset approved a resolution sponsored by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state. That resolution specifically targeted the unilateral creation of such a state amid reports of international discussions about recognizing a Palestinian state without a peace agreement with Israel. In July, the Knesset passed another resolution rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state, even as part of a negotiated settlement. This resolution was co-sponsored by coalition and right-wing opposition parties, with backing from Benny Gantz’s centrist National Unity Party. 'The Knesset of Israel firmly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state west of Jordan. The establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the Land of Israel will pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region,' the resolution stated. Rothman told ILTV that this latest initiative is the 'last leg' in the effort to prevent such a state. The proposed law would ensure that the government cannot cede Jerusalem, territorial waters, or land beyond the Green Line—including Judea, Samaria, or the Jordan Valley—without a referendum or the approval of 80 MKs. 'We want to extend it now that everyone understands the dangers of a Palestinian state, especially so close to our cities and communities,' Rothman explained. 'This protection should also apply to Judea and Samaria, ensuring the State of Israel cannot create a Palestinian state through an agreement or any other means.' This legislative push comes as former U.S. President Donald Trump returns to the White House, with a stated goal of brokering peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Saudi leaders have indicated that progress toward a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for any peace agreement. Rothman, however, dismissed concerns that the legislation would hinder negotiations. 'In any negotiation, you say at the beginning what is not on the table,' he said. 'For Israel, a Palestinian state is not on the table. You can find another solution.' He pointed to numerous alternatives to a two-state solution proposed over the years that could provide Palestinians with rights and autonomy without compromising Israel’s security. Rothman highlighted a recent plan by former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman called 'One Jewish State.' The plan proposes granting Palestinians citizenship or residency in Israel, with civil authority over their daily lives while benefiting from living in Israel. However, it would bar them from voting in national elections, preserving Jewish governance of the State of Israel. Friedman compared this arrangement to the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. 'The peace agreement with the Saudis that we all want will happen when they understand that peace cannot be based on something we see as the destruction of the State of Israel,' Rothman said. 'If you want peace with us, you don’t want to destroy the State of Israel.' He emphasized the importance of preserving Judea and Samaria, calling it the 'biblical heartland' of the country. This region, he said, is where many significant events in the Bible took place, including in ancient Shiloh, Bethel, and Hebron, all of which have deep Jewish religious ties. Rothman argued that fighting for a Jewish state in Israel is meaningless if key locations like Jerusalem and Hebron are abandoned. 'You have less justification to hold Tel Aviv, because Tel Aviv can be built anywhere. But Jerusalem—you cannot build another Jerusalem anywhere else,' he said. 'There is only one Jerusalem. This is important for security reasons, historical justice, and because we are the indigenous people of the land of Israel. We cannot take away our heartland from our land.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1lx11tfujl	2025-01-01T04:24:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/HkIhZ6zUyx/HkIhZ6zUyx_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell is calling the New Year'Day mass casualty incident that killed 10 people and injured 30 a 'terrorist attack.' The FBI is investigating what occurred early Wednesday, when a vehicle drove into a crowd on New Orleans' famed Canal and Bourbon Street in the first hours of New Yea's Day. Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's New Orleans field office, said officials were investigating the discovery of at least one suspected improvised explosive device at the scene. Earlier, the New Orleans Police Department said it was responding to a mass casualty incident Wednesday that included fatalities. NOLA Ready advised people to stay away from the area. It said the injured had been taken to five local hospitals. The incident came at 3:15 a.m. toward the end of New Year's celebrations in New Orleans and hours before the kickoff of the Sugar Bowl, a college football quarterfinal held in the city's Superdome, with thousands expected to be in attendance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hylsc3miyg	2025-01-01T04:09:39-08:00

President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russia's government and the country's biggest bank, Sberbank, to build cooperation with China in artificial intelligence. Putin's instructions were published on the Kremlin's website on Wednesday, three weeks after he announced that Russia would team up with BRICS partners and other countries to develop AI. He told the government and Sberbank, which is spearheading Russia's AI efforts, to 'ensure further co-operation with the People's Republic of China in technological research and development in the field of artificial intelligence'. Western sanctions intended to restrict Moscow's access to the technologies it needs to sustain its war against Ukraine have resulted in the world's major producers of microchips halting exports to Russia, severely limiting its AI ambitions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1e0anzl1x	2025-01-01T04:06:40-08:00

Minister Chikli: 'Reading the Bible is also reading the best book that was ever written' Since the October 7 massacre and the ensuing war, Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism has developed several new tools to monitor and forecast antisemitism. However, according to Minister Amichai Chikli, the most effective way to combat antisemitism is through education. 'We need to make sure that young Jews are aware of their Jewish identity, [their] Zionist identity,' Chikli told ILTV during the Lights of Hope virtual event. As part of these efforts, Chikli recently launched Project Aleph Bet in collaboration with the Jewish Federations of North America, UnitEd, and Prizmah. The program focuses on increasing enrollment in Jewish day schools across North America. In addition to this initiative, Chikli emphasized that his ministry is working on several other programs to strengthen connections between Jewish communities outside North America and Israel. 'Because we have the same Torah, because we have similar history, and because we share Jewish values, from the Ten Commandments and on,' Chikli explained, the connection between Jews in Israel and the Diaspora should be natural and strong. 'Reading the Bible is also reading the best book that was ever written. It’s not just religion; it’s far more. It’s history, it’s culture, it’s drama—it’s actually good reading,' he added. 'The Bible is what connects us.'

Can renewable energy revolutionize rural Africa?	Here is how Gigawatt Impact is transforming lives with renewable energy in Africa and beyond Gigawatt Impact is a groundbreaking nonprofit dedicated to scaling renewable energy in the world’s least developed countries and vulnerable rural communities. Gigawatt Impact develops utility-scale, community-based renewable energy projects by leveraging venture philanthropy. These efforts empower communities with financial and environmental independence while addressing racial and economic injustice. The organization was highlighted this week at the Lights of Hope virtual event. The concept began 18 years ago when Co-founder Yosef Abramowitz arrived in Israel’s Arava region, intending to power the area entirely with solar energy during the day. 'It was the same time that the region in the south of Israel got a million-dollar grant from the UJA Federation of Toronto, and it started us off on our journey, which we ended up deploying $400 million of investments there,' Abramowitz recalled. 'It’s the first time I understood some grant money can unlock big investment money.' Today, Abramowitz is using the same model to help transform Africa. 'In a very poor country like Burundi, it’s very hard for investors to get their minds around investing serious money. There’s a lot of risks. So here, the philanthropic community plays a very important role, both in doing some of the studies and the community work, corporate social responsibility programs, the water pump, and other things we’re doing there,' Abramowitz explained. He shared one example: 'We just fired up 200,000 of these bricks. It had six classrooms for 1,400 students, cramming into very few classrooms. So that’s the role of philanthropy. However, our other partners were able to bring in the largest investment in Burundi’s energy history. It wouldn’t have happened if we didn’t have the philanthropic money.' Gigawatt Impact’s initiatives extend beyond Burundi. The organization is also working in Uganda, where Patrick Nzitunga leads its efforts. Many rural communities in Africa lack access to electricity, yet 90% of the population relies on farming as their main source of income. Gigawatt addresses this issue by building power plants, connecting them to the national utility grid, and selling electricity to support these communities. However, Gigawatt’s work goes beyond simply providing electricity. It focuses on empowering rural communities by boosting agricultural productivity. The organization develops community infrastructure centers to ensure energy solutions are tailored to local needs. By tackling challenges like post-harvest losses and the exploitation of farmers by middlemen, Gigawatt enables farmers—especially women—to increase their productivity, income, and overall economic independence. 'This is not about solving poverty in a ‘poor’ country; rather, it’s about addressing systemic barriers and creating opportunities through access to energy and sustainable agricultural practices,' Abramowitz said. 'Gigawatt’s work is transforming rural economies, enhancing livelihoods, and boosting local revenues.' Nzitunga emphasized that the success of these efforts can have a ripple effect across Africa. 'Many rural communities in Africa have similarities so that you can go from Uganda to Rwanda to South Sudan… We believe that the pilot we are doing in Uganda can be easily replicated, and we can raise a revolution in Africa,' he said. Gigawatt Impact’s mission is not limited to Africa—it also has a role in the United States. The Thurgood Marshall College Fund is actively collaborating with Israeli institutions to explore joint research projects and student exchange programs, aiming to advance sustainable agricultural practices. 'Israel really is at the forefront of agro-voltaic plant science and all kinds of agricultural sciences, whether it’s hardware or software,' said Weldon Turner, a co-founder of Gigawatt Impact. Turner added that they are working on initiatives to bring Israeli technology and expertise to the United States. 'The U.S. is the biggest consumer market in the world, and it’s the biggest food consumer market in the world,' he said. 'We do it one step at a time, and I think this is the real opening to provide Israeli technology to move into the United States.'

End of Russian gas to Europe as Ukraine stops pipeline transit	The start of 2025 signals the expiration of the agreement that allowed the transfer of Russian gas through pipelines in Ukraine to the European market, despite three years of war; Europe has already dramatically reduced its dependence on Russian gas, but Slovakia may be affected and Moldova declared a state of emergency Russian gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Ukraine came to a halt on New Year's Day, marking the end of decades of Moscow's dominance over Europe's energy markets and the final cooperation between Russia and the West after nearly three years of war. Russia's gas firm Gazprom said it had stopped early Wednesday after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement. Russia and the Soviet Union before it have, in the past 50 years, been an inexpensive source of gas for Europe, and Ukraine was a central conduit for its supply. At its height, Russian gas constituted 35% of the European market. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, European countries began depending on alternative sources and its market share dropped to 8% after 2022. The widely expected stoppage will not impact prices for consumers in the European Union, unlike in 2022, when falling supplies from Russia sent prices to record highs, worsened a cost-of-living crisis and hit the bloc's competitiveness. The last remaining EU buyers of Russian gas via Ukraine, such as Slovakia and Austria, have arranged an alternative supply. Hungary will keep receiving Russian gas via TurkStream, which runs two pipelines under the Black Sea. Gas deliveries through Ukraine yielded considerable profits for Moscow even after many of the European nations turned to other sources and now Russia stands to lose some $5 billion annually and Kyiv will be out the $800 million in annual revenue from commissions. The latest deal between Ukraine and Russia, which has now expired, was signed in 2020 despite the tensions between the countries after the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine's neighbor Moldova which was reliant on the transit flows, cut off heating and hot water supplies to households early on Wednesday. The European Commission said the EU had prepared for the cutoff. 'The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin,' a spokesperson for the Commission said. 'It has been reinforced with significant new LNG (liquefied natural gas) import capacities since 2022.' Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the EU has slashed its dependence on Russian energy by buying more piped gas from Norway and LNG from Qatar and the United States. Ukraine, which refused to extend the transit deal, said Europe had already decided to abandon Russian gas. 'We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses,' Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. Cost to both sides Ukraine now faces the loss of some $800 million a year in transit fees from Russia, while Gazprom will lose close to $5 billion in gas sales. Russia and the former Soviet Union spent half a century building up a major share of the European gas market, which at its peak stood at around 35%, but the war has all but destroyed that business for Gazprom. The Yamal-Europe pipeline via Belarus has also shut and the Nord Stream route across the Baltic Sea to Germany was blown up in 2022. Combined, the various routes delivered a record-high 201 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to Europe in 2018. Russia shipped about 15 bcm of gas via Ukraine in 2023, down from 65 bcm when the last five-year contract began in 2020.

Cam Israeli training transform pediatric cardiac care in Israel?	Simon Fisher: 'We as Israelis are so proud to be able to make our world a better place' Doctors trained in Israel and living in Tanzania and Zambia joined forces to save the lives of 10 children in Zambia, explained Save a Child’s Heart Executive Director Simon Fisher. Speaking at the Lights of Hope virtual event this week, Fisher detailed a mission to Zambia at the end of 2024. Dr. Godwin Godfrey Sharau of Tanzania and Dr. Mudaniso Kumani Ziwa of Zambia, both trained by Save a Child’s Heart in Israel, worked alongside Tanzanian and Zambian teams to perform life-saving operations. Dr. Lior Sasson, director of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery at Wolfson Medical Center, was also present, observing firsthand the collaboration between two generations of surgeons he had trained in Israel over the past 15 years. 'You should have seen the smile and satisfaction on Dr. Sasson’s face,' Fisher said, 'and the glimmer of hope for these children. We as Israelis are so proud to be able to make our world a better place.' Watch the full Lights of Hope event: Save a Child’s Heart is dedicated to saving the lives of critically ill children suffering from heart disease in countries where access to pediatric cardiac care is limited or nonexistent. Through bringing children to Israel for treatment, conducting medical missions abroad, and training medical professionals, the organization delivers hope to families, communities, and even entire nations. However, Fisher acknowledged the challenges faced since October 7. 'We’ve found ourselves in a very, very difficult situation, and against all odds, Israel is reaching out to the world and showing the better and the best face of Israel—reaching out in a humanitarian way, saving lives, teaching, giving knowledge,' he said. 'And the beauty is, it is not only done by Israelis, but it is done by Israelis in partnership with Tanzanians and in partnership with Zambians,' Fisher added. Dr. Zachias Moonde Muulu, currently in Israel to further his skills in pediatric cardiac surgery, highlighted the stark reality in his home country. 'My country has a population of 20 million people, but for years, there were no heart operations done on children,' he said during the conference. 'When you have a child with a heart problem and you do not have the medical expertise to help your child, there is no hope.' Since 2017, however, Save a Child’s Heart has been conducting operations in Zambia and training local professionals. 'So, I am now coming in as a second-generation surgeon. We have a team that has already been built by Save a Child’s Heart to conduct these operations right from home,' Muulu said. 'And so my coming [to Israel] was a joyful moment. It was not scary… it is a dream come true for me.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skrpsqf8ke	2025-01-01T01:48:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/ByjChcz8Jl/ByjChcz8Jl_2_0_798_450_0_small.jpg

Under UNIFIL's nose, village in Lebanon becomes terror base for H...	Picturesque coastal village of An-Naqoura, home to UNIFIL HQ, was staging ground for Radwan's planned invasion of the Galilee; Each home had munitions, explosives, rockets and its orchards hid launchers aimed at Israel; 'It is impossible to believe peacekeepers saw nothing' IDF forces on Tuesday continued to work to uncover Hezbollah terror infrastructure in the picturesque Shiite village of An-Naqoura on the Israel-Lebanon border, and adjacent to the large UN peacekeepers' base in South Lebanon. There just next to the base, in the village that was home to 5,000 residents before the war, the troops uncovered a trove of armaments. It is a staging ground for what was to be the invasion of the Galilee by Hezbollah's Radwan forces, and the occupation of Nahariya and the surrounding communities. An-Naqoura is a symbol of the failure to implement the 2006 UN Security Council resolution 1701 that ended the Second Lebanon War and that states that UNIFIL peacekeepers were responsible to ensure Hezbollah forces remained north of the Litani River. For years, the Israeli governments and the IDF failed to prevent what had come to light in the recent conflict, all along the frontier, from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the mountains in the east. 'It is impossible to believe that the UN forces did not prevent Hezbollah from amassing so many arms and munitions,' Col. (Res.) Nir Shimri, whose paratroopers have been operating in the village, said. What the military found was no less than incredible. Hezbollah set up one of its largest logistical and strategic bases on the coastal road leading from the border to Tyre and Sidon. The terror group operated alongside the UNIFIL forces that were there to protect the border and maintain stability but did nothing to stop Hezbollah. It is clearly evident that the international force was complicit in its silence, given the scope of Hezbollah's military might, revealed in An-Naqoura and dozens of other villages. 'Nearly every home had storages of military equipment and positions. These were Hezbollah's auxiliary supplies,' Shimri said. The IDF left operations in the village to the later stages of the fighting and after the cease-fire agreement came into effect because of its proximity to the UNIFIL headquarters, where the international committee established to oversee compliance with the agreement has been meeting. In November, eight UNIFIL troops were hurt from a Hezbollah rocket launch and the IDF could not allow such a mishap to be repeated. 'We had to ensure that the fighting against Hezbollah did not pose a danger to the UNIFIL camp,' an IDF commander said. 'He explained that his forces were limited in their use of firepower and had to operate with surgical precision under the gaze of the international forces. 'We had observed significant movement of UNIFIL troops along the coastal road but it appeared that they did nothing to prevent Hezbollah from doing as they will in the village.' In the village orchards, the troops found rocket launchers aimed at Israel. Nearby they found notebooks with markings of targets in northern Israel that they planned to attack. 'The launchers were under cover of the trees and we would not have been able to find them had we not entered the orchards on foot,' one soldier said. He added that the entire area between the villages was dug up with underground tunnels, command centers, weapons storages and trucks loaded with rocket launchers. 'The closer you move toward the UN base and the border, the more ammunition you find and the feeling is that UNIFIL provided cover for Hezbollah,' he said. Inside the village, the troops found explosive devices, RPG rockets and AK47 rifles in homes and yards along with Iranian missiles, anti-tank mortar shells and other weapons ready for use. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'In another world, this village could have been a tourist attraction like villages in Cyprus or Greece,' the commander said. 'You step into a well-to-do home, with expensive marble that you might see in any affluent Israeli neighborhood, and you ask yourself, why use this as infrastructure for terror? It's all so surreal.' On the eve of the cease-fire coming into effect, some in the village believed the residents could return and warned them of undetonated bombs and explosives spread on the ground. But less than three weeks later, the Abbas Awada, the municipal engineer published an angry post on the village's Facebook page, blaming Israel for carrying out a systematic destruction. He said 70% of the village, was destroyed since the cease-fire came into effect after only 35% was damaged before. Awada wrote that he was amazed at the lack of action from UNIFIL to force compliance with the cease-fire and criticized the UN troops for not preventing the damage to his village where their headquarters is located. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skh1600fiyl	2025-01-01T00:57:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/30/r1eS6t00RR/r1eS6t00RR_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Report: Negotiations for hostage deal again at impasse as Hamas i...	The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday morning that, according to Arab mediators, negotiations between Israel and Hamas over the release of the hostages have once again reached a dead end. According to the report, this is because the terrorist organization has once again insisted on its demand that Israel commit to an immediate complete cease-fire. It was also reported that the Biden administration has expressed frustration with the situation, and it seems that no deal is expected until Donald Trump enters the White House.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00votz8kl	2025-01-01T00:19:15-08:00

A ‘decisive’ attack on Iran could end the regional war, says Isra...	Brigadier General (Res.) Amir Avivi: 'This coming year is going to be a very defining year, which we hopefully will see the Shia axis falling down' If Israel were to carry out a decisive attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, it could end the regional war, according to Brigadier General (Res.) Amir Avivi, founder and chairman of Habithonistim. 'Some people feel that the U.S. attacking Iran is opening a war,' Avivi said. 'No, it’s closing a war. And therefore it’s crucial to see the U.S. really leading an attack.' Speaking during the Lights of Hope virtual event, Avivi recommended a series of airstrikes lasting up to three days, which he said 'would completely change the Middle East.' 'It’s not just about hitting the head of the snake and bringing down the Shia axis,' he explained. 'It’s what will follow. And what will follow is peace agreements, is normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia,' a move he said would likely also lead to peace with countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan. The Lights of Hope event was designed to provide moments of optimism for a country and people enduring over a year of war. Avivi suggested that the tragedy of October 7 could ultimately pave the way for Israel to build a brighter future. 'This coming year is going to be a very defining year, which we hopefully will see the Shia axis falling down,' Avivi said. Watch the full Lights of Hope event: He envisioned a future where 'Israel will become the Singapore of the world. All the world trade will go through Israel,' accompanied by a path to sovereignty in Judea, Samaria, and the Jordan Valley. Avivi also expressed confidence that within the next one to three years, Israel would find a solution for Gaza. Avivi’s comments were followed by insights from former IDF Spokesperson Jonathan Conricus, now with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, who offered a more cautious perspective. Conricus highlighted the challenges of resolving the Gaza situation. 'Gaza is the area where I am the least optimistic because of the complexity of the challenge, because of how poor, uneducated, extremist, and jihadi the population in Gaza was before the war, and how strong and so many years that Hamas had to brainwash Palestinians in Gaza and therefore create a very, very difficult environment for us to operate,' Conricus said. He also voiced concerns about the ceasefire with Hezbollah, noting that 'it doesn’t provide Israel with real security assurances for people to go back to Northern Israel and for there to be a real security change.' Conricus warned that Hezbollah remains largely intact, with its weapons, personnel, and funding still in place. 'At the end of the day, as long as the Iranian regime exists, Hezbollah will exist,' Conricus concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bymymkf8jx	2025-01-01T00:03:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/ByMh7YfIJx/ByMh7YfIJx_57_0_793_446_0_small.jpg

Hanukkah, New Year’s message from Israeli President Isaac Herzog	Herzog: 'In this season that takes us inward, the entire world must project their voices outward and demand, immediately, to bring the hostages home' Shalom, dear friends. From the President's Residence in Jerusalem, from so many different corners of the earth, our hearts connect around the world during these days of Hanukkah to affirm what is most true. In these darkest moments of winter, in an hour of deep grief and longing for all of us, we recall that our light still shines. It is a light that takes so many forms: lights of creativity, lights of connection, lights of progress, lights of peace. They all point to the same truth—against the darkness, evil, and pain, there is so much light, so much beauty for us to acknowledge, to celebrate, and to cultivate. Watch the full Lights of Hope event: We have seen it in countless ways since October 7, that infamous day. We have seen it in the remarkable courage of soldiers and civilians who came forward to defend, protect, and save their fellow citizens. We have seen it in the spirit of generosity, mutual responsibility, and connection that has carried us through—from within Israel and through beautiful acts of friendship and caring in communities around the world. These points of light do not, of course, take away our pain, our agony, or our responsibility. We cannot speak about darkness without thinking about our sisters and brothers still buried deep in the dungeons and tunnels of Gaza. They continue to cry out to us and remind us of our supreme duty: to free them and let them go. In this season that takes us inward, the entire world must project their voices outward and demand, immediately, to bring them home. Now. We cannot be whole without them. This is also a call for the leadership of Israel, the leadership of all the countries around us, and predominantly a call and demand to our enemies, Hamas. The presence of each of you here, my friends, shows clearly that the power of coming together in joint purpose is greater than any attempt to weaken us or divide us. We will stand together against hatred, bias, and antisemitism and stand with our communities in Israel and throughout the world. The State of Israel, with our friends and allies around the world, will rebuild. We will find a path to harness our inner light and spread it to create a kinder, softer world. Yes, we shall overcome. May we shine it together during these eight days of Hanukkah and always.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1io00ozuke	2024-12-31T23:23:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/01/Hy13YuM81g/Hy13YuM81g_63_0_670_377_0_small.jpg
Who’s running Gaza now?	The ‘Ladies Who Drink’ reflect on Israel this New Year: Lessons from 2024, challenges of today, and hopes for 2025 Israel is struggling to win the war against Hamas, which is regaining strength, particularly in northern Gaza, according to veteran foreign correspondent Linda Gradstein. Gradstein, a reporter for Voice of America, appeared on ILTV’s Insider this week to discuss the past year and the challenges ahead. She joined ILTV Executive Editor Maayan Hoffman, who moderates the show, alongside MediaCentral Director Laura Cornfield, freelance photojournalist Laura Ben-David, and strategic communications consultant Robin Sirkin. Gradstein, who has covered the region for decades, noted a significant contrast between Israel’s wars with Hezbollah and Hamas. While Israel’s recent targeted operation against Hezbollah was swift and effective—rendering Hezbollah 'not really a serious military force,' in her words—the war with Hamas lacks a clear resolution. 'The problem is there’s no plan for the day after,' Gradstein explained. 'The government has three options: work with the Palestinian Authority and the international community, take over Gaza permanently, or allow the status quo to continue. Right now, we’re seeing the third option play out, and in that vacuum, Hamas is regaining control.' She added, 'Who’s running Gaza now? Gangs and Hamas. They’re stealing international aid while the people of Gaza suffer.' Cornfield and Ben-David echoed her concerns. Cornfield criticized the lack of unified leadership, saying, 'There’s no one person leading the fight, and it’s a huge detriment. Nobody knows what the endgame is.' Ben-David emphasized that with 100 hostages still in Gaza, Israel cannot claim victory. The Media Battle Off the battlefield, Israel is also losing the information war, Sirkin pointed out. She argued that Israel struggles to counter misinformation effectively on social media. 'We can’t express ourselves in 280 characters,' Sirkin said, while the other side uses passion and soundbites to gain support. Gradstein highlighted another challenge: foreign journalists often lack access to critical information. She noted that the IDF and government agencies like the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) are slow to provide updates, leaving journalists to report incomplete stories. As an Israeli and Jerusalem resident, Gradstein believes the Government Press Office (GPO) could do more to assist journalists. 'I always joke that the GPO should have a desk at the airport with fresh Jaffa orange juice to welcome correspondents,' she said. Cornfield, whose MediaCenteral organization works to provide access for foreign journalists, noted that many of these reporters are 'helicoptered in' with limited knowledge of the region. Additionally, she said, some arrive with preexisting agendas, either their own or dictated by their editors. Reflecting on 2024 The panel, who are close friends and call themselves 'The Ladies Who Drink,' also gathered on New Year’s Eve to share their reflections on heroes, villains, and resolutions for the coming year. Gradstein named Rachel Goldberg Polin, the mother of murdered hostage Hirsh Goldberg, as her hero. 'She has just been a hero in the way she has handled the most horrible, horrible thing that can happen to any parent with incredible grace and incredible love for Israel and love for the Jewish people,' Gradstein said. Hirsh Goldberg was killed as the IDF approached the tunnel where he was held. Ben-David chose the Mossad as her hero, praising its science fiction-level beeper attack against Hezbollah and other counterterrorism efforts that have bolstered Israel’s security. For Cornfield and Sirkin, the villain of the year was social media. 'It’s killing us, our children, and our education,' Cornfield said. 'It’s not just controlling the narrative; it’s controlling the next generation.' A Resolution for Unity As for resolutions, Gradstein believes Israel can learn from the Ladies Who Drink. 'We come from very different backgrounds. We have very different political views. We have very different families. We have very different family situations, and yet we support each other,' she said. 'We champion each other’s successes, we help each other during hard times. 'The State of Israel should be like that,' she continued. 'We should all just relate to each other.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkfltdzlje	2024-12-31T22:15:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/Hkexlx1kLke/Hkexlx1kLke_1_279_2048_1153_0_small.jpg

Since Oct. 7 the US has given Israel $22 billion in military aid	Missiles, precision bombs, attack helicopters and armored vehicles: According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, from the outbreak of the war until August, the US transferred more than 50,000 tons of weapons to Israel. The US has provided Israel with military aid totaling approximately $22 billion since October 7 2023, which the IDF has used for its operations in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria during the war, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). According to the institute's data, between 2019 and 2023, the US supplied about 69% of Israel's weapons, a figure that rose to 78% in the subsequent period. By December 2023, the US had transferred more than 10,000 tons of weapons worth $2.4 billion to Israel, and this number jumped to 50,000 tons by August 2024, carried by hundreds of aircraft and ships. The U.S. has provided Israel with a variety of advanced military equipment, including missiles for the Iron Dome system, precision-guided bombs, CH-53 heavy transport helicopters, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, 155mm artillery shells, bunker-penetrating bombs, and armored vehicles. The institute's data also shows that the revenues of the three Israeli arms manufacturers ranked in the world's top 100 arms companies reached unprecedented levels in 2023 following the war in Gaza, and that their total revenues increased by 15%, totaling $13.6 billion. Revenues for Elbit Systems (ranked 27 in the world), for example, increased by 14%, reaching $5.4 billion. The company reported that between October 2023 and December 2023, it secured contracts worth about $900 million related to the IDF. > Israel Aerospace Industries (ranked 34) reported that 2023 was a record year for the company, with weapons revenues of $4.5 billion - a 15% increase compared to 2022. It increased the production rate to meet the IDF's demand for armaments, and accelerated the development of new systems. Rafael (ranked 42) also reported record sales and orders. In 2023, the company's arms revenue reached $3.7 billion, a 16% increase compared to the previous year. The company produces weapons essential to Israel's military strategy, such as missiles for the Iron Dome and David's Sling air defense systems. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryqd2lgl1e	2024-12-31T21:29:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/01/SyP5BfbY9T/SyP5BfbY9T_0_94_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Knesset considers bill favoring crime victims’ rehabilitation nee...	Proposed law allows victims to voice their position in person before the early release of offenders, requires parole boards to weigh the impact of release on victims’ recovery alongside offenders’ rehabilitation The Knesset's Constitution, Law, Justice Committee began preparing on Tuesday for the first reading of a proposed law that would allow crime victims to express their opinions orally before the early release of the offender who harmed them. According to the proposal, initiated by opposition lawmaker Chili Tropper, the parole board would be required to consider the impact of the release on the victim's rehabilitation process. 'This law is intended to improve the current situation,' Tropper explained during the committee discussion. 'Today, the parole board is required to consider the rehabilitation prospects of the inmate but is not required to take into account the rehabilitation of the victim, who, from their perspective, carries scars that do not fade over time. It is important to consider the state of the victims even after the offender has served their sentence in prison and before their release, as part of the significant considerations the committee must weigh when making its decision.' 'There is an anomaly in the law, as until now, victims could send a letter detailing the implications of the early release, but the board was not required to consider it,' committee chair Simcha Rotman said. Adv. Noa Brodsky Levi, from the legal advisory team to the committee said the bill would outline the considerations that the parole board must weigh, including risks to the public, the inmate's family, and the behavior of the inmate in prison. 'Under certain circumstances, the board is allowed to consider additional factors,' he said. 'The Crime Victims’ Rights Law allows the victim to submit a written statement to the parole board, and in practice, the board sometimes permits the victim to appear in person, but the law does not mandate this. The proposed law would add the impact of early release on the victim to the board's considerations and allow the victim to express their opinion orally as well.' 'It’s important to express the victim's outcry' A harrowing testimony was heard in the committee from Shari Golan, one of the victims of sex offender Alon Kastiel: 'Every time I wanted to speak at the parole board, I went through a difficult ordeal. The inmate's position is automatically heard orally, but we, the victims, are not heard.' Golan described how she was required to submit letters from psychological and medical professionals and how her ability to speak was dependent on the inmate's consent to leave the hearing. 'In 2022, with the final release of the serial offender, all the victims were given only 22 hours' notice to appear,' she said. 'They couldn’t submit their opinions or come to speak. I fought to speak, and even then, they asked the man who raped me and locked me in a storeroom for his permission to leave the hearing. I feel it’s important to express the victim's outcry, whose cries are not heard during the first offense.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Public Defender's Office expressed reservations about the proposal, with Adv. Gil Shapira pointing to implementation difficulties and budgetary implications, while also raising the issue of overcrowding in prisons. 'We’ve been in a state of prison emergency for over a year, exceeding the maximum incarceration capacity,' Shapira said. 'Early release is one of the mechanisms that helps relieve this situation.' Adv. Nili Finkelstein from the Ministry of Justice noted that following challenges raised in the field, an inter-ministerial team led by the judiciary administration was established. 'The Ministerial Committee for Legislation decided to support the component of the proposal concerning the victim's right to express their opinion orally,' she said. 'Expressing this position does not make the victim a party to the process but recognizes them as a significant factor with rights at various stages of the process.' 'The issue of overcrowding and its harm to other inmates is not currently considered a factor, which is strange,' said MK Rothman. In response, MK Tropper stated, 'There’s no problem adding the issue of prison overcrowding during wartime as a consideration—it stands as no contradiction to the impact on the victim.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hktdpj118jx	2024-12-31T20:28:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/07/18/S1XC5tM3q/S1XC5tM3q_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel, and the world at large, welcomes 2025	In all of the world's major cities, the new year was welcomed with much fanfare; Here are some photos that showcase how each country 'kissed under the mistletoe', including Israel Around the world, people are saying goodbye to 2024 on Tuesday and welcoming 2025 with celebrations and dazzling fireworks displays. The year 2024, the hottest in recorded history, was overshadowed by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, upheavals in the Middle East and the U.S. presidential election, which concluded with Donald Trump’s victory. As is tradition, the first to count down to the new year were the island nations in the South Pacific. In Kiribati, one of these islands, 2025 began at 12:00 PM (Israel time). An hour later, following Tonga and Samoa, the new year arrived in New Zealand—the first major country to welcome 2025. In Auckland, a spectacular fireworks display lit up the sky above the Sky Tower, the tallest building in the country, drawing massive crowds to witness the celebration. At 2:00 PM, the new year reached Australia’s east coast. In Sydney, the celebrations began early: three hours before midnight, fireworks already illuminated the sky over the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge as part of the city’s main event. Sydney, which proudly calls itself the 'New Year’s Eve Capital of the World,' used nine tons of fireworks for its display. Estimates suggested that over one million people gathered to watch the show in person. Later in the afternoon, the new year will reach countries across Asia, with Japan and South Korea welcoming 2025 at 4:00 PM. As evening turns to night, Europe will count down to midnight and celebrate with cheers and kisses as the clock strikes twelve. Celebrating in Israel as well Parties are underway all over the Holy Land. Here are two examples: In various parts of the world, there is hope to witness the Northern Lights, following a phenomenon in which a solar eruption, or 'solar storm,' intensifies the aurora and extends it to areas farther from the North and South Poles. In the United States, reports suggest that the aurora may be visible in the northern regions of the country. In the UK, it was reported that the lights might be seen in northern England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. A similar phenomenon occurred last May. > And the Americans?.. By Wednesday morning, the new year will arrive in the United States. At 7:00 AM (Israel time), the traditional dropping of the giant crystal ball will take place in Times Square (Where else?..), marking the start of 2025 in America. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rry60jczr	2024-12-31T20:12:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/rJcDdRb8yl/rJcDdRb8yl_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

Former hostage leaves marriage, expecting baby	Months after returning from captivity in Gaza, where she was held for 49 days with her two young daughters, Doron Katz-Asher discovered she was pregnant, which she calls a miracle; Now, in her 8th month, she talks about the hell of Hamas captivity, how much she misses her mother and brother who were killed by the terrorists, and her separation from husband Yoni When the nausea and sensitivity to smells and tastes started, Doron Katz-Asher knew she had to buy a home pregnancy test to confirm the feeling. It was just before the eve of the holiday of Shavuot. 'I went to the self-pay counters,' she says. 'I didn't want to stand in line and have people see that I bought the test. I did the test at home, on the morning of the holiday. When I saw two lines, I told Yoni the news. It was an exciting moment of happiness. I did feel it, but until you see a positive result, you don't know.' The fact you got pregnant after being held captive in harsh conditions is a bit of a miracle, isn't it? 'Yes. I wanted another child even before the war. It didn't happen because we weren't mature. Yoni didn't want to and that's fine, I respected his wishes. It's not easy to be with two little girls and decide to have another child. I understood why he didn't want to, and I also understood why I did.' And after the captivity? 'When I returned from there, I had doubts about whether I really wanted another child. Do I want to bring a child into a world like this or into a family in post-traumatic stress? After all, we've all been through an unimaginable experience here. Am I even capable of it? Is it good for the family? My desire reared its head again a few months after I returned from captivity. I didn't expect it to come so relatively quickly. This is the pregnancy that came after a period of poor nutrition in captivity, drastic weight loss, stress and grief. I'll be honest and say that I didn't even get my period for months. Everything together wasn't in my favor. I was surprised, and it only made me feel like it was the right thing that had to happen. The pregnancy is one of the miracles that happened to me in the last year, alongside the difficult things.' Did you feel you could? 'Yes. I think I'm strong. If I do something, it's a sign that I can do it. For my daughters, Raz (6) and Aviv (4), it will bring a lot of good. They are crazy excited about the birth, which is expected in February, and they are looking forward to it. There is no joy from me with all the complexity of the matter. It will do good for the girls and the whole family.' Katz was released from captivity with her daughters on November 24, 2023, in the first phase of the hostage deal, after 49 days in Gaza. During the kidnapping to Gaza, her mother, the late Efrat Katz, was killed by fire from an Air Force helicopter. Her brother, the late Ravid Katz, a member of Kibbutz Nir Oz's standby security squad, fought to defend the community and was murdered at the age of 51. His body was kidnapped to Gaza and rescued in July. She is already in her eighth month, and has not yet made any special preparations for the birth. She has not bought any clothes or equipment, nor has she asked to know the sex of the fetus. 'Right now, leaving a little mystery is good for me,' she says. 'If I had gotten pregnant before October 7, I would have obviously known the sex of the fetus and I would already have all the baby equipment. In the past, I had to have the clothes folded in drawers, and have lists of all the equipment and what was needed in an Excel file. That doesn't exist now. Something has been released. The need for order and organization no longer drives me. I haven't been to a single baby store yet. I'm also not thinking about names yet. 'This pregnancy is different from previous ones. The body and mind are busy with the hostages. I pray every evening that my late mother's husband, Gadi Mozes, who spent his 80th birthday in captivity, will be able to be in Israel on the day of the birth. In December 2023, Islamic Jihad released a video of Gadi, a sign of life. Since then, we have known nothing.' Didn't choose to be famous A month and a half ago, Yoni Asher, Doron's estranged husband, published a personal and open post on his Facebook account, announcing that he and his wife were separating. My first meeting with Doron, which took place in their beautiful home on a moshav in Sharon, took place just before the announcement of the separation. In our second meeting, Doron pats her stomach, is silent for a moment, and confirms things in a matter-of-fact manner. 'It's true,' she admits, 'Yoni and I decided to break up. It's not easy for me, but I will be okay and the family will be okay. The girls remain in first place for us. However, I choose to keep the circumstances of our separation within the four walls of our home. I am a private person, I did not choose to become a well-known woman in the public eye, it happened out of necessity. At least I still want to keep my personal life to myself and remain as clean as possible in the process. It's not easy for all of us. Life is complex and full of surprises, good and bad, and we have to do our best.' What can you say? 'A breakup is an emotional roller coaster and it's not a pretty thing, but for me, no matter what happened and what happens between us, we are a family, and soon we will become five. That won't change. For the sake of the children, we will always remain a family, with kindness and a smile. Even though it's difficult now, I hope we're headed for a better future.' In her life before October 7, Doron Katz- Asher, 35, was an accountant who worked for the real estate company Api Properties. If all goes well, she is expected to return to her office after maternity leave. Her managers are waiting for her and supporting her throughout this difficult year. 'I tried to go back to work a little bit recently,' she says, 'it was kind of a kick-starting attempt. I came to the office once a week. Can I tell you it was successful? Unfortunately not. I can't concentrate. Returning to a routine of home-work-children when Gadi is in the tunnels is very difficult for me. I try to come once a week. It's meaningful for me to get dressed and leave the house. I hope that after maternity leave things will look different.' Tell me about your feelings during the kidnapping. I was in some kind of emotional disconnect. You just want to stay alive, protect your daughters, and you don't understand that this is the situation you're in. When we got to Gaza, we entered the Hamas headquarters, which had hundreds of people inside. I was wounded and asked for a doctor because I wouldn't stop bleeding, and I lost consciousness twice. Then I saw that Aviv was wounded in the leg. She didn't speak from the shock. 'A car with a man and a woman in it was waiting for us outside, and after a few minutes we arrived at their house. My body was exhausted. I could barely climb the stairs. They brought in their son, who apparently worked as a paramedic, to check on me. He asked to stitch up my wounds, without anesthesia, of course. I didn't know how I would react to the pain, and I asked my daughters to move to the far end of the room, but they were so scared they wouldn't leave me. It made me feel restrained when they stitched up my wounds, despite the excruciating pain.' After 16 days, they were transferred to another place. 'We were woken up in the middle of the night and told to leave quickly, because the IDF announced that it was bombing the house. We went out into the street. It was one of the scariest moments. I was afraid that the girls would speak Hebrew, that they would cry, that something would go wrong and that we would be lynched in the middle of the street.

There we met other hostages, most of whom have already been released today, except for David Cunio. We were there for 33 days in terrible hygienic conditions and extreme hunger. My daughters defecated in the room's wastebasket, because the toilet was locked, we had to knock on the door and girls that age can't help themselves. There was a terrible smell in the room and they were sick several times. Sometimes they brought me something to bring down the fever and sometimes they simply told me to put them under a stream of cold water. They gave us half a pita a day each. I was hungry and the girls cried because they were hungry. I tried to move their sleep until the later hours, because we knew that in the morning there would be no food, so I wanted them to get up in the middle of the day and not feel hungry for many hours.' How did you communicate to your daughters what was happening? 'I told them that we are now with good people who will take care of us, and as soon as we can we will return home. To this day they ask me why Gadi isn't coming home and if all the bad guys are already in prison.' How are they today? 'Aviv and Raz are in a full and good routine of kindergarten, friends, enrichment classes and birthday parties. Everything a normal child does. Acclimating at home took time. It's not that there aren't any difficulties, they talk about the captivity as if it were yesterday. It's present in the house and we don't hide it and sweep it under the rug. They have great mental resilience. Although Aviv was very small, she remembers what wounded her and where she was and the names of the terrorists who guarded us in the hospital. They say, 'My dear, shwaye shwaye (slowly, slowly in Arabic),' and they also write in Arabic sometimes. It doesn't scare me. Today they already speak in the lexicon of 'we were kidnapped,' 'Grandpa Gadi is in Gaza,' 'The bad guys killed Grandma and Uncle Ravid.'' We are just before a new year. What do you wish for yourself? 'I can't wish myself anything good right now. I hope the new year begins with the 100 hostages at home with us, some for rehabilitation and some for burial. Until that happens, we're stuck on October 7. This won't be a new year for me, and it won't be possible to talk about a resurrection.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sjt00ufg8jg	2024-12-31T13:24:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/ByeGG7icB1x/ByeGG7icB1x_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Security cabinet meeting scrapped, Katz to discuss alternatives t...	Netanyahu insists neither Hamas nor Palestinian Authority have governing role in Gaza including distribution of humanitarian aid; official says Israel considering options for governing body Amid the stalemate in negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal, the security cabinet scheduled to meet this week has been postponed until Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recovers from surgery to remove his prostate gland. Defense Minister Israel Katz will convene a meeting with members of the government on Thursday and will discuss the day after the war and an alternative rule of the Strip to Hamas. The obstacles to the talks remain the number of hostages that would be released in the first phase of the deal, with Israel demanding twice as many Israeli captives than Hamas has agreed to free. The terror group claims Israel is demanding the release of soldiers and wounded men although they do not comply with the criteria for the humanitarian exchange. The would agree to hand over bodies of dead hostages if a deal is made. Another major obstacle is the demand to end the war. Security officials warned the government that Hamas was rebuilding its control of Gaza. Hours later a 'senior official' said that according to Netanyahu, even if a deal is made, Israel would return to the fighting in Gaza until it achieves its declared goals. That statement was an Israel admission from the senior official that Israel was heading toward a partial release of hostages that would not include an end to the war as Hamas demands, before all the hostages would be released. The prime minister is in the opinio0n that there can be no plan for the day after the war until all of Hamas's capabilities are destroyed,' the official said adding that there have been discussions in the appropriate forums on the matter.

Lebanon to chose its president two years after Aoun resignation	After Hezbollah suffers defeats in the war against Israel and is weakened politically, the path to electing a president appears clear ending years of political stalemate Lebanon will appoint a new president on January nine two years after the resignation of Michel Aoun and as no agreement could be reached on who should replace him. The Hezbollah insisted on naming the next president, leading the country to a political stalemate. But after the Shiite political party and the terror group that is its military wing, suffered crushing blows in the war against Israel, the path to electing a replacement to Aoun, may be clear. According to Lebanese law, the president must be a member of the Maronite Christian community while the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament from the Shiite sector. A power sharing agreement was devised to ensure Lebanon's 18 recognized religious groups can coexist. Its 128 Parliamentary seats are divided equally between Muslims and Christians and a president must be supported by a two-thirds majority. Aoun who has been out of office since October 2022 said in an interview last week that there was still no agreement and none of the candidates have the majority support. Among the prominent names under consideration is Joseph Aoun, who is currently the chief of the Lebanese military. He is responsible for deploying his forces along the border with Israel, under the cease-fire agreement signed in October. He is considered close to the West and therefore rejected by Hezbollah. Suleiman Frangieh who heads the Marda Party, formerly one of Lebanon's armed militias, is the favored candidate for the Shi'ite group and is also supported by Hezbollah's ally from the Amal Party, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. But after Hezbollah's losses, his chances have reduced. According to a member of parliament for Hezbollah, if Frangieh pulls out of the race, other names may be considered. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Samir Jaja led the Christian militias during Lebanon's years-long civil war.

After the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, Jaja called on Hezbollah to disarm and deliver its weapons to Lebanon's army. 'The game is over,' he said of the terror group. Another recurring candidate is George Huri, a former senior military officer who also served as Lebanon's ambassador to the Vatican.

US imposes sanctions on entities in Iran, Russia over election in...	Iran and Russia have targeted election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns, treasury says The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on entities in Iran and Russia, accusing them of attempting to interfere in the 2024 U.S. election. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement the entities - a subsidiary of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and an organization affiliated with Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) - aimed to 'stoke socio-political tensions and influence the U.S. electorate during the 2024 U.S. election'. 'The Governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns,' Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. 'The United States will remain vigilant against adversaries who would undermine our democracy.' Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York and Russia's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Republican Donald Trump was elected president in November, beating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House. The Treasury said the Cognitive Design Production Center planned influence operations since at least 2023 designed to incite tensions among the electorate on behalf of the IRGC. The Treasury accused the Moscow-based Center for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) of circulating disinformation about candidates in the election as well as directing and subsidizing the creation of deepfakes. The Treasury said CGE also manipulated a video to produce 'baseless accusations concerning a 2024 vice presidential candidate.' It did not specify which candidate was targeted. The Moscow-based center, at the direction of the GRU, used generative AI tools to quickly create disinformation distributed across a network of websites that were designed to look like legitimate news outlets, the Treasury said. It accused the GRU of providing financial support to CGE and a network of U.S.-based facilitators in order to build and maintain its AI-support server and maintain a network of at least 100 websites used in its disinformation operations. CGE's director was also hit with sanctions in Tuesday's action.

IDF seals off Gaza hospital used at terror base	Forces say Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, used as a Hamas terror hub; Over 600 civilians, 240 militants arrested, and 20 killed, on top of weapons, explosives and tunnels found at al-Shifa Hospital during similar operations; world press claims forceful evacuation of innocents The IDF has sealed off the Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya on Tuesday, in an unusual move and amid international criticism after concluding its military operation there over the weekend. In previous instances when Israeli forces raided hospitals in the Gaza Strip, operations were allowed to resume and in the Al Shifa Hospital, Hamas recently carried out extensive renovations. IDF evacuated hundreds of patients and staff from the large medical facility to the Indonesian Hospital, also located in northern Gaza. 'The hospital had become a Hamas terror base. We precisely and carefully evacuated about 600 civilians while thoroughly screening for militants,' said an IDF spokesperson following the takeover of the site last weekend. 'Combat soldiers from the 401st Brigade, operating under the 162nd Brigade and Unit 504, completed a focused counterterrorism operation at Kamal Adwan Hospital, arresting more than 240 militants, eliminated 20, and neutralized powerful explosives planted at the site.' The forces conducting the operation launched a swift and covert raid, surrounding the building located in the heart of the camp in less than an hour. As expected, the operation drew sharp international criticism, with major global newspapers and news outlets extensively covering the event. For example, the BBC headline read: 'Israel forcefully evacuates Gaza Hospital and arrests medical staff.' The report emphasized that the hospital director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, was arrested by Israel on suspicion of being a Hamas operative, 'without providing evidence' against him. The British broadcaster also cited the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health regarding the number of fatalities in the hospital area as of Friday: '50 people, including hospital staff, were killed in airstrikes.' The New York Times reported under the headline: 'IDF forces patients and medical staff to leave hospital in Northern Gaza.' A nurse working at the hospital told the American newspaper that Israeli soldiers instructed female staff and patients to leave the hospital, without immediately giving the same order to the men. > Al-Shifa Medical Center, Gaza's main hospital, which was recently renovated, underwent the most extensive raid during the war. In its vicinity, more than 200 militants were killed, and hundreds more were arrested. In September, five months after Israeli forces left the hospital, the emergency department at the medical center reopened, where hostages had been held and even murdered. The hospital is currently operating partially. Buildings at al-Shifa Hospital were used as emergency assets for the operations headquarters of Hamas' Gaza City Brigade. Additionally, during the fighting, weapons and other equipment were moved to the hospital's underground floors. As part of the IDF's activities in the hospital area, numerous weapons were discovered in the MRI building within the hospital complex, as well as an operational tunnel shaft next to a weapons-laden pickup truck. Furthermore, in the cardiology department, a weapons storage room, ammunition, and an interrogation room were found. In the physiotherapy department, explosive devices were discovered, and in the Qatari building, another explosive device and communication equipment were found. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk7bc9zlkx	2024-12-31T09:27:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/B12FfEkIJl/B12FfEkIJl_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

The Israeli tourist, described in Mexico as a young man in his 20s, was planning to fly to Europe. The drugs were discovered hidden in his suitcases during an X-ray inspection. The tourist had arrived in Mexico on a flight from Rome, but authorities remain uncertain whether the drugs were intended for Italy’s capital or another European city. Photos shared by Mexican customs authorities show two packages wrapped in adhesive tape and filled with pink pills. > In August, indictments were filed against nine individuals for smuggling over 728 lbs. of cocaine, valued at millions, and 6.6 lbs. of methamphetamine from Costa Rica to Israel on two occasions. The drugs were concealed in furniture and a vehicle that were shipped to the Port of Haifa aboard a cargo ship. Five of the suspects were charged with drug importation and trafficking offenses, while four others—members of the same family—were charged with money laundering offenses. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1gwyc11uyg	2024-12-31T08:24:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/B1lY3bDbUJx/B1lY3bDbUJx_0_0_992_558_0_small.jpg
A look at the Israelis spying for Iran in 2024	A dozen cases of espionage include carrying out missions for Iranian handlers in exchange for payment; ynet looks at the suspects and the charges they face They stormed into our lives a few months ago and, like mushrooms after the rain, spies of all ages from all sectors of society have been popping up the length and breadth of the country. Collaborating primarily with Iranian agents, they’ve become weekly Israeli news items. eeeee A judicial system source tells Ynet that, due to the suspected spies’ danger to the public, as soon as the interrogations become public, indictments are filed so as to keep them in judicial custody until the conclusion of legal proceedings. The police then spend months gathering further evidence to build a legal case for sentencing which, for serious espionage offences, ranges from six to 12 years. Ynet's examination reveals that the exceedingly high fees charged by lawyers for espionage cases mean defendants from lower socio-economic backgrounds have been unable to obtain lawyers to represent them and their families are still trying to raise money for their defense. In recent weeks, judges have requesteefd tehat, for cases that need to move forward, lawyers from the Public Defense should be appointed to represent suspects and defendants. Like Eli Feldstein and the NCO, arrested as part of the classified documents affair, the detainees are currently being held in solitary confinement in harsh conditions, unable to talk to their families. In recent weeks, judges have requested that, for cases that need to move forward, lawyers from the Public Defense should be appointed to represent suspects and defendants. Like Eli Feldstein and the NCO, arrested as part of the classified documents affair, the detainees are currently being held in solitary confinement in harsh conditions, unable to talk to their families. Espionage Cells exposed in Israel So Far An espionage cell uncovered this year in its full glory, included a 72-year-old father of four from Ashkelon named Motti Maman, who had always earned is living by questionable means. The affair publicized September 19 of this year, and a spy like Motti Maman, took entire nation by surprise. The same day, the State Attorney filed an indictment against Maman at the Beersheva District Court, charging him with offences against state security by contacting a foreign agent and entering an enemy country without permission. According to the indictment, Maman communicated, on Iranian soil, with local agents operating on behalf of the Islamic Republic’s intelligence agencies. He entered Iran twice and, in meetings with the Iranian agents, discussed the possibility of carrying out terrorist attacks in Israeli territory, partly amid the Ayatollah’s regimes desire to avenge the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Maman is currently held at Shikma Prison in particularly harsh conditions, 'like those of the Nukhba terrorists' according to his lawyer, Eyal Besserglick who, in recent months, has repeatedly appealed to the court to alleviate Maman’s conditions due to his poor health ensuing from his prolonged detainment. In the second case, revealed October 14, indictments were filed against Ramat Gan residents Vladislav Victorsson (30) and his partner, Anna Bernstein (18). Victorsson communicated with an Iranian official and, at the Iranian’s instruction, carried out various missions such as interring money and burning cars for which he even recruited another person alongside his partner Anna. According to the interrogation, at the instruction of the Iranian official, and while aware of his identity, Vladislav carried out various missions including spray-painting graffiti, putting up posters, and burying money. Vladislav even agreed to carry out a mission to assassinate an Israeli public figure by throwing a hand grenade at his house, and made efforts to procure weapons including a sniper-gun, pistols and pepper spray grenades. Victorsson and Bernstein are accused of offences of contact with a foreign agent, vandalism, arson and conspiracy to cause malicious damage. Victorsson is also charged with committing a terrorist act and conspiracy to commit murder. The third case, revealed a week later, October 11, involved seven Israelis who had made Aliya from Azerbaijan, including a father and son, suspected of communicating for two years with Islamic Republic officials. The seven suspects photographed army bases that were also targets in the ballistic missile attack from Iran last month. Some of the seven suspects were caught in the act of following an Israeli official they are suspected of planning to kill. Four days following their arrests, an indictment was filed against the seven suspects from Haifa and the north who include a deserted soldier and two teenage boys. The suspects are: Aziz Nisanov (43) who was the cell leader, his son Yigal Nisan (20), Alexander Sadykov (58), Vyacheslav Gushchin (48), and Yevgeny Yoffe (47), and, as mentioned, two 16- and 17-year-old teenagers whose names cannot be published. The seven are accused of a series of serious security offences. The fourth case, made public October 22, involved the arrest of seven young men aged 19-23 from Beit Zafafa, Jerusalem, on suspicion of carrying out espionage activities for Iran over a several month period. Their chief mission was the assignment of assassinating an Israeli nuclear scientist and an Israeli mayor. The prime suspect is 23-year-old Rami Alian, who admitted that he knew the operator was Iranian, and that he was proud to have been contacted by the agent. Alian was in contact with a foreign agent and was asked to carry out various missions in Israel. He then recruited further members to the cell. The seven suspects claim to have acted for nationalist reasons, but also received money for their deeds. The day after their arrest, they were indicted under the 'aiding the enemy in wartime' clause. The fifth incident, for which an indictment was filed against Asher Binyamin Wiess from Bnei Brak, October 11, for following an Israeli nuclear scientist with the intention of assassinating him at the direction of Iranian agents. He is accused of offences of contact with a foreign agent, conveying information to the enemy and obstruction of justice. According to the indictment, Wiess, at the instruction of the Iranian agent, used a go-pro camera to photograph the scientist’s car and home. The Iranian agent then sent the picture to a young man from East Jerusalem assigned to the assassination. Wiess was indicted two weeks ago. In the detention extension hearing, Wiess said that he was being held in solitary confinement in substandard conditions and that he is not permitted to talk to his family or conduct his prayers as a religious man. Wiess’s family haven’t found him private legal representation at this time. As mentioned, lawyers demand vast sums to represent suspects involved in such incidents, that the family cannot afford. The court extended Wiess’s detention by two weeks and instructed appointing a lawyer from the Public Defense. The sixth incident, also exposed October 31, involves Rafael (32) and Lala Guliyev (29) from Lod, allegedly conducting missions on behalf of the Iranians and recruiting 'Israelis in Israel from Caucasus countries.' GSS and police investigations reveal that Guliyev was recruited by Elshan (Elkhan) Agayev (56), an Azerbaijani-born operator working for Iranian intelligence. The incitement against the Lod couple charges the two with communicating with Iranian agents since 2021 with the purpose of aiding the enemy in a war against Israel and harming state security. According to the indictment, the couple received a cumulative sum of $26,000 and were charged on the day of their arrest. The seventh incident was publicized December 6, over a month later. Tahrir Safadi (21) from Mas'ade on the Golan Heights was charged with serious espionage offences. His father, Bassem Safadi who connected his son with the spies, was also arrested and questioned. Software Engineering student Tahrir was, in recent years, involved in gathering intelligence regarding IDF activities, which was then handed over to Hussam as-Salam Tawfiq Zidan, a Damascus-based journalist working with the Iranian state-owned Al-Alam News Network, who has been working in recent years for the Iranian Quds Force’s Palestine Branch, designed to assist Palestinian organizations promote terrorist activity against Israeli citizens. Artium Zolotrav (33) from Nof Hagalil was arrested as part of the eighth incident on suspicion of committing security offences involving contact with Iranian security officials and carrying out security missions in exchange for money. The Nazareth District Court later indicted him for offences of contact with a foreign agent, arson and vandalism. The security agencies’ investigation reveals that a connection was made as early as this October between Zolotrav and a character known as 'Eliad' who suggested Zolotrav carry out graffiti anti-government spray-painting missions so as to change public perception in Israeli civilian life. During the ninth incident, exposed December 1, Erdler Israel Amoyal, (23) from Jerusalem was arrested for allegedly communicating with Iranian intelligence officials and conducting security missions in Israel at their instruction, in exchange for money. GSS investigations reveal that Amoyal had been communicating with Iranian intelligence officials over social media. It was further learned that he was communicating with a profile using the handle 'Arianna,' who later transferred him to 'John,' who became his handler. The investigation also reveals that, despite Amoyal realizing at the outset of communication that the 'John' was an Iranian agent, he agreed, at his direction, to carry out intelligence-gathering missions that included photographing an address and pray-painting graffiti. Amoyal took photographs of a pamphlet reading 'Making Peace' at various Jerusalem and Tel Aviv locations. He is expected to be indicted at the Jerusalem District Court. In the tenth incident, Mohammed Saadi (19) from Nazareth was indicted on charges of contact with a foreign agent. Saadi was arrested on suspicion of conveying information to Hezbollah officials in wartime. Police and GSS investigations reveal that he had approached Hezbollah several times in recent years and even asked to join its ranks in combat. Saadi also contacted Hezbollah affiliated Al-Manar TV Lebanon, and asked if could provide them with pictures and videos, including during the war. The investigation further reveals that Saada conveyed information regarding locations of missile landings, aircraft movement, and the location of IDF forces. The eleventh incident was made public December 22. Abed Al-Salam (33) and Taar Asili (35) were indicted by the State Attorney on charges of contact with a Hezbollah operative and transferring information to a terrorist organization in wartime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to indictment filed at the Jerusalem District Court, the accused made contact with a woman named Dianna through a Watsapp group, and shared with her information about Israel, even after they knew she was a Hezbollah operative.

The State Attorney requested the court extend the detention of the two accused men until the conclusion of legal procedures.

Authorities allege he burned vehicles, photographed sensitive sites, filmed the home of MK Benny Gantz and sent images to Iranian handlers. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzn8cb8ke	2024-12-31T08:02:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/BJgfo1ExN1l/BJgfo1ExN1l_0_58_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Australia, New Zealand welcome in 2025	Fireworks lite up the skies in Kiribati, New Zealand, and Australia as the world says goodbye to 2024, a year marked by record heat, wars, and global upheaval Around the world, people are saying goodbye to 2024 on Tuesday and welcoming 2025 with celebrations and dazzling fireworks displays. The year 2024, the hottest in recorded history, was overshadowed by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, upheavals in the Middle East and the U.S. presidential election, which concluded with Donald Trump’s victory. As is tradition, the first to count down to the new year were the island nations in the South Pacific. In Kiribati, one of these islands, 2025 began at 12:00 PM (Israel time). An hour later, following Tonga and Samoa, the new year arrived in New Zealand—the first major country to welcome 2025. In Auckland, a spectacular fireworks display lit up the sky above the Sky Tower, the tallest building in the country, drawing massive crowds to witness the celebration. At 2:00 PM, the new year reached Australia’s east coast. In Sydney, the celebrations began early: three hours before midnight, fireworks already illuminated the sky over the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge as part of the city’s main event. Sydney, which proudly calls itself the 'New Year’s Eve Capital of the World,' used nine tons of fireworks for its display. Estimates suggested that over one million people gathered to watch the show in person. Later in the afternoon, the new year will reach countries across Asia, with Japan and South Korea welcoming 2025 at 4:00 PM. As evening turns to night, Europe will count down to midnight and celebrate with cheers and kisses as the clock strikes twelve. > By Wednesday morning, the new year will arrive in the United States. At 7:00 AM (Israel time), the traditional dropping of the giant crystal ball will take place in Times Square, New York, marking the start of 2025 in America. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byd00lfwike	2024-12-31T06:58:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/rJPbqLW8yx/rJPbqLW8yx_272_381_2366_1332_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu leaves hospital to save coalition bill	Against advice of his doctors, prime minister arrives to cast a critical vote to increase government revenue in 2024 budget; another member of the coalition in mourning for his mother also arrives to support bill Against advice of doctors Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, left his hospital bed to attend a vote in the Knesset that his coalition stood to lose. Netanyahu had surgery on Sunday to remove his prostate gland and was to spend the next days recovering. The vote, part of the coalition's efforts to increase revenue in the 2024 budget, finally passed with a small majority after the prime minister was on hand to cast his vote and another member of his coalition, who was in mourning for his mother, was called in.

The crisis began when National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said his party would vote against the proposed bill unless his demand for additional funds for his ministry are provided. He was joined by the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism Party which demanded assurances that a law exempting Haredi men from military service, be advanced. Earlier the coalition approved millions in budgetary allotments to Haredi institutions and West Bank settlements in last minute additions to the budget that were delivered to lawmakers late on Monday night and were therefore not properly reviewed or discussed, despite opposition outrage while funds for reserve soldiers were cut.

U.S. led coalition strikes Yemeni capital Sanaa in six waves of attack according to media reports; Senior member of rebel group says targets were civilian or empty instillations Yemen's Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said that the country would continue to defend itself after several U.S. strikes targeted facilities in the capital Sanaa on Tuesday. The U.S. military said that it carried out strikes against Houthi targets in Sanaa and coastal locations in Yemen on Monday and Tuesday.

You’re almost home': Emotional call between hostage IDF soldier ...	Over a year after her rescue from Gaza, Shin Bet recording reveals operative comforting Ori Magidish in her first moments out of captivity; 'You're brave, one of a kind. Your parents are waiting'; a trembling Magidish softly replies, 'I'm okay' More than a year after her dramatic rescue from captivity in Gaza, a recording of the moments following the release of Israeli soldier Ori Magidish has been made public. The recording, unveiled on Tuesday, highlights the emotional exchange between Magidish and a Shin Bet operative after her rescue during a ground operation in Gaza. Magidish, the first hostage freed during Israel’s October 2023 campaign, was rescued 23 days after being abducted by Hamas terrorists from her post at Nahal Oz, where she served as a lookout. Just four months after her release, Magidish made the decision to re-enlist in the military, joining the Intelligence Corps. In the newly revealed recording, a Shin Bet operative reassures Magidish during the moments after her rescue: 'Ori, dear, you're in good hands. The team got you out—we’re bringing you home. You’re incredible and brave. Well done. Soon, there will be a big hug waiting for you.' Speaking from the operations control room, the operative added, 'Your parents, Chaim and Margalit, are waiting for you. You’re almost home. You’re amazing.' A clearly shaken Magidish responded quietly, 'Yes, I’m okay.' Shin Bet officials explained their decision to assign a female operative to speak with Magidish immediately after her rescue. The operative works in the organization’s Special Operations Division. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Magidish’s remarkable journey led to her being chosen as one of the torchbearers during Israel’s most recent Independence Day ceremony. Before lighting the torch, she dedicated it to her fellow lookouts: 'To my comrades who defended the borders then and continue to protect them now. To all those who made my rescue possible. Even in the darkness I experienced, I knew you would come for me.' Following her release, Magidish spoke about the strength she drew during her time in captivity. 'I believe in God. I knew He was with me and would save me. I prayed every day—not from a prayer book, but from my heart. I felt the presence of my late grandmother, grandfather, and cousin. I clung to their memory and trusted that I would be freed, whether through a deal or a rescue mission. I believed in my country and my army, and that belief gave me strength to keep going.' She also described an unshakable intuition that her rescue was imminent. 'I can’t explain it, but I knew they were coming that day. I knew they wouldn’t leave me behind. I was overwhelmed when I saw them.' Since her release, rumors have swirled about her ordeal, but Magidish has returned to a semblance of normalcy, even resuming military service. Her mother, Maggie, dismissed the speculation, saying: 'Just because she’s not in perfect condition doesn’t mean she’s broken. People have said everything from claiming she was a Shin Bet plant to labeling us a crime family. They even questioned her appearance, asking how her nails could look manicured after captivity.' Acknowledging the challenges, Maggie added, 'Ori is living her life like any young woman her age, but, of course, no one returns from captivity unchanged. She lost friends there... It’s a harsh reality we’re still living because the war continues. But we know we’re incredibly fortunate. What happened to us is nothing short of a miracle.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj00z9wwljx	2024-12-31T04:24:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/08/Skk0ezFMR/Skk0ezFMR_1_366_954_537_0_small.jpg

Drones to Eilat, the Arava and the Golan: A year of daily attacks...	Iran-aligned Iraqi militias launched yearlong drone and missile strikes on Eilat and the Golan, killing 2 Israeli soldiers; framing the attacks as support for Gaza, Israel avoided retaliating in Iraq, leaving the response to the US, which also faced losses Iraq officially announced Monday that pro-Iranian militias operating from its territory have ceased their attacks on Israel, at least for now. From strikes on U.S. bases in retaliation for American support of Israel, to the bombardment of a so-called 'Mossad headquarters' in Kurdistan, the targeting of Eilat as a key site for strikes and a deadly drone attack in the Golan Heights—this is how Iraq’s front in the Iron Swords War unfolded step by step. A ‘proxy war’ against the US The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iranian-backed militias, began their campaign on October 17, 2023, with a series of strikes targeting U.S. bases. These attacks were framed as a response to American support for Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Rockets and drones targeted the Ain al-Assad air base in western Iraq, home to U.S. and foreign troops. The next day, October 18, more than 20 people were injured in a drone attack launched from Iraq on the Al-Tanf base in Syria. By October 23, U.S. President Joe Biden abruptly left a press conference after reports of simultaneous strikes on three American bases in Iraq. Over the following months, more than 100 attacks were launched from Iraq against U.S. bases and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. On December 22, 2023, after the IDF published footage of a drone intercepted over Lebanese waters en route to Israel, Iraqi militias claimed responsibility for an attempted attack on the Karish offshore gas platform. The IDF did not confirm who launched the drone, and no damage was reported to the platform. Throughout the war, Iraq’s militias, positioning themselves as an additional front in Iran’s axis against Israel 'in support of Gaza,' issued numerous statements claiming responsibility for alleged drone and cruise missile launches against Israeli targets. They asserted strikes on 'critical sites' in Tel Aviv, Haifa Bay, Ashdod, the Dead Sea and other areas. However, no evidence was provided, and no interceptions or damages were reported.

How did Jimmy Carter go from peacemaker to critic of Israel?	Gerald Steinberg, CEO of NGO Monitor, says former U.S. President Jimmy Carter left behind a complex legacy Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who played a pivotal role in brokering the historic Israel-Egypt peace treaty at Camp David in 1978, left behind a complex legacy, according to Gerald Steinberg, CEO of NGO Monitor. Speaking to ILTV, Steinberg highlighted Carter’s significant contributions to the peace process, which established lasting peace between Israel and Egypt, but also noted the tensions and difficulties Carter faced with Israeli leaders, including Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Rabin. Steinberg also addressed Carter's later criticism of Israel, attributing it to his frustration with Israeli policies and his embrace of Palestinian narratives, which led to strained relationships with Israeli leaders in his post-presidency years.

Yemeni activist: Israel's actions against Houthis help save the r...	Luai Ahmed: 'The Islamic regime in Iran hates Arabs, Muslims, and Yemenis and Lebanese' When Israel targets the Houthis, it is ultimately saving the Yemeni people, according to Luai Ahmed, a Yemeni activist. Speaking to ILTV on Monday, Ahmed explained that many in the Middle East fail to realize the broader benefits of Israel's actions against terrorism. He emphasized that eliminating terrorist threats improves the region as a whole. 'A lot of people think that we should not kill terrorists,' Ahmed said. 'They think we should try to negotiate with them, but Israel has been trying to do that for the longest time and this is the only option that it has right now, is to attack back and defend itself.' Ahmed likened Iran to the head of an octopus, with the Houthis as one of its many tentacles. He underscored how the Islamic regime in Iran manipulates groups like the Houthis to further its agenda. 'The Islamic regime in Iran hates Arabs, Muslims, and Yemenis and Lebanese. They don't care. They're only using us to further their agenda,' Ahmed said. 'Their agenda is Islamic occupation. We see this Islamic occupation in Lebanon, in Yemen, in Gaza, and what they want is exactly what is written in the Houthi slogan: Death to America. Death to Israel. Now, if that is your slogan, death, there is no way that you're going to be able to create a prosperous society.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjfryszujx	2024-12-31T01:44:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/HkW11iBbLJl/HkW11iBbLJl_0_0_939_532_0_small.jpg

3 A.M. sirens in central Israel: The growing threat of the Houthi...	Comment: The Houthi problem is not just Israel’s problem, the U.S., U.K. and others should get involved Sirens warning of incoming ballistic missiles have become a nightly reality for millions of Israelis in central Israel over the past week. These attacks come from the Houthis in Yemen—a fanatical group disrupting vital shipping routes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since 2023, choking global trade and harming economies worldwide. Yet during the Gaza war, anti-Israel demonstrators in the West have been seen cheering for them on campuses. Why? And who are these Houthis? Who Are the Houthis? The Houthis are a Shia Muslim extremist group in Yemen, founded in the 1990s and led by Abdul Malik al-Houthi. They are notorious for their egregious human rights violations: using child soldiers and child brides, targeting civilians, employing human shields, executing members of the LGBTQ+ community, taking hostages, and enforcing gender apartheid against women. This group is defined by its murderous ideology and oppressive practices. Their official slogan and flag declare: 'Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews.' Backed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Houthis serve as a deadly proxy in Tehran’s campaign of destabilization and occupation throughout the Middle East. The Iranian regime has provided the Houthis with funding, weapons, and resources, enabling them to attack not only their neighbors but also nations far beyond the region—including Israel, the U.S., and the U.K. The Cost of Iranian Backing Iran’s influence plunged Yemen into a brutal civil war, resulting in one of the worst famines in modern history. The Houthis have exacerbated this crisis by using starvation as a deliberate weapon. Thanks to Iranian support, the Houthis have gained unprecedented territory and power, threatening Yemen's government and stability. Since October 7, the Houthis have turned their focus to destroying the State of Israel. They have fired an increasing number of drones and ballistic missiles at Israeli civilians, attacked U.S., U.K., and commercial ships in the Red Sea, and killed British and American soldiers. These attacks, carried out under the guise of 'solidarity' with Palestinians, are cheered on by uninformed college students in the West. A Global Problem Demands a Global Solution The Houthi problem is not just Israel’s problem. That is why the U.S., U.K., and Israeli forces have targeted Houthi strongholds. Despite these efforts, the Houthis remain the last proxy standing in the region. How can a country defeat the Houthis when even bombing them into the Stone Age might not be effective? After all, they already live there. Like Hezbollah and Hamas, Houthi leaders must be targeted, and their capabilities must be eradicated. But the only lasting solution is to cut off the head of the snake: the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian regime is the lifeline of Houthi atrocities and aggression. Eliminating this regime is not just a moral imperative—it’s a strategic necessity. Doing so would restore stability and hope to Yemen, Iran, and the entire Middle East.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1pimh11l1x	2024-12-31T01:15:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/31/yk13657783/yk13657783_59_0_1239_697_0_small.jpg

Putin marks 25 years in power: How the tsar crushed all his rival...	Twenty-five years after Boris Yeltsin named a little-known Vladimir Putin as his successor, the once-perceived puppet has solidified his rule; having stabilized Russia after the chaos of the '90s and built a middle class, Putin remains unchallenged despite setbacks in Ukraine President Vladimir Putin marks 25 years in power on Tuesday—a quarter century as Russia's undisputed leader during turbulent times, shaping not only domestic affairs but also significantly influencing the international arena. Putin's rise to power was unexpected. On December 31, 1999, then-President Boris Yeltsin shocked Russians preparing to celebrate the New Year and the turn of the millennium by announcing his resignation during a brief televised address. As required by Russia's constitution, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who had been in office for just four and a half months and previously served as head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) for 13 months, stepped in as acting president until elections were held a few months later. Given Putin's current status and image, it’s hard to believe that he was a relatively obscure figure at the time—not only to most Russians but also to many within government circles. His rapid ascent was largely due to Yeltsin’s declining health, which severely impacted his ability to govern. As a result, real power was wielded by a group of oligarchs known as 'The Family,' which included Boris Berezovsky, his protégé Roman Abramovich, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Mikhail Gusinsky and others. The arrangement was simple: these oligarchs ensured Yeltsin’s reelection in 1996 by financing his campaign and providing overwhelmingly favorable media coverage, and in return, Yeltsin handed over state assets worth immense fortunes for a fraction of their value. Putin, then known primarily in St. Petersburg—where he worked closely with the city’s liberal rising star mayor Anatoly Sobchak and headed the city’s powerful and lucrative Committee for External Relations—and in security and intelligence circles (the 'siloviki'), caught the attention of 'The Family.' Berezovsky even met with Putin during a family vacation in southwestern France. Putin’s relative anonymity worked to his advantage, as Berezovsky and his associates saw him as a gray, manageable figure they could control behind the scenes, extending the status quo of the Yeltsin era. However, they severely underestimated Putin’s capabilities and his ability to consolidate power, proving their assumption that he would be a puppet to be a grave miscalculation. As acting president, Putin secured a decisive victory in Russia's March 26, 2000, presidential election, winning 53% of the vote against Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov's 29%. Immediately after his election, Putin launched a systematic campaign to dismantle the power of oligarchs, severing their ties to influential positions and subordinating them directly to the Kremlin. His message was clear: those who dared to challenge him politically would face severe consequences, while those who aligned with the Kremlin’s interests could retain significant wealth and business influence. Putin’s crackdown included high-profile cases like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, who was imprisoned for years under charges of corruption and tax evasion—widely seen as politically motivated. This strategy consolidated Putin’s domestic authority and sent a stern warning to other power centers, including regional governors, as the Kremlin took full control over their appointments and elections. These moves centralized power in the Kremlin, eliminating regional and political rivals. Not Navalny, not Prigozhin, not the West: Putin’s unshakable grip Much has changed over the years along the Volga and Moscow rivers. Vladimir Putin has solidified his rule while intensifying domestic measures to crush opposition and enacting restrictive laws that have severely impacted civil society. At the same time, he successfully restored Russia's international standing, which had plummeted during the difficult decade of the 1990s and the economic turmoil following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Putin, largely aided by soaring energy prices during his first decade in power, brought substantial revenue into the state coffers and became associated in the eyes of many Russians with the stabilization of the country and the rise of a middle class earning decent wages and enjoying significantly improved living standards. Over the years, Putin has overcome numerous challenges that could have threatened his regime’s stability. These include large-scale opposition protests in Moscow led by Alexei Navalny following the 2011 parliamentary elections; the Western response to the annexation of Crimea and the ensuing international sanctions; widespread protests—beyond just Moscow and St. Petersburg—against the contentious pension reform of 2018; public outrage over Navalny's death in prison; and the anti-war demonstrations that erupted after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Each wave of public dissent only prompted Putin to tighten his grip further, deploying an increasingly powerful and wide-reaching suppression apparatus. This pattern has become especially evident in today’s Russian atmosphere, shaped by the war and strong anti-Western sentiment. Putin has leveraged the war in Ukraine to completely dismantle the remnants of the Russian opposition, freedom of speech and the fragments of civil society that still existed. As a result of these measures, there is now virtually no genuine internal threat to Putin’s leadership. The last individual who posed a significant challenge was Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led an armed rebellion in June 2023, with his Wagner Group fighters marching toward Moscow. The rebellion was ultimately quashed, and Prigozhin himself was killed two months later in a plane crash. Russia in 2025 is a nation starkly different from the one Vladimir Putin inherited in 2000. While economically and militarily stronger in some respects, the country finds itself in a de facto, albeit undeclared, war with the West—a situation teetering on the brink of direct military confrontation, fueled by the ongoing war in Ukraine. Putin’s decision to escalate the invasion of Ukraine aimed to fundamentally alter Russia’s strategic position and restore the influence lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the reality is far more complex. Russia currently occupies over 18% of Ukrainian territory but has endured severe conventional military losses and suffered staggering casualties. The conflict has brought significant strategic setbacks, including the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO, the loss of the European market for Russian oil exports and an increasing dependence on China. Additionally, the war has contributed to the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, a shift in Russian priorities that threatens its strategic air and naval bases along Syria’s coastline—a potential blow to Russia’s influence in the region. Despite these challenges, one lesson from Putin's 25 years in power is clear: writing off his regime prematurely is a mistake. Over the years, particularly in the past three, predictions of his imminent downfall have repeatedly emerged from Western commentators and media. Yet, Putin’s centralized, authoritarian and oppressive system—strengthened significantly in the last decade—has proven resilient. As history has shown, as long as Putin remains in good health, his hold on the Kremlin appears unshakable. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ld2zzi1e	2024-12-30T21:34:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/08/08/9411915/9411915_1_596_980_552_0_small.jpg
South Korea court approves arrest of President Yoon in martial la...	A South Korean court gave authorities approval on Tuesday to arrest President Yoon Suk Yeol after he was impeached and suspended from power for imposing martial law, marking the first time that a sitting president of the country has faced arrest. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) confirmed the Seoul Western District Court approved an arrest warrant requested by investigators examining Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law. Yoon is facing investigation on allegations that he was the leader of an insurrection, one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. Separately, his trial on impeachment is being heard at the Constitutional Court. The arrest warrant for an incumbent president is unprecedented, and deepens the political crisis that has engulfed South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy and a key U.S. ally. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who took over from Yoon as acting president, has also been impeached by parliament, which is dominated by the opposition.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skswww11lkg	2024-12-30T20:29:39-08:00	
Guatemalan authorities on high alert for Lev Tahor members fleein...	Guatemalan authorities rescued 204 members of the Lev Tahor sect, prompting heightened border security with Mexico to prevent cult leaders from fleeing with children; The extremist sect, accused of abuse and trafficking, has a history of evading justice across multiple countries A week and a half after Guatemalan authorities rescued 204 children, teenagers, and women from the compound of the extremist ultra-Orthodox sect Lev Tahor ('Pure Heart'), security at the border with Mexico has been tightened amid concerns that sect leaders may attempt to flee with children into the neighboring country. The rescued individuals are currently being housed in welfare facilities in Guatemala City. A statement sent by the Guatemalan government to Mexico, said: 'Following the rescue of the minors, it is highly likely that this community will attempt to flee to Mexico, particularly to Chiapas, where this sect previously stayed in 1994. Both nations must remain on high alert and work together to prevent those responsible from escaping.' The statement also warned that, in an effort to 'protect their leaders, sect members may try to cross the border into Mexico illegally and blend in with the thousands of undocumented migrants who attempt to reach the United States every day.' A source in Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, within the Department for Latin America and the Caribbean, stated: 'We are on high alert and closely cooperating with Guatemala. Over the past few days, we’ve held several meetings to coordinate border monitoring.' As part of this joint effort against Lev Tahor, both countries agreed to enhance border inspections. Special police forces in Guatemala and Mexico’s National Guard are reinforcing security along the border. Authorities are taking the threat seriously, as the sect’s leaders have a long history of fleeing justice, making it unsurprising if they were to attempt to seek refuge in Mexico. The children, teenagers and women, who reportedly endured severe abuse, were rescued from the sect’s compound in Santa Rosa on December 20. Santa Rosa is a small town located about 60 miles south of Guatemala City. The rescue operation was part of a broader effort to combat human trafficking. Since its establishment in 1988 in Israel, the Lev Tahor sect has been implicated in forced marriages, human trafficking, and child abuse across several countries, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania and, more recently, in North Macedonia and Albania since 2022. The sect is also reportedly active in Kurdistan.

Several sect leaders were arrested and are now serving lengthy prison sentences in the United States. Lev Tahor adheres to strict dietary rules, requiring all food to meet biblical standards. Members only drink milk they can extract themselves from cows they milk, and they produce their own wine. Children are prohibited from eating sweets and are instead limited to homemade chocolate or natural options like fruit, nuts, and seeds. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylutqgukl	2024-12-30T14:08:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/S111yHb8Bke/S111yHb8Bke_140_11_780_439_0_small.jpg

Taliban say they will close all NGOs employing Afghan women	The Taliban say they will close all national and foreign nongovernmental groups in Afghanistan employing women, the latest crackdown on women's rights since they took power in August 2021. The announcement comes two years after they told NGOs to suspend the employment of Afghan women, allegedly because they didn't wear the Islamic headscarf correctly. In a letter published on X Sunday night, the Economy Ministry warned that failure to comply with the latest order would lead to NGOs losing their license to operate in Afghanistan. Itâ€™s the Talibanâ€™s latest attempt to controlor intervenein NGO activity. Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council heard that an increasing proportion of female Afghan humanitarian workers were prevented from doing their work even though relief work remains essential. According to Tom Fletcher, a senior U.N. official, the proportion of humanitarian organizations reporting that their female or male staff were stopped by the Talibanâ€™s morality policehas also increased. The Taliban deny they are stopping aid agencies from carrying out their work or interfering with their activities. They have already barred women from many jobs and most public spaces, and also excluded them from educationbeyond sixth grade. In another development, the Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzadahas ordered that buildings should not have windows looking into places where a woman might sit or stand. According to a four-clause decree posted on X late Saturday, the order applies to new buildings as well as existing ones. The United Nations also called for a reversal of this restriction, Soto Nino-Martinez said. The decree said windows should not overlook or look into areas like yards or kitchens. Where a window looks into such a space then the person responsible for that property must find a way to obscure this view to â€œremove harm,â€ by installing a wall, fence or screen. Municipalities and other authorities must supervise the construction of new buildings to avoid installing windows that look into or over residential properties, the decree added. A spokesman for the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing was not immediately available for comment on Akhundzadaâ€™s instructions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syngyqxlkl	2024-12-30T13:07:07-08:00	
Blossoming romance between Moscow and Tehran puts Israel, US on e...	As Donald Trump prepares for his inauguration, Russia and Iran are finalizing a strategic partnership agreement that will strengthen ties in defense and nuclear technology; Israeli officials fear the deal could significantly accelerate Iran’s progress toward nuclear weapons capability Just before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his return to the White House on January 20, Russia and Iran are reportedly planning to publicly sign a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement. The concern in Israel is that this agreement could lead to the transfer of technology that would assist Iran in developing nuclear weapons. According to reports in Russian media, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is expected to make an official visit to Moscow on January 17, during which he and Russian President Vladimir Putin will sign the agreement, marking a crescendo in the growing closeness between Tehran and Moscow. All this, of course, unfolds against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and the strengthening of the Russia-North Korea-Iran axis, supported by solid Chinese backing. On Thursday, the Iranian Embassy in Moscow confirmed the expected visit of the Iranian president to the Russian capital. In an interview on Sunday with the state news agency Russia Today, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed the anticipated agreement. 'The agreement is intended to legally formalize the unprecedented progress in bilateral relations achieved in recent years and to document their transition to the level of a strategic partnership,' he said. 'Naturally, such a comprehensive document also has an international component,' according to Lavrov. Among other things, it pays special attention to strengthening cooperation for peace and security on regional and global levels and formalizes Moscow and Tehran's desire for closer collaboration in security, defense, counterterrorism and combating extremism, as well as against other common challenges and threats.' Lavrov added that the signing of the agreement 'will open additional opportunities for further expanding the Russian-Iranian partnership in various fields.' An Iranian diplomatic source confirmed to the Russian newspaper Izvestia that the agreement would be signed soon. 'This is a central event in our bilateral relations,' he added. 'We have been working on the agreement for several years. The signing is planned for mid-January. We need this agreement, which will outline the basic principles on which the interaction between our countries is based.' The strategic partnership agreement will have many aspects, but naturally many are focusing on its security dimension, which illustrates the tightening cooperation between the countries against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. Iran is already supplying Russia with short-range ballistic missiles, which Russia uses in its war in Ukraine, and has significantly helped with drones, including assistance in establishing a Russian factory to produce a local version of Iran's Shahed drone. It is highly likely that, as part of the agreement, Tehran will provide Moscow with an upgraded model of drones to aid in continued attacks in Ukraine. One of the key questions that has arisen is what Russia is offering in return for this Iranian assistance. Among other things, there has been talk of accelerating a deal to supply advanced Russian Sukhoi 35 fighter jets to Iran. According to reports in recent months, Iranian pilots have already been trained in Russia to fly the jets as a preparatory stage for their delivery. Russia also is likely to provide Iran with technological knowledge related to missile and military satellite production, along with advanced defense systems like the S-400. However, this is uncertain due to Russia's need for these systems in the ongoing war in Ukraine. One of the most concerning issues for Israel regarding the agreement is Iran's nuclear ambitions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel fears that the agreement could include the transfer of Russian technological knowledge and possibly even critical components for the production of nuclear weapons, including those related to the manufacturing of nuclear warheads. It is clear that any cooperation in this sensitive area would not be publicly declared. However, such a move could bring Iran significantly closer to crossing the nuclear threshold and achieving nuclear capability, something Israel is determined to prevent. Ynet commentator Ron Ben-Yishai notes that the two countries have been negotiating this agreement for over six months, possibly longer. Originally, the idea behind the agreement was to push the Americans out of the region and dismantle the Abraham Accords. But that was over a year ago when Russia and Iran thought that through the Gaza war they would divide the Middle East between them. Today, the situation is entirely different. Iran cannot guarantee Russia control over the Middle East, nor can it produce missiles (due to strikes on its solid fuel facilities). Nevertheless, talks about the agreement have continued, though Russian enthusiasm for it has waned over time. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1vqyteuyl	2024-12-30T13:02:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/07/19/rJ119BI42c/rJ119BI42c_36_39_1473_829_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu believes fighting will resume after hostage deal, senio...	Prime minister asserts that Israel will resume fighting after any hostage deal to fulfill the war’s objectives; Despite partial agreements being considered, Netanyahu insists Hamas must be fully eliminated, highlighting that post-war plans for Gaza depend on Hamas’ total destruction A senior political source responded on Monday afternoon to warnings from top security officials, revealed by Ynet, stating that 'without an alternative to Hamas before a hostage deal, we risk returning to the situation of October 6.' According to the source, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that 'even if Israel enters into a deal, fighting will resume afterward to achieve the war’s objectives.' The source effectively acknowledged that Israel is leaning toward a partial deal that will not include ending the war or withdrawing IDF troops from Gaza — conditions Hamas views as prerequisites for a comprehensive deal. 'The prime minister insists that plans for 'the day after' in Gaza cannot be implemented until Hamas is completely destroyed, along with all its capabilities,' the source said. The source added that 'the issue of 'the day after' in Gaza is being discussed and advanced in appropriate forums, not through biased briefings from those who failed entirely in their assessments. The prime minister is unwilling to accept any reality in which Hamas has a presence in Gaza. Therefore, before addressing the 'day after' scenario, Hamas must first be eliminated, hostages must be returned, and this is the main focus for Israel.' The source also noted: 'The policy being shaped by the prime minister in Gaza is that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority will have civilian control in Gaza, including over the distribution of humanitarian aid. As a result, the security establishment is exploring various alternatives. Disconnecting Hamas from humanitarian aid is intended to strip the terrorist organization of its control over the Gazan population and to promote progress in hostage negotiations.' Additionally, the political source stated that 'If the prime minister had heeded calls from his critics back then, terror leaders like Sinwar, Deif, Haniyeh and Nasrallah would still be roaming free; Hamas’ military capabilities would not have been nearly destroyed; and Iran and its terror proxies wouldn’t be struggling to recover from the devastating blow they’ve suffered. Thanks to the prime minister’s determined and thoughtful policies, Israel is achieving significant gains, protecting its security, and will meet all the war’s objectives.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier, senior security officials warned about 'a lack of focus on the 'day after' in Gaza' and the risk of returning to pre-October 7 conditions. These officials, who are well-versed in the political and security situation and support a full or partial cease-fire in the immediate term, cautioned Netanyahu that failing to discuss and decide on governance and civilian control in Gaza after the war would allow Hamas to reestablish administrative control in the region. 'In the absence of an alternative,' the officials said, 'Hamas’ rule will inevitably return. A decision must be made now, before any deal is reached. Even with a 'small' deal, Hamas will regain full control. Without a decision, we risk undermining the war’s achievements and failing to meet one of its main objectives –toppling Hamas.' This position is shared by senior officials in both the IDF and Shin Bet. They argue, contrary to the political leadership, that while Hamas’s military capabilities have been nearly destroyed – despite sporadic rocket launches (with the army noting that Hamas will retain some launch capabilities) – its governance structures remain intact. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjoh5pxu1l	2024-12-30T11:43:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/BysDqScGyg/BysDqScGyg_0_0_1280_852_0_small.jpg

Germany accuses Elon Musk of trying to influence its election	Tycoon and Trump associate expressed support for the Alternative for Germany Party and called on Chancellor Olaf Scholz to resign; This week, he published an article in a German newspaper, and the editor resigned in protest; The coalition and opposition are united against him: 'Musk wants our country to be weak, just like Putin' The German government accused U.S. billionaire Elon Musk on Monday of trying to influence its election set to take place in February with articles supporting the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, even though it suggested they amounted to 'nonsense.' Musk, who is set to serve Donald Trump's new administration as an outside adviser, endorsed the AfD as Germany's last hope in a guest opinion piece for the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, prompting the commentary editor to resign in protest. 'It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election' with X posts and the opinion piece, a German government spokesperson said. Musk is free to express his opinion, the spokesperson said, adding: 'After all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.' Musk, the world's richest person, has defended his right to weigh in on German politics because of his 'significant investments' and has praised the AfD's approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation. His intervention has come as Germans prepare to vote in a parliamentary election on Feb. 23 after the collapse of the coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Musk also called for Scholz's resignation after a car rammed into a crowd at a Christmas market on Dec. 20, killing five people. The AfD is currently in second place in opinion polls behind the main opposition conservatives, and might be able to thwart a center-right or center-left majority in the election. Germany's mainstream parties have pledged not to work with the AfD at the national level. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The government spokesperson said Musk's endorsement of the AfD was 'a recommendation to vote for a party that is being monitored (by domestic intelligence) on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and which has already been recognized as partly right-wing extremist.' German politicians have excoriated Musk for his endorsement of the AfD, with the co-leader of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) comparing him to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'Both want to influence our elections and specifically support the AfD's enemies of democracy. They want Germany to be weakened and plunged into chaos,' Lars Klingbeil told the Funke news group on Monday. Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats and current favorite to succeed Scholz as chancellor, told Funke that Musk's comments were 'intrusive and pretentious.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ctedxujg	2024-12-30T10:56:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/30/B1wSDVxUyl/B1wSDVxUyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Pro-Iran militias in Iraq halt attacks on Israel due to US pressu...	Iraqi militias halt attacks on Israel following pressure from the Iraqi government, U.S., and Iran; Israeli threats and Syria’s instability also contributed to the pause, but the issue may be reignited should a full-scale war erupt between Israel and the Islamic Republic A week after reports emerged that one of the pro-Iranian militias in Iraq had reached an agreement with the Iraqi prime minister to halt military actions against Israel, an official Iraqi confirmation arrived on Monday that the militias have ceased their attacks on Israel – at least for now. Yasser Watout, a member of Iraq’s Parliamentary Security and Defense Committee, told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the halt in militia operations against Israel for more than a month stems from pressure applied by the Iraqi government and Shiite political factions, alongside external threats that Iraq is exposed to. According to him, these pressures aim to distance Iraq from a conflict that could escalate and directly involve the country. 'Iraq has received threats from Israel and the United States due to the activities of the militias, and these threats have been a central reason for stopping their actions,' Watout explained. He also noted that the fall of Assad's regime in Syria contributed to the cessation of militia activities because they could no longer launch attacks from Syrian territory as they had in the past. 'After Assad’s fall, the militias faced significant difficulties in carrying out attacks against Israel. They relied on Syrian territory for their operations. We believe this has stopped permanently, not just temporarily,' he added. Ayed al-Hilali, a close associate of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, also stated that regional and international powers – including the United States and Iran – seeking to avoid escalation in the region, pressured Iraq and the militias to halt their attacks. He further mentioned that Israeli threats to target Iraq were another factor in the decision, saying: 'It is possible the militias are adopting a new strategy that involves maintaining silence for the time being while reorganizing their position.' Additionally, Iraqi Parliament Speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani said in an interview with the Saudi television channel Al-Hadath that: 'What is happening in Syria affects Iraq. The security deterioration in Syria will have negative consequences for the region, but we will not interfere in its internal affairs.' He added, 'Iran is concerned about what has happened in Syria. They have their own fears. Turkey's dominance in Syria is evident – this is concerning. We do not want Turkey to replace Iran in Syria.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to him, 'Trump emphasized to the Iraqi Prime Minister that weapons must remain in the hands of the state. The militias agreed to the demands to stop their attacks against Israel, but we cannot take sides if a U.S.-Iranian conflict erupts. Israeli threats regarding strikes in Iraq are troubling, but for now, U.S. pressure has curtailed Israel's intentions to attack Iraq.' The last known attack by the militias occurred on November 24, about a month after they resumed targeting Israel and claimed responsibility for an unusual number of cross-border rocket launches. These militias maintain close ties with Hezbollah – with their relationship significantly predating the start of the current conflict. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkrupveiye	2024-12-30T09:26:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/24/Sk0sMDgRR/Sk0sMDgRR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

His call came during a visit to the Syrian capital by Kuwaiti foreign minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya and other diplomats that signalled an openness to establish relations in the wake of the overthrow of Assad by rebel forces in early December.

Al-Yahya called on the international community to reconsider sanctions imposed on Syria. He also said Kuwait's leadership also appealed for aid to be sent to Syria urgently. The Sunni Muslim Arab states boycotted the former Syrian administration after Assad accepted help from Shi'ite, non-Arab Iran and Russia to put down the Sunni-led rebellion against him.

He also warned Tehran that Israel has the ability to strike any target in the Middle East, including in Iran, adding that Israel would not tolerate attacks by Iranian proxies. 'To the Houthis, perhaps you have not been paying attention to what has happened to the Middle East over the past year. Well, allow me to remind you what has happened to Hamas, to Hezbollah, to Assad, to all those who have attempted to destroy us. Let this be your final warning. This is not a threat. It is a promise. You will share the same miserable fate,' Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon told the U.N. Security Council. Speaking before the meeting, Danon told reporters: 'Israel will defend its people. If 2,000 kilometers is not enough to separate our children from the terror, let me assure you, it will not be enough to protect their terror from our strengths.' The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was about to board a plane at the airport when it came under attack by Israel. A crew member on the plane was injured, he said. Israel's elimination of the top leaders of the Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah and the destruction of their military structure along with Assad's collapse represent a succession of monumental wins for Netanyahu. Briefing the Security Council meeting, Assistant U.N. Secretary General for the Middle East Khaled Khiari reiterated grave concern about the escalation in violence, calling on the Houthis to halt attacks on Israel and for international and humanitarian law to be respected. 'Further military escalation could jeopardize regional stability with adverse political, security, economic and humanitarian repercussions,' Khiari said. 'Millions in Yemen, Israel and throughout the region, would continue to bear the brunt of escalation with no end.'

'This is yet another example of Hamas’ cynical use of Gaza’s civilians and civilian establishments for terrorist activity and a gross violation of international law,' according to the IDF.

Soldiers stationed on Mount Hermon face dangerous conditions	IDF soldiers on the Syrian Golan face unclear strategic goals as rising tensions with local residents sparks concern; Commanders question the mission’s necessity as troops balance defense, humanitarian efforts, and extreme conditions in a volatile and complex environment; A blizzard could put them in mortal danger Amid criticism from Northern Command officers regarding the futility of stationing hundreds of IDF troops on the Syrian side of the border on the Golan Heights, the daily routine of the soldiers is becoming clearer under the shadow of potential danger that may approach from the east. On Sunday, Ynet revealed voices from within the IDF questioning the presence of two brigades in the Syrian territories beyond the border over the past two weeks, following the fall of Bashar Assad's regime to the rebels. The IDF is not ruling out the possibility of withdrawing from populated areas where forces have entrenched themselves over the past week, near Syrian residents, and instead consolidating in open spaces. IDF reservations stem from the fact that there is no visible enemy, nor any intelligence indicating one. Soldiers are primarily engaged in self-defense under very low operational tension, alongside violent friction that has begun to develop with local Syrian residents protesting the IDF's incursion into their territory. According to warnings, this could lead to a terror effect from cells approaching the area and attempting to harm the soldiers. Two days ago, additional officers noted that, unlike the borders with the Gaza Strip or Lebanon, most of the Golan Heights is flat and easier to control through observation and firepower. Additionally, the perimeter is much larger than other borders: The tall security fence is not the actual border, and in some areas Israeli territory stretches one to two kilometers eastward, up to the barrel line marking the boundary between the two countries. Meanwhile, the daily routine of paratroopers and armored corps soldiers in the area is becoming clearer. All of them, until recently, were engaged in intense offensive missions against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Now the soldiers are primarily defending themselves in temporary outposts or abandoned Assad army posts, but also on the outskirts of the villages themselves. They patrol between five to six locations the IDF has seized in the Syrian Golan. They attempt to cover each other through ambushes and reconnaissance missions and occasionally undertake less formal tasks. For example, troops have repaired infrastructure they accidentally damaged for Syrian residents, such as water pumps and a local power line. In at least two cases, Syrian residents approached IDF soldiers requesting medical assistance for their ailments, and their requests were granted by an IDF paramedic. In accordance with the political echelon's decision, the gates to Israel have not yet been opened for them, but the IDF promises that efforts to create opportunities for cooperation with at least some of the 70,000 Syrians living opposite Israel are ongoing. Officers currently most engaged beyond the border are from the Northern Command's Population Unit, many of whom are Druze reservists. They are trying to understand the Syrians, and the Syrians are trying to understand the IDF through them. 'The officers from this unit have prevented further incidents thanks to dialogue with the local Syrians. We’ve also learned lessons from the two cases where we had to shoot the knees of key agitators during protests against us after they got too close to our forces,' the military said. 'We haven’t conducted weapons searches in their villages, even though not all of them have handed over their weapons. It’s doubtful we’ll be able to collect all their weapons because it’s part of their culture – to be armed for self-defense after what they’ve experienced in the past decade.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF also emphasized that not all sectors in the Golan have a wide perimeter and there are still dead zones in the region. 'Our presence allows us to continue fortifying the barrier – a large and critical project for defense against an invasion of Israel,' the IDF said in a statement. 'There are still Assad army outposts, slightly deeper in, that we won’t reach. We’re not there for unnecessary adventures.' Another potentially dangerous point, though not for operational reasons, is the summit of the Syrian Hermon, which Israeli forces also captured this month without a fight. Despite a swift operation by the Technology and Logistics Directorate (Atal) to prepare or establish durable outposts for soldiers at altitudes of 1.49 miles and 1.74 miles, as revealed by Ynet last week, some still point to the dangers of staying there during a snowstorm or under harsher extreme conditions than those at older outposts like Israeli and Snow Observatory, located at around 1.37 miles. The IDF is preparing for the possibility of very long days without the ability to evacuate soldiers from there if necessary, and they will have to survive on their own with emergency equipment and food now being supplied to them. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hknpjreuyg	2024-12-30T08:29:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/Sy4m00NtnNyl/Sy4m00NtnNyl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Sergeant Uriel Peretz, 23, killed in northern Gaza, 7 soldiers in...	He is the 825 IDF casualty since the start of the war in Gaza; Peretz was killed by an anti-tank missile strike on the building where his force was stationed in Beit Hanoun Sergeant Uriel Peretz, 23, from Beitar Illit, a soldier in the Netzah Yehuda Battalion in the Kfir Brigade, fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip, the IDF announced Monday evening. Peretz was killed by an anti-tank missile fired by Hamas terrorists at a building in Beit Hanoun where the force was stationed. Seven soldiers were injured by the anti-tank missile strike, three of them seriously, all from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion. Peretz is the 825th IDF casualty since the beginning of the war. The IDF operation in Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip began last weekend. The Beitar Illit municipality paid tribute to Peretz, 'who fell for the sanctity of God while sacrificing his life for the people of Israel and the Land of Israel.' Mayor Meir Rubinstein said: 'Our hearts go out to the family in their difficult time. The entire city mourns and sends its condolences. We pray that we will soon be able to see the 'salvation of Israel.'' On Tuesday, Rabbi Yitzhak Bar Haim, one of the rabbis of the Netzah Yehuda Association, came to visit soldiers who were on duty at the Tze'elim base, took a picture with Peretz and sent his grandmother a message. 'Hello, Mrs. Navon,' the rabbi said to Peretz's grandmother, 'I have a special experience. The Holy One, blessed be He, summoned a special grace for me to meet your cute grandson here in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of a field, in the south, before going to fight. What a cute grandson, righteous and heroic. May he end up in peace together with all the soldiers, and with God's help you will be blessed to see him, of all grandchildren, happy. May he reach his wedding and 'build a faithful home in Israel.' You are blessed to have such children. All the best, greetings to you.' The rabbi eulogized Peretz on Monday: 'He was in the medics course for three months because he had the ability to give. He was a charming young man, pleasant and noble. He took responsibility, always cared for his friends and was very much loved by everyone. I met him a few days ago, then I sent a recording to my grandmother about her grandson, that she could be proud of him and the values ​​he brought with him from home. A difficult loss, we lost one of the best.'

Trump loses appeal of E. Jean Carroll $5 million defamation verdi...	A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a $5 million verdict that E. Jean Carroll won against Donald Trump when a jury found the U.S. president-elect liable for sexually abusing and later defaming the former magazine columnist. The decision was issued by a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. The May 2023 verdict stemmed from an incident around 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan, where Carroll said Trump raped her, and an October 2022 Truth Social post where Trump denied Carroll's claim as a hoax. Though jurors in federal court in Manhattan did not find that Trump committed rape, they awarded the former Elle magazine advice columnist $2.02 million for sexual assault and $2.98 million for defamation. A different jury ordered Trump in January to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her and damaging her reputation in June 2019, when he first denied her rape claim. Trump's lawyers argued the $5 million verdict should be thrown out because the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, should not have let jurors hear testimony from two other women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Trump's lawyers also said the trial judge should not have let jurors watch a 2005 'Access Hollywood' video where Trump boasted graphically about forcing himself on women. But the appeals court said Trump failed to show that Kaplan erred, or that any errors warranted a new trial. Judge Kaplan also oversaw the trial that ended with the $83.3 million verdict.

Netanyahu recovers from surgery as government crisis deepens, thr...	The Haredim are threatening to oppose the budget if the draft exemption law is not advanced, and Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir continues to threaten that members of his faction will also oppose it; If the government is unable to pass a budget for next year then the Knesset is dissolved automatically and goes to new elections While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is lying in the hospital recovering from the prostate surgery he underwent Sunday night, his coalition partners have increased the pressure and escalated the government coalition crisis. The Haredim, in this case the Gur Hasidic faction, are threatening to oppose the state budget if the draft exemption law is not advanced. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also threatened Monday morning that if Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich does not increase the budget for police salaries members of his faction will on Tuesday oppose the trapped profits law, that will enable the state to collect tax on the estimated 150 billion shekels of trapped profits held in personal service companies. At the same time, the opposition is refusing offsets in preparation for the proposal of a law that is supposed to bring about 10 billion shekels into the state coffers, and the coalition currently does not have a majority. All of this is happening while the prime minister is recovering from surgery. Professor Ofer Gofrit, director of the urology department at Hadassah, updated Sunday evening that the surgery went as planned and that the prime minister woke up from anesthesia and is in good condition. 'Everything, thank God, went smoothly. There is no suspicion of malignancy or cancer. It's all a benign prostate that was removed, and we only hope for the best,' he said. Meanwhile, even if we put aside the campaign to oust the attorney general, the pressure on Netanyahu is increasing. It is precisely after the coalition expansion that he is having difficulty managing his partnership with the right, and senior government officials claim: 'We must put an end to this.' Coalition officials accuse the Haredim of 'irrational' behavior, and Ben-Gvir of promiscuous conduct. Ben-Gvir, for his part, accuses Smotrich of vindictiveness, but at the same time also criticizes the National Insurance Law, which is costing the coalition about 4 billion shekels. Knesset Member Israel Eichler of United Torah Judaism has already decided to vote against the budget. 'The government is going against the Haredi public in everything,' said a confidant. 'He said at faction meetings in recent weeks that the budget should be voted against, and therefore he will vote against it tomorrow.' This behavior is shaking the coalition into the unknown. A senior government official told Ynet that 'Ben-Gvir and the Haredim are simply a scandal. Every time something doesn't seem right to them, they threaten to oppose critical laws of the state budget. Sometimes it's the conscription law and sometimes the police salary. This leads us on a direct path to dissolving the coalition and bringing elections forward.' Another source in the coalition claimed that right-wing voters will punish those who dismantle the government. 'The right-wing public is watching, they see who is strengthening the camp and who is drilling holes in it in these historic days. The public will make them pay the price,' he said. And what happens if there is no majority? If a majority is not found today for the Retained Earnings Law, which is expected to yield the Treasury 10 billion shekels in taxes in 2025, ministry officials are threatening to announce a '5 billion shekel cut in the budgets of all ministries.' A similar statement has been made before. Almost a week ago, senior officials in the Treasury Department said that 'due to ego games, Ben-Gvir will himself cause cuts in the budgets of the police, welfare, education, health, infrastructure and budgets intended for post-war reconstruction. We will call this the 'Ben-Gvir Plot,' so that they will understand what he caused.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Economic and political sources claim that what lies behind Ben-Gvir's decision is 'a power struggle against Smotrich. He is trying to show how much he cares about the salaries of the police officers, unlike the minister and the heads of the Finance Ministry.' Otzma Yehudit, in response, accused Smotrich of 'a reckless decision to harm the salaries of the police officers and prison guards.' Despite this, Netanyahu is not expected to fire Ben-Gvir following his decision to vote against the coalition, and a coalition source explained that 'the risk of such a move is too great.' At the same time, the coalition also estimates that none of the partners really intend to break up the government, but that the goal is simply 'to operate in a broken work environment with the aim of minimizing damage.' Now the question is: Will the coalition survive its two significant political minefields, the state budget and the draft exemption law? The answer is still unclear. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byhlrmliye	2024-12-30T06:03:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/28/B1gNLgpxJe/B1gNLgpxJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Alexander Granovsky is accused of setting fire to eight vehicles in various locations, photographing infrastructure facilities in central Israel, and also capturing images of former Defense Minister Benny Gantz's neighborhood; Granovsky was reportedly operated via Telegram by Iranian agents Israel Police and the Shin Bet security agency announced Monday the arrest of Alexander Granovsky, a 29-year-old Petah Tikva resident, accused of carrying out missions on behalf of Iran. Granovsky, with a criminal history of property offenses, drug-related crimes and violence, allegedly operated under Iranian directives, targeting locations in Ra’anana, Hadera, and Ashdod. Authorities claim Granovsky conducted various acts, including photographing a sensitive Israeli infrastructure site and the residential neighborhood of former IDF Chief of Staff and Defense Minister Benny Gantz. Granovsky allegedly sent these images to his Iranian handlers. Granovsky also reportedly set fire to eight vehicles, purchased military uniforms to film himself burning them, and shared details of another Israeli citizen for potential recruitment. Granovsky was arrested earlier this month at his partner’s home. Police have requested his detention be extended ahead of an indictment at the Central District Court. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Superintendent Sarit Peretz, an officer in the International Investigations Unit, said Granovsky acted under explicit instructions, including burning vehicles, for which he received payments ranging from hundreds to thousands of shekels. In some instances, he was unpaid but claimed he needed the money. 'He told us, 'They pay me, and I do it,'' Peretz said. She added, 'Granovsky communicated with Iranian operatives via Telegram. They instructed him to act against the government and the prime minister by spraying graffiti, committing arson, and gathering intelligence. He provided details about a security officer and collected information on IDF officials, with plans to expand these efforts. He was stopped before completing all his assignments.' The investigation revealed that Granovsky had requested additional tasks before his arrest but refused certain instructions, such as burning an ambulance or a police vehicle. While he was directed to acquire firearms and grenades, he only proposed creating Molotov cocktails. 'He knew exactly who he was dealing with. He is a very dangerous individual,' Peretz concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyo5aml81x	2024-12-30T05:17:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/30/B1gyxflLyl/B1gyxflLyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Stolen lives: Inside Russia’s abduction of Ukrainian children	Nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken to Russia or occupied territories since the war began; experts describe Russia's efforts to erase their identities and Ukraine's struggle to bring them home Since the outbreak of the war in 2022, nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territories without the consent of their families, Ukrainian officials say. Independent research, including research by Yale University, suggests a policy of systemic deportation of Ukrainian youth. The harrowing consequences of that policy became clear in January 2024, when an 18-year-old Ukrainian who had been sent to a foster family in Russia took his own life. Shortly before his death, he sent a voice message to his friends expressing his despair over the relocation. Ukraine says these actions meet the UN’s definition of genocide and last year, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his children’s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of unlawfully deporting Ukrainian children. Russia denies these allegations. Lvova-Belova has acknowledged that 730,000 Ukrainian children fled Ukraine for Russia since the start of the war but said that most of them came with their families. She said that Russia had taken about 2,000 children from Ukrainian orphanages, but she did not mention other allegations of widespread forced displacement. Ukrainian human rights advocates who spoke to The Media Line described a harrowing, calculated effort to undermine Ukraine’s future through the use of its youngest and most vulnerable citizens. They noted that the true extent of the abductions likely surpasses the 20,000 figure. The fate of Ukraine’s abducted children Aksana Filipishyna, an analyst with the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union, traced the roots of the abducted children crisis back to at least 2014, when Ukraine raised the alarm that Russia was abducting Ukrainian children from orphanages. By 2015, Russia had launched the 'trains of hope' initiative, encouraging Russian citizens to travel to occupied Ukrainian territories and adopt Ukrainian children. 'Ukraine raised this issue on the international stage and appealed to the European Court of Human Rights,' Filipishyna told The Media Line, noting that those actions were carried out under the auspices of Pavel Astakhov, then the presidential envoy for children's rights in Russia. Russia’s own public records reveal how the policy of child relocation has taken off since the 2022 invasion. From 2022 to mid-2023, Russian authorities openly published data on government websites detailing the arrival of Ukrainian orphans in over 70 localities across 42 regions. 'The geography is vast, from border regions to deep inside Russia,' Filipishyna said, describing a deliberate dispersion of Ukrainian children across the country. She cited a 2023 public event where Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Putin’s envoy Maria Lvova-Belova discussed 'reeducation facilities' for Ukrainian teenagers who resisted Russian assimilation. 'These boys, displaying pro-Ukrainian sentiments, were to be sent to such institutions in Grozny,' the capital city of Russia’s Chechen Republic, Filipishyna said. Filipishyna noted that Ukraine had tried to clear out its state-run child care institutions on the border regions leading up to the 2022 Russian invasion to prevent children from being kidnapped. 'Most children from state institutions were successfully evacuated,' Filipishyna said. But an estimated 4,000 children remained in orphanages, foster care or other guardianships in areas like Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv. As Russia moved in, those regions saw widespread violence, civilian casualties, forced detentions and abductions. She pointed to the 2022 siege of Mariupol as another example of how Ukrainian children have been forcibly relocated. Before the siege, Mariupol’s civilian population was over 250,000, one-fifth of whom were children. The city’s infrastructure was almost entirely destroyed by relentless shelling and bombings, leaving 90% of it in ruins. 'When Russian forces entered the devastated city, they brought buses and systematically cleared out neighborhoods,' Filipishyna said. Civilians were forced out of bomb shelters and basements under the threat of complete annihilation. 'People were told they had 30 minutes before the area would be completely cleared—meaning everything that moved would be destroyed. Those seeking survival had no choice but to board the transport, which took them to so-called filtration camps in Russia,' she continued. In those camps, families with children were held for three to five days under grueling conditions. Adults underwent a rigorous 'filtration' process, and suspicions of pro-Ukrainian sentiment often led to devastating separations. 'If parents were found with pro-Ukrainian information on their phones, tattoos or laptops—or identified as local officials, activists or human rights defenders—they were immediately detained,' Filipishyna said. Those parents’ children were separated from them and transferred to orphanages or health camps in Russia. Filipishyna said that the figure of 20,000 forcibly relocated children from across Ukraine is likely understated. 'In Mariupol alone, where 51,000 children lived before the invasion, we suspect many remain unaccounted for—especially those whose families perished or whose parents were executed or detained by Russian forces,' she said. Other children were vulnerable to forced relocation after being left with grandparents or other relatives when their parents joined the military or were taken prisoner, Filipishyna said. The fate of the abducted children varies—some remain in orphanages, others have been placed with foster families and a significant number have been adopted within Russia. Research by Yale University and Ukrainian human rights groups confirms the widespread and systematic nature of these transfers. Filipishyna said her own research has found that the abductions take a serious mental toll on their victims, with the potential for lasting harm. 'Children who spent extended periods in the Russian Federation endured significant psychological manipulation,' she said. Abducted Ukrainian children are often forcibly humiliated, banned from speaking Ukrainian and made to participate in singing Russian anthems. Ties to their families are cut off, including by confiscating their phones, and some are even confined to basements. 'Children faced punishment for expressing hope that Ukraine would return or for showing any positive sentiments toward their homeland,' Filipishyna said. She added that many children reported being told by their captors that Ukraine had forgotten about them and that only Russia could offer them a future. The harsh conditions left many children, particularly teenagers, vulnerable to suicidal thoughts. 'These were children who remembered an independent, democratic Ukraine—where dignity and human rights mattered, where they could speak freely,' Filipishyna said. She emphasized that the totalitarian environment was hard to tolerate for adults, let alone children. 'It’s no surprise that some were pushed to the brink,' she said. Fast-tracked Russian citizenship for Ukrainian children Filipishyna detailed how Russia systematically altered its citizenship laws since May 2022 in order to facilitate the integration of Ukrainian children. The most recent changes, effective January 4, 2024, allow almost any adult to apply for citizenship on behalf of a child from occupied Ukrainian territories, she said. 'This adult could be a hospital director, a school principal, the head of an orphanage or even a temporary guardian,' Filipishyna said. The individual merely needs to state that the child is unaccompanied and has no established connection with relatives. 'Of course, no one attempts to establish such connections or inform Ukraine about the child’s whereabouts,' Filipishyna noted, adding that the child’s opinion is also not taken into account in the process.

'The system is designed to close the loop and make these children untraceable,' Filipishyna said. 'This policy isn’t just about assimilation; it’s a calculated effort to erase Ukrainian identity.' Filipishyna described the policy of child abduction as 'another facet of a systematic strategy to strip Ukraine of its future by targeting its children.' 'Children represent the future and hope of any nation. By erasing Ukrainian identity among these children, Russia seeks to weaken Ukraine’s future,' she said. She added that Russia is also hoping to benefit demographically from the introduction of Ukrainian children, who are seen as 'intelligent, curious and industrious.' The challenges of returning Ukraine’s abducted children Ukraine wants to rescue abducted children, but so far, it hasn’t managed to do so in any large-scale way, Filipishyna said. 'The full procedure envisioned by the Geneva Conventions has not been implemented, and this leaves us with slow progress on bringing these children back home,' she explained. Under the Geneva Conventions, both Ukraine and Russia are obligated to create national information bureaus to document civilians displaced by war, including children. 'Ukraine compiles lists of those we seek to locate and believe were unlawfully taken, while Russia is required to maintain a registry of individuals it has transferred or detained in occupied territories,' Filipishyna said. Ukraine’s registry, established in 2022, gathers information from sources including families, law enforcement officers, orphanage directors and other officials. According to the Geneva Conventions, both Ukraine and Russia were required to identify at least four trusted states to act as mediators in negotiations about returning displaced civilians. 'Ideally, if both sides agreed on a mediator country, intermediary bodies would form under its auspices, potentially involving organizations like the International Red Cross or the UN,' Filipishyna said. But this process has not been realized. Instead, the fate of Ukraine’s children rests with various isolated efforts. 'What we see are small-scale or individual cases of family reunifications, rather than the systematic return of orphans or children deprived of parental care,' Filipishyna said. Most cases of returned children involve families separated during the invasion, such as children who were sent to stay with grandparents in Kherson when their mother was working in Kyiv. 'Very few children have been retrieved from deep within Russia—these are not hundreds but merely dozens,' Filipishyna explained. Daria Kasianova, chairman of the Board of the Ukrainian Network for Children’s Rights, highlighted the involvement of international mediators in facilitating the return of abducted Ukrainian children. 'Countries like Qatar, the Vatican and South Africa have expressed willingness to assist, with Qatar already achieving some success,' she explained. But for now, the efforts of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union have resulted in the return of just 210 children. 'Children from Mariupol, for example, were first taken to Donetsk and later moved to Moscow suburbs. Parents and guardians began reaching out to us, but retrieving children is extremely difficult,' she said. In many cases, legal hurdles arise. 'Even mothers must gather extensive documentation to prove parental rights. Grandmothers, if the parents are deceased, are often forced to apply for guardianship under Russian law, which is absurd,' Kasianova added. Getting a child back to Ukraine is even more difficult if a child had no legal guardian in Ukraine or if their documents were confiscated. Rescuing abducted children is even more challenging when the children have been taken to Russian-occupied territories. 'Occupied territories are harder to access due to military equipment and numerous checkpoints,' Kasianova said, noting that many children fear prolonged interrogations at border crossings. She emphasized the need for streamlined international mechanisms, as the current system places significant barriers on families trying to reunite. 'It’s an incredibly challenging process that leaves many children in legal limbo, unable to return home,' she said. For the few children who manage to return to Ukraine, vast challenges remain. These children, who sometimes have no parents to return to, undergo a careful reintegration process involving long-term psychological support upon their return to Ukraine. Kasianova recounted the story of one boy who was left stranded at a Russian hospital after his parents were killed during their escape from occupied territory. In another case, a 12-year-old girl was coerced into accepting Russian citizenship and witnessed the rape and murder of a childhood friend by a Russian soldier. Even those children who don’t experience violence are deeply psychologically affected by the abduction and by having to give up their sense of being Ukrainian. 'They return deeply scarred, needing to unlearn the falsehoods forced upon them and rebuild their identities,' Kasianova said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1czlfeikx	2024-12-30T04:11:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/23/rklaH61L36/rklaH61L36_110_48_943_531_0_small.jpg
Architectural marvel or disastrous boondoggle? Sisi's new palace ...	With its pyramid-shaped hall and a mural celebrating Sisi’s coup against the Muslim Brotherhood regime, the lavish venue has left many Egyptians questioning whether their taxes might have been better spent on schools and hospitals The 11th summit of the Developing Eight (D-8) nations on Dec. 19 in Cairo left its mark on Egypt—not for its outcomes, but for the opulent venue where it was held. The D-8 group, founded in 1997, includes Egypt, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey. Among the attendees were Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. During the summit, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi warned of 'unprecedented crises in the Middle East' and highlighted the challenges developing nations face in achieving growth amid mounting obstacles. However, the event’s discussions took a backseat to the public’s fascination—and outrage—over the lavish palace hosting the summit. The newly unveiled palace, located in Egypt’s New Administrative Capital east of Cairo, boasts a footprint of 50,000 square meters within a 2.5-million-square-meter complex. Designed in a pharaonic style, it features an expansive pyramid-shaped hall for special events. The palace’s debut triggered a heated debate on social media. Some Egyptians praised it as a testament to architectural achievement under Sisi's leadership. Others criticized it as an extravagant misuse of state funds during a severe economic crisis, suggesting the resources could have been better spent on schools, hospitals and public welfare projects. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Critics also took aim at the palace’s interior decorations, which some saw as glorifying Sisi’s rule. One mural depicts Sisi’s 2013 ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, while Quranic verses adorn other walls. Notably, one verse quoting Pharaoh—'Am I not the king of Egypt, and these rivers flow beneath my feet?'—was displayed with Pharaoh’s name conspicuously omitted. Sisi defends spending Addressing the criticism during a visit to a police academy two days after the summit, Sisi claimed that the palace and other facilities in the New Administrative Capital were financed by the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), a government-owned holding company established in 2016. Still, the backlash highlights longstanding grievances about Sisi’s ambitious—and costly—construction projects. Detractors argue these projects prioritize grandeur over the dire needs of ordinary Egyptians. In 2019, construction contractor Mohamed Ali accused Sisi of corruption, claiming the president was building palaces while Egyptians went hungry. Sisi famously responded, 'Yes, I am building presidential palaces—but not for myself, for Egypt.' Mounting economic pressures Egypt’s economic struggles are undeniable. According to the Qatari newspaper The New Arab, the country’s external debt has ballooned from $45.2 billion in 2014, when Sisi took office, to $152.9 billion as of June 2023. Recent regional conflicts, including the war in Gaza and Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, have further strained the economy. Egypt reportedly lost 70% of its Suez Canal revenue, a critical income source. The controversy over Sisi’s new palace is not occurring in a vacuum. Images of opposition forces seizing opulent palaces during Syria’s civil war have intensified scrutiny of such symbols of power across the Arab world. For many Egyptians, the palace serves as a stark reminder of their economic struggles and fuels questions about the priorities of their leadership. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1cej11ei1g	2024-12-30T03:32:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/29/ryGjuwSCxkg/ryGjuwSCxkg_0_37_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Berlin says Elon Musk trying to exert influence over German elect...	U.S. billionaire Elon Musk is trying to exert influence over the German election taking place in February, a government spokesperson said on Monday. 'It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election,' with X posts and an opinion piece he wrote backing the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) over the weekend, she said. Musk was free to express his opinion, the spokesperson added. 'After all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.' The support of the AfD from Musk, who is set to serve U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration as an outside adviser, comes as Germans are set to vote on Feb. 23 after a coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed. The commentary published in German in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, flagship of the Axel Springer media group, expanded on a post by Musk on social media platform X last week in which he wrote 'only the AfD can save Germany' and praised the party's approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyqxzbxuyl	2024-12-30T02:22:13-08:00

IDF officials: 'Find Hamas alternative before any deal or we'll r...	Senior military officials warn that the lack of a clear policy for Gaza could allow the terror group, severely weakened in combat, to regain political control; 'We will lose the achievements of the war,' they caution Senior IDF officials warned Monday that failure to plan for Gaza's future governance could lead to a relapse of conditions that existed before the October 7 terror attack. 'It’s that simple,' one official said. These warnings have been repeatedly delivered to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Security officials emphasize that without decisive action on post-war governance, Hamas could rebuild its political power and regain control of Gaza. 'In the absence of an alternative, Hamas will inevitably return to power. Decisions must be made now, before any hostage deals or cease-fire agreements,' officials said. This concern resonates within both the IDF and the Shin Bet. While Hamas’ military capabilities have been decimated, officials caution that the group’s political infrastructure remains intact. Approximately 1.9 million residents, about 90% of Gaza's population, are concentrated in humanitarian zones in central and southern Gaza. The IDF has a limited presence in these areas, focusing primarily on targeted airstrikes. Meanwhile, Hamas operatives continue to exert brutal control over the local population, silencing dissent with violence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'When families try to resist, Hamas suppresses them ruthlessly. But the larger issue is the absence of leadership or energy for rebellion,' one military official explained. Security officials outline three potential paths forward Restoring Palestinian Authority control: This would involve significant international investment, primarily from the U.S. and Gulf nations, to bolster the Palestinian Authority (PA). Such a move, coupled with normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, could reshape the region. However, Netanyahu has dismissed this option, citing political constraints within his coalition. Establishing military rule in Gaza: Under this scenario, Israel would assume responsibility for Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, from food distribution to healthcare. This would come with enormous financial and diplomatic costs, which Netanyahu is reluctant to bear. Defaulting to the status quo: This would allow Hamas to gradually reclaim power, undermining one of the primary objectives of the war—dismantling the group. Lessons from the West Bank The lack of strategic planning in Gaza mirrors Israel’s approach in the West Bank. While some voices on the political right call to dismantle the PA, Netanyahu has avoided making a decision. Security forces loyal to Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas continue to fight Hamas, preventing its rise in areas near Israeli cities. 'Just last week, five PA security personnel were killed fighting Hamas,' a senior official noted. 'They tell us, ‘If we’re not strong, Hamas will take over, and it’ll be your problem too.’ Yet, Israel neither supports the PA nor dismantles it, effectively leaving it to collapse slowly.' If the PA were to fall, security officials warn, Israel would need to double its troop presence in the West Bank, a logistical nightmare. Israeli security officials stress they are not advocating for a Palestinian state or territorial concessions. Instead, they seek pragmatic solutions to safeguard national security. 'The lesson from October 7 is not just to stop turning a blind eye but to stop deferring critical decisions,' one official said. 'Difficult steps must be taken now. Hoping for quiet hasn’t worked—it’s time to face reality and act decisively.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy1ky1ei1e	2024-12-30T02:06:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/06/S1eS4ck1Jx/S1eS4ck1Jx_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Why is minimal clothing necessary for pole dancing?'	Certified psychotherapist and pole dance instructor Michali Aspis is adamant about breaking the stigma and using pole dancing as a powerful tool for treatment and self-appreciation I came across an ad inviting women to a therapeutic group involving pole dancing. What does that mean? 'I've designed a therapeutic program combining pole dancing with group discussions, focusing on body image, femininity and sexuality,' explained Michali Aspis, 32, a clinical social worker, cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist and certified pole dance instructor. Married and a mother of two, she lives in Haifa. 'The pole, due to its stigmas and cheap sexual connotations, confronts women directly, forcing them to deal with many aspects of their sexuality immediately. The room itself is full of mirrors, leading women to undergo a kind of exposure therapy — suddenly seeing their entire bodies in minimal clothing, something many avoid by only looking at their faces in the mirror.' Why is minimal clothing necessary for pole dancing? 'First, our skin is one of the points of contact with the pole — meaning that to stabilize ourselves, we use our form. Additionally, it allows women to view their entire bodies in the mirror. 'In principle, someone could decide it doesn't suit her and remain clothed but this offers a genuine opportunity to experiment in a safe, judgment-free environment full of acceptance and love. It’s about exposing oneself emotionally and physically.' What issues do women address in these workshops? 'One woman might work on childhood sexual trauma, another may deal with diminished sexuality due to motherhood. One is recovering from cancer and another was near the Gaza border on October 7 and seeks to cope with the trauma still lingering in her body. One of the aspects most severely impacted by PTSD is sexuality and it’s rarely addressed in therapy rooms because it’s seen as secondary to 'more important concerns.'' You're a social worker. How did you come across this type of therapy? 'Over the years, I realized you can't separate the body from the mind. Many struggles manifest physically, especially in the context of sexuality and sometimes conversational therapy alone isn't enough to create the necessary change. 'Unfortunately, sexuality is taboo in our society. Even in therapy rooms, very few clients dare to touch on the subject. In the case of pole dancing, it’s front and center — you address it simply by working with it.' Is there another reason you chose the pole? 'Because I want to break the stigma around it. I think it’s time we redefine the pole and use it as a tool for women to reclaim their sexuality.' What does that mean? 'In our society, women are expected to use their sexuality to please their husbands and have children. Through work with the pole, I contradict that, saying a woman's sexuality is, first and foremost, her own. 'I believe the pole, given its history, is an excellent tool for reclaiming ownership of sexuality. It’s an element through which a woman simply enjoys her body. Abroad, pole work is already a recognized therapeutic field, with doctoral research being conducted on it. For example, there’s a feminist movement called S Factor that uses the pole as a tool for connection and female empowerment.' When did you start working with pole dancing? 'About seven or eight years ago. I reached a weight of 102 kilograms (225 lbs) and then lost 36 kilograms (79 lbs), rediscovering my sexual drive. Before losing weight, I met someone who attended a pole dance class and I told myself that one day, when I slimmed down, I’d try it too.

Man replaced by machine': Is the use of AI undermining the IDF's...	Unit 8200 served as a testing ground for advanced AI systems, shaping its military strategy for years before October 7; a Washington Post report raises concerns about increased civilian casualties and weakened human intelligence under the unit’s AI-driven approach Following Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7 last year, the IDF launched an extensive aerial campaign in Gaza, leveraging years of meticulously gathered intelligence on addresses, tunnels and critical infrastructure tied to the terrorist group. However, as the target bank began to dwindle, the military turned to an artificial intelligence system known as 'The Gospel' to rapidly generate hundreds of new targets, according to a detailed Washington Post investigation. The report examines how the use of AI technologies impacted the prolonged war, including its influence on civilian casualties and the quality of Israeli intelligence. According to two individuals familiar with the intelligence-gathering operation, the deployment of AI allowed the IDF to maintain a relentless pace of airstrikes. The Post describes the software as one of the most advanced applications of military AI to date, central to Israel’s ongoing operations. It also sheds light on internal debates within the IDF over whether reliance on AI weakened traditional intelligence capabilities and if the technology’s recommendations received sufficient scrutiny. Discussions on the use of AI began years before the October 7 attack, according to the investigation. Critics within the military have argued that the AI system contributed to a significant rise in civilian casualties in Gaza. The Post bases its findings on interviews with over a dozen individuals familiar with the system, most of whom spoke anonymously due to national security concerns, as well as on internal documents obtained during its investigation. 'What’s happening in Gaza is a forerunner of a broader shift in how war is being fought,' said Steven Feldstein, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, who researches the use of AI in war. He noted that the IDF appeared to have lowered its threshold for the acceptable civilian casualty rate during the Gaza war. 'Combine that with the acceleration these systems offer — as well as the questions of accuracy — and the end result is a higher death count than was previously imagined in war.' The IDF said claims that its use of AI endangers lives are 'off the mark.' 'The more ability you have to compile pieces of information effectively, the more accurate the process is,' the IDF said in a statement to The Post. 'If anything, these tools have minimized collateral damage and raised the accuracy of the human-led process.' A week's work in 30 minutes A major transformation within Unit 8200, Israel’s elite intelligence division, has been revealed, showing a dramatic shift toward engineering and technology roles under the leadership of Yossi Sariel. According to a Washington Post investigation, by October 7, 2023, 60% of Unit 8200 personnel worked in engineering and technological capacities—double the percentage from a decade ago. This shift came at the expense of traditional roles, including experts in Arabic language, and involved the dismissal of officers critical of adopting artificial intelligence. The report highlights the integration of AI tools like 'The Gospel,' a system developed using hundreds of predictive algorithms designed to process vast quantities of data—referred to by the IDF as 'the pool.' The software generates recommendations for military targets, including tunnels, rockets and other infrastructure, which are reviewed by analysts and ultimately approved by senior officers for inclusion in the target database. A military source familiar with the systems told the Post that the AI’s image recognition capabilities allow soldiers to identify subtle patterns in satellite imagery, such as minor terrain changes indicating newly buried rocket launchers or tunnels. This level of analysis compressed work that previously took a week into just 30 minutes. However, the rapid adoption of AI has raised concerns among some officers. Critics argue the technology’s speed conceals its limitations, such as inaccuracies in Arabic-language processing, where slang and keywords were reportedly misunderstood. A former senior military official noted that intelligence reports presented to commanders often did not clarify whether data was derived from human sources or AI, complicating the evaluation process. 'Everything was treated as the same,' another former senior official said. 'I’m not even sure the person preparing the report knew the difference between the pieces of information.' The Israeli military utilizes advanced AI systems, including 'The Gospel' and 'Lavender,' to predict potential civilian casualties during operations. These tools rely on data mining software that combines image recognition from drone footage with tracking data from smartphones connected to cellular antennas to estimate the number of civilians in a targeted area. In 2014, the IDF’s accepted civilian-to-combatant casualty ratio was one civilian per senior terrorist, said Tal Mimran, a former legal advisor to the military. According to Breaking the Silence, a group citing testimonies from IDF soldiers, that ratio has risen during the current war to 15 civilians per low-ranking terrorist and exponentially higher for mid- and senior-level operatives. The New York Times recently reported the figure may be closer to 20 civilians per terrorist. The IDF has maintained that its assessments of collateral damage comply with international law, which requires distinguishing between civilians and combatants and taking precautions to minimize harm to non-combatants. Internal debate: Man vs. machine Supporters of these technologies argue that aggressive implementation of AI innovations is essential for the survival of a small nation facing determined and powerful adversaries. 'Technological superiority is what keeps Israel safe,' said Blaise Misztal, vice president for policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, who was briefed by the IDF’s intelligence division on its AI capabilities in 2021. 'The faster Israel is able to identify enemy capabilities and take them off the battlefield, the shorter a war is going to be, and it will have fewer casualties.' However, concerns about the quality of AI-generated intelligence have sparked internal divisions within the IDF. According to three sources, the reliance on such technology has shifted priorities, favoring technical capabilities over traditional practices. For example, Unit 8200 has long allowed junior analysts to bypass their immediate commanders and relay warnings directly to senior officials. Some worry that the reliance on AI systems may have undermined this practice, potentially weakening the IDF's decision-making processes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sariel has resigned from the military, citing his responsibility for the intelligence failures leading to Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7. The resignation was submitted to IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Military Intelligence Chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder. According to two former senior officers interviewed by the Post, the unit’s growing reliance on AI was a key factor in Israel’s lack of preparedness. They claim an overemphasis on technological findings hindered analysts from effectively conveying warnings to top commanders. 'This was an AI factory,' said one former military leader, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe national security topics. 'The man was replaced by the machine.' Sariel’s name surfaced after a security breach reported by The Guardian. A book he authored, The Human Machine Team, published on Amazon, revealed a digital trail linked to a personal Google account under his name. The account contained unique identifiers and maps tied to his work. The book outlines Sariel’s vision of integrating AI into defense, emphasizing how it could revolutionize the relationship between humans and machines in military operations. Before taking command of Unit 8200, Sariel spent a sabbatical year at the Pentagon-funded National Defense University in Washington. A professor from the institution described Sariel’s radical vision for AI on the battlefield, which he shared in his book. Sariel proposed that AI would transform all aspects of defense, including border security, turning Israel’s borders into 'smart borders' using advanced surveillance technologies. He also predicted that within five years, AI could replace 80% of intelligence analysts specializing in foreign languages. When Sariel returned to Israel, he implemented his vision. Appointed commander of Unit 8200 by then-IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi in the summer of 2020, Sariel faced internal concerns from former commanders who privately expressed worries about what they described as a 'religious attitude toward AI' developing under his leadership. Unit 8200, renowned for its cutting-edge cyber technologies and online intelligence gathering, has long held a reputation for technological excellence. However, the sheer volume of information often overwhelmed analysts. For instance, Hamas operatives frequently used the word 'watermelon' as code for a bomb, but the system struggled to differentiate between discussions about actual watermelons and encrypted messages. 'If you pick up a thousand conversations a day, do I really want to hear about every watermelon in Gaza?' one insider told the Washington Post. Under Sariel, the unit intensified its data mining efforts and restructured intelligence operations. New technologies were introduced to rapidly process algorithms in anticipation of a potential war with Hezbollah. One such innovation was an app called 'Hunter,' which allowed soldiers in the field to directly access intelligence data in real time. Long before Hamas’ surprise attack, Unit 8200 had been meticulously constructing a target bank, requiring analysts to verify findings with at least two independent sources and to continuously refresh the data, according to three individuals familiar with the program. Before a target could be added to the 'bank,' it had to be 'validated' by a senior officer and a military lawyer to ensure compliance with international law. Senior intelligence officials, including Sariel, believed machine learning could dramatically accelerate this process. 'They really did believe with all the sensors they had all around and above Gaza, I won’t say total informational awareness, but that they had a very good picture of what was happening inside,' said Misztal, who leads an organization focused on security cooperation between the United States and Israel. Following the events of October 7, Unit 8200 has reportedly increased efforts to recruit additional Arabic-speaking analysts, including those tasked with evaluating and critiquing AI systems, according to three sources cited by the Post. Meanwhile, Israeli officials are notably more restrained in their public remarks about the use of artificial intelligence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjyhbn1ikx	2024-12-29T21:40:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/06/08/Hkg7m7N1P3/Hkg7m7N1P3_46_0_1185_667_0_small.jpg

Military expert: Israel has not yet defeated Hamas	Brig.-Gen. (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser says increasing Israel's troop presence in Gaza could pressure Hamas to show more flexibility in releasing hostages Israel has not yet defeated Hamas, according to Brig.-Gen. (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser. 'We are not yet at the point of defeating Hamas entirely,' he told ILTV on Sunday. 'More power needs to be invested in this effort.' He explained that increasing Israel's troop presence in Gaza and demonstrating unwavering resolve could pressure Hamas to show more flexibility in releasing hostages. Kuperwasser's comments came after Israel launched a major operation in Jabaliya over the weekend. During the operation, Israeli soldiers captured more than 240 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists and dismantled a terror base located at Kamal Adwan Hospital.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkz7viylyl	2024-12-29T19:54:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/SyQtMUZ1Lye/SyQtMUZ1Lye_0_71_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Festive gatherings ease the toll of war for Israeli soldiers	Mimi Rozmaryn: 'We can take a moment from the serious crisis that we’re facing and enjoy togetherness' Every day seems to bring news of another soldier lost in the battle against Hamas in Gaza. This grim reality has persisted for 15 months, taking a heavy toll on Israeli morale. To help ease the pain and uplift the spirits of those fighting on the frontlines, several organizations are stepping in to bring moments of joy to the soldiers. One such organization is Meir Panim, which has been hosting festive Hanukkah parties to remind everyone that even in the darkest times, there is still room for light and hope. 'We can take a moment from the serious crisis that we’re facing and enjoy togetherness, appreciating the fact that we’re able to continue our mission to help bring light to each person in need,' said Meir Panim’s Director of Global Development, Mimi Rozmaryn. 'We are really feeling the toll of this year of war and the stress on our communities,' she added. 'What we’re hearing is that the fact we’re able to keep going and provide these events—even doing things like sending pizza to families of reservists or organizing parties for troops on the frontlines—is a reminder to our communities that we stand behind them.'

Israeli surrogate faces twin pregnancy with husband in reserves	Carmel Eliyahu-Zinger says she always dreamed of being a surrogate but didn't expect to get pregnant in the middle of a war while raising three kids and worrying about her husband in extended reserve duty Carmel Eliyahu-Zinger, 36, from Kibbutz Ma'agan, who is married and a mother of three and pregnant with twins as a surrogate, recounted the story of her decision to help other couples while also dealing with the war in Gaza, her role as director of rehabilitation services at Natan Medical and her husband’s service in the IDF reserves. 'The idea of surrogacy has been with me since my teenage years. I saw a film about it and thought it was the best thing one could do, but it stayed as just an idea. I met my husband when I was 17 and when I mentioned it to him before we got married, he was appalled. 'He felt it was like giving up your own baby, your flesh and blood. After our children were born, the topic occasionally came up. As I approached my 35th birthday I realized I wasn’t getting any younger and if I wanted to act, it had to be now,' she said. 'Before the war, the mood in Israel felt like a civil war was brewing and I felt I had to do something for others to avoid succumbing to that despair. One evening, amid dinner and bath routines, I casually mentioned it to my husband, and he said, 'Well, maybe now’s the right time.' I left my details with SurMom, a company specializing in surrogacy, and they got back to me within hours. It felt almost cosmic.' 'I underwent many tests before I even found a couple to carry for: childbirth summaries, gynecological check-ups, a breast surgeon evaluation and psychological assessments. Then the company sent me stories of potential couples.' If a woman chooses this willingly, with her motives thoroughly vetted and uses her power and control over her body to give a gift to someone else, I think there’s nothing more empowering 'I initially thought I’d choose a same-sex couple for ideological reasons, but ultimately, a heterosexual couple’s story touched my heart and I couldn’t help but want to help them. My husband and I met them in July 2023 and the chemistry was immediate. From that moment, everything felt natural.' 'The war hit us during the peak of embryo transfers and hormonal treatments. My husband, a combat soldier and company commander, was in continuous reserve service from October to February, then received another call-up until recently.' 'I had to undergo intense hormonal treatments and frequent blood tests while managing three kids on my own. The emotional and physical strain was immense. At one point, I considered either committing fully or pausing and postponing the process, but I decided to continue for the sake of the couple.' 'I was juggling concerns for my husband, kids, home and work — I oversee rehabilitation services in the northern district of Natan Medical, supporting individuals with mental illnesses, and I’m also a psychotherapist. It was hard to manage everything and, just when I reached my limit, the third embryo transfer resulted in a pregnancy,' she recounted. 'I went to major check-ups with the intended parents and smaller ones on my own. My husband came home every three weeks to support and strengthen me, though the army didn’t grant him any exemptions because of me. Thankfully, I live in a kibbutz where friends could help with groceries and other tasks. My parents, in-laws and even my pregnant sister-in-law also pitched in.' 'Still, being a reservist’s wife is a lonely experience. One night, I woke up with a severe sore throat and a high fever, unsure whether to go to the hospital because I didn’t know who’d watch the kids if I were admitted.' 'People around me mostly asked why I was doing surrogacy, saying things like: 'You must be making a lot of money, enough to pay off your mortgage and loans.' I usually just go along with it and say, 'Sure, it’s all about the money.'' 'What they don’t understand is that the compensation — 170,000 shekels ($46,267) — won’t pay off a mortgage. What will I do with the money? Probably a family vacation and save the rest.' 'The pregnancy’s been challenging physically. Two embryos at 20 weeks and my belly is already huge. It’s heavy and I’m exhausted. But there’s something freeing about not having the anxieties of raising these children after birth. If these twins were mine, it’d be a very different experience. Knowing I’ll pass the child-rearing to someone else is liberating,' she said. 'There’s a debate in Israeli society about the ethics of surrogacy and the discussion itself highlights the issue. If a woman chooses this willingly, with her motives thoroughly vetted and uses her power and control over her body to give a gift to someone else, I think there’s nothing more empowering.'

Another call-up is coming soon and it’s tough, but I’m proud of my husband. The pregnancy drains my resources and energy but it’s about giving to those who need it — and that’s a value I deeply connect with during this time.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/r1tghq1ikg	2024-12-29T13:04:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/27/BkZdiZSm1x/BkZdiZSm1x_0_32_1192_671_0_small.jpg

Turkish officials say Israel 'betting on wrong horse in Syria'	Ankara stressed Jerusalem's skepticism of de facto Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani) is 'beneficial to the Iranian snake' and that cooperation in the region could better both country's positions Senior Turkish officials warned on Sunday that Israel was 'betting on the wrong horse in Syria' for its skepticism toward Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani) and risks missing a rare opportunity to collaborate with the new regime that 'seeks to maintain stability in the country.' 'Chaos in Syria is beneficial to the Iranian snake; the Iranians have an interest in reigniting the civil war. Peace in Syria is bad for the Ayatollahs,' Ankara officials said. They assert that Israel is making a mistake by dismissing al-Golani. 'Israel ignores his positive overtures and actions, such as seizing weapons and his statements against Iran and Hezbollah. Israel and Turkey share mutual interests in Syria and both should cooperate to advance them,' the officials said. The officials added that, contrary to various reports, it was Israel that approached Turkey with a proposal for a military coordination mechanism between the two nations. Israel suggested dividing Syria into three geographic zones reflecting each side’s interests: Turkey would have interests in the northern sector, requiring Israeli pre-approval for operations there. Israel would have freedom of action in the south, while both sides would need to notify each other before operating in the central region. According to the officials, Turkey agreed to dialogue but rejected the geographic division proposal. Turkish officials highlighted that the coordination mechanism between Jerusalem and Ankara worked effectively during the war in Lebanon, citing instances where Turkey shared coordinates of Turkish evacuation convoys and Israel refrained from striking areas they were located in. 'There’s no reason it shouldn’t work just as effectively in Syria just as coordination worked well in Lebanon,' they said. Ankara expressed anger over Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar’s statements in favor of Israeli cooperation with the Kurdish minority in Syria. 'Israel is once again betting on the wrong horse and doesn’t understand that the Kurds controlling the Iraq-Syria border are the ones enabling Iran to smuggle weapons into Syria and Hezbollah in exchange for money,' they said. According to them, the 'Iranian snake' benefits from Syria's instability as Tehran has an interest in prolonging the conflict. 'Israel and Turkey should have a shared interest in achieving stability as quickly as possible,' they added. Since Bashar Assad’s fall and the end of the war, a significant escalation has been taking place in northern Syria between Turkish-backed rebel groups and local Kurdish forces, some of which are supported by the U.S. Turkish air force jets. Turkish forces have been striking Kurdish targets in the region and reports indicate that Ankara is amassing forces near the Syrian border in preparation for a possible ground invasion. The conflict between Turkey and the Kurds has persisted for over 40 years. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) issued an intriguing statement on Sunday quoting its imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan. In the statement, Ocalan hinted at a willingness to lay down arms and end the Kurdish struggle against Turkey. Ankara has repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that it won’t allow the People's Defense Units (YPG) Kurdish militia, which it considers the PKK's military arm, to operate in the 'new Turkey.'

Hundreds of terrorists captured: Massive IDF operation ending in ...	IDF troops captured over 240 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists in Jabaliya while neutralizing terrorist strongholds; The Kamal Adwan Hospital, used as a terror base, was cleared of civilians and secured; Fighting continued in Beit Hanoun from where rockets were fired at Israel For the 162nd Division, which has been leading the offensive operation in the northern Gaza Strip for the past three months, the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya was the last major Hamas stronghold in the city. Its fall this past weekend marked the conclusion of the operation in Jabaliya, although a few remaining tasks will continue this week. Over 240 terrorists were arrested during the operation, and approximately 20 were killed. Meanwhile, fighting continued on Sunday in Beit Hanoun, the primary target of IDF attacks in the northern Gaza Strip. In the afternoon, five rockets were launched from the area toward Sderot and its surroundings. IDF reports stated that three of the rockets were intercepted, while the others likely exploded in open areas. Shayetet 13 amphibious commandos found a small cache of weapons at the hospital in Jabaliya but encountered a massive concentration of terrorists – the largest found in a single location in the Gaza Strip – who were arrested simultaneously. Commanders from the 401st Armored Brigade, which led the operation, said some Hamas terrorists wore fake bandages to disguise themselves as patients. IDF ensured the safe evacuation of medical teams, hundreds of patients, as well as displaced women and children who had taken refuge in the hospital, transferring them to the Indonesian Hospital located on the outskirts of Jabaliya’s refugee camp. The raid on the hospital began about a week ago with an aerial pursuit of the facility, starting at 3:00 a.m. on Friday. Infantry fighters from the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade, alongside armored forces from the 401st Brigade, identified two terror squads attempting to flee the hospital as forces arrived and encircled the compound within an hour. Squads were eliminated from the air, and it became apparent to the forces that most of the surrounding 'civilian' buildings housed combat positions, booby traps, and hundreds of weapons. These were prepared for terrorists who were meant to emerge 'innocently' from the hospital, arm themselves in these nearby buildings, and mobilize for combat. A D9 bulldozer operator from the 401st Brigade, a career soldier with prior experience in operations at the hospital, led the route into the compound. His alertness prevented a major disaster. From the protected cabin of his massive bulldozer, he spotted a cable stretched across the road near the hospital entrance. He halted all forces and reported that he hadn’t seen the cable before. Specialized engineering units cautiously advanced to the location and identified the cable as part of a large explosive device, which was safely neutralized. 'Kamal Adwan Hospital had become a Hamas terror base. We carefully and precisely evacuated about 600 civilians from it, while thoroughly screening for terrorists,' said IDF officials. 'During the fighting on the outskirts of the hospital, forces eliminated 19 militants without any injuries among our soldiers. Hamas had heavily fortified its stronghold at the hospital. We still have follow-up tasks to complete at the site, and for now, no one will be allowed to return to it.' 'The 401st Brigade completed a targeted operation against a Hamas command center located inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital on Saturday,' a message from the IDF Spokesperson said. 'The forces launched a swift and covert operation, encircling the area of Kamal Adwan Hospital. As part of the operation, the forces carried out the safe evacuation of civilians from the area of the hospital. The area near the hospital is an active combat zone and rigged by terrorists with booby traps and explosives. During the operation, approximately 20 terrorists were eliminated, and powerful explosive devices planted by the terrorists were neutralized.' The spokesperson added: 'The operation was conducted following extensive intelligence-gathering efforts and based on various sources from the Intelligence Directorate and the ISA, which indicated the presence of hundreds of terrorists in the vicinity of the hospital. Field investigators from Unit 504 directed the apprehension process and conducted hundreds of field interrogations to transfer 240 terrorists belonging to the Islamic Jihad and Hamas terrorist organizations for further investigation in Israeli territory. The terrorists apprehended are expected to provide valuable intelligence to aid in the ongoing war efforts.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to IDF officials, this was one of the largest terrorist arrest operations conducted in a single location since the start of the war. 'During the arrests, some terrorists attempted to disguise themselves as patients, and others even hid in ambulances, but they were identified by the forces and detained. Among those arrested were 15 terrorists who participated in Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel on October 7 last year,' IDF stated. While Israeli forces operated near the hospital, terrorists fired anti-tank missiles and RPGs at the troops and attempted additional terror attacks, with no resulting casualties on the Israeli side. terrorist gunmen were eliminated in swift counterattacks. Additionally, Air Force targeted and killed militants attempting to flee the area. More than ten investigators from Unit 504 operated on the ground, utilizing advanced intelligence systems and technologies. Most of the interrogated militants were active members of the military wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Some field interrogations led, in real time, to the identification of additional operatives in the area. Humanitarian efforts Prior to the operation, according to IDF reports, 350 patients, escorts and staff were evacuated from the hospital in recent weeks in coordination with the Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration. Tens of thousands of gallons of fuel, along with hundreds of food and medical supply packages, were delivered to the hospital. During the operation, in coordination with the Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration and health officials, 95 patients, escorts and staff were evacuated to the Indonesian Hospital. Additionally, 1,320 gallons of fuel, two generators, and medical equipment were delivered to maintain essential services and operate the Indonesian Hospital. Hundreds of civilians were also safely evacuated from the area through organized routes to protect their safety. IDF identified Jabaliya as the core Hamas stronghold in the northern Gaza Strip, where hundreds of terrorists, including senior Hamas commanders, had concentrated. Despite earlier operations in the city –including a ground maneuver about a year ago and a raid by the 98th Division on its refugee camp in May – the military began operating in the area again approximately three months ago. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jbpek8ye	2024-12-29T10:23:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/rJWxlgkkUJg/rJWxlgkkUJg_0_128_974_549_0_small.jpg

The senior Hezbollah official's 4 mistresses and the time Netanya...	A New York Times investigation reveals the extent of the Israeli security apparatus' infiltration into Hezbollah, including new details about the exploding pager operation and the assassination of Nasrallah About a month after the cease-fire in Lebanon went into effect , a New York Times investigation published on Sunday reveals how deeply Israel has infiltrated Hezbollah and closely monitored its commanders over the years. The investigation, based on interviews with dozens of current and former senior officials in governments and intelligence agencies in Europe, the United States and Israel, reveals the broad scope of Israeli infiltration. Even up until Hassan Nasrallah's final moments , he did not believe that Israel would kill him. In late September, he moved to a bunker 12 meters underground. His aides urged him to take more extreme precautions to protect his life but, according to intelligence gathered by Israel and shared with its Western allies, he did not listen to them. He thought Israel was not interested in a full-scale war. Nasrallah also did not realize that Israeli spy agencies were tracking his every move, and had been doing so for years. It was also the result of two decades of systematic intelligence work in preparation for an all-out war that many in Israel knew would one day come. Building a network of sources The Second Lebanon War in 2006 ended in a stalemate for Israel. But actions during that war formed the basis for the current approach. In one operation, according to information provided by Israel to the United States, tracking devices were planted on Hezbollah's Fajr missiles which provided Israel with information about weapons hidden inside secret military bases, civilian storage facilities and private homes. In the 2006 war, the Israeli Air Force bombed the sites and destroyed the missiles. Ten current and former American and Israeli officials told the NYT that, as Hezbollah rebuilt itself, the Mossad expanded its network of human sources within the terrorist organization. For example, the Mossad recruited people in Lebanon who had helped Hezbollah set up its network of secret facilities and knew where they were. Those sources fed the Mossad with information about the locations of the bases and facilities, and helped the Intelligence Directorate monitor what was happening at those facilities. Israel generally shared intelligence about Hezbollah with the United States and its European allies. The place where Nasrallah was killed in Dahieh In 2012, the intelligence Unit 8200 obtained extensive information about the location of Hezbollah leaders and their hiding places. Five senior officials in European and U.S. intelligence agencies, based on a briefing they received from Israel, said that a significant moment came in 2012, when Unit 8200 was able to obtain a wealth of information about the precise whereabouts of Hezbollah leaders, their hiding places, and the organization's missile and rocket batteries. This operation raised confidence among Israeli intelligence agencies that, if Netanyahu carried out his threats to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, the IDF could help 'neuter' Hezbollah's ability to respond. Shortly after that operation, Netanyahu visited the headquarters of Unit 8200 in Tel Aviv, and during the visit, the unit's commander printed out all the information collected by the Intelligence Directorate about Hezbollah, and presented the huge pile to Netanyahu. 'You can now attack Iran,' he told Netanyahu, while standing next to the pile. Israel, as we know, ultimately did not attack. Over the next few years, Israeli intelligence agencies worked to refine the intelligence gathered from the previous operation and produce information that could be used in the event of a war with Hezbollah. According to a senior Israeli security official, when the Second Lebanon War ended in 2006, Israel had 'target files' on just under 200 Hezbollah leaders, operatives, weapons caches and missile sites. By the time Israel launched its major operation against Hezbollah in September, Israel’s target bank had grown to about 30,000. Turn pagers into deadly devices Ultimately, in order to gain an advantage in the war that was about to break out with Hezbollah, Israel also developed plans to sabotage the organization from within and to provide it with booby-trapped electronic devices. This was a joint operation by the Mossad and the Military Intelligence Directorate, especially Unit 8200, because it was designed to be included in Israel's war plan, a critical element in the IDF's calculations for a possible conflict, whether as a result of a planned attack by Israel or in response to a surprise attack by Hezbollah. Within the Israeli intelligence community, the devices were known as 'buttons' that could be activated whenever Israel chose to do so. To design and manufacture the buttons, Israeli engineers specialized in placing PETN explosives inside the batteries of electronic devices, turning them into small bombs. The most complex part of the operation was carried out by the Mossad, which for nearly a decade had tricked Hezbollah into purchasing military equipment and communications equipment from Israeli shell companies. First reports of explosions in Beirut The Mossad deceived Hezbollah, and the first pagers rigged with explosives were sent to Lebanon in 2015 In 2014, Israel had seized an opportunity when Japanese technology company iCOM stopped making its popular IC-V82 walkie-talkies. The devices, originally assembled in Osaka, Japan, were so popular that copies were already being produced across Asia and sold on online forums and in black market transactions. Seven American, Israeli and European officials told the Times that Unit 8200 had discovered that Hezbollah was specifically seeking the same device to equip all of the organization’s frontline forces, even designing a special vest for its men with a chest pocket that accommodated the device. Israel has begun producing its own copies of the IC-V82 walkie-talkies with minor modifications, including packing explosives into the batteries. The first Israeli-made copies arrived in Lebanon in 2015, and more than 15,000 were eventually shipped there. In 2018, an Israeli Mossad intelligence officer devised a plan that would use a similar technique to implant explosives into a pager battery. Israeli intelligence chiefs reviewed the plan, but according to three officials they determined that Hezbollah’s use of pagers was not widespread enough, and the plan was shelved. Over the next three years, Israel’s ability to hack cell phones improved even more, causing Hezbollah, Iran, and their allies to be more cautious about using smartphones. Concerned, Hezbollah’s leadership decided to expand its use of pagers. Such devices allowed them to send messages to forces in the field, but they did not reveal location data and did not have cameras or microphones that could be hacked. Israeli intelligence officers reconsidered the pager operation, and worked to build a network of shell companies to hide their Israeli identities and sell the products to Hezbollah. Israeli intelligence officers targeted the Taiwanese brand 'Gold Apollo,' known for the pagers it produces. In May 2022, a company called BAC Consulting was registered in Budapest, and a month later, in Sofia, Bulgaria, a company called Norta Global Ltd. was registered in the name of a Norwegian citizen named Rinson Josue. It was Unit 8200 that identified Hezbollah's need for the new product. The Mossad oversaw the production of the pagers in Israel, and through intermediaries, the organization's agents began marketing them to Hezbollah buyers - offering a discounted price for bulk purchases. During a meeting in March 2023, the Mossad presented Netanyahu with the gadget, without a hidden explosive. The prime minister was skeptical about the durability of the pagers, and asked Mossad head Dedi Barnea how easily they could break. Barnea assured him that they were strong. The prime minister was not convinced, abruptly got up from his chair and threw the device against the wall of his office. The wall cracked, but the pager did not. The Mossad front company sent the first batch of pagers to Hezbollah in the fall of 2023. War Games management The pager operation was not fully in place until October 2023, when war broke out following the surprise attack by Hamas. Even as Israel focused on Hamas, military and intelligence officials continued to work on plans for war with Hezbollah. Israeli intelligence analysts who had been closely monitoring Hezbollah’s use of the devices discovered a potential problem with the operation. According to a report provided by Israel to the United States, at least one Hezbollah technician began to suspect that the radios might contain hidden explosives. Israel quickly dealt with this and killed the technician in an airstrike. Along the way, Israel has collected routine and intimate details about Hezbollah commanders, including the identities of four mistresses of 'Hajj Muhsin,' the nickname of Fuad Shukar, considered Hezbollah’s most senior military commander who was assassinated in July . At one point this year, apparently feeling uncomfortable about his situation, Shukar sought help from Hezbollah’s top cleric in order to marry all four women, according to two Israeli and one European source. The cleric, Hashem Safi al-Din, who was also later assassinated, organized four separate, quick wedding ceremonies for Shukar, thus making the relationships acceptable. Meanwhile, new intelligence disrupted the planning: Hezbollah operatives suspected that someone had been 'tampering' with the pagers they were using. On September 11, suspicions arose that experts might be checking the devices, and Israel knew that it was only a matter of time before the covert operation would be discovered. On September 16, Netanyahu met with senior security officials to consider whether to blow up the pagers. 'Use it or lose it,' they told him. Some opposed it, saying it could provoke a full-scale counterattack by Hezbollah, and perhaps even lead to an attack by Iran. Netanyahu accepted the recommendation to act, and the next day, at 3:30 p.m. local time, the Mossad and Military Intelligence activated the system to activate the devices and send an encrypted message to the thousands of pagers. Seconds later, they exploded.

Jose was exposed in news reports as having participated in the operation, and the Norwegian government announced that it was demanding that he return to the country for questioning. Israel secretly pressured the Biden administration to ensure that Jose could leave the United States without returning to Norway, and the officials involved did not reveal his whereabouts, saying only that he was in a 'safe place.' Assassination confirmation For almost a year, the Intelligence Directorate, Unit 8200 and the Israeli Air Force conducted about 40 'war games' built around the elimination of Nasrallah and other senior Hezbollah leaders, according to two Israeli sources. They wanted to be able to attack them at the same time, even if they were not in the same place. The most significant decision was whether or not to eliminate Nasrallah. While Israeli officials debated, intelligence agencies received new information that Nasrallah was planning to move to another bunker, one that would be much harder to hit. On September 26, a few hours before Netanyahu was scheduled to fly to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, the prime minister met with his senior political, intelligence, and military advisers to discuss authorizing the assassination. They also had to decide whether to tell the Americans in advance. Netanyahu and other senior advisers opposed Israel informing the Biden administration about the assassination, as they believed that the Americans would pressure it not to carry it out, but that the United States would nevertheless come to its defense in the event that Iran retaliated for the assassination. They agreed to keep the Americans in the dark. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hylchykikg	2024-12-29T09:42:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/B1r80DRSJg/B1r80DRSJg_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

Should I say my last words?': South Korea plane crash is country...	Nearly 180 people were killed in the accident, including five children; Footage of Boeing aircraft prior to landing shows burning engines The deadliest air accident ever in South Korea killed 179 people on Sunday, when an airliner belly-landed and skidded off the end of the runway, erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall at Muan International Airport. Jeju Air (089590.KS), opens new tab flight 7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok with 175 passengers and six crew on board, was attempting to land shortly after 9 a.m. (0000 GMT) at the airport in the south of the country, South Korea's transport ministry said. Two crew members survived and were being treated for injuries. The passengers’ age ranged from 3 to 78 and five of the victims were reported to be children below the age of 10. The deadliest air accident on South Korean soil was also the worst involving a South Korean airline in nearly three decades, according to the transport ministry. The twin-engine Boeing 737-800 was seen in local media video skidding down the runway with no visible landing gear before crashing into navigation equipment and a wall in an explosion of flames and debris. 'Only the tail part retains a little bit of shape, and the rest of (the plane) looks almost impossible to recognize,' Muan fire chief Lee Jung-hyun told a press briefing. The two crew members, a man and a woman, were rescued from the tail section of the burning plane, Lee said. They were being treated at hospitals with medium to severe injuries, said the head of the local public health center. Authorities combed nearby areas for bodies possibly thrown from the plane, Lee said. Investigators are examining bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors, Lee said. Yonhap news agency cited airport authorities as saying a bird strike may have caused the landing gear to malfunction. The crash was the worst for any South Korean airline since a 1997 Korean Air crash in Guam that killed more than 200 people, according to transportation ministry data. The previous worst on South Korean soil was an Air China crash that killed 129 in 2002. Experts said the bird strike report and the way the aircraft attempted to land raised more questions than answers. 'A bird strike is not unusual, problems with an undercarriage are not unusual,' said Airline News editor Geoffrey Thomas. 'Bird strikes happen far more often, but typically they don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves.' Under global aviation rules, South Korea will lead a civil investigation into the crash and automatically involve the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States where the plane was designed and built. ‘My last words’ Hours after the crash, family members gathered in the airport's arrival area, some crying and hugging as Red Cross volunteers handed out blankets. Many victims appeared to be residents of nearby areas returning from vacation, officials said. Families screamed and wept as a medic announced the names of victims identified by their fingerprints. Papers were circulated for families to write down their contact details. One relative stood at a microphone to ask for more information from authorities. 'My older brother died and I don’t know what’s going on,' he said. 'I don’t know.' Another asked journalists not to film. 'We are not monkeys in a zoo,' he said. 'We are the bereaved families.' Mortuary vehicles lined up outside to take bodies away, and authorities said a temporary morgue had been established. The crash site smelled of aviation fuel and blood, according to Reuters witnesses. Workers in protective suits and masks combed the area while soldiers searched through bushes. The control tower issued a bird strike warning and shortly afterward the pilots declared mayday and then attempted to land from the opposite direction, a transport ministry official said. A passenger texted a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing, the News1 agency reported. The person's final message was: 'Should I say my last words?' The aircraft was manufactured in 2009, the transport ministry said. The two CFM56-7B26 engines were manufactured by CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace (GE.N), opens new tab and France's Safran (SAF.PA), opens new tab, the transport ministry said. A CFM spokesperson said, 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of Jeju Air flight 2216. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of those on board.' Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae apologized for the accident, bowing deeply during a televised briefing. He said the aircraft had no record of accidents and there were no early signs of malfunction. The airline will cooperate with investigators and make supporting the bereaved its top priority, Kim said. No abnormal conditions were reported when the aircraft left Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, said Kerati Kijmanawat, president of Airports of Thailand. The passengers included two Thai nationals and the rest are believed to be South Koreans, according to the transportation ministry. It was the first fatal flight for Jeju Air, a low-cost airline founded in 2005 that ranks behind only Korean Air Lines (003490.KS), opens new tab and Asiana Airlines in terms of the number of passengers in South Korea. The accident happened only three weeks after Jeju Air started regular flights from Muan to Bangkok and other Asian cities on Dec. 8. Muan International is one of South Korea's smallest airports but it has seen the number of international passengers jump nearly 20 times to 310,702 from January to November from the same period in 2022, according to government data. The Boeing model involved in the crash, a 737-800, is one of the world’s most flown airliners with a generally strong safety record. It was developed well before the MAX variant involved in a recent Boeing safety crisis. Boeing said in an emailed statement, 'We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew.' The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. All domestic and international flights at Muan airport were canceled, Yonhap reported. South Korean acting President Choi Sang-mok, named interim leader of the country on Friday in an ongoing political crisis, arrived at the scene of the accident and said the government was putting all its resources into dealing with the crash. Two Thai women were on the plane, aged 22 and 45, Thai government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsub said.

Staff Sergeant Yuval Shoham, 22, was killed in Jabaliya	He is the 9th graduate of Jerusalem's Himmelfarb High School to die in this war; His parents are close friends of Jon and Rachel, the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was murdered in Hamas captivity Staff Sergeant Yuval Shoham, 22, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the 9th Armored Battalion, 401st Iron Tracks Brigade, fell Sunday during combat in Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip, 'The boy is gone and I, where can I go,' the family announced, quoting the biblical statement by Reuben when he returns to the pit to rescue his brother Joseph only to find that he has beeen sold into slavery. 'Yuval Shoham, our dearly beloved son, was killed this morning in the Gaza Strip. Funeral details will be provided later.' Yuval is a graduate of Himmelfarb High School in Jerusalem, and is the ninth of its graduates to fall in the war. The school also lost Rabbi Avi Goldberg, who fell during the war and served as a teacher at the high school. Yuval's parents, Effi and Oshrat Shoham, leaders of the Hakhel synagogue community in the Baka neighborhood of Jerusalem, are close friends of Jon and Rachel, the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was murdered in Hamas captivity in Gaza, and whose body was rescued and returned to Israel. 'Hersh was here on Simchat Torah Eve. On Simchat Torah night, he was still here in the synagogue and danced here,' Oshrat said last September, after the announcement that he had been killed in captivity. 'Yesterday night, we realized with all the rumors what was happening. People from the community didn't sleep all night. At 5 a.m. we heard the news. We accompany the Goldberg-Polin family all year. Here Jon prays. Here Hersh prayed. This morning we spontaneously organized to create a space for the community. It really feels like he's our son. Everyone is very involved in the struggle. The whole neighborhood is here with Hersh signs. We didn't think it would end like this. Everyone was hoping that we would meet in the joy of liberation and not in this end. We didn't imagine such an end.' On Saturday, the IDF and Shin Bet spokespersons announced that security forces completed a joint operation at Hamas' 'terror headquarters' at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya and arrested more than 240 terrorists in the area. 'A targeted operation against terrorist targets was carried out at the hospital, following intelligence information that the area had once again been used as a Hamas terror stronghold and a shelter for terrorists, despite repeated calls to refrain from military use of medical facilities.' The joint statement also said that the forces of the 13th Battalion operated inside the hospital, and located weapons, including grenades, pistols and ammunition. 'During the operation in the area, over 240 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists and other operatives suspected of terror activities were apprehended, some of whom attempted to pose as patients or flee using ambulances,' according to the statement. 'Among the suspects taken for questioning was the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, who is suspected of being a Hamas terrorist operative, as well as Hamas engineering and anti-tank missile operatives, and approximately 15 terrorists who infiltrated Israel during the October 7th massacre.'

At the beginning of the operation, the forces of the 401st Brigade surrounded the hospital, arrested terrorists hiding in the area, and eliminated additional terrorists. The hospital was surrounded within an hour, and during the operation in the area, an anti-tank missile was fired at a force from Battalion 52. There were no casualties in the anti-tank incident. In initial field investigations by Unit 504 field investigators and Shin Bet coordinators, many terrorists who left the hospital testified that they had taken part in terrorist activity in the area. This was an extraordinary activity by Unit 504, in which the largest concentration of terrorists was investigated in one day and in one place since the beginning of the war. More than 10 investigators from the unit were active in the field, using intelligence knowledge systems and advanced technologies, and most of the terrorists who were interrogated were operatives in the military wing of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

Houthis make arrests fearing 'Israeli infiltration', report says	Arabic-language news outlet claims Iran-backed terror group fears Israeli intelligence operations that could lead to targeted assassinations against its leadership; Arrests come days after Houthis claimed to have uncovered a spy network in Yemen led by the CIA and Mossad UK-based Arabic-language outlet Asharq Al-Awsat on Sunday reported that Yemen’s Houthis carried out arrests in the provinces of Saada, Sanaa and Hodeidah over fears of 'Israeli infiltration' into their ranks. According to the report, the Houthis are concerned that the terror organization’s senior leaders could be targeted as Hezbollah leaders were in Lebanon. The report noted that the arrests came only days after the Houthis claimed to have uncovered a spy network in Yemen allegedly led by international intelligence agencies including the CIA and Mossad. 'The enemy tasked the spies with conducting intelligence operations, including surveillance and pinpointing the locations of missiles, drones, naval forces and other military sites,' according to the Houthis. They also alleged the 'spies' were instructed to track and locate military, political and security leaders, as well as prominent social figures. Sources told the outlet that the Houthis are in a state of panic due to the collapse of the Iranian axis and that the arrests are meant to 'spread terror' in Yemen to suppress opposition activity and prevent the possibility of a coup, similar to events in Syria with the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. According to these sources, the Houthis are using 'Israeli threats' as a pretext to detain civilians. The arrests come amid threats against the Houthis by Defense Minister Israel Katz following his statement last week. 'We will strike the strategic infrastructure of the Houthi terror organization and eliminate its leaders — just as we did to [Ismail] Haniyeh, [Yahya] Sinwar and [Hassan] Nasrallah — in Tehran, Gaza and Lebanon. We'll do the same in Hodeidah and Sanaa,' Katz said at the time. One example of the Houthis’ concerns can be seen in a post by senior Houthi figure Hazam al-Assad, who shared images of the terror organization’s senior members featured in the report, saying: 'They’re the ones who should be worried and afraid. We will not stop supporting our people in Gaza.'

Civil war: Trump supporters clash as Musk supports worker visas	Discussion on the incoming Trump administration's policies on immigration spark war on social media as Musk seems to go against the president-elect's 'America first' principle U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s camp has been celebrating the achievement and preparing for his return to the White House next month ever since his election victory. Over the weekend, however, significant cracks emerged within his camp as his most prominent supporter clashed openly with others over immigration policy. Trump’s most vocal supporters likely didn’t anticipate a confrontation with Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who helped fuel Trump’s presidential run. Musk has been outspoken in his support for Trump’s plans for mass deportations and stringent immigration restrictions. Yet, it now seems he has one major caveat: the H1B visa, which allows foreign workers with academic or technical expertise to work in the U.S. for up to six years. This visa is a cornerstone of Silicon Valley, enabling tech professionals from around the world, including many Israelis, to live and work in the U.S. Amid a firestorm on X, Musk wrote to Trump supporters: 'F*** yourself in the face.' The controversy was sparked by Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who had been close to Trump during the campaign. She criticized Trump’s decision to appoint Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-born tech entrepreneur as an advisor on artificial intelligence. Loomer highlighted Krishnan’s advocacy for lifting green card restrictions and easing the hiring of skilled foreign workers, calling these views 'directly opposed to Trump’s agenda.' Tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who will co-chair a Trump-appointed Department of Government Efficiency alongside Musk, defended the use of skilled foreign labor, saying, 'The U.S. doesn’t produce enough skilled workers and pretending otherwise will let China kick our a**.' Musk added: 'The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low.' Musk quickly realized the issue’s delicate nature as his comments alienated many Trump supporters and proponents of the 'America First' ideology. Far-right figure Ann Coulter attacked Musk, claiming he prefers H1B workers because they’re bound to their employers and can’t leave, unlike Americans. 'People like him want contract slaves,' she said, while others pointed out that Musk himself, now a U.S. citizen, is a South African immigrant. After several X users told Musk to 'go back to Africa,' he erupted on Friday, tweeting: 'The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B. Take a big step back and F*CK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.' Musk, who claimed he bought Twitter to preserve free speech online, retaliated on Saturday by showing just how little he values the principle: Loomer and others who criticized him lost their exclusive 'blue checkmarks' on the platform. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During his first term, Trump imposed significant restrictions on the H1B visa, but didn’t owe his victory to Musk at the time. In the early days of the current internal conflict, Trump refrained from intervening. However, in an interview published in the New York Post on Saturday, he appeared to side with Musk on this issue, praising the use of H1B visas. 'I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,' he said, despite having criticized them harshly in the past as 'very bad' and 'unfair' to American workers. 'I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,' Trump told the outlet. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1mltyyikl	2024-12-29T07:22:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/26/HJdoqQQ7kl/HJdoqQQ7kl_0_38_2205_1241_0_small.jpg

German politicians decry Elon Musk's AfD support as 'intrusive' e...	U.S. billionaire Elon Musk drew criticism from German politicians from the government and opposition on Sunday for an opinion piece he wrote backing the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) which they deemed 'intrusive' outside influence. The support of the AfD from Musk, who is set to serve U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration as an outside adviser, comes as Germans are set to vote on Feb. 23 after a coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed. The commentary published in German in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, flagship of the Axel Springer media group, expanded on a post by Musk on social media platform X last week in which he wrote 'only the AfD can save Germany' and praised the party's approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation. In response to the publication of his commentary, the editor of the newspaper's opinion section said on X that she had resigned.

Palestinian woman killed in gun battle between Hamas and PA	Hamas accuses Palestinian Authority security forces of killing Shatha al-Sabbagh, whose brother was a member of the group’s armed wing in Jenin; PA denies involvement, blaming 'lawless individuals' for the shooting Shatha al-Sabbagh, a communication student, was fatally shot in the head Saturday night in the Jenin refugee camp, reportedly by a sniper linked to Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces, according to the Hamas-affiliated Palestinian news agency Shehab. In response to her death, Jenin authorities declared a general strike in the city for Sunday. Her brother, Moatasem Sabbagh, was a known member of Hamas’ Jenin Brigade and was killed in an earlier exchange of gunfire with PA security forces. The incident has reignited tensions between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. Anwar Rajab, the official spokesperson for PA security forces, denied PA involvement in the killing, condemning it as 'a heinous crime committed by lawless individuals who fired indiscriminately, resulting in Shatha's death and damage to a nearby house.' Rajab affirmed the PA’s commitment to enforcing the rule of law, pledging a swift investigation to bring those responsible to justice. He urged residents to cooperate with authorities and provide any information that could assist in identifying the perpetrators. The initial reports of Shatha’s death were circulated by Hamas-affiliated media, which frequently criticizes PA security forces, particularly since the PA launched a major crackdown on terror groups in Jenin. Hamas issued its own statement, condemning the killing and accusing PA security forces of escalating violence in the refugee camp. 'This heinous crime led to her death,' the Hamas statement read. 'We reiterate our demand for the Palestinian Authority to cease attacks on our people in the camp, to embrace national initiatives to avoid further clashes, and to prevent the spilling of Palestinian blood.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas later acknowledged that Shatha’s brother was a member of its military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades. The group accused the PA of deliberately targeting her. 'The PA security forces killed the sister of our martyred Qassami fighter, Moatasem, in cold blood,' the statement said. 'This criminal act is yet another addition to a dark record of actions against our people, including killings, arrests and torture.' Shatha’s family also held the PA and its security forces directly responsible. 'We see this as a premeditated crime,' the family said in a statement. 'This dangerous escalation reveals the transformation of the PA security apparatus into an oppressive force that terrorizes its own people instead of protecting their dignity.' The PA’s operation in Jenin began roughly three weeks ago and has targeted militants accused of terrorism, arms trafficking, and attacks on PA security personnel. The campaign has resulted in the deaths of five PA officers and the arrest of numerous suspects linked to militant activities, including members of the Islamic Jihad. The killing of Shatha Sabbagh has further inflamed the already volatile situation in Jenin, deepening divisions among Palestinian factions and highlighting the fraught relationship between the PA and armed groups operating in the West Bank. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1s0yarbjl	2024-12-29T05:53:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/BygjGq0Hyl/BygjGq0Hyl_268_181_379_214_0_small.jpg

Hostage release talks on verge of collapse, report	Egyptian sources tell Qatari outlet that if Israel does not alter its position, talks will fail; members of negotiating team tell families they recommend comprehensive deal to free all 100 captives, say they are bound by silence while PM tells world war will not end The talks to reach a hostage release deal and cease-fire in Gaza are on the verge of collapse, the Qatari owned Al Arabi channel reported on Sunday quoting Egyptian sources. The sources blamed Israel and said that if the government does not change its conduct, the talks will fail. At the same time officials in the negotiation team told members of family of hostages that there is a gap between them and the government. 'While the negotiating team's professional view is that there must be a deal to return all of those held captive, dead or alive, the ministers insist on a partial deal that would see only some of the hostages freed,' the officials said. 'The team was sent without a mandate to negotiate an end to the war, despite the fact that it is the main demand of Hamas in exchange for all 100 hostages.' In their conversation with the families, the officials said they were instructed to remain silent about the negotiations while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made public statements to the foreign media, promising the war would not end.

Erin Molan challenges Pope Francis: ‘What should Israel do instea...	Former Sky News correspondent to the pope: ‘Use every iota of the considerable power you have to help end this war’ Former Australian Sky News correspondent Erin Molan has issued an impassioned plea to Pope Francis, urging him to leverage his global influence to help end the war between Israel and Hamas and to secure the release of hostages held by the terror group. 'Use every iota of the considerable power you have to help end this war, fight to bring the hostages home, and repeatedly condemn the terrorists who stole them,' Molan implored in a YouTube monologue published over the weekend. 'It would be the greatest light you could bring to the world. For Israel, yes; for the children of Gaza, absolutely; for all who value life, many of whom are understandably starting to lose hope. 'This is not just a moral mission, but a sacred one,' she continued. 'Your Holiness, it’s time. It’s time to help bring them home and end this war. For the sake of all children around the world and for the sake of humanity.' Molan’s appeal comes amid growing tensions between Israel and the Pope following his recent controversial comments about the conflict. The Pope has accused Israel of genocide in Gaza, described its actions as 'cruel,' and claimed that children were being 'machine-gunned down.' These statements have drawn sharp criticism from pro-Israel voices and from Israeli leaders. The former Sky News journalist was recently in Israel to visit communities near the southern border, meet with President Isaac Herzog, and receive briefings from top leaders. During her trip, she interviewed with Ynet News and delivered an opening monologue for ILTV. Molan’s tenure at Sky News ended abruptly, sparking speculation that her termination was linked to her vocal support for Israel. While the network has denied this claim, critics have suggested that her pro-Israel stance played a role in the decision. Her plea to the Pope underscored her deep concern for the hostages and her frustration with global leadership. She emphasized, 'This is a moment for moral clarity,' urging Pope Francis to prioritize the plight of the hostages and work towards a resolution to the conflict. Molan directly confronted Pope Francis, stating that his voice is not aiding the situation but is instead a 'detriment' to the Palestinians he claims to care about. 'You lament the deaths of children in Gaza, describing their suffering as cruel—as it is, you are absolutely spot on. It is utterly devastating. The issue I have is you seemingly lay the blame, the responsibility for this cruelty, solely at the feet of Israel, which, and I say this, I promise you, with the utmost respect, you are wrong,' Molan said. 'Israel is not perfect. No country is. Every single nation involved in war will make mistakes, and some individuals, whether they be in command or troops on the ground, will do the wrong thing. History has shown us that is a certainty, no matter how justified or noble the cause may be. But the difference between them, the democratic nation, and Hamas, the terrorists, is those from Israel who do the wrong thing will be held to account.' She underscored reports by the United States and other sources showing that Israel takes extensive measures to minimize civilian casualties, even when facing an enemy that actively targets civilians. Molan emphasized that the war could end if Hamas returned the hostages and laid down its arms. She reminded her audience that Hamas initiated this conflict on October 7, 2023, when they entered Israel, brutally killing 1,200 people and kidnapping more than 250. Molan also pointed out the equal worth of children on both sides of the conflict and that all children suffer so long as the conflict continues. 'No child in the Middle East will ever have peace whilst terrorism is allowed to flourish,' Molan said. 'The people of Israel cannot allow Hamas to exist, to rebuild, and rearm again. Their mission statement is to kill Jews and destroy Israel. It’s not subtle. They don’t hide it. They don’t disguise it and show it very clearly by their actions.' She challenged Pope Francis directly, asking what he believes Israel should do if not what it is already doing. She also warned him of the broader implications of inaction, reminding him that terrorism would eventually reach the West, possibly even his community. 'The Western world is not immune to the evil we witnessed on October 7,' Molan said. 'We are already seeing elements of it in Europe and America, Canada, and Australia, and the longer we accept what occurred, sit idly by, and in some cases, inexplicably defend it, the more widespread the carnage will become.' Molan concluded with a plea for action, emphasizing the power of the Pope’s platform. 'What you say and do matters,' she said. 'You are respected and revered around the world, and rightly so. I implore you to help end the cruelty you speak of suffered by children in Gaza. Please use your formidable voice and platform to put pressure on the terrorists, those actually responsible for their heartbreaking pain.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylif6aske	2024-12-29T03:45:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/HkQ7EpRS1g/HkQ7EpRS1g_0_0_698_398_0_small.jpg
Syria's de facto leader says holding elections could take up to f...	New Syria leader says in the first interview dealing with elections in Syria that drafting of new constitution could take up to three years Holding elections in Syria could take up to four years, Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said in remarks to be broadcast on Sunday, the first time he has commented on a possible electoral timetable since Bashar al-Assad was ousted this month. Drafting a new constitution could take up to three years, Sharaa said in written excerpts from the interview with the Saudi state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya, due to be transmitted later on Sunday. He also said it would take about a year for Syrians to see drastic changes. The comment from Sharaa, who leads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that ousted Assad on Dec. 8, comes as the new government in Damascus has been seeking to reassure its neighbors that it has moved away from its roots in Islamist militancy. The group's lightning campaign ended a 13-year civil war but has left a host of questions about the future of a multi-ethnic country previously held together by decades of authoritarian Assad family rule, and where foreign states including Turkey and Russia have strong and potentially competing interests. While Western powers largely welcomed the end of Assad family rule in Syria, it remains unclear whether the group will impose strict Islamic rule or show flexibility and move towards democracy. Sharaa said HTS, formerly known as the Nusra Front, would be dissolved at a national dialogue conference. The group was once affiliated with Islamic State and al-Qaeda but has since renounced both and sought to reposition itself as a force for moderation. It has repeatedly vowed to protect minority groups, who fear the new rulers could seek to impose an Islamist government and has warned of attempts to incite sectarian strife. In the interview, Sharaa said Syria shared strategic interests with Russia, a close Assad ally during the long civil war which has military bases in the country, reiterating conciliatory signals his government has made previously. Sharaa said earlier this month that Syria's relations with Russia should serve common interests.

'It is a question not only of maintaining our bases or strongholds, but also of the conditions of their operation, maintenance and provision, and interaction with the local side,' he said in an interview with Russian news agency RIA published on Sunday. Sharaa also said he hoped the administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on Syria. Senior U.S. diplomats who visited Damascus this month said Sharaa came across as pragmatic and that Washington has decided to remove a $10 million bounty on the HTS leader's head. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rknxzarr1g	2024-12-29T03:40:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/S1znMXmur1l/S1znMXmur1l_0_187_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Babak, lock the door' - Journalist under threat from Iran hears ...	Babak Eshaghi says was not surprised to learn of Iranian plot to abduct him after being warned by and under protection of Israeli security; says his Saudi funded opposition channel reaches anywhere in Iran and is watched by many considering it reliable source 'I was not surprised,' Iran International reporter Babak Eshaghi said after a plot to kidnap and assassinate him was revealed on Saturday. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) tried to lure him to Turkey and take him across the border to Iran. 'When you are considered in Tehran to be a terror organization, you behave accordingly,' he told Ynet in an interview on Sunday. According to IranWire, an opposition outlet, the IRGC devised a scheme to lure several Iran International journalists to a border region near Iran and abduct them into Iranian territory. The outlet based its report on details from the interrogation of Mohammad Hashemzadeh, a former Iranian political prisoner currently detained in Armenia. 'I've been under threat and am in contact with Israeli intelligence and security agencies. They have been keeping me updated and I consult with them before leaving the country,' he said. 'I trust them.' Eshaghi said this was not the first time that the Iranian regime tried to harm reporters for Iran International an outlet that is funded by Saudi Arabia. 'A number of months ago, members of the regime stabbed a colleague of mine in London and a year ago, a plot to attack the building housing our newspaper was uncovered. I received a call at home a few months back and the caller told me to lock the doors. I did and walked to the window to look outside. I saw police checking something. When I asked what was going on they told me there was a suspicious object outside. Now when we see at least five different cases of Israelis willing to work for Iran in exchange for payment, Iran could be and was behind this.' In the interview Eshaghi said he once received a message on WhatsApp from Professor Meir Litvak inviting him to a meeting, only the message came when he was sitting in a hall listening to the professor's lecture. 'I spoke to him later and realized the Iranians had breached his app and were sending messages. This is a small incident. There are many more,' he said. We broadcast to Iran over some 15 satellites and no one can block us,' he said. 'Even the most remote villages receive our transmissions using a small dish.

Rescued hostage reported hearing Hebrew during captivity, IDF say...	Information given to the families of six hostages executed by Hamas near the tunnel where Kaid Farhan Alkadi was found and extracted; IDF says suspended all operations using sensors to locate hostages but none were found until bodies discovered The IDF informed families of hostages executed by Hamas in Gaza that Kaid Farhan Alkadi who was rescued by forces in August told the troops that he had heard the voice of a female speaking Hebrew nearby. Later six Israelis were found executed in a Rafah tunnel. The information was given to the families of the six slain hostages last week and was not made known to the general public until a report on local channel 12 on Saturday. The military apologized for withholding the information. They said Alkadi had told the rescuers that he had been held in seclusion and had not seen any other hostages. Alkadi was found on his own after his captors escaped. The IDF said that his report of voices would not have changed the fate of the hostages because the military suspended all operations for 24-hours to assess the situation before continuing their offensive. At that time sensors were activated and there was no indication that any other hostages were nearby.

IDF officers warn against military stay in Syria|	Intelligence suggests terrorist cells are planning to target troops on the Syrian Golan; forces struggle to find purpose in their current mission; 'troops are frustrated by a mission without a visible enemy or meaningful operations' IDF commanders warned a prolonged stay of troops in the Syrian Golan Heights would lead to escalation of violence. After a relatively calm and optimistic start to the IDF’s deployment in the Syrian Golan, marked by a bloodless takeover and constructive dialogues with local Syrian leaders, tensions have escalated. Over the past week, two significant incidents involving IDF soldiers and Syrian protesters have highlighted growing unrest. Military commanders describe an operational environment lacking clear objectives, with soldiers stationed at static positions as far as 18–20 kilometers from the border. 'It’s only a matter of time before we face a surprise anti-tank missile or mortar fire,' said a senior IDF officer in the Northern Command. 'Troops are frustrated by a mission without a visible enemy or meaningful operations, especially after transitioning from intense combat against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.' The IDF presence, including daily tank movements through villages, has drawn protests. In one incident near Quneitra, IDF soldiers fired at demonstrators, injuring at least one person. The IDF claims troops felt threatened and emphasized efforts to de-escalate, aiming to engage positively with the 70,000 Syrians living in the area. Israeli intelligence has detected early signs that Islamist rebel groups from southern Syria, including near Daraa, are considering moving toward the Golan. While no militant cells have been spotted near the IDF positions, commanders are wary of armed groups exploiting the situation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The military has focused on disarming local communities, collecting hundreds of weapons left behind by fleeing Syrian army forces. In some cases, villagers have cooperated, recalling Israel’s humanitarian aid during the Syrian civil war. However, resistance persists in areas like Jubbata al-Khashab, where the IDF issued an ultimatum for residents to surrender arms or face military action. In response to regional complexities, the IDF has committed two regular brigades to the Golan, avoiding additional reserve deployments. The mission, part of a 'forward defense' strategy, aims to prevent terrorist organizations from establishing a foothold along the border. The IDF has also extended protective measures to Druze communities in southern Syria, including Hader near Mount Hermon, signaling support amid threats from Salafist groups. Meanwhile, Syria’s de facto leader, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, continues consolidating power, reshaping alliances, and overseeing clashes between rebels and pro-Assad forces in Alawite strongholds. As the situation unfolds, the IDF remains focused on balancing security needs with the broader goal of maintaining stability in the volatile region. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkxcyuchyg	2024-12-28T22:13:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/B11120yP0B1g/B11120yP0B1g_448_457_2284_1285_0_small.jpg
Brazilian Congress defies Lula da Silva, strengthens ties with Is...	Senator Carlos Viana: 'Brazilians and Israelis share a brotherly bond. We stand firmly against anti-Semitism and international terrorism' In a bold move opposing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian parliament has strengthened its legislative ties with Israel. Earlier this month, the Brazilian Israel Allies Caucus expanded to include the Senate in Brasilia under the leadership of Senator Carlos Viana, transforming into a bicameral group of 78 parliamentarians. This development comes as relations between Brazil and Israel have reached historic lows, with the president accusing Israel of genocide and likening its actions in Gaza to the Holocaust. The expansion underscores the growing divide between the Brazilian Congress and the president. 'Brazilians and Israelis share a brotherly bond. We stand firmly against anti-Semitism and international terrorism, and today, we reaffirm our commitment to a free, democratic, and secure world,' Viana said. Viana also highlighted the historical connection between the two nations, recalling Brazil’s significant role in the establishment of the State of Israel. Brazil’s then-UN ambassador, Oswaldo Aranha, presided over and voted for UN Resolution 181, which approved the partition plan for Palestine on November 29, 1947. 'We stand with Israel and always will,' Viana declared. This is not the first time Viana has taken a strong stand in support of Israel and against Silva. In December last year, he led a solidarity mission of Brazilian lawmakers to Israel following the October 7 massacre. At the time, Viana stated, 'We want to make it clear to the people of Israel that we do not agree with the recent statements made by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva regarding the State of Israel and the Hamas terrorist group.' He added, 'We assert that Israel has the right to defend itself, to position itself, and to exist.' Silva has faced international criticism for comparing Israel to Hitler and the Nazis. He also falsely claimed that more than 12 million children had died in Gaza and Israel—an implausible figure, given the Gaza Strip’s population of approximately 2.3 million. Since then, Brazil has recalled its ambassador to Israel, and Israel declared Silva unwelcome in the country. Israeli-Brazilian relations had flourished during the tenure of former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro. Moreover, a February poll conducted by CNN Brasil revealed that 57% of the 800 respondents believed Israel was on the right side in its conflict with Hamas, while 26% said Brazil should actively support Israel in the conflict. Representative Geovania de Sá, who has chaired the pro-Israel caucus for nearly a decade, described the creation of the bicameral caucus as 'an important milestone in strengthening our partnership with Israel.' Joshua Reinstein, president of the Israel Allies Foundation, which supports the Brazilian caucus along with 53 similar bodies worldwide, praised the parliamentarians for their initiative. He emphasized the importance of their support during a challenging period for Israel. 'The new bicameral caucus is very important for Israel, especially at a time when we are under military and diplomatic attack,' Reinstein said. 'I thank Senator Carlos Viana and Congresswoman Geovania de Sá for mobilizing Brazilian deputies and senators to support Israel through faith-based diplomacy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1w7bwcskg	2024-12-28T20:50:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/HkJeQDCBke/HkJeQDCBke_2_0_1599_901_0_small.jpg

Teens made to commit sexual acts on each other; horrors of Hamas ...	Physical abuse, torture, psychological terror, starvation, in Israel's report to the UN; teens beaten in their genitals, suffering burns; hostages witness others being murdered; Caution: hard to read content 'Teenagers were forced to commit sexual acts on each other, most women were sexually assaulted': This was described in the harrowing report spread over eight pages, that includes horrific testimony of hostages who were freed from Hamas captivity. The report that was prepared by the Health Ministry was submitted to the UN last week. It describes neglect, abuse, torture and humiliation that the hostages endured. The report begins with a description of the massacre of October 7, 2023, in the communities near the Gaza border. 'The abduction of children, women, men, and the elderly from their homes is a traumatic event, often occurring after the murder of family members or close friends. In some cases, children were taken without their parents or after their parents' murder. The terrorists caused widespread destruction, with hostages witnessing their homes burning, acts of rape and looting which took place in their communities. The captives were transported to Gaza in open vehicles, often alongside the bodies of those murdered. They endured beatings, humiliation, and verbal, physical, and sexual violence during the journey. Seven weeks after the atrocities, a deal to release hostages began. It spanned seven phases. The report notes that in the exchange, 105 hostages – 81 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals including 37 children (22 girls and 15 boys,) 16 elderly women and 52 adults including 27 women and 25 men, were released. In the ensuing months, one woman and four men were rescued alive and the bodies of 15 men and women were extracted from Gaza. Beating, isolation, branding, sexual assault Women, men, and children who returned from captivity reported that they endured severe physical and sexual abuse, such as beatings, isolation, deprivation of food and water, branding, hair-pulling, and sexual assault. Additionally, some of them reported that the captors sexually assaulted them or forced them to undress. 'Two of the children that were held together during captivity reported that they were held bound and were beaten throughout their captivity. Signs of binding, scars, and marks consistent with trauma were found. Additionally, two young children had burn marks on their lower limbs. One child stated that the burns were the result of a deliberate branding with a heated object. 'Both the child and adults who were with him in captivity described the incident as a purposeful branding event, not an accident. It was described as an extremely traumatic experience. Cases of Physical and Sexual Violence Against Women and Men One of the returned hostages described being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by a Hamas terrorist. 'On several occasions, captors forced women of all ages to undress while others, including the captors, watched. Some women reported that the captors sexually assaulted them. In addition, some women reported that they were tied to beds while their captors stared at them. Another woman, injured during the attack, was held in a dark isolation for 30 days, bound and unable to move. She had no contact with the outside world, received an inadequate amount of food and water, and did not receive treatment for her injury. Other women also reported starvation and abuse by their captors The men endured severe physical abuse, including continuous starvation, beatings, burns with galvanized iron (branding), hair-pulling, confinement in closed rooms with a limited amount of food and water, being held in isolation with hands and feet tied, and being denied access to the bathroom, which forced them to defecate on themselves.' The report describes how the hostages were deprived of medical treatment. ' The hostages were denied medical treatment for acute injuries caused during October 7 and subsequently, in addition to for untreated chronic conditions. Fractures, shrapnel wounds, and burns were treated inadequately, leading to complications which required additional surgeries, that could have been prevented with proper care. Upon arrival in Israel, intensive treatment was given to the returned hostages. The captors also tortured those injured by performing painful procedures without anesthesia. Many hostages also suffered from untreated chronic conditions (e.g., heart failure, diabetes, hypothyroidism), leading to severe short-term medical deterioration, such as low blood pressure, bradycardia, and hypothermia. In one case a hostage died from untreated medical complications. Also, several older women required urgent life-saving treatment due to untreated hypertension and hypothyroidism.' Starvation of hostages was deliberate, the report said. 'About half of the returned hostages described being deliberately starved during their captivity. They were given a poor diet, which often led to hunger that worsened over time. In addition to inadequate nutrition, they were kept in dark spaces, increasing the risk of vitamin D deficiency. This malnutrition resulted in an average weight loss of 815 kg (10-17% of body weight), with children losing an average of 10%, and in one extreme case, a girl lost 18% of her body weight. Poor nutrition may lead to Sarcopenia, delayed wound and fracture recovery, and a weakened immune system. Malnutrition also negatively impacted cognitive function and mental health, and as for children, it may hinder development and growth.' Ahead of their release their captors attempted to improve some of the hostages' appearance and weight. ' Those who received excess food before returning to Israel were at risk of Refeeding Syndrome and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, particularly among elderly hostages. 'In cases with complex medical backgrounds, these electrolyte disorders can be life-threatening. Additionally, the hostages were denied essential medications and treatment for their injuries, leading to the risk of widespread metabolic disorders. The poor quality of food and water, combined with unsanitary conditions, led to increased morbidity among the hostages. Many suffered from diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sometimes constipation. They had limited access to showers and returned with skin infections, including Dermatitis. Infections were detected in hospital cultures (Clostridium, Salmonella, Vibrio, Shigella, Giardia, E. coli). Some were diagnosed with Q fever, while two returned hostages suffered from acute case of Q fever. Several of the elderly women developed Deep Venous Thrombosis due to age, pre-existing medical conditions without medication, and lack of mobility during captivity.' Returning hostages suffered survivors guilt The released hostages suffered survivor's guilt and trauma. Children refused to be parted from their mothers for even minutes. 'Some returned hostages had paranoid anxieties, fearing retaliation against their loved ones still in captivity if they spoke about their experiences. The inability to share their trauma with therapeutic factors, which made it harder to process their trauma. The returned hostages have been experiencing 'survivor's guilt,' feeling responsible for being rescued while their loved ones remain in Gaza. This guilt delays their return to routine and rehabilitation. Some wish to return to captivity to help those left behind, feeling they are 'not rehabilitated' as long as their loved ones are still there. The concern for those remaining is unbearable for them and their families. Many returned hostages experience fear, restlessness, emotional detachment, and confusion. Some were afraid to leave their rooms, even in the hospital's protected areas. They struggled to let go of behaviors from captivity, like barely eating and neglecting hygiene. 'Others hoarded food, fearing they would not have enough for the next day, despite knowing this was irrational. The returned hostages also reported severe nightmares and sleep deprivation, trying to avoid repeating nightmares. Some experienced derealization, struggling to accept their presence in the Israeli hospital as real, rather than a dream from captivity. They avoided anything that reminded them of their traumatic experiences, including certain foods.'

'These are actions that cannot be tolerated and demand that the world wake up and take action. The report highlights the horrors the hostages endured and reveals to the world the brutality of the enemy with whom Israel is engaged. The testimonies presented in this report serve as a wake-up call for the international community to apply increased pressure on Hamas and its supporters to free all the hostages without delay. I urge the global community to utilize all available means to end this cruelty and bring the hostages home immediately. It is a moral and humanitarian imperative, and the time to act is running out.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1cbi8asje	2024-12-28T20:16:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/10/ByxeWlM030/ByxeWlM030_0_0_1600_1066_0_small.jpg
At least 62 dead, two crew rescued in fiery South Korea airliner ...	Video shared by local media showed the twin-engine aircraft skidding down the runway with no apparent landing gear before slamming into a wall in an explosion of flame and debris At least 62 people were killed when an airliner veered off the runway and erupted into a fireball as it slammed into a wall at South Korea's Muan International Airport on Sunday, the national fire agency said. Two people were rescued, the agency said. The crash occurred as Jeju Air flight 7C2216, carrying 175 passengers and six crew on a flight from the Thai capital Bangkok, was landing shortly after 9 a.m. (0000 GMT) at the airport in the south of the country, South Korea's transport ministry said. The ministry did not confirm the reports of casualties. At least 58 bodies have been recovered but that number is not final, another fire official told Reuters. Two people were found alive and rescue operations were under way, a Muan fire official said. Yonhap news agency said three people had been rescued. Authorities were working to rescue people in the tail section, an airport official told Reuters shortly after the crash. Video shared by local media showed the twin-engine aircraft skidding down the runway with no apparent landing gear before slamming into a wall in an explosion of flame and debris. Other photos showed smoke and fire engulfing parts of the plane. Yonhap cited airport authorities as saying the landing gear may have malfunctioned due to a bird strike. A passenger texted a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing, agency News1 reported. The person's final message was, 'Should I say my last words?' Bird strike is among several theories that have not been verified, an official from the transport ministry's aviation department said, adding that the investigation was ongoing. The passengers included two Thai nationals and the rest are believed to be South Koreans, according to the transportation ministry. The plane was a Boeing 737-800 jet operated by Jeju Air, which was seeking details of the accident, including its casualties and cause, an airline spokesperson said. Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment. All domestic and international flights at Muan airport had been cancelled, Yonhap reported. South Korean acting President Choi Sang-mok, who was named interim leader of the country on Friday after the previous acting president was impeached amid an ongoing political crisis, ordered all-out rescue efforts, his office said. His chief of staff convened an emergency meeting.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skia00r0ryg	2024-12-28T19:07:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/Sybt01E0r1e/Sybt01E0r1e_0_0_800_601_0_small.jpg

Lights of Hope virtual event: Illuminating the path to 2025	ILTV and Ynet News are proud to present the Lights of Hope virtual event, streaming live on Monday, December 30 ILTV and Ynet News are proud to present the Lights of Hope virtual event, streaming live on Monday, December 30, at 9 p.m. (Israel time). The event will be available on the Ynet News homepage, ILTV News YouTube channel, and other platforms. Featuring eight inspiring panels, the event symbolizes the eight candles of the menorah, each representing a light of hope for the coming year. The themes of the panels are: Security, Regional Stability, Tikkun Olam, Sustainability, Education, Innovation, Sports, and Community. The goal is to spotlight areas where Israel and the Jewish people can find light and inspiration as they move forward into 2025. The evening will begin with a special message from President Isaac Herzog and include interviews with Ministers Amichai Chikli and Ofir Sofer. This year, Chanukah and New Year’s Eve coincide, creating a unique opportunity to celebrate both the Jewish Festival of Lights and the hope for a brighter year ahead. After a challenging 2024, marked by war and adversity, 2025 offers the promise of renewal and recovery for Israel. 'The year 2024 has been an unprecedented year for Israel,' said Maayan Hoffman, Executive Editor of ILTV. 'We’ve faced a war on seven fronts, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers defending against Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other threats. At the same time, we’ve fought another battle—a war of words on social media and in the media. These platforms have not only amplified antisemitism and anti-Zionist rhetoric but have also incited violence.' Hoffman emphasized that Chanukah serves as a reminder of resilience and miracles. 'Chanukah celebrates the courage of the Maccabees, who triumphed against overwhelming odds to preserve Judaism. It’s a holiday of light and miracles—the oil that should have burned for one day lasted eight, illuminating the Temple in Jerusalem. This is the essence of the Lights of Hope event.' The event is supported by six generous strategic partners: Afeka Academic College of Engineering in Tel Aviv, Belong, Gigawatt Impact, HaBithonistim, Nechama and Hatzala, and Save a Child’s Heart. 'Our strategic partners play a vital role in helping ILTV and Ynet News expand our reach and influence,' said Tom Zadok, CEO of ILTV. 'As we continue to grow as leading media outlets for the English-speaking community worldwide, we recognize that people increasingly prefer video content. We’re committed to meeting this need by delivering the most important stories and headlines from Israel each day.' Don’t miss this inspiring event.

Hezbollah’s plot to down an Israeli plane: The tactics that foile...	Once blocked by Hezbollah's 100+ missile batteries and Syria's dense air defenses, Israel overcame these challenges with decoys, advanced drones and precision strikes, restoring air dominance and reopening Middle Eastern skies for IDF operations As they sat at their computer screens at the pit in the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv, mission officers rubbed their eyes in disbelief. Prepping for yet one more routine sortie in the north, they were convinced the sensitive strategic system had a serious bug in it. All anti-tank missile signals from Syria, red lines and icons, which had cluttered the screens for years, had disappeared. It was as if they never were. The skies had opened, clean of the enemy. The Middle East was in tatters. Fighter pilots, if they wanted, could now merrily fly in pairs, with visible operating systems, at any altitude, to any range, to any spot in Israel’s first circle of defense. In the first months of the war, there was no consensus within the IDF about revisiting flying the Lebanese skies. IAF chief Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar insisted, despite the then focus on Gaza and Hezbollah successfully downing state-of-the-art IAF UAVs at a rate of one a month in the war’s first six months. For this, Bar joined up the Military Intelligence Directorate and the Air Intelligence Group to one end – finishing this war by restoring Israel’s air supremacy in Lebanon. He didn’t know that Syria’s skies would also soon open. So, he pushed decision-makers to attack Syrian anti-aircraft defenses too. 'You must understand, our more veteran pilots are used to practicing for all the Syrian anti-aircraft dodging systems,' says a veteran IAF pilot. 'These systems took down one of our F16s last decade in the Galilee, and has affected every mission to the point of having to deploy more manpower on almost every sortie, limiting flights and implementing a totally different flight operation. 'Our people saw the screens and were in a state of shock. We used to invest so much organization and preparation before each flight just to address this very danger. In two days, we destroyed the main threat to the IAF, that’s been with us for 50 years. Suddenly, this dangerous situation, which had been going on for decades, disappeared - as if it never was. It’s as if all the missiles and rockets aimed at Israel no longer existed.' This dramatic change would never have come about were it not for, in a matter of 25 hours, the IAF destroying over 100 surface-to-air batteries of the densest anti-aircraft system on Earth – dependent on advanced Russian systems that Bashar Assad bought as new at his lowest moments last decade when his army had collapsed. 'He invested every lira and ruble to purchase anti-aircraft batteries that we destroyed in interwar attacks from the beginning of last decade, even at the height of the civil war.' The pilot adds, 'Anti-aircraft systems we attacked were sometimes replaced within the week. As the main threat to the IAF, this array was at the very heart of our intelligence.' This threat has almost doubled in recent years. Hezbollah’s appetite was whetted, and Hassan Nasrallah made it the first terrorist organization on Earth to have a state-run anti-aircraft system, albeit with slightly different operating systems, but the same Russian and Iranian-made batteries. A few weeks before destroying Syria’s anti-aircraft system, the IAF also ticked off destroying Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft system in more graduated and cunning moves, first revealed here. The air force operation destroying the Syrian army took only a few days. Assad’s arsenal was its main and most important target, certainly when compared to the MiG and Sukhoi squadrons, anyway inferior to Israel’s F15s and F16s. For years, including over the past decade, these jets conducted Israel’s real aerial warfare in Syria. 'Syrian aerial defense systems have been activated' was a code of sorts from initial official statements coming out of Damascus that could be reported in Israel, following any of the thousands of attacks in Syria for which Israel did not claim responsibility. On Syrian soil, there are still active, even highly advanced, anti-aircraft batteries, such as the S-300. These, however, have always been, and still are, in Russian hands at air bases such as Khmeimim. The IDF isn’t ruling out the possibility of destroying them to prevent them from falling into the hands of dangerous elements. Assad’s army deployed its anti-aircraft array wisely: Primarily around the capital Damascus, not far from the Golan Heights, and in 'Little Syria' where the Alawite community, of which Assad’s family is part, is concentrated; the coast above Lebanon that includes the strategic port cities of Latakia and Tartus. The radars themselves are deployed across the whole country. The Syrian air force’s operational, command and control capabilities have always gotten good grades from the IAF. There were many very close encounters with hundreds, sometimes only dozens of meters, separating these missiles from blue and white planes. 'These bases, that we knew so well, like the Syrian army camps, have been simply abandoned,' says an IDF source. To what extent was the IAF caught by surprise? 'The air force had no contingency plan for destroying the Syrian army and its anti-aircraft array. The vast operation of around 400 attacks in 72 hours was prepared swiftly in a matter of days, literally out of thin air - witness to the IAF’s tremendous operational flexibility. 'Syria’s entire surface-to-air array was destroyed along with both its mobile and portable batteries, the kind greatly absorbed by Israel in the Yom Kippur and 1982 Peace for Galilee wars. They’re fast and deadly, with efficient ranges covering 20-40 km, and there are the SA-17 and SA-22 with further ranges. Some have proven effective in not only endangering jets but also perusing and downing IAF bombs. 'The IDF noticed Assad’s army starting to move around some of its batteries, apparently to protect them from rebels who had begun their conquests, mobilizing Israel into preparing for action. The anti-aircraft danger now remaining in the second circle in Iraq has also suffered serious blows from Israel this past year. This system, however, is considered lower quality than that of Syria. 'Iran also, obviously, has advanced aerial defense, including S-300 batteries. They too suffered severe blows by the IAF in October. We now know that Syria’s anti-aircraft array, along with its radars, seems to have been linked up to Israel’s number one enemy’s ground-to-air batteries.' Saturday night, October 7, 2023, at precisely 8 p.m., a select planning, operations and intelligence team convened in a side room at the Air Force’s new base at the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. As the IDF was struggling to recover from its loss of control from the Hamas invasion, and fighter squadrons were landing their first strikes on Gaza, this group of Air Force officers conducted their first situation report for a distant and strategic mission in a sector that was, in fact, calm on that horrific day. The discussion was led by head of the IAF’s air supremacy division Lt. Col. I. who was hardly four months into the job at the time. The aim was to destroy this air anti-aircraft array built up by Hezbollah over the years preceding the war. The Air Force rarely flew over Lebanon in recent years for fear of its manned aircraft being shot down by Hezbollah. The situation worsened between 2021 and 2023, as the IAF kept even simple high-altitude photographic sorties to a bare minimum. One of the world’s most powerful air forces was compelled to use more satellites to investigate a rocket factory in the Bekaa Valley or keep tabs on Hezbollah officials in Beirut's Dahieh district. Hezbollah’s gamble of invading Israel also involved it becoming the first terrorist organization on Earth to set up an anti-aircraft array of 100 large surface-to-air missiles. This included advanced, unique and innovative detection radars reliant on Syria’s anti-aircraft array - the densest on Earth - alongside Iranian and Russian systems and information. In closed-door talks over the past decade, Air Force officials sought to calibrate and reduce expectations. 'It was clear that at least one plane would be shot down in the Third Lebanon War, not only helicopters like in the Second Lebanon War,' they said. 'The public should know that’s what we’re preparing for.' Israel’s deterrence against Hezbollah and the unprecedented erosion of its air supremacy delved into an almost humiliating nadir in February 2020. Hezbollah exhibited an extraordinary and daring display of its surface-to-air capabilities: An SA-8 missile was launched at an advanced Hermes 450 UAV conducting a reconnaissance mission in the north. The UAV was downed, but Israeli policy remained unchanged: Serious targets in Lebanon must not be attacked, even more so north of the Litani River – so as not to be drawn into escalation with Hezbollah. A danger to Israeli planes By the evening of October 7, Lt. Col. I. already realized that air supremacy would not be achieved in one single strike. A startling image flickered on the screen before the convened team. Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft rings covered a line from Haifa, east across the Jezreel Valley, and included the Ramat David Air Base. As the months passed, and intelligence probes accumulated, it became apparent that Hezbollah’s cover stretched as far as the Atlit-Kineret line. This meant that any Israeli aircraft, military or civilian, flying over the northern third of Israeli sovereign airspace was in danger of being taken down by Hezbollah. 'From that October 7 discussion onward, we went into fighting mode, with an ever-growing operational team,' says Air Intelligence Group Lebanon Air Supremacy Division chief, Lt. Col. A. 'Unlike in the Military Intelligence Directorate, here at IAF intelligence, we don’t gather intelligence for information about the enemy, but rather we collect information needed for each operation. At that first discussion, we already understood we were heading toward a multi-front war. We prepared an array whose entire purpose was protecting the Air Force.' This array was a far cry from the 'Terrorists in flip flops with shoulder-held missiles' à la 1990s Afghanistan or Maroun El Ras 2006. In addition to the Russian-made S-300 and S-400s, which the Russians also have, a game-changing, effectively state-owned, anti-aircraft array was built up over the past decade in central and southern Lebanon. It included relatively advanced versions of Soviet missiles such as radar-based SA-6, SA-8 and SA-22 missiles alongside the jet-based and optical target identification-based Iranian Sayyad, Taer and 67 anti-aircraft arrays. These are loitering anti-aircraft missiles that can 'tour' in the air for 20 minutes, and when its homing device identifies a target, it locks into pursuit. The Taer can reach a range of 100km and is similar in shape to a UAV. In the first months of the war, the IAF was concerned that such missiles would also shoot down civilian planes en route to Beirut airport. 'Even if we swiftly deny involvement and show proof, just imagine what would happen if, in the middle of a war, a French passenger plane were shot down off the coast of Lebanon,' says an IAF source. 'They’d blame us just like they blamed us in 2018 when 15 Russian soldiers were killed as a Russian Ilyushin plane was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft during an attack on Latakia attributed to Israel.' Hezbollah’s array included the deployment of SA-6 and SA-22 batteries around Beirut airport, that were attacked in recent months. 'Lebanon also had vested interests in our taking out these batteries, endangering Lebanese skies,' says Lt. Col. I. 'At the start of the war, we sent the world a warning: Whoever flies to Lebanon, risks facing an air defense systems reliant on a terrorist organization.' Five advanced mid-sized Hermes UAVs shot down Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft array, mainly during the first half of the war when the learning race between the two sides peaked and incorporated Iranian weapons industries and engineers. Lt. Col. I. and Lt. Col. A.’s team investigated and gathered information about the array, and understood the extent of the danger to the IAF’s freedom of action. This endangered Apache helicopters assisting forces on the ground as well as intelligence gathering sorties to Tyre. The greatest concern was that these batteries would be moved around and further deployed. The SA-22 battery, considered the most dangerous of them all, can be placed on the ground floor of a three-story building in Nabatieh or an underground parking lot of a 14-story building in the crowded Dahieh district. The IDF wasn’t monitoring these hundreds of anti-aircraft Hezbollah targets 24/7. It was enough for a truck covered in tarpaulin, or a couple of missile trucks, to drive a few hundred meters to fire at IAF jets, and we’d lost. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Air Force also failed to appreciate the level of skill of Hezbollah's anti-aircraft cells that, in recent years, were returning from several-week operational training courses in the Iranian army with end-of-course air shows over Syria. 'They had no intention of totally paralyzing the IAF from operations in Lebanon,' say IAF officials. 'It was enough for them to show one success, like taking down an F-16 with a pilot abandoning a mission on Lebanese soil or, Heaven forbid, getting killed.' A month into the war, on November 8, scores were settled. Three weeks earlier, Hezbollah had managed, for the first time in the war, to shoot down its first Hermes 450 IAF done with an SA-67 battery. The IDF received the green light from the political echelon to kick off its offensive deep into Lebanon. General Staff Operations Directorate chief, Maj. Gen. Oded Basyuk gave Lt. Col. I.’s team the go-ahead. Operation Mountain Air was underway. The IAF nicknamed the first surface-to-air battery attacked in Lebanon, an advanced SA-22 battery, the 'Nexus.' The IAF used a small missile for 'roof knocking' in the dead of night. Families living nearby fled for their cars within ten minutes. The massive secondary explosions in the house, reminiscent of a fireworks display, left no room for doubt. There had been at least eight large missiles on the destroyed multiple-barrel launcher. Those hesitant months were utilized to gather deep intelligence on Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft array. The young officers in the colonel lieutenants’ team understood that an organized plan to destroy the enemy’s anti-aircraft array could be prepared only with ongoing aerial presence. The danger, however, meant that the bulk of the operation in the first months of the war was carried out by the use of drones. 'For Hezbollah, taking down a drone is an achievement,' says Lt. Col. I. 'They know that doing so ostensibly restricts our monitoring or aerial assassinations of their commanders and operatives in the field.' At some point, the air supremacy team learned something new about Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft array: The network connecting the batteries wasn’t dense, but rather dispersed and independent. 'If you were to ask a Syrian army battalion commander, he’d tell you it’s extraordinary and makes no sense, as anti-aircraft batteries were being deployed on some hilltop, next to the radar and other mechanisms protecting it,' says I. 'We had to engage with this array, even at the risk of taking down our own drones. If we hadn’t done that, we might have saved a drone or two, but weakened our capabilities of harming Hezbollah.' Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft array had 3,000 operatives and took serious blows in the war, losing its top commanders. Most operatives are alumni of professional training in Iran and Syria. They’re divided into three geographical areas: the southern anti-aircraft array; the Beirut unit and the Bekaa unit. 'Our young guys knew that there was an advanced surface-to-air battery in a certain place, but couldn’t say where,' says Lt. Col. A. Facing this challenge, the air force managed to develop covert ruses and deceptions to confuse Hezbollah’s anti-aircraft operatives. 'We implemented these crazy ideas that came from below, from 20-year-old officers who invented a variety of aerial ambushes and knew the right moment to strike.' At the end of December last year, the aerial supremacy unit caused a Hezbollah anti-aircraft cell to remove a truck with a large launcher on it from a hiding place in an orchard, that was destroyed in a precision attack, this time from an Israeli missile ship stationed near Tyre. As the hesitation declined from one month to the next, Hezbollah’s ambitious anti-aircraft array, laying the groundwork for the opening shots of its planned September Operation Northern Arrows, was systematically eroded. 'The conditions for starting the major strikes we afflicted on Hezbollah, including those assassinating its leaders, was complete IAF freedom of action in Lebanon. Without that, we’d have been in a quite different place,' I. continues. Complete freedom of action means F-15s, not just stealthy F-35s flying at 4000 feet, but rather actually over Beirut’s Dahieh high-rise rooftops. A young aircraft supremacy officer also pushed for another method to make this difficult for Hezbollah: A supersonic boom used as a regular fighting pattern – generally by F-35 Adir planes. This is a deafening noise that can sound like a bomb, caused when a jet exceeds the 1.1 Mach speed of sound, creating a shock wave. In one of his final speeches before his assassination, Hassan Nasrallah and the residents of Beirut were treated to an especially loud supersonic boom. 'It can shatter windscreens, has a huge impact on the population, and moves things for Hezbollah,' says one officer. 'To restore deterrence, it’s important to us that Lebanon should know that our planes are free in their airspace. I remind you, Beirut has no sirens or warning systems.' The freedom of aerial action has another benefit for the Air Force. It’s more effective. Jets can get closer for strikes in Syria, as these strikes can be conducted from Lebanese skies, taking full advantage of the country’s topography. Despite these achievements, the IAF believes Hezbollah still has firepower, albeit much less than before the war. IAF planes no longer face the same dangers. Israel believes that as soon as the cease-fire is fully implemented, the array will be rebuilt with Iranian support and lessons will have been learned. So, the IDF demands to counter in practice any effort to rearm Hezbollah. Alongside the large surface-to-air missiles, Hezbollah also has thousands of shoulder-fired missiles (man-portable air-defense systems [MANPADS]), in its possession since the 1990s. This tactical array has been upgraded in recent years and includes an aerial rocket converted to explode in the air, triggered by a time-activated fuse; a broad range of classic anti-aircraft mortars (varying in diameter from 12mm through to 100mm) designed primarily to hit helicopters and anti-tank missiles converted into anti-aircraft missiles with a dedicated fuse for precision targeting helicopters - effectively 'air mines', used in areas such as valleys or the Litani or Saluki rivers where the IAF planes are expected to fly low. These mines explode a few dozen meters above the source of sound or movement detected by its dedicated sensors. They accordingly demand high maintenance and are battery operated. A Hermes drone was shot down by one such MANPADS in the war in the north. During the Egoz unit’s difficult battle in early October, in which six soldiers were killed, Hezbollah operatives shot shoulder-held missiles that almost hit Apache helicopters descending to low altitude in a dangerous area to help soldiers. 'We live in the Northern Command and hold weekly meetings about freedom of action with its commander, Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin to whom this matter is very important, mainly as a critical matter for continuance,' the IAF says. 'We have to continue flying unrestrictedly over Lebanon. Over the years, we lost our intelligence grip there, and we can’t make the same mistake again.' Proof of the mission’s importance flickers on a screen behind these officers: Two pictures of a broad single-story building in Bekaa, deep inside Lebanon near the Syrian border, that was used as a warehouse for advanced Hezbollah weapons. There are two versions of this picture: one taken during the intelligence gathering sortie in recent months, the other before the war. 'Iran has invested many millions in Hezbollah’s surface-to-air anti-aircraft array, turning it into one of its heaviest arrays,' say the aerial supremacy officers. 'The Lebanese army also has anti-aircraft capabilities but hasn’t used them against us. We couldn’t have carried out the major assassinations, including Nasrallah without close air reconnaissance.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkz8a1chyg	2024-12-28T13:24:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/12/H1QLM4004yg/H1QLM4004yg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Terrorists posing as patients': Inside the IDF's largest Gaza ra...	401st Brigade encircles Kamal Adwan Hospital in an hour, arresting over 240 terrorists, including hospital director; some suspects try fleeing in ambulances; Unit 504 interrogations on-site leads to capture of additional Hamas and PIJ operatives The IDF reported on Saturday that it completed a focused operation targeting a Hamas command center within the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. Over 240 suspects were reportedly apprehended. Among those detained were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), including 15 individuals connected to the October 7 attacks on Israel, as well as engineering and anti-tank missile specialists and the hospital director, suspected of Hamas ties. Some suspects reportedly attempted to disguise themselves as patients or escape using ambulances. The IDF said that the 401st Armored Brigade secured the hospital’s surroundings while Shayetet 13 special forces conducted precise actions inside, seizing weapons such as grenades, firearms and other military equipment. Troops encountered resistance, including anti-tank fire, but successfully neutralized the attackers. Alongside Shayetet 13 commandos, combat teams from the 401st Armored Brigade, Unit 504 field investigators and Shin Bet forces, all under the command of the 162nd Division and guided by intelligence from the IDF Intelligence Directorate (AMAN) and the Shin Bet. At the outset, 401st Brigade combat teams encircled the hospital, arresting terrorists hiding in the area and eliminating others. The encirclement was completed within an hour. During the operation, an anti-tank missile was fired at a 52nd Battalion force, but no injuries were reported. Initial interrogations conducted on-site by Unit 504 investigators and Shin Bet operatives revealed that many of the terrorists exiting the hospital had participated in terror activities in the area. This marked a significant achievement for Unit 504, which handled the largest single-day concentration of detainees since the start of the war. Over ten investigators employed advanced intelligence systems and technologies, with most of the terrorists identified as members of the military wings of Hamas and PIJ. Real-time interrogations also led to the identification of additional terrorists in the vicinity.

IDF and Shin Bet personnel sustained no injuries, and the attackers were swiftly neutralized. Israeli Air Force aircraft also struck and killed terrorists attempting to flee the area. In the weeks leading up to the operation, the IDF coordinated with COGAT to evacuate 350 patients, caregivers and medical staff from the Kamal Adwan Hospital. Additionally, tens of thousands of liters of fuel and hundreds of food and medical supply packages were delivered to the hospital. During the operation, 95 more patients and staff were transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, accompanied by 5,000 liters of fuel, two generators and additional medical supplies to ensure its essential functionality. Hundreds of civilians were also evacuated safely via designated routes. In a parallel operation in Jabaliya, Multi-Dimensional Unit commandos identified and eliminated terrorists from the air, while Kfir Brigade soldiers located and dismantled explosive devices in the area. Over the weekend, a fourth IDF brigade, Nahal, joined the northern operations, moving from its previous position in southern Gaza near the Philadelphi Corridor, where it was replaced by the 4th Reserve Brigade. Nahal forces are now operating in Beit Hanoun alongside the Kfir Brigade. Jabaliya has been identified by the IDF as a Hamas stronghold in northern Gaza, hosting hundreds of terrorists, including senior commanders. Despite prior IDF operations in the city, including a ground maneuver last year and a 98th Division raid on its refugee camp in May, the area remains a critical focus for military activity. IDF forces have been conducting operations there for the past three months to address persistent threats. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryzyit6byx	2024-12-28T10:02:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/28/r1oaGsarkl/r1oaGsarkl_2_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

Iran says 2025 'important year' for nuclear issue	Tehran braces for renewed US 'maximum pressure' policies under Trump administration; amid concerns over potential sanctions and military actions, Iranian rial hits all-time low, reflecting growing economic uncertainty Iran, bracing for a possible re-imposition of incoming U.S. president Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' policy, said on Saturday that 2025 would be an important year for its nuclear issue. Trump in 2018 reneged on a deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 in which Iran agreed to curb uranium enrichment, which can yield material for nuclear weapons, in return for the relaxation of U.S. and UN economic sanctions. '2025 will be an important year regarding Iran's nuclear issue,' Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Beijing, adding in remarks aired by Iran's state TV that he had discussed the issue in talks with his Chinese counterpart. He did not mention Trump by name, however, or spell out how the year might be significant. Iranian leaders' main concern may be that Trump could empower Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's nuclear sites, while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its crucial oil industry.

Military says forces encountered resistance, including anti-tank fire from terrorists, during targeted operation against Hamas command center located inside Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya The IDF announced Saturday that it had arrested more than 240 suspects during a targeted operation against a Hamas command center located inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. The military said the operation, coordinated with the Shin Bet, was based on intelligence indicating the hospital was being used for military activities in violation of international law. The detainees included members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), as well as 15 individuals implicated in the October 7 attacks on Israel. Among those arrested were engineering and anti-tank missile operatives and the hospital's director, who is suspected of being a Hamas operative. Some detainees reportedly attempted to evade capture by posing as patients or fleeing in ambulances. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF said that prior to the operation, 350 patients, medical staff and caregivers were evacuated from the hospital in coordination with the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT).

Report: Iran’s Revolutionary Guard plotted to lure and kidnap Isr...	Former political prisoner in Armenia reveals IRGC planned to lure Iran International reporter Babak Eshaghi and another journalist to Turkey-Iran border region; Eshaghi to Ynet: 'I trust my country’s intelligence and security services' The opposition news outlet IranWire reported Saturday that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) planned to kidnap Babak Eshaghi, an Israeli journalist working for the Saudi-funded opposition channel Iran International. According to IranWire, the IRGC devised a scheme to lure several Iran International journalists to a border region near Iran and abduct them into Iranian territory. The outlet based its report on details from the interrogation of Mohammad Hashemzadeh, a former Iranian political prisoner currently detained in Armenia. The investigation revealed that members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard pressured Hashemzadeh and an associate to lure several Iran International journalists to a border city near Iran, where they would be abducted into the Islamic Republic. Hashemzadeh, originally from the southeastern Iranian city of Bandar Abbas, relocated to Armenia after working in Antalya, Turkey. During his interrogation in Armenia, he disclosed that while imprisoned in Iran, Revolutionary Guard operatives tried to persuade him and his cellmate—who was formerly a friend of Eshaghi—to entice Eshaghi and another Iran International reporter to travel to the border city for the abduction. According to the report, the plan failed due to the refusal of Hashemzadeh and his cellmate, Mehdi Behnam, who had been sentenced to five years in prison in Iran. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In response to Ynet, Eshaghi said: 'This is not the first time the Islamic regime in Iran has tried to harm Iran International journalists. We are the free, true and independent voice of news in Iran and the world. A few months ago, regime operatives stabbed my colleague Pouria Zarati in London, and last year, there was a revealed plan to attack our channel’s building and harm our journalists. As an Israeli journalist, I trust my country’s intelligence and security services. I will continue my work with the channel.' Iran International has long been a target of the Iranian regime, particularly since its intensive coverage of the widespread protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. The channel’s satellite broadcasts allowed it to reach audiences inside Iran, further amplifying its influence. According to the Daily Mail, Tehran labeled the channel a 'terrorist organization' in December 2022. That same month, British broadcaster ITV revealed that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard had plotted to assassinate two Iran International TV hosts, Sima Sabet and Farhad Farahzad, in 2022, in knife attacks outside their homes, similar to the stabbing of Zarati. The Daily Mail reported that the assassins were offered more than £150,000 for the job, but the plot was thwarted when one of the would-be attackers turned into a double agent. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by72h9ahyl	2024-12-28T06:42:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/28/SJPVMKpByl/SJPVMKpByl_200_109_1016_572_0_small.jpg

Cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah on verge of collapse?	Hezbollah accuses Israel of exploiting the fragile ceasefire as Israeli forces continue targeting southern Lebanon's terror infrastructure; Amid rising tensions, Lebanon warns of the agreement's collapse while Hezbollah hints it may intervene if Israeli operations persist, threatening renewed conflict in the region Lebanese network Al-Akhbar, closely aligned with Hezbollah, reported on Saturday morning that concerns over the fragility of the ceasefire are growing as it enters its second month, citing Israeli military activities in border villages as a potential tipping point. Serving as a mouthpiece for the Lebanese militant group, the network stated that while Hezbollah remains committed to the ceasefire, it has begun signaling that it will not hesitate to act on Lebanon’s 'right to self-defense' as stipulated in the agreement. According to Al-Akhbar, Hezbollah has warned that if Lebanon’s official security forces fail to curb what it describes as Israeli 'attacks,' the group will intervene directly. Hezbollah’s representative in the Lebanese parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, accused Israel of exploiting the ceasefire to implement plans for destruction and aggression in the border villages. He placed responsibility on the Lebanese state, the international monitoring committee established after the ceasefire, UNIFIL, the Lebanese Army, and the various countries involved in the agreement. 'We, the people of southern Lebanon, the resistance, Hezbollah’s supporters across Dahieh and the Bekaa, have never needed proof that resistance is a national necessity,' Fadlallah declared. In a morning editorial, Al-Akhbar’s editor, Ibrahim Al-Amin, argued for the necessity of resisting what he called Israeli violations. He claimed that a loophole in the ceasefire allows Israel to act with impunity while the monitoring forces lack the authority to stop its actions in border areas. Al-Amin further alleged that while the Lebanese Army has expressed concern to the Americans over Israel’s actions, the U.S. has dismissed these complaints. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati reportedly told the U.S. that Israeli operations threaten the agreement but received no meaningful response. Similarly, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri conveyed concerns to Washington, warning Israel’s actions could legitimize military responses from Hezbollah. According to Al-Amin, Israel has destroyed twice as much in border villages over the past month as it did during 14 months of prior conflict, preventing residents from returning to their homes and restricting ambulance and civil defense teams from recovering bodies. He asserted that Israel’s actions are restoring the legitimacy of resistance, whether by Hezbollah or other groups, adding that while people are weary of war, the cost of confrontation with Israeli forces would be less than the cost of continued Israeli actions. IDF operations continue across the border Hezbollah’s grievances arise from the fact that, despite the ceasefire, IDF has continued ground operations aimed at clearing southern Lebanese villages of terrorist infrastructure. IDF announced on Friday that the 226th Brigade, under the command of the 146th Division, remains active in the area while adhering to the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon. Forces are currently operating in the westernmost village of Al-Naqoura, where dozens of Hezbollah terror infrastructures used for attacks against Israel have been uncovered. Troops discovered military equipment and weapons stored in civilian buildings, including a building disguised as a pharmacy that contained explosives, RPG missiles, and AK-47s. Additional finds included rockets, mortars, and launchers aimed at Israeli territory, as well as a truck carrying 40 rocket tubes. All the equipment was confiscated and destroyed. Al-Akhbar regularly reports on Israeli operations in southern Lebanon, where, under the ceasefire agreement, armed forces not officially affiliated with Lebanon’s military are not permitted to operate. Nonetheless, IDF continues to identify and target terror-related sites in the region, with occasional airstrikes resulting in casualties. Recent strikes have targeted rocket launchers, significant weapons caches, smuggling routes, and armed militants. A delicate agreement on shaky ground Hezbollah has largely refrained from responding to Israeli strikes since the ceasefire, with the exception of one mortar attack on Mount Dov earlier this month. The group suffered significant losses during the conflict, particularly in its final months, which included the elimination of senior leadership and IDF ground maneuvers in southern Lebanon. While IDF operations have continued post-ceasefire, their intensity has decreased substantially, likely contributing to Hezbollah’s apparent interest in preserving the current status quo to avoid reigniting the conflict. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Lebanese Army, now deployed in villages across southern Lebanon, claims to have dismantled terrorist infrastructure in recent days. Meanwhile, IDF remains in border areas, actively targeting Hezbollah operatives who violate the ceasefire. In the past month alone, over 40 Hezbollah operatives have reportedly been killed, adding to the approximately 3,000 militants killed and 7,000 wounded over the past year—roughly a third of Hezbollah’s estimated 30,000 combatants. In areas where the Lebanese Army has established control, IDF has withdrawn back to Israeli territory. However, Israeli forces continue engineering operations to destroy Hezbollah bunkers and internal combat tunnels. IDF clarified this week that the initial 60-day ceasefire period is not a 'sacred deadline' and that implementation of the agreement’s stages will proceed gradually under U.S. oversight. For the first time, the United States is leading the enforcement mechanism for the ceasefire, described as operating under an 'American umbrella.' The fragile ceasefire remains precariously balanced, with both sides closely monitoring each other’s actions. While Hezbollah appears to be avoiding direct confrontation, its rhetoric and warnings suggest that any perceived overreach by Israel could risk pulling the region back into conflict. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byifdrpbje	2024-12-28T00:59:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/ByffmWGnSyl/ByffmWGnSyl_1_124_1601_901_0_small.jpg

WZO Chairman speaks about one of the most challenging times to be...	Following the loss of his brother-in-law during the Nova party on October 7, the head of the World Zionist Organization has taken on a project of revitalizing the Gaza border region by introducing not only evacuated residents, but bringing those who wish to make aliyah as well, because overseas, 'Jews are afraid to walk the streets' Yaakov Hagoel, Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, lost his brother-in-law, Assaf Schlesinger, a paramedic at the Nova music festival, on October 7. In an interview with 'Mamon' section of Yedioth Ahronoth, he speaks for the first time about the painful family tragedy, shares insights on a complex $407 million project to rehabilitate the north and south of Israel and addresses why the World Zionist Organization is still relevant 76 years after the establishment of a Jewish state. And what does Hagoel, a longtime Likud member, have to say to Miki Zohar, who is working to replace him? 'Miki's attempts are a testament to the influence and power I hold. It’s unfortunate that during a time of war, when there is so much to do, I’m dragged into dealing with this.' How do you cope with such a situation? 'These were the hardest days our family has ever faced. We went from hospital to hospital amidst the terrible chaos. During the shiva, the rabbi who came to visit me mentioned that it was his seventh shiva that day. My brother-in-law left behind twins, a boy and a girl. My personal experience with this family tragedy connects me to the suffering of the families of those kidnapped. When I speak with them, I’m reminded of the heavy sense of uncertainty and fog that envelopes you. It’s extremely difficult. My eldest son served over 100 days in Gaza, took a brief leave to attend his son's Brit Milah, and returned to reserve duty. My daughter-in-law’s family also suffered a loss during the war—a cousin who was killed at Nahal Oz. We went from one funeral to the next. Our nation is in trauma.' Yaakov Hagoel assumed his role four years ago for a five-year term, amid one of the most difficult and challenging times for Jewish communities around the globe. 'Since October 7, attitudes toward the World Zionist Organization have shifted. There is greater awareness of our activities and goals. Antisemitic incidents worldwide have surged dramatically. We are witnessing an eightfold increase in Antisemitic events, amounting to hundreds of such incidents per day globally. The most troubling issue is that many Jews in the diaspora are beginning to accept this situation as normal. 'They view it as ‘the price of being Jewish outside Israel.’ Even worse, many have lost faith in the ability of law enforcement in their countries to protect them. One of the most shocking recent events was the pogrom against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam. The Israeli government managed to evacuate most of the fans back to Israel in record time, but the Jewish community that remained there is experiencing a deep crisis. I sent a team to Amsterdam, and they spent Shabbat with the Jewish community. The situation was extremely distressing—they were afraid to leave their homes. 'As Israelis, we fail to grasp how deeply the sense of security for our brothers and sisters in the diaspora has been shaken. I am in daily contact with representatives of Jewish communities worldwide, and I hear repeatedly that their fears today are far greater than they’ve been in years past. Jews are afraid to walk the streets, reluctant to place mezuzahs on their doorposts. Over the past year, Jewish students have felt unsafe standing out on U.S. campuses or have preemptively chosen not to send their children to such campuses at all.' Any silver linings? 'One of the things that has strengthened me the most during this past challenging year has been witnessing thousands—literally thousands—of Jews from around the world coming here to volunteer and help, despite travel warnings and the ongoing war. They’ve been willing to assist with anything, from agricultural harvests to any task we’ve asked of them. The Jewish diaspora has also contributed an enormous sum of nearly two billion dollars over the past year to various projects in Israel. This moves me deeply and is far from something I take for granted.' What can we expect for the relationship between world Jewry and Israel after the war? 'Based on the number of immigration files that have been opened, we estimate that around 100,000 immigrants are expected to arrive in Israel after the war. Since October 7, despite the complex security situation, approximately 33,000 people have already made Aliyah. As the chairman of the Zionist movement, of course, I would be delighted if everyone chose to make Aliyah, but I respect each individual's right to decide where to live and raise their children. On one hand, I encourage Aliyah, but on the other, I support strengthening Jewish communities in the diaspora because they have the right to exist and thrive anywhere in the world.' 25 years together The World Zionist Organization (WZO) was founded in 1897 by Theodor Herzl at the First Zionist Congress. The organization owns the Jewish National Fund (Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael), holds a 50% stake in the Jewish Agency for Israel and Keren Hayesod (United Israel Appeal), and manages around 20 subsidiary companies, including the rehabilitation organization HaMashkem. With an annual budget of approximately 150 million shekels and a workforce of about 500 employees—240 of whom are emissaries stationed worldwide—the WZO oversees subsidiaries that generate millions more. 'As Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, I essentially serve as the head of a massive holding company,' says Yaakov Hagoel. It’s no surprise that numerous political figures, both within Likud and beyond, have their sights set on gaining control over the WZO. Hagoel was elected to his position following a heated internal battle within World Likud, and political circles are already preparing for the next elections slated for October 2025. This battle revolves around control of enormous budgets, high-ranking positions with significant salaries, and considerable power. Hagoel is seen as a close ally of Danny Danon in World Likud. Danon's control over World Likud and WZO institutions has drawn rivals like Miki Zohar and David Bitan, who have set their sights on these centers of power. Zohar has already signed agreements with political opponents such as Benny Gantz, Avigdor Lieberman, and even Meretz, dividing control over roles and influence in the various bodies under the WZO’s purview. 'I view Miki Zohar’s attempts to take my place as a significant indication of the influence and power I hold in this position,' says Hagoel. 'I was elected four years ago after a very intense battle. Even then, Miki Zohar, along with the Prime Minister and other senior ministers, tried to sway the elections. That battle taught me to value this role even more. I am a democrat and respect the rules of the game. It saddens me, however, that during a time of war, when there is so much to be done, I am being drawn into election matters a year ahead of time.' Could your connection to Danny Danon be working against you? 'Danny is my close friend, a dear person. We’re the same age group, and we first met in the Beitar Movement. We’ve shared a journey of over 25 years together. It’s rare in Israeli politics to have friendships that last this long. I have tremendous respect for Danny, and he reciprocates. There aren’t many people who would leave the Knesset, as Danny did, and say, ‘Friends, if I’m not a senior minister and find myself on the backbench, I’ll return to the place where I’ve made a real impact.’ And that’s what Danny did. Danny is made of the same material I am: the place where we know we can make a difference is the place we strive to be. And I’ll do everything I can to be re-elected. Once every five years, the Jewish world holds elections. Seven hundred delegates are chosen, representing the Jewish people both in Israel and the diaspora. It’s like the parliament of the Jewish people—it’s my sacred space.' Why do we still need an organization like the World Zionist Organization when a Jewish state has existed for decades? 'The State of Israel is a state for all, including the Arabs, and that’s perfectly fine. However, there are specific Jewish interests that we are responsible for, both in Israel and in the diaspora: combating Antisemitism, encouraging Aliyah, and rescuing Jews in distress. The World Zionist Organization leads projects aimed at strengthening the connection between Jews in the diaspora and the State of Israel. It actively promotes Aliyah and helps with the absorption of immigrants in Israel, supports settlement efforts, and contributes to the development of infrastructure across the country. Additionally, the WZO serves as a representative and authoritative body for the Jewish people in the international arena. It continues to play a vital role in mobilizing donations and resources for national causes.' A life of service and Zionist commitment Yaakov Hagoel, 53, is married to Tchiya and the father of four (a 16-year-old son, a 19-year-old daughter who serves as a paramedic in National Service, a 22-year-old son, and a 27-year-old son). He is also a grandfather to two. Born in Tel Aviv, his family moved to Arad when he was seven. 'My parents were true Zionists,' he says. 'Back in the 1970s, moving from the center of the country to the periphery was considered a significant step.' Hagoel began his public service career in the Betar Movement in Arad. 'As a teenager, I founded Betar in the city,' he recalls. 'Later, I was one of the first non-kibbutz members to do a year of service in Ofakim, where I founded a Betar branch when I was 18. Afterward, I joined a Betar Nahal group at Kibbutz Misgav Am. Back then, doing a year of service was something only kibbutzniks did. My whole life has been dedicated to Betar. I’ve held every position imaginable in the movement, eventually becoming its global CEO. Everything I’ve accomplished has been through my own hard work. I even met my wife through Betar. I’ve always wanted to go into politics to make an impact, though I didn’t think it would be in the Jewish world. At the time, I imagined becoming a mayor.' Leading rehabilitation efforts in the wake of the war Since the war, a central focus of the World Zionist Organization has been assisting displaced residents from northern and southern Israel and rehabilitating destroyed communities. The WZO is managing 1.5 billion shekels from the Israeli government for this extensive project. 'We’ve helped establish seven new neighborhoods for evacuees: Shfayim and Kibbutz Ruhama for residents of Kfar Aza, Karmi Gat for evacuees from Nir Oz, Hazerim for residents of Kibbutz Be’eri, with caravans for 300 families and a separate dining hall, Mishmar Ha’emek for those displaced from Nahal Oz, Ashalim for residents of Kerem Shalom, Ramat HaNegev for evacuees from Kibbutz Holit. We worked on tight schedules to ensure children could begin the school year in September. Additionally, the Settlement Division of the WZO is assisting six evacuated regional councils, encompassing a total of 47 communities.'

We turned to Jews around the world and asked for their help. The response was incredible—we received 500 keys to apartments in Israel owned by Jews living abroad. We took full responsibility for these properties, including insurance and property management, in a heartwarming project we named ‘My Home is Your Home.’ These apartments were used not only by evacuees from the Gaza border communities but also by residents of Netivot, Ofakim, and Ashkelon seeking temporary shelter. Jews even offered us their luxury homes in Rehavia, Jerusalem, for the evacuees. Some stories were incredibly touching. One Jewish family offered a home filled with valuable art pieces. I declined that offer, but it illustrates the profound solidarity among Jews worldwide.' How much have you invested in helping evacuees? 'In addition to our assistance for southern evacuees, we invested 28 million shekels in aid for evacuees in the north. It’s painful to say, but during a tour of the north, we saw that there is almost nothing left of Metula. On the way there, I also saw the Roaring Lion memorial—a landmark I know intimately from my days in the Betar Movement. It was heartbreaking to see the area in its current state. It feels just like when our parents arrived here, starting from scratch in the wilderness. A few months ago, we took on an additional responsibility: providing support to the families of hostages and returnees. This is perhaps the most sacred mission we’ve undertaken. Until then, the families of the hostages were cared for by a directorate under the Prime Minister’s Office. The WZO essentially civilianized this directorate. Colonel (Res.) Yaron Cohen, who knows every family that has experienced this unimaginable nightmare, remained in his role, joined by our appointed director, Ilan Or.' What is your vision for the future if you’re re-elected as chairman? 'In my view, the real dream isn’t just to return the residents to the Gaza border region but to bring dozens of families of new immigrants to the area to strengthen it. Immigration is not just an economic growth engine—it’s a message of hope and faith in the State of Israel. When people choose to come here despite everything, it strengthens us all. I sit in Herzl’s chair, in an office where Ben-Gurion once sat. It’s a great privilege to continue this legacy and lead the World Zionist Organization into the challenges of the 21st century.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkvjvmthkl	2024-12-27T23:01:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/07/r1Ph8NfbJJx/r1Ph8NfbJJx_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Sara Netanyahu under the scope over alleged witness harassment in...	Sara Netanyahu, the Prime Minister's wife, is under scrutiny for allegedly intimidating a key witness in her husband’s corruption trial; A TV investigation revealed messages where she reportedly pushed for a campaign against the witness, raising severe legal and ethical implications Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing potential legal trouble after allegations surfaced that she may have tried to intimidate a key witness in a corruption case against her husband. The controversy stems from an investigative report by the TV program 'Uvda,' which revealed text messages allegedly sent by Sara Netanyahu to Hani Blivis, a close aide to the Prime Minister, who was known as a powerful figure in his office. In these messages, Sara Netanyahu reportedly urged Blivis to 'go after' Hadas Klein, a key witness in Case 1000, involving accusations of the Prime Minister and his wife receiving expensive gifts, such as champagne and cigars, from billionaire Arnon Milchan in exchange for political favors. In her messages, Sara Netanyahu reportedly wrote, 'We need to go after Hadas Klein, Arnon Milchan’s secretary, who has been defaming us for years. She lies, slanders, and is vile.' Shortly after these messages were sent, negative posts about Klein began appearing on social media, raising suspicions that Sara Netanyahu may have been involved in witness harassment and obstruction of justice. This prompted Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and State Attorney Amit Isman to instruct the police to open an investigation. For the police to pursue charges, they will need to prove Sara Netanyahu had 'criminal intent'—in other words, that she intended to intimidate Hadas Klein. They will also need to establish a clear connection between the messages allegedly sent to Bleiwis and the social media posts that followed. Witness harassment, the potential charge in this case, is a criminal offense under Israeli law, punishable by up to three years in prison. To convict someone of this offense, prosecutors must demonstrate two main components: intent to harass and evidence linking the harassment to the defendant. A recent example of such a case occurred in 2018, when a man was convicted of harassing Nir Hefetz, a former spokesperson for Netanyahu and a state witness in another case. The man had sent Hefetz a threatening letter, calling him a 'snitch,' and was later sentenced to community service and a fine. This investigation into Sara Netanyahu faces a unique challenge: the phone that allegedly contained the incriminating messages belonged to Hani Blivis, who has since passed away. While the police may still use the messages as evidence if they can establish their authenticity, the defense could argue it’s impossible to verify the circumstances under which the messages were sent, creating potential doubts about the evidence’s reliability. If the investigation progresses, Sara Netanyahu will likely be summoned by the police first for an open testimony and, depending on the evidence, could face formal questioning under caution. The investigation could take months, as the police will need to gather evidence, coordinate with witnesses, and verify findings. There’s also a possibility that the investigation could expand to include other individuals who may have assisted or been involved in the alleged harassment. The investigation is further complicated by the police’s prior criticism of the 'Uvda' report, describing it as 'distorted and false.' Despite this, the investigation will be handled by the Lahav 433 anti-corruption unit, with close oversight from senior prosecutors to ensure objectivity, particularly given its connection to Sara Netanyahu and the ongoing corruption trials involving her husband. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Finally, there are questions about whether these alleged offenses are still within the statute of limitations. For standard cases of witness harassment or obstruction, the statute of limitations is five years. However, if it’s found that Sara Netanyahu conspired with others to harass Hadas Klein, the statute of limitations could extend to ten years. This case could have significant implications—not just for Sara Netanyahu but also for the broader legal battles surrounding Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trials, which have been a focal point of Israeli politics in recent years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy7dpzahyg	2024-12-27T21:57:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/SyU7S7jSJe/SyU7S7jSJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

How IDF uses explosive-laden APCs to clear booby-trapped areas in...	IDF develops a new method using the old M-113 armored personnel carriers, packing them with explosives, and remotely detonating them to clear booby-trapped areas in Gaza; method was also used in Lebanon against Hezbollah Explosions heard across central Israel on Thursday evening originated from a unique IDF tactic initially developed at the start of the current war and previously used in southern Lebanon. The method involves old M-113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) loaded with tons of explosives, which are remotely detonated to clear booby-trapped areas before troops enter. Residents reported feeling intense blasts as far away as Tel Aviv, Hod HaSharon, and Jerusalem. One Tel Aviv resident described the explosions as 'earth-shaking,' while another in Hod HaSharon said, 'The windows shook twice.' The IDF has not issued a formal statement on the incident, though police attributed the noise to military activity in Gaza. Led by the 401st Brigade under the 162nd Division, the operation followed intelligence from the Shin Bet and Military Intelligence Directorate. The IDF claimed the site housed terrorists, terror infrastructure, and ongoing hostile activity. Footage from Gaza showed partially clothed residents with hands raised being escorted by IDF forces surrounded by tanks. Additional visuals from the hospital showed signs of fire damage. According to Palestinian sources, the IDF gave hospital occupants 15 minutes to evacuate before communication with the facility's management ceased. 'Throughout the war, Hamas has used the hospital as a key operational center, sheltering militants and conducting terrorist activities,' an IDF spokesperson stated. The military had previously operated in the area in October and warned against using the facility for military purposes. The IDF emphasized efforts to avoid harming civilians, patients, and medical staff. 'We are operating in a focused manner to minimize harm to uninvolved individuals,' the spokesperson said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas accused the IDF of committing war crimes, alleging the forces 'burned' Kamal Adwan Hospital and mistreated patients, staff, and displaced individuals during the operation. 'The decision to burn the hospital after storming it and abusing its occupants is a war crime and a flagrant violation of international laws and humanitarian values,' a Hamas statement read. The group claimed the IDF systematically targets medical facilities and infrastructure in Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry, managed by Hamas, said the fate of medical staff and patients remains unknown following the operation. The ministry added that the IDF had recently forced evacuations at the Indonesian Hospital under similar circumstances, calling it a further display of 'contempt for global humanitarian values.' The IDF rejected Hamas’ accusations, asserting its compliance with international laws regarding medical facilities. Military officials stressed their efforts to facilitate the evacuation of patients and staff from Kamal Adwan Hospital to other facilities. 'The IDF, in coordination with international organizations and local health officials, has ensured defined evacuation routes using ambulances to guarantee continued medical care,' a military statement read. The IDF highlighted ongoing actions to deliver medical supplies, food, and fuel to hospitals in the area. Despite the IDF’s efforts, the military condemned Hamas for its alleged systematic violations of international law. 'Hamas exploits civilian infrastructure and endangers lives by embedding military operations within medical facilities,' the spokesperson added. As the war continues, the IDF’s operations in Gaza and their impact on medical facilities remain a focal point of global scrutiny. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkt16f3hje	2024-12-27T11:58:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/HyeNraDnSJe/HyeNraDnSJe_0_1_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Israel's future mediator with Iran? The sultan who keeps his door...	One of Sultan Haitham of Oman's first actions upon taking office was ensuring his son would succeed him, securing his legacy; Oman’s strategic location forces the Sultan to navigate delicate diplomacy, maintaining good relations with both Iran and the US while offering medical aid to Yemen's Houthis; Could Trump’s entry pave the way for Israelis to visit Muscat? Haitham bin Tariq Al Said is the Sultan and Prime Minister of Oman, Yemen’s thriving neighbor, and ranks among the Middle East’s most important brokers, always operating beneath the radar. He took power only five years ago on the death of his cousin, Qaboos bin Said who ruled Oman for 49 years – almost half a century. He maintains good relations with Iran, the US, and the Houthis, and conducts covert relations with Israel. Sultan Qaboos died in 2000 after battling cancer for 6 years. He had no children of his own but was close to his cousins, one of whom became the new sultan. Didn’t publicly declare his successor, but rather recorded a statement that was kept in a sealed envelope. After Qaboos’ death, Oman State TV reported that the envelope had been opened and that the family had 'accepted his wise advice' and vision. The TV channel soon after declared Haitham sultan. Qaboos conducted overt relations with Israel for years: In 2018, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a rare visit to Oman, meeting with the sultan at his palace in the capital, Muscat. Former President Shimon Peres visited Oman in 1996, as did then prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1994. Oman was the first Gulf state to approve Israeli diplomatic presence in its territory. Further diplomatic representation was then set up in other countries in the region. This momentum, however, came to a halt in the first two decades of the 21st century due, inter alia, to the stalemate on the Palestinian issue. Oman is very different from its neighbor to the west. 'Qaboos revolutionized his country,' Gulf expert Dr. Shaul Yanai tells Ynet. 'He took a country replete with never-ending civil wars and stabilized it. He managed to keep Oman out of regional wars, and the Arab Spring all but bbypassedOman. Almost nothing happened there.' Although Sultan Haitham has introduced some changes, since assuming power, he has promised to adhere to the sultanate’s policy of neutrality and non-intervention in both regional and international conflicts. 'Unlike Qaboos, Haitham is pareve. Haitham is following in Qaboos’ footsteps. He was chosen and trained by him to continue the tribal distribution of wealth and deal with minorities' says Dr. Yanai. 'He’s carrying on the traditional line, nd is even taking steps bacbackwardaboos was a cultural revolutionary of sorts. Haitham isn’t like that. He’s calmer.' Little is known about Sultan Haitham’s private life. He was born in 1955 in the capital Muscat and is married to Ahad bint Abdullah bin Hamad Al Busaidiyah with whom he has four children. His father was Sayyid Tariq bin Taimur who served as prime minister 1970-1972. Haitham graduated from Oxford in 1979 and before assuming power, served in various official roles in Oman, most recently as Minister of Heritage and Culture from 2002 through to his inauguration. In the 1990s, he served as Secretary General for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Special Envoy for Sultan Qaboos. He also headed Oman’s special committee overseeing the country’s future planning through 2040. He’s known for his love of sports and soccer and served as president of the Oman Football Association. In his first days as sultan, he made efforts to stabilize his rule, turning Oman for the first time, into a 'dynastic monarchy.' As mentioned, his predecessor had no children to inherit the position, and there was fear of a monarchy crisis and internal struggles. Haitham, however, declared that the crown prince would be the Sultan’s firstborn son, thereby fortifying his family’s position. 'Haitham appointed a successor. He already has a designated, heir, providing him with a certain stability' says Dr. Yoel Guzansky, senior researcher and head of the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). 'In the meantime, he’s doing good things for Oman that have contributed to stability, most importantly turning Oman into a dynastic monarchy - essentially toeing the line with other such Gulf states.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In his first speech after taking office, Sultan Haitham promised to continue his predecessor’s foreign policy of peace and economic development and hasn’t implemented any revolutionary measures. 'He’s pretty much continuing Qaboos’ regional policies in terms of relations with Iran and quiet, discreet mediation with the Americans', says Dr. Guzansky. 'He understands Oman’s strength and capabilities, cultivated by Qaboos for years. He’s now reaping the rewards.' Haitham’s four-and-a-half years in office have been generally stable with no serious crises. Despite Oman’s economic development in recent decades, making the country a world success story, Oman is still regarded as relatively poor. 'Oman exports around 10 million barrels,' says Dr. Guzansky. 'Oman is poor in natural resources in Gulf terms. This makes things hard as there were years when oil prices were low.' Like other monarchs, Haitham’s solution wasto increaseg the burden shouldered by the citizens. 'All of the Gulf states have done that,,' says Dr. Guzansky. 'He’s levying VAT and has slightly reduced fuel subsidies, so everything became slightly more expensive. It’s not very significant as it’s still low, but this change is common in many Gulf states that are ‘rentier states’ in that they provide their citizens with nearly everything in exchange for not participating in the political process. There are no political parties, but rather absolute rule.' In Qatar, for example, citizens receive education, health, education, cheap housing and further benefits. Oman, however, can give its citizens less, and its population is larger. 'Haitham isn’t rich like the Emir of Qatar or the President of the UA, E,' says Dr. Guzansky. Another problem facing Oman, which has become a big problem for the sultan in recent years, is the Houthis who have taken control of much of the country’s territory. Prof. Uzi Rabi senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, Tel Aviv University tells Ynet, 'Historically, and now too, there’s enormous concern that practically and realistically, Yemen is becoming a haven for extremely dangerous terrorist organizations. Tensions must be reduced and stability established. The least healthy thing for Oman is having a dangerous Yemen next door.' Oman and its leader are very worried about the terrorist organizations operating in Yemen. 'It’s not a dangerous country in the sense of increased terrorist trends. Oman believes that, as a monarchy in the Gulf, it will become a target for terrorism. Oman is very concerned about the situation in Yemen' says Prof. Rabi. Despite the implications for Oman of the fighting in Yemen, the country has conducted and still conducts, good relations with the Houthis. 'The Houthis receive medical care in Oman. It’s been reported that their contraband comes via Oman - which turns a blind eye, - and that Omani planes are used to fly the senior ranking Houthi wounded' says Dr. Guzansky. He further says that these activities have ultimately been good for Oman in that it has assisted the Saudis in negotiations with the Houthis and also helped the Americans in mediation. Oman isn’t making any great declarations. It is, however, a very important country. I mediate between Iran and the United States, Iran and Saudi Arabia, and before the current war, almost reached an agreement between the latter who are fighting one another in Yemen. Although not regarded as such in Israel, Oman is an important broker, the mediation conducted behind the scenesfocusesg primarily on the Gulf and the Middle East. Haitham visited Tehran in May 2023 and discussed various diplomatic, defense, and regional matters – two days after Oman mediated a Belgium-Iran hostage release. Haitham’s visits to Saudi Arabia, Qatar,r anBritainan are viewed as part of maintaining good relations with all his important partners. His 2021 visit to Saudi Arabia was the Omani sultan’s first political visit to the kingdom in over a decade. 'This is a country that is very good at maintaining good relations with everyone, be on a high or low light, never completely closing the door,' says Dr. Rabi. He says that the Omanis understand that, they talk to the Houthis and Iranians, they’re very important in the eyes of America and the West. 'They’re brokering the Qatari version, with much less toxic aroma of the Muslim Brotherhood, and more on a functional level. They’re not shouting about it. Oman is quietly accruing lots of credit points.' Oman and its leader have very good relations with Tehran. Both Iran and the US trust Oma. 'The problem is that Qatar is competing with Oman on this front and has greater economic capabilities, 'says Dr. Guzansky. 'Qatar also mediates in Africa, and South America, and helps the Americans in Afghanistan. Oman has a global presence, operating on a slightly different scale.' Dr, Guzansky adds, 'I’m not sure the Haitham has the capabilities Qaboos had. Qaboos was Oman and Oman was Qaboos. The country was molded in his image.'Inn tribal societies, mediators are very important and attain a very special status. 'Mediating honestly and correctly serves as a protection of sorts for the country, as regional powers will come to her to resolve issues that can avert war,' says Dr. Yanai. Oman has always maintained neutrality, never, for example, joining in sanctions on Iran. So, Iran can use Oman as a back door for selling oil, goods, and banking systems much more freely than Qatar can' says Dr. Yanai. 'Qatar has gotten itself into trouble with other Gulf states,s,' says Dr. Yanai. 'The Americans need Oman to mediate with Iran due to the endless friction in the Strait of Hormuz that connects the Gulf of Oman in the Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf.' If the strait closes, much of the world’s daily energy can’t pass through, so it’s important for all sides that Oman remains neutral and Oman is very happy in that role.' Now, with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House, the region is starting to wonder what would happen to Iran if the tough sanctions policy is reinstated. 'I’m not sure the Omanis are as happy as other countries, es,' says Prof. Rabi. 'If Trump imposes tough sanctions on Iran, and he may well do that, Oman will have to follow suit rather than playing backhand. If anyone’s thinking of attacking Iran or hindering Iran’s production capabilities, Oman can serve as a base for, quite quickly, restoring these capabilities.' So, despite foreseen regional changes, says Dr. Yani, the clear rule over the past century in the Gulf has been that oil must flow. World economic stability is dependent on oil flowing and on a neutral Oman cooling Riad and Tehran. Oman and the sultan have acquired a very important position in the Gulf and the entire Middle East without placing themselves in the center like Qatar. 'This all due to Qaboos and then Haitham,' says Dr. Yanai. Amid efforts to remain neutral, Haitham must sustain a very delicate tribal balance within Oman. Oman is home to a great deal of Shiites from a variety of countries, including Iranians immigrating for work. There are considerable sized communities, keeping up their relationships with their home countries and Muscat encourages inter-cultural and inter-religious tolerance. Dr. Yanai explains 'Any of the parties can use the western tribes, in the desert near Yemen, to instigate riots if Oman takes a clear side. The embers are always burning, and the regime is sure to subdue them.' Regional conflicts, such as the Houthis in Yemen or Iran’s involvement in Lebanon, have taught Haitham that he must ensure his country doesn’t become pa awn in political games. Oman’s unique ethnic makeup also has a great impact on Haitham’s desire to act as a quiet mediator, without standing out. Most of Oman’s residents are Ibadis, Islam’s third largest sect - a moderate faction, distinct from both Shiites and Sunnis. 'Traditionally, the Ibadi’s haven’t wanted to attract too much attention. Saudi Arabia and Iran are both extremist, theocratic powers - in Saudi Arabia, Wahabi, in Iran, Shiite. The Ibadis could easily be declared heretics if they were to upset anyone. They have always kept a low religious profile' says Dr. Yannai. Israel and Oman conduct informal relations, with covert ties between the countries since the 1970s, including covert, and later overt, visits. Following the Abraham Accords, Oman published an official statement of support, though later stressed that it did not intend to normalize relationsshortlye. In February 2023, Oman announced it would allow Israeli airlines to fly in its airspace. This decision, however, was reversed due to the war.' Then Transport Minister Israel Katz visited Oman in 2018 and received a warm public welcome. With swords, he joined his hosts in an Omani traditional dance to the sounds of a familiar folk song. Minister Katz presented his hosts and Arab ministers with his plan for a rail connection to the Gulf states. The future of relations between the countries, however, is unclear. 'The future is shrouded in fog. It very much depends on the Palestinian issue' says Dr. Guzansky. 'The matter concerns them greatly. There’s a tendency to go in the anti-Israel direction. It started before the war and has since intensified. There are covert talks, but I’m looking ahead. The day will come that Israel needs a conduit to Iran, for all kinds of reasons. Oman could be the address for that.' Over the years, Israel has had good relations with Oman, albeit behind the scenes. 'Israel is remembered for its past assistance in stabilizing Qaboos’ power. Now everything’s more complicated' says Dr. Guzansky. 'In recent years, there have been calls from parliament to scale down ties. When the war broke out, this was true for the entire Arab region. Oman has publicly gone in this direction. It should be noted, however, that there are also quiet, covert, channels.' During Haitham’s reign, however, there’s been a retreat of sorts, explains Prof. Rabi. 'The attitude to Israel is slightly less open and more critical than in Qaboos’ time. We’re seeing an attitude taking the back seat, leaving all doors open.' He says there’s less enthusiasm about promoting moves with Israel, and certainly not the countries who signed the Abraham Accords, but also not like during his predecessor’s time. Qaboos was the first to make efforts to develop diplomatic relations with Israel following the Oslo Accords' says Prof. Rabi. 'In 2000, following the First Intifada, there was a regression. This taught Oman to tread carefully. We’re seeing a deliberate, partial, retreat, telling Oman not to be as bold as in the past. Ultimately, this is demonstrated by having a special relationship with the US, but the Strait of Hormuz means that Iran is also very important to Oman which is revisiting its policy from Qaboos’ time. Let’s just hope some war doesn’t break out in the Gulf. Haitham has toed the line with Arab consensus on questions concerning the Palestinian story. 'Haitham is now in a very interesting position, with Trump on his way back and rumors flying about promoting Israel-Saudi normalization', says Prof. Rabi. 'Much of what Haitham is doing, is preparing lots of bargaining chips for the sultanate for the shifts in the Middle East’s geopolitical sands – such as sanctions on Iran and normalization with Saudi Arabia. If this does happen, Oman will go there, albeit crawling – without ruining what it’s already built up with other parties. Oman’s pace has always been very slow. Oman won’t be waking up one morning and doing a 180 turnaround. It will stand in what it feels is a comfortable middle ground, and tilt the pendulum slightly in the direction the Middle East is going.'

Israel awaits Hamas decision to finalize the hostage release deal	Hamas has yet to provide the lists of hostages held for 448 days, as Jerusalem officials say 'Hamas needs to make a decision to finalize the deal'; US officials have presented hostage families with analyses suggesting that Hamas should agree to a deal before Trump takes office Senior Israeli officials said Friday that Hamas has yet to provide lists of hostages, and while negotiations continue, Jerusalem is urging Hamas to make a decision. 'Hamas needs to make a choice and open the door to finalizing the deal,' they said. The families of Israeli hostages have been waiting for official word on a potential deal as they mark 448 days since 100 hostages, both alive and deceased, were taken by Hamas terrorists to Gaza. Meanwhile, U.S. officials expressed optimism that a hostage deal could be reached, or at least an initial step, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. 'There are signs it's coming together, and there’s still a good chance for a deal,' they told family members’ representatives. The U.S. also outlined why Hamas might consider reaching an agreement now, ahead of Trump’s inauguration. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent comments, blaming Hamas for reneging on previous agreements, have not fazed U.S. officials. They understand Netanyahu’s political constraints, they said. In the meantime, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker has launched a crowdfunding campaign to support her fight for his release. 'I can’t rely on anyone else,' she said. 'I need the public’s help.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zangauker, a leader of the families’ protest movement, voiced her frustration with the government’s actions. 'I see the government abandoning some hostages and leaving them to die in Hamas captivity,' she said. 'I’m furious. They’re playing with my son’s life. Israeli citizens have become pawns in the government's political game.' Despite the ongoing struggle, Zangauker clings to hope. 'I picture hugging Matan every night before I sleep and every morning when I wake up,' she said. 'The knowledge that he's alive and knows what I’m doing for him is my light in this dark time.' While hopeful, Zangauker remains determined to reach a comprehensive deal. She criticized Netanyahu for proposing only a partial deal, arguing it involved 'selecting between the lives of citizens.' She also claimed the government had not authorized the negotiators to address ending the war, a key Hamas demand for releasing all hostages. 'Our fight will not end with the first deal,' Tsangoker stressed. 'It will only end when Israel agrees to end the war in exchange for Matan and all the hostages.' She vowed to continue her struggle, even if it meant using more radical tactics. 'We will apply all possible pressure until the government commits to ending the war in exchange for a full deal,' she said.

US defense system intercepts Yemen missile for the first time sin...	Deployed in October, the U.S.-supplied THAAD air defense system successfully intercepted its first ballistic missile early Friday, launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen; 'We’ve waited 18 years for this' says one of the American soldiers operating the system The U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, deployed in Israel since October, successfully intercepted a ballistic missile launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen early Friday—marking its first operational use in the country. The missile launch occurred against the backdrop of Israel's extensive air operation, 'Operation Sounds of the Vineyard,' targeting Houthi positions in Yemen on Thursday night. The operation, described as Israel's most significant strike against the terror group to date, prompted the missile launch in retaliation. Sirens blared across central Israel, including the Tel Aviv area, Sharon, and Shfela regions, at 3:29 a.m. The interception prevented any casualties or direct damage. However, Magen David Adom (MDA) reported treating 18 people for injuries sustained while rushing to shelters. Two others were treated for anxiety. The missile launch briefly disrupted air travel. Four El Al flights en route to Ben Gurion Airport from Paris, Athens, Berlin, and Munich were rerouted over the Mediterranean. Landings resumed approximately 30 minutes after the sirens ceased. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, France condemned the Houthi attacks, including the ballistic missile launch and ongoing drone strikes against Israel. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the attacks 'unacceptable,' stating they undermine regional stability and must stop. France reaffirmed its commitment to Israel’s security and regional stability. The THAAD system, operated by approximately 100 U.S. soldiers stationed in Israel, is designed to intercept missiles at high altitudes, even outside the atmosphere, using kinetic energy. Similar in capability to Israel’s Arrow missile defense system, THAAD can target various stages of an enemy missile's flight path. The U.S. deployed the THAAD system to Israel at its request, both as a strategic deterrent and a display of military support in the region. Israeli officials view THAAD as a significant enhancement to the country’s multi-layered air defense systems, particularly in light of escalating threats, including from Iran. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkbscb2bjg	2024-12-27T07:16:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2017/07/30/7940246/7940246_0_0_1300_730_0_small.jpg

Italian journalist arrested for over a week in Iran, Italy says	Rome accuses Tehran of taking journalist Cecilia Sala, 29, under arrest and placing her in solitary confinement; Iran fails to respond to claims An Italian journalist has been under arrest in Iran for more than a week, Italy's foreign ministry said on Friday, adding it was following the case with the 'utmost attention'. Cecilia Sala, 29, works for the newspaper Il Foglio and for podcast company Chora Media. She was arrested by police in Tehran on December 19, the ministry said in a statement. Italy's government 'has worked with Iranian authorities to clarify Cecilia Sala's legal situation and verify the conditions of her detention', the statement said. Chora Media said in a separate statement that Sala was being held in solitary confinement in the Evin prison in Tehran and that no reason had been given for her arrest. There was no immediate confirmation of the arrest by Iranian officials. It was not clear whether it might be linked to tensions between Rome and Tehran after Iran last week summoned a senior Italian diplomat and the Swiss ambassador, who represents U.S. interests in the country, over the arrest of two Iranian nationals. One of the men was arrested in Italy at Washington's request. Chora Media said Sala had left Rome for Iran on December 12 with a valid journalist visa and had conducted several interviews and produced three episodes of her 'Stories' podcast. She had been due to fly back to Rome on December 20. The Italian ambassador to Iran visited Sala in prison on Friday, the ministry and Chora said. The journalist has also been in phone contact with her family, they said. Chora said news of her arrest was not immediately made public as her family and Italian authorities had hoped that keeping it quiet could help secure her swift release. The foreign ministry urged the media to exercise 'maximum discretion' over the case, while Chora launched a #FreeCecilia hashtag. 'Her free voice has been silenced, and neither Italy nor Europe can tolerate this arbitrary arrest. Cecilia Sala must be freed immediately,' Chora said.

Israel remains vigilant': A month into cease-fire agreement with...	Military officials recount Hezbollah violations treated by the IDF and stress forces are ready to act against terror group if needed; US enforcement mechanism aids in easing tensions The cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah on the northern border came into effect a month ago. Despite skepticism, suspicions, violations and mutual accusations, it's holding for now. IDF forces remain deployed in most of the areas where they operated during the ground operation. However, the agreement’s enforcement mechanism isn’t fully functional yet. Lebanon has expressed doubts about Israel's willingness to withdraw from its territories at the end of the 60 days stipulated in the agreement. The IDF also doesn't regard the deadline as sacred. During a Security Cabinet meeting held at the IDF Northern Command this past week, security officials reported a decrease in Hezbollah's attempts to violate the agreement. Simultaneously, there’s been improvement in the work of the cease-fire enforcement mechanism, headed by a U.S. general. Cooperation between Israel, the IDF and the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) has been described as excellent. Still, violations of various kinds take place. Israel is allowing the mechanism to address them while continuing to act independently when immediate threats are identified. 'That’s why we work alongside it, but we still enforce it ourselves at this stage,' an Israeli official said. 'It looks better now than it did before, but like in Syria, Israel remains vigilant.' According to IDF data, the IDF has eliminated 44 terrorists, conducted 25 strikes in Lebanon and documented 120 Hezbollah violations since the cease-fire began. Conversely, Lebanon accused Israel of violating the agreement in An-Naqoura, citing airstrikes, the raising of the Israeli flag in a Lebanese village and roadblocks, excavation work and explosions in areas like Yaroun and Kfar Kila — actions seemingly intended to achieve unfulfilled war goals. Lebanese officials, meanwhile, doubt Israel's readiness to withdraw from Lebanese territories as stipulated. If Israel fails to to so, Hezbollah might respond with force, claiming Israel breached the agreement which could reignite regional escalation and place the Lebanese army in a precarious position against the Shiite terror organization. The Lebanese drew criticism the 'slow pace' of the agreement’s enforcement mechanism, which they argue allows Israel to continue its operations in the country’s south. Beirut fears Israel aims to provoke Hezbollah into retaliating, thereby framing it as responsible for collapsing the cease-fire. Hezbollah, though battered, has so far exercised relative restraint while issuing warnings about time running out. The IDF remains prepared to stay in locations beyond the border if the Lebanese army fails to meet its commitments or achieve full control over the area. For now, Israel is dismantling weapons caches and tunnels in approximately 15-20 villages near the border while driving back Lebanese civilians attempting to return to the area. Meanwhile, the IDF enforces the cease-fire and has targeted dozens of terrorists approaching the border or preparing rocket launches against Israel. One significant from which the IDF withdrew during the first month of the cease-fire was the Al-Khiyam region, the northernmost area where Israeli forces operated in, extending into Lebanon from the Upper Galilee and paralleling the northern Hula Valley. The IDF drew back after the Lebanese army deployed in the area and began searching for and confiscating Hezbollah rocket launchers in the Litani and Saluki Valleys. The cease-fire’s implementation is meant to proceed gradually for the IDF, with the withdrawal date — while set — not taken as immutable. The possibility of an extended presence in parts of southern Lebanon is being considered. In recent days, most IDF activity has been focused on destroying underground complexes in the western sector, near villages where Lebanon has claimed violations. Attack helicopter strikes against identified Hezbollah operatives have also been reported in these areas. Unlike the 2006 cease-fire under UN Resolution 1701, which ended the Second Lebanon War, this time, the enforcement mechanism is led by an American general rather than weak UNIFIL inspectors. This change means that immediate strikes will be carried out with minimal bureaucratic hurdles if the IDF detects preparations by Hezbollah for attacks against Israel or short-term threats. For less immediate threats, such as the construction of observation posts or bunkers, the IDF will report the location to the American enforcement mechanism. A drone will verify and document the violation and the Lebanese army will be required to address it. Failing to do so will enable the IDF to act. This approach also extends to arms smuggling from Syria to Lebanon for Hezbollah. By collaborating with the American-led enforcement mechanism, Israel aims to address potential threats effectively while maintaining the option to act unilaterally if necessary.

IDF officer holds son’s bris at kibbutz where harrowing October 7...	Moshe Barsheshet and his wife Renana hold their newborn son’s circumcision ceremony at Kibbutz Holit where he bravely fought terrorists during Hamas' attack 'When I heard about the chaos in the south, I immediately knew it was something big,' recalls Moshe Barsheshet, reflecting on the day that changed the course of Israel’s history — and his own life. 'I was an IDF company commander when a soldier named Rafael Hayun connected us with two people from Kibbutz Holit.' 'They told us the kibbutz was devoid of military presence and infiltrated by Hamas terrorists. Although I was instructed not to head in, I decided to go anyway. On the way, we witnessed horrifying scenes,' he recounts. When Barsheshet and his team arrived at Holit, the situation was dire. 'We discovered around 60 terrorists in the kibbutz,' he says. 'Houses were burning and there were many wounded. We engaged in a fierce battle, during which some of our comrades were injured. But by dawn we regained control of the kibbutz with the help of additional military forces.' Barsheshet and his unit worked tirelessly to evacuate the wounded to the kibbutz gate, clear homes, and rescue survivors. The experience left a profound mark on him. 'I feel a deep connection to the kibbutz, its people, and the place itself,' he says. 'A person who experiences battle or a significant event either becomes repelled by the location or deeply attached to it. My life could have ended there and terrorists cruelly took the lives of so many. But for me, it was essential to return to that place, find closure and raise a new generation where there was once so much sorrow and blood.' A moment of closure Last Friday, Barsheshet and his wife, Renana, returned to Holit but for their son’s brit milah (Jewish circumcision ceremony) — a symbolic act of renewal. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Holit remains a closed military zone, largely uninhabited except for soldiers and a few kibbutz members maintaining the site. Despite this, Barsheshet secured the necessary permissions from both the military and the kibbutz. 'We brought catering, invited the soldiers who were with me that day, kibbutz members and security personnel,' he shares. 'It was an incredibly emotional and joyful moment — to bring new light to a place once shrouded in darkness. It truly felt like closing a circle.' Barsheshet shared a deeply personal message. 'I’m a settler from Kiryat Arba and they’re kibbutz residents from Holit. Before October 7, our paths rarely crossed. But the terrorists’ bullets didn’t discriminate between us.' 'We need to set aside our divisions,' he says. 'We all know how fractured the nation was before. I want to raise my children with certain values and holding the Brit milah at Holit is part of that. It’s a testament to our shared humanity and resilience.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1zjjrjh1g	2024-12-27T01:30:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/By0I9Z00S1x/By0I9Z00S1x_460_196_759_427_0_small.jpg

New Damascus governor wants 'peace' with Israel, says its fears a...	Maher Marwan, appointed by Syria's de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, says many Syrians wish for coexistence as Israel remains skeptical Maher Marwan, the new governor of Damascus appointed by Syria’s de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), made a surprising statement calling on the United States to establish peace between Syria and Israel. 'There exists a people who want coexistence. They want peace. They don't want disputes. We want peace, and we cannot be an opponent to Israel or an opponent to anyone,' he said in an interview with U.S. public radio network NPR. However, he acknowledged Israel’s concerns, saying, 'It's natural for Israel to be worried about certain factions.' He added, ' Israel may have felt fear, so it advanced a little, bombed a little, etc. We have no fear towards Israel, and our problem is not with Israel. And we don't want to meddle in anything that will threaten Israel's security or any other country's security.' A U.S. official confirmed that the new Syrian administration's message was relayed to Israel but noted that the White House isn’t urging either side to take steps toward establishing relations at this time. Direct dialogue between the U.S. and the Syrian rebels has been ongoing since the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, culminating in the removal of the $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa’s head due to his past jihadist activities. Israeli officials have indicated that while the Americans understand Israel’s security needs and concerns, they believe Israel should give the new regime a chance. Conversely, Israel maintains a far more skeptical stance. Syria’s transitional government, led by al-Sharaa, recently announced several appointments, including new governors for the country’s provinces, one of whom is Maher Marwan. The governors will serve for three months in the timeframe allocated to form the new government. According to reports in Arab media, Marwan was born in Damascus in 1979. He actively participated in the protests in Syria starting in 2011 and has lived in Saudi Arabia, Damascus the city of al-Qaryatayn in the Homs countryside and later in Idlib. He studied at Idlib University and held various positions under the Syrian opposition, which now controls the country. Israeli officials appear unfazed by the governor's remarks. Sources in Jerusalem told Ynet earlier this week, 'The burden of proof is on al-Sharaa and his people. We mustn’t forget their ideological foundations.' According to these sources, the 'warm' messages from Damascus’s new leadership remain an enigma as no one knows which direction the new regime will take. While al-Sharaa and his team are saying the 'right things,' the post-October 7 mood in Israel is marked by skepticism and fears of a 'charm offensive' meant to deceive the West. Al-Sharaa isn’t affiliated with the Islamic State (ISIS). He was once active in al-Qaeda but left the organization years ago, pivoting toward other jihadist yet more Syrian nationalist-oriented paths. In the past, he also led al-Nusra Front during its affiliation with al-Qaeda and the group itself maintained ties with Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel believes it’s too early to predict al-Sharaa’s intentions or his ability to maintain a unified and democratic Syria.

What do Christian Zionists need to do to support Israel?	‘Liquid Prophecy’ and Loud Voices: Experts weigh in on how Christians can stand with Israel today What does Israel need from Christian Zionists? This was one of the questions that three experts on Israel-Christian relations sought to answer this week on Christmas Eve. During ILTV’s Insider, Maj. (Res.) A.Y. Katsof, founder and director of The Heart of Israel; Ilse Strauss, news bureau chief of Bridges for Peace; and Pesach Wolicki, executive director of Israel365 Action, shared their Christmas messages with North American evangelicals, who, according to recent reports, make up about 25% of the population. 'Pray for Israel,' was Katsof’s message. 'I see there are so many churches praying for Israel, reading Psalms, praying for the peace of Jerusalem, praying for the peace of Judea and Samaria,' he said. On the other hand, he urged them to visit and 'put boots on the ground.' Katsof runs 'Settlers’ Cellar' in Eish Kodesh, where he grows grapes harvested by Christians and produces what he calls 'liquid prophecy'—wine made in the ancient tradition of the Israelites, whose first kingdom was in the area. 'Come to the land. See it for yourself,' Katsof said. 'We’re waiting to greet you and let you taste some liquid prophecy.' Wolicki encouraged Christians to stand up for Israel and the Jewish people in their own communities. 'Be loud. Be proud,' he said. 'The pro-Hamas supporters are a tiny, little fringe minority, but they’ve taken to the streets. We need Christians not only to pray for Israel but to be out there in public, standing up, making their voices heard.' He emphasized that such actions would 'matter a lot to the Jewish community,' adding, 'You’ll see more and more Jewish arms open to the relationship if Christians do that.' Strauss, however, focused on empowering Christians to strengthen themselves. 'Educate yourself,' she advised, addressing ILTV’s Christian Zionist audience directly. 'Make sure you have the facts. You can’t stand in front of someone who comes with an accusation of genocide, and your answer is, ‘Yes, but it’s God’s chosen people.’ Have the facts on the ground. Listen to people in the know. Make sure you are an expert.' She concluded, 'Your voice matters. So make sure that when you have that 30 seconds, you use it wisely.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjl6inssjg	2024-12-26T20:42:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/11/rkbGP1gxGyg/rkbGP1gxGyg_0_0_1000_563_0_small.jpg
The 'diplomatic Iron Dome' Israel didn't know it needed	MK Moshe Tur Paz and Josh Reinstein predict Trump’s Christian Zionist-backed administration will usher in a transformative era for Israel A sea change is expected on January 20, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office, and Israel is poised to feel its impact, according to Joshua Reinstein, President of the Israel Allies Foundation. 'When Trump comes in, he is going to sign a variety of executive orders. I don’t think you’re going to see any more lawfare like the International Criminal Court. I think you’re going to see the end of UNRWA [The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]. You’re going to see Jerusalem embassies opening up one after another,' Reinstein told ILTV News on this week’s podcast. 'It’s a new dawn. And this is thanks to our Christian allies. This is what we’ve been working for over the last 21 years—to mobilize Christians around the world to stand with Israel and create real political action. 'I think the best is yet to come for faith-based diplomacy,' he added. Reinstein spoke with ILTV shortly after MK Moshe Tur Paz was appointed co-chair of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus. This caucus, one of 54 worldwide, is designed to mobilize political support from lawmakers who stand with Israel out of faith. While the caucus is open to all, it primarily includes Christians who view Israel as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Tur Paz, a member of the centrist Yesh Atid party, has been involved with the caucus for four years. Reflecting on the challenges Israel has faced, he said, 'In the past year, we have confronted Iran in ways we never have since the country’s founding.' He emphasized the importance of U.S. support, saying, 'Now, we need the Americans there with us. We have faced antisemitic voices around the world. When we have Donald Trump and his administration on our side, it’s a completely different battle—a stronger way to fight.' Tur Paz also expressed optimism about the future. 'We know we may have new challenges ahead, but we have a strong friend in the United States—in Congress and the White House. That’s a big, big thing for Israel.' Reinstein believes the Trump administration will be 'the most pro-Israel administration in the history of American-Israel relations, even more so than the last Trump administration, which was probably Israel’s greatest supporter to date.' He attributes this to the Republican Party’s strong base of Bible-believing Christians and Trump’s selection of like-minded individuals for key positions. 'For example, Peter Hegseth, nominated to be Secretary of Defense, is an evangelical Christian. The U.S. Ambassador to Israel nominee, Mike Huckabee, is also an evangelical Christian,' Reinstein said. 'These individuals, and many others, support Israel not just for political or economic reasons, but because of their faith. That’s a kind of support that doesn’t waver,' he stressed. Reinstein anticipates a wave of embassies opening in Jerusalem soon after Trump takes office, with countries from Africa, Latin America, and even Europe expressing interest. While he did not confirm specifics, he suggested Argentina might be next, followed by nations like Fiji, Malawi, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Romania. 'As the Trump administration works with Israel, there could be a package of benefits for countries that recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. This aligns with official U.S. policy and, of course, Israel’s policy,' Reinstein explained. A Diplomatic Iron Dome The role of Christian Allies Caucuses has grown significantly since the October 7 Hamas massacre. Reinstein described them as 'the diplomatic Iron Dome of the State of Israel,' with around 1,500 legislators advocating for Israel in their own parliaments since the war began. 'We’re seeing faith-based diplomacy in action worldwide,' Reinstein said. 'For example, Australia’s parliamentary Israel caucus passed legislation banning antisemitic symbols in public. This is crucial in a country that has seen an unprecedented spike in antisemitism.' In another case, the Dutch parliament decided to phase out funding for UNRWA, following advocacy by former caucus co-chair and Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel. She visited the Netherlands twice to highlight how UNRWA had been infiltrated by terrorists. Even at the International Criminal Court, when a case against Israel was publicly presented, 500 Christians stood outside waving Israeli flags. Some Jews have historically been hesitant to work with Christians due to a history of antisemitism and persecution. However, both Reinstein and Tur Paz said these attitudes are shifting. 'Eighty percent of our diplomatic successes now come from faith-based diplomacy,' Reinstein said. 'People are realizing there’s nothing more powerful than Christian support for Israel. There are 15 million Jews in the world and a billion Christians.' Tur Paz agreed. 'Faith-based diplomacy is great for Israel and the world. I’d like to see similar partnerships with Muslims,' he said. 'It’s about people-to-people and faith-to-faith. If we can work together in this way, it’s a great path for the world.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aixhohye	2024-12-26T19:56:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/04/Bkv1FQiga/Bkv1FQiga_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Attack comes hours after Israel conducted its largest air raid against Houthi targets in Yemen; IDF says investigating incident; 4 El Al flights en route to Ben Gurion Airport temporarily redirected to circle over Mediterranean before receiving clearance to land Air-raid sirens blared across central Israel, including the Gush Dan area, the Shephelah region and parts of the West Bank, following a missile launch from Yemen, the IDF reported Friday morning, less than a day after Israel launched its largest air raid against Houthi targets in Yemen to date. According to an initial statement from the IDF, the sirens were triggered due to a missile crossing into Israeli airspace. Later, the military clarified that the missile was intercepted before entering Israeli territory, and the alarms were activated as a precaution against debris from the interception. The incident disrupted air traffic, with four El Al flights en route to Ben Gurion Airport from Paris, Athens, Berlin and Munich temporarily redirected to circle over the Mediterranean Sea before receiving clearance to land.

IDF officer killed in combat in northern Gaza	Maj. Hod Shriebman falls in battle in Jabaliya; another Multidimensional Unit soldier seriously wounded; unit has faced heavy losses, including its commander and 3 soldiers in Jabaliya; tank soldier severely wounded by sniper The IDF reported on Thursday that Major Hod Shriebman, 27, a company commander in the Multidimensional Unit (888), from Tzofit, was killed during combat operations in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. Just three months ago, Shriebman married his partner, who shared photos on Facebook, celebrating their 'happy day.' In a separate incident early Thursday, Captain (res.) Amit Levi was killed in the central Gaza Strip. Since the outbreak of the war, 823 Israeli soldiers have lost their lives. During the encounter in which Major Shriebman fell, another soldier from the Multidimensional Unit, also known as the Ghost Unit, was seriously wounded. Additionally, a tank commander from the 401st Armored Brigade's 9th Battalion was severely wounded in northern Gaza due to sniper fire. In October, a battle in Jabaliya claimed the lives of an officer and three soldiers from the Multidimensional Unit: Captain Yehonatan (Joni) Keren from Moshav Moladot, Staff Sergeant Nisim Meital from Hadera, Staff Sergeant Aviv Gilboa from Neve Tzuf and Staff Sergeant Naor Haimov from Rosh HaAyin.

In line with its mission, the unit comprises a diverse group of fighters from various branches, including Golani, Armor, Engineering and elite units like Sayeret Matkal and Shaldag. On October 7, the unit lost its commander, Colonel Roi Levy, who was critically injured during Operation Protective Edge and later fell in combat in the Ramim area. In the afternoon, Captain (res.) Amit Levi, who was killed in the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, was laid to rest. The incident occurred around 5 a.m. during a routine nighttime battalion raid aimed at locating anti-tank missiles, weapons and intelligence materials belonging to Hamas.

In the crosshairs: The children of Hamas officials who were assas...	Since the outbreak of the war, Israel has intensified its focus on targeting the children of senior Hamas officials, many of whom hold significant roles within the terror organization; this strategy has reportedly escalated in recent weeks The children of senior Hamas leaders remaining in Gaza have reportedly been in Israel's crosshairs since the outbreak of the war. However, according to Arab media reports, targeted killings of these individuals have only intensified in recent weeks. 'Being the child of a Hamas leader grants significant social status in Gaza, even amid public anger against them,' sources in Gaza said. 'These families often have access to resources, know how to hide effectively and can secure food and shelter. They are also well-acquainted with Gaza's infrastructure, some of which Israel has yet to reach.' The first reported assassination occurred on December 28, when the IDF killed Muhammad Issa, the son of Marwan Issa, then deputy head of Hamas’ military wing and the organization's third-ranking leader. Both father and son were killed in separate strikes. Muhammad, who had been battling cancer for years, had unsuccessfully sought medical evacuation from Gaza prior to the war. In April, Israeli forces struck a significant blow by eliminating three sons and three grandchildren of Ismail Haniyeh, the former head of Hamas' political bureau. The six were killed in a targeted strike on the Shati refugee camp in western Gaza. Haniyeh himself was later reported killed in Tehran. In November, Ala’a and Baha’a Barhoum, sons of senior Hamas figure Fawzi Barhoum, were killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Taba’in school in Gaza City. According to local sources, they were there to deliver salaries to Hamas personnel. August saw the killing of Ismail Nofal, the son of Ayman Nofal, a commander in Hamas' military wing and a close associate of Mohammed Deif. Both father and son were killed in separate airstrikes, with Ayman Nofal eliminated early in the war. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sources told the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat that Israel conducted a drone strike in the Jabaliya refugee camp last month, killing Taher Ghandour, the son of Ahmed Ghandour, the commander of northern Gaza and head of Hamas' rocket program. Ahmed Ghandour was killed in November 2022 in a tunnel strike in Jabaliya. Other recent casualties include Imad Salman, son of Rafat Salman, a former senior military operative in northern Gaza; Sohaib and Hassan Rajab, sons of Wael Rajab, a deputy commander who was also killed in Jabaliya; and Ahmad Abu Askar, son of Mohammed Abu Askar, Hamas' administrative chief in the camp. Broader operations Among other targeted killings, Israel eliminated Mohammed Al-Sharafi, son of Youssef Al-Sharafi, a senior Hamas political bureau member; Ibrahim Harb, son of Yasser Harb, another political bureau member; and Sohaib Al-Biyari, son of a prominent commander in Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, and Ibrahim Mohammed Sinwar, a nephew of Yahya Sinwar. Israel has reportedly attempted to assassinate Muamin Al-Jabari, son of Ahmed Al-Jabari, a former deputy of Mohammed Deif who was assassinated in 2012. That attempt was unsuccessful. Additionally, Asharq Al-Awsat reported that Israel recently killed one of Deif’s brothers in a strike on his Khan Younis residence. The intensifying campaign reflects Israel’s strategy of targeting the inner circle of Hamas leadership, aiming to disrupt the organization’s infrastructure and command network while also addressing the families’ roles in Gaza’s conflict dynamics. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syp0z11sbyg	2024-12-26T09:20:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/10/HyPQu74lC/HyPQu74lC_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israel’s Air Force launches largest Yemen strike yet, targeting Sanaa Airport and other key locations; 'No Houthi leader will escape Israel’s reach,' Katz says Israeli officials confirmed the country’s largest airstrike in Yemen since the war began, targeting Houthi-controlled sites in Sanaa and other key locations. The operation involved 25 aircraft, including fighter jets, reconnaissance planes and tankers, and hit infrastructure critical to Houthi operations. Targets included Sanaa International Airport, where the control tower and landing aids were destroyed to prevent Iranian supply shipments. Civilian aircraft used by the Houthi government were also hit. Additional strikes targeted Hodeidah’s port, a power station with five turbines and oil facilities. Damage reports from Yemeni media indicated the airport’s runways, terminal buildings and the Haziz power station south of Sanaa were also struck. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz observed the operation from the Israeli Air Force command center alongside IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar. 'We are determined to cut off this terror arm of Iran’s axis of evil,' Netanyahu said. Katz added, 'Those who harm Israel will be hunted. No Houthi leader will escape Israel’s reach.' Halevi emphasized the IDF’s long-range strike capabilities, saying, 'Once again, we’ve shown we can reach and eliminate any threat to Israel’s citizens, with precision and power.' Houthi-affiliated Yemeni network Al Masirah reported three deaths and 16 injuries from the strikes on Sanaa airport. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was at the airport during the strike. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Writing on X (formerly Twitter), he said, 'The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge – just a few meters from where we were – and the runway were damaged.

A senior Israeli official defended the operation: 'If the Houthis don’t understand force, they’ll understand even more force.' Another source suggested future escalations: 'The Houthis only respond to direct action, and that action will come.' Israel emphasized close coordination with the U.S., which provided intelligence for the strike. A source described the operation as a 'Hanu-Christmas' collaboration, underscoring the partnership between the two nations. The strikes follow a series of Houthi ballistic missile launches, with four incidents in the past week alone. These attacks triggered widespread nighttime alarms across central Israel, causing destruction at a school in Ramat Efal and in Tel Aviv. Israeli officials stressed that further measures are on the table to address the escalating threat. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1wrsmih1x	2024-12-26T08:54:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/26/rylV0wWjH1e/rylV0wWjH1e_0_152_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Pro-Palestinian leaders removed from Michigan’s student governmen...	University of Michigan student government president Alifa Chowdhury removed alongside vice president after blocking funding to pressure university to cut ties with Israeli companies, supporting harassment of Jewish students and encouraging meeting disruptions The University of Michigan’s Central Student Government has removed its president, Alifa Chowdhury, and vice president, Elias Atkinson, citing misconduct tied to their controversial pro-Palestinian activism and incitement of violence against Jewish students. Chowdhury and Atkinson, elected in April amid a wave of campus protests against Israel, spearheaded initiatives that included boycotts targeting Israeli companies or firms allegedly profiting from the Gaza conflict. Their actions put them at odds with university administrators and the Jewish community on campus. The 40-page resolution outlining their dismissal accused the two leaders of failing in their roles, eroding trust within the student body of approximately 50,000. 'Their decisions not only harmed student organizations but also undermined the community’s confidence in its elected leadership,' the resolution stated. 'Their inability to protect student representatives, coupled with their endorsement of violence and harassment, represents a severe breach of duty.' Chowdhury and Atkinson ran on a platform titled 'Shut It Down,' promising to sever the university’s ties with companies they claimed supported the Gaza conflict. Early in their tenure, they suspended $1.3 million in annual funding for student clubs—ranging from debate teams to dance groups—until the university complied with their demands. The funding freeze crippled hundreds of student organizations, prompting backlash from students who accused the duo of disregarding the broader campus community. The funds, derived from mandatory student fees, were blocked at the governance level, leaving clubs scrambling for resources. University administrators attempted to mitigate the fallout with temporary loans, but tensions escalated. Protests disrupted student government meetings, with reports of physical threats against council members. Chowdhury and Atkinson frequently skipped meetings to avoid reversing their decisions. 'The campus became a political battleground, leaving students to bear the brunt,' said the president of one major student club. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The unrest peaked on Oct. 8, when Chowdhury and Atkinson encouraged protesters to storm a meeting discussing the funding freeze. Jewish council members reported threats, verbal assaults and even spitting incidents during the disruption. Additional allegations against Chowdhury included unauthorized changes to the student government’s official Instagram account credentials. The Jewish student population at the University of Michigan is among the largest at U.S. public universities, with roughly 6,500 members, including 5,000 undergraduates and 1,500 graduate students. In tandem with their removal, pro-Palestinian students filed a lawsuit this week against the university, alleging constitutional rights violations stemming from the administration’s handling of anti-Israel protests. Filed in Michigan’s district court, the lawsuit accuses the university of disproportionately targeting pro-Palestinian students with disciplinary actions, including campus bans, job terminations, and employment restrictions. The lawsuit details incidents such as arrests during a 2023 sit-in at the university president’s office, where law enforcement from 10 counties was present. Protesters reported physical mistreatment, including one instance where a student’s hijab was forcibly removed. The university has not commented on the allegations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hknxkyorkl	2024-12-26T06:53:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/06/SJAQvPIfA/SJAQvPIfA_1_407_719_405_0_small.jpg
Israeli officials: '100 aircraft took part in Yemen air raid'	Israeli officials confirmed that the Air Force carried out its largest strike to date in Yemen, targeting key infrastructure, including Sanaa International Airport. The control tower was rendered inoperable, and civilian aircraft used by the Houthi administration were also hit. The strikes extended to Hodeidah’s port and a power station. Officials noted that 100 aircraft participated in the operation, which was coordinated in advance with the United States. 'We said the Houthis would pay a heavy price. If they don’t understand force, they’ll understand even greater force,' an Israeli source said, adding that this strike will not be the last. Lebanese network Al Mayadeen, affiliated with Hezbollah, alleged the strikes targeted sick passengers at Sanaa Airport.

An Israeli official confirmed to Sky News Arabia that Israel carried out strikes on Sanaa International Airport, marking its response to a series of ballistic missile launches by the Houthis targeting Israel. According to Yemeni sources, the strikes hit the airport’s control tower and damaged aircraft stationed there. Some reports claim all targets were civilian, with casualties reported, though exact numbers remain unclear. Additional strikes reportedly hit the Haziz power station near Sanaa and locations in the port city of Hodeidah.

This attack follows last week’s Israeli strike on Yemen—the first to target Sanaa since the war began and the third Israeli operation in Yemen since October 7. The Houthis have launched multiple missile attacks on Israel. The strikes occurred as al-Houthi delivered his regular Thursday speech, a platform often used to boast about attacks on Israel. The reclusive leader, who has been in hiding for years, delivers speeches exclusively via television. Despite the reported strikes, Houthi-controlled TV channels continued broadcasting his address uninterrupted. *This is a breaking news story.

IDF changed rules of engagement shortly after October 7 attack, r...	International outlet's extensive investigation, citing Israeli military commanders, claims IDF approved 'unprecedented' strikes against Hamas in Gaza with up to 20 civilian casualties approved per attack; Military denies accusations An investigation has revealed that the IDF dramatically changed its rules of engagement and restrictions on targeting civilians in Gaza immediately following Hamas' terror attack on October 7, 2023, the New York Times reported on Thursday. The shift led to what has been described as one of the most intense bombing campaigns in contemporary warfare. According to the investigation, at exactly 1:00 p.m. on October 7, 2023, for the first time in the history of conflicts with Hamas, a senior IDF command issued an order granting mid-ranking officers extensive authorization to target thousands of locations in Gaza. These included lower-priority Hamas operatives who had not been high-value targets in previous operations. Under these orders, officers were allowed to approve strikes that could risk the lives of up to 20 civilians — significantly more than the restrictions that had previously been in place. Most strikes in past operations were only approved after officers determined there would be no civilian casualties. In some cases, up to five civilian casualties were permitted and rarely was the threshold raised to 10 or more. According to a senior IDF officer interviewed by the newspaper, the military changed its engagement rules because it believed Israel faced an existential threat during the initial hours of Hamas' surprise attack which resulted in the massacre of 1,200 Israelis and the kidnapping of 250 others to Gaza. This was while terrorists were still present inside Israel. The senior officer said that it was imperative to exert significant force to neutralize the threat, executing thousands of strikes in a short time. This necessitated decentralizing strike authorization, typically reserved for senior command. These critical hours were further complicated by the looming fear of a potential Hezbollah invasion from Lebanon, which required the IDF to divert considerable forces to that front. The investigation claimed that in its effort to dismantle Hamas' capabilities in Gaza, Israel significantly weakened oversight mechanisms meant to prevent harm to civilians. It adopted 'flawed' methods for identifying targets and assessing risks to innocents, ignored warnings from IDF officers and U.S. officials about deficiencies and failed to conduct thorough post-strike investigations or punish wrongdoers. The American outlet noted that its findings were based on the review of dozens of military documents and interviews with over 100 soldiers and other sources, including over 25 individuals involved in strike approvals. The report said that in order to significantly expand the target pool in Gaza — part of the pledge to counter the attack on Israel and destroy Hamas — the number of Palestinian civilians who could be endangered in each strike was also increased. The outcome, according to the investigation, was the IDF dropping nearly 30,000 bombs and munitions on Gaza — more than the total used in the subsequent eight months combined. The investigation found that another order issued by IDF command at 10:50 p.m. on October 8 indicated the scale of civilian casualties deemed acceptable during those early days of the war. According to the order, strikes on military targets in Gaza could cumulatively risk the lives of up to 500 civilians daily. This limit was reportedly removed two days later, allowing officers to approve an unlimited number of strikes they deemed lawful. A 500 casualty limit: precaution or quota? IDF sources told the outlet that the removed restriction was actually a precaution meant to limit the number of strikes per day. However, Professor Michael N. Schmitt of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, argued that mid-level officers might have interpreted it as a 'quota' of permissible civilian deaths per day. Following the limit’s removal, Hamas-controlled authorities in Gaza often reported daily death tolls exceeding 500, though it remains unclear how many were civilians, terrorists or casualties from previous days. The investigation highlighted Shaldan al-Najjar, a senior Islamic Jihad terrorist, as an example. During Operation Protective Edge in 2014, the IDF reportedly took numerous precautions to keep civilians away from his house before attacking it. These included calls to neighbors warning of the impending strike and implementing the 'roof knock' procedure, commonly used before targeting buildings suspected of containing weapons or tunnel entrances. As a result, everyone, including al-Najjar himself, evacuated with no casualties. However, when the IDF targeted a house he visited on October 10, 2023, no prior warnings were issued. The strike killed al-Najjar along with 20 of his extended family members, including children and a two-month-old baby. In some cases targeting Hamas leaders, senior IDF officers approved strikes knowing they could endanger over 100 civilians each — actions the outlet described as ' crossing an extraordinary threshold for a contemporary Western military.' The IDF reportedly conducted strikes at such a rapid pace that the pre-war target database was depleted within days. As a result, the military adopted a new and 'unproven' system for identifying targets, relying on artificial intelligence heavily. According to the report, a system called 'The Gospel' was used to cross-reference information from various sources, including phone calls, satellite imagery and cellular tracking. The IDF also maintains extensive databases, one of which is known as 'Lavender,' containing phone numbers and addresses of suspected terrorists. A chaotic mood Israel's control over Gaza's communication networks allowed for the monitoring and tracking of Palestinian phones. However, six IDF officers told the outlet that these databases sometimes contained outdated information, increasing the risk of misidentifying civilians as terrorists. The investigation further alleged that the IDF frequently relied on a simplistic statistical model to assess risks to innocents during strikes. Sometimes targets were bombed just hours after being identified, allegedly increasing the likelihood of errors. The model mainly estimated risks based on cellular activity in broad areas near strike zones rather than detailed intelligence tracking of specific structures as was customary in previous Israeli operations. The IDF’s air campaign was most intense during the initial weeks of the war. Palestinians claim that 15,000 people were killed in the first two months — a figure reported by Gaza's Hamas-controlled Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and terrorists and has faced skepticism over its data. Regardless, amid international outrage during that period, the IDF reportedly reduced its use of bombs from November 2023 onward to conserve munitions and tightened strike protocols, including halving the number of civilians allowed to be endangered in low-priority strikes. Despite this, the death toll in Gaza continued to rise, with Palestinians claiming over 45,000 fatalities to date. The dramatic and extensive investigation comes as Israel faces allegations of genocide in Gaza, including a lawsuit filed against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Israel firmly denied these accusations, stressing its compliance with international law and its efforts to minimize civilian harm, such as mass evacuation orders for entire cities, leaflets dropped from the air and warnings via social media. Israeli officials frequently highlight Hamas and other terror groups' use of civilians as human shields, embedding terrorists and weaponry in residential buildings and hospitals. According to the outlet, IDF officers must ensure that the risks posed by airstrikes are 'proportional' to the military value of the target and take feasible precautions to protect innocent lives under international law. However, the investigation stressed that officers have considerable discretion because the rules of warfare are ambiguous regarding what constitutes a feasible precaution. The report, citing about a dozen sources who spoke to the New York Times, claimed that some IDF officers involved in the bombing campaign became far less stringent about adhering to military protocols after the shock of the October 7 massacre. While some commanders worked hard to maintain compliance, five senior officers reportedly described the mood in the military using the term 'harbu darbu' (A Hebrew slang expression coined from the Arab harb wadarb: Battles and war). The outlet noted it received a 700-word response from the IDF and included excerpts of it alongside interviews with senior officials to understand the policies. The IDF confirmed that the rules for approving strikes changed after October 7 but stressed that its forces have 'consistently been employing means and methods that adhere to the rules of law.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: IDF representatives explained that the changes to strike protocols were made in the context of an 'unprecedented and hardly comparable to other theaters of hostilities worldwide.' The response cited the massive scale of Hamas' deadly terror attack, the terrorists’ use of civilians as human shields and the extensive tunnel network as factors influencing military target selection and the ability to take various precautions before strikes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryi00s09r1x	2024-12-26T05:10:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/22/SyVUNsj4T/SyVUNsj4T_0_124_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Moshe disappeared in Israel's 'Bermuda Triangle', and he's not th...	Searches still continue for several Israelis who went missing in the area between Safed and Meron including Moshe Eliezer Ilovitch, whose family refuses to give up efforts to find him The area between the northern Israel cities of Safed and Meron has earned the nickname 'Bermuda Triangle' for good reason. Its dense, open terrain, spiritual aura and holy sites intertwine with years of poverty and neglect, culminating in the tragic disaster that has claimed the lives of 45 people. The region's nature attracts shady figures and cult members who seem to find it a lawless space, leaving the price to be paid by tens of thousands of law-abiding citizens. This phenomenon has also led to a troubling pattern of disappearances — ranging from a young girl to an elderly man. On Wednesday morning, the Israel Police’s Canine Unit, Safed police station and other organizations launched yet another operation to locate some of the missing individuals: Moshe Kleinerman (16 at the time of his disappearance) missing since March 25, 2022, near the Tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai; Haymanot Kasau, 9, who vanished in Safed on March 25; Raphael Chaim Hadad, 60, last seen in the Safed area on November 18, 2022; David Israel Padida, 28, missing since October 15, 2024, also from Safed, and Moshe Eliezer Ilovitch, 37, who disappeared on May 18, 2019, near Meron just before the Jewish holiday of Lag B'Omer. The missing individuals’ families assisted in the search, which focused on caves, pits, thickets and hiding spots. Yet, like many previous efforts, this operation ended with no breakthroughs. 'It’s been a long time since searches took place,' said Aharon, Moshe’s son. 'It’s always relevant to try finding something new, there’s been no trace of my dad since he disappeared.' The list of the region’s missing extends even further. It includes, for example, Yoram Fliter, 32, a Safed resident who disappeared under mysterious circumstances on October 8, 2023, though his car was later found near Beit Shemesh; Shalom Dahan, 60, missing since February 15, 2017, in Hatzor HaGlilit; and even Haviv Ben Abu, 80, who went to Meron on Lag B'Omer eve in 1995 and has not been seen since. The home burned down during the searches Aharon, who was 16 when his father Moshe disappeared, still recalls the shock and fear when his father didn’t answer the phone on that Saturday night. Since then, his family has lived with one question looming over them: What happened to him? 'I have no answers, only hope,' he says. Moshe was 42 at the time of his disappearance. He lived on Mount Meron after his divorce and worked in Safed. He was last seen at the Tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai on the morning of May 18, a few hours before he vanished. 'There were no prior indications, nothing unusual,' Aharon says, describing his father as someone who loved the area and handled personal struggles just like anyone else. Aharon, now 21, is the second of Moshe's five children. He was supposed to spend that Sabbath with his father, but Moshe stopped answering his phone as early as Thursday. 'I was waiting for him to call me Saturday night, but it never happened,' he recalls. Concerned, Aharon went to his father’s home the next day, but five and a half years later, Moshe is still missing. The family had lived in Mevo Modi’im, but Moshe had moved to Meron a few months earlier following his separation from his wife. The children frequently visited him for Sabbaths and holidays and were planning to spend Lag B’Omer with him. Aharon recounts that his father and friends were evicted from their rented apartment days before the holiday to make way for foreign visitors willing to pay high sums for accommodations near the celebration. This common practice in the area forced them to camp in tents nearby. On May 17, about an hour before the Sabbath, a friend drove Moshe from Safed to Meron, reporting nothing unusual in his behavior. CCTV cameras recorded Moshe at the tomb at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday. He then walked toward the tents. Since then, no trace of him has been found. The area, a dense forest with pits and rugged terrain, has caused others to lose their way in the past. Despite extensive searches, no sign of Moshe or the other missing individuals has been found. According to Aharon, his father struggled after the divorce but showed no worrying signs. 'It was a mutual decision and everything ended amicably,' he says. 'We even visited him together with my mom.' On Sunday evening, May 19, Aharon and his younger brother went to Meron to investigate. 'I went to the tent where he stayed and all his belongings were there — except for him,' he says. The next day, the family reported him missing to the police. Amid their anguish, the family faced another tragedy when their home in Mevo Modi’im burned down completely. 'I was out searching for my dad when a friend told me the town was on fire. My sister called, saying the younger siblings had been evacuated,' Aharon recounts. Homeless and overwhelmed, they rented an apartment in Safed to stay close to the search area. 'He might have wandered into a forest' Eli Ben-Tovim, a veteran search volunteer in northern Israel, has known Aharon since his father's disappearance. 'I met the family the day they reported Moshe missing. Aharon was only 14 and seeing his mother running around with a baby stroller to search for her husband was heartbreaking,' he says. Ben-Tovim noted that recent searches resumed in previously restricted forested areas following the war. 'If someone’s lost, injured or worse we should’ve found them. It’s unusual if we don’t.' Meron, he adds, attracts individuals seeking solitude or refuge. 'But Moshe wanted to see his family. I don’t think he intended to disappear. He might’ve wandered into a forest, fallen or gotten hurt.' Initially, the family felt the police weren’t making enough effort but they saw improvement after Israel’s Canine Unit joined the case. 'They’ve supported us ever since,' Aharon says. 'Police involvement felt dismissive before that.' Even after Moishi Kleinerman’s disappearance in the same area, Aharon remains skeptical of law enforcement’s dedication. 'Every few months, they’d call my mom to ask if we found him and hang up,' he says. 'They would have found him if they truly wanted.' Monetary reward leads to tips, not breakthrough The family even offered a monetary reward — first 50,000 NIS ($13,628), then 100,000 ($27,256) — but every lead ended in disappointment. Aharon recalls traveling to Jerusalem after receiving an unclear photo suggesting Moshe had been spotted. 'I rushed there before Sabbath, but a video later confirmed it wasn’t him.' Aharon has taken on his father’s role, supporting the family and strengthening bonds among his siblings and extended relatives since May 18, 2019. 'We’ve grown closer. We’re a strong family, and we’re all waiting for him,' he says. 'He’s missing from everything — Sabbaths, meals, daily life trips,' Aharon says, his voice heavy with emotion. 'He wasn’t there for my younger brother’s bar mitzvah three years ago. My brother initially refused to celebrate without him. 'We had to convince him and it was a very charged event. We went to the Western Wall with our grandparents and the whole family — but my dad wasn’t there. I hope he’s back in time for my wedding,' Aharon said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I don’t know what happened to him,' Aharon concludes. 'I’ve considered every possibility over the years. After all this time, all I have left is hope. I feel he’s alive but I can’t explain why he hasn’t contacted us. 'If he’s listening, I want him to know that we’re still strong and waiting for him no matter what — me and the rest of the kids. I’ve even imagined waking up one morning and seeing him smiling next to me. That would be a joy beyond words.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bji5x69sjg	2024-12-26T04:23:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/HkwheOZSye/HkwheOZSye_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Journalists are mishandling critical evidence in Syria needed for...	Absence of capable personnel to safeguard institutions after the Assad regime’s collapse has led to the mishandling of documents and potential criminal evidence that journalists, in a race for exclusives, have found in prisons and security branches From the collapse of the Syrian regime and the flight of former President Bashar Assad, a deluge of news stories has emerged from a nation struggling to recover. Syria, described as a vast prison under the Assad regime, has revealed dozens of detention centers and security branches rife with evidence of war crimes. Many media professionals have observed that much of this reporting lacks proper oversight, partly due to the chaotic handling of sensitive documents left in these facilities. Journalists, in a race for exclusives, often accessed these sites without authorization, mishandling materials that could serve as critical evidence in prosecuting crimes. Arab media, for example, widely reported on documents retrieved from security branches implicating former officials in war crimes. Yet many of these documents subsequently disappeared, erasing evidence vital for accountability. Syrian political analyst Wael Al-Khalidi criticized journalists entering government facilities without authorization from the new Syrian administration. He stressed that any handling of documents should occur under the supervision of national authorities, warning that journalists otherwise risk being perceived as 'thieves' pilfering sensitive material – a scenario that has indeed occurred. Ibrahim Hussein, director of the Syrian Center for Media Freedoms, highlighted the need for professional standards, urging reporters to prioritize their safety and ethical integrity. 'Journalists must also be familiar with local and international laws regarding handling forensic evidence. It is essential not to tamper with, move, or alter evidence unless necessary to preserve it,' he explained. Similarly, Mohammad Al-Sattouf, a member of the Journalists’ Association, emphasized the importance of verifying the authenticity of documents and preserving their integrity. He advised consulting experts to validate evidence and maintain confidentiality, particularly when dealing with sensitive investigations or witness testimonies. Ethical violations have also recently extended to the treatment of former detainees. Some media outlets, such as Al Jazeera, were criticized for bringing former prisoners back to their cells and asking them to reenact the conditions of their detention. Observers condemned this as a severe breach of journalistic ethics, turning reporters into interrogators. Al-Sattouf pointed out that journalists have an ethical duty to respect privacy and avoid publishing graphic images or content that violates the dignity of victims and their families. Instead, he stressed the need for balanced coverage that delivers the facts while upholding humanitarian principles. Journalist Ahmed Alayan condemned such practices as a descent into 'media madness.' He attributed these ethical breaches to the lack of professional standards in many media organizations, calling for immediate reform to prevent further harm. The proliferation of misinformation in Syria, compounded by years of violence and suppression, represents another significant challenge. Misleading narratives have fueled hatred and distorted facts, both locally and globally. Ahmed Primo, director of the verification platform Taqat, warned of the dangers of misinformation in the context of detention and imprisonment. He cited examples of well-intentioned misinformation that undermined the credibility of verified testimonies, videos and photos. Primo highlighted a case involving the BBC, where the network misled the public by claiming its correspondent in Damascus facilitated the release of a former detainee, who later turned out to be a security officer complicit in crimes. He also emphasized the critical role of the new Syrian authorities in maintaining evidence integrity. 'While we advocate for media freedom, there must be guidelines to ensure responsible reporting,' he said. The mishandling of evidence, Primo argued, risks obstructing justice. Sensitive materials must be preserved for prosecuting perpetrators rather than exploited for journalistic scoops. Since the collapse of the Syrian regime, the state-run media has remained largely paralyzed. Officials cite a lack of qualified personnel to manage even basic operations, such as running the state television network. Despite widespread public demands for a robust national media to report on ongoing developments, Syrian state media remains conspicuously absent, leaving a vacuum of reliable information. A source close to the Ministry of Information in the new Syrian government stated that the level of chaos in state institutions following the fall of the regime was not as extensive as might have been expected, considering the magnitude of the event. The source noted that the fall of the regime in such a manner could have resulted in even greater disorder. The source, who requested anonymity, highlighted the severity of the mishandling of documents, which could serve as criminal evidence, that occurred in prisons and security branches. However, this occurred due to the absence of capable personnel to safeguard these institutions after the regime’s collapse. In this context, Ibrahim Al-Qaddah, a member of the Syrian military cadre, said that the situation has now reached an acceptable level of stability. He affirmed that all institutions and their documents are currently protected, and the government has expressed its willingness to cooperate with any international body seeking to investigate crimes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Previously, the head of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria requested access from the new authorities to begin on-the-ground investigations into atrocities. The UN has expressed concern over the potential loss or destruction of critical evidence.

Journalists are mishandling critical evidence in Syria needed for...	Absence of capable personnel to safeguard institutions after the Assad regime’s collapse has led to the mishandling of documents and potential criminal evidence that journalists, in a race for exclusives, have found in prisons and security branches From the collapse of the Syrian regime and the flight of former President Bashar Assad, a deluge of news stories has emerged from a nation struggling to recover. Syria, described as a vast prison under the Assad regime, has revealed dozens of detention centers and security branches rife with evidence of war crimes. Many media professionals have observed that much of this reporting lacks proper oversight, partly due to the chaotic handling of sensitive documents left in these facilities. Journalists, in a race for exclusives, often accessed these sites without authorization, mishandling materials that could serve as critical evidence in prosecuting crimes. Arab media, for example, widely reported on documents retrieved from security branches implicating former officials in war crimes. Yet many of these documents subsequently disappeared, erasing evidence vital for accountability. Syrian political analyst Wael Al-Khalidi criticized journalists entering government facilities without authorization from the new Syrian administration. He stressed that any handling of documents should occur under the supervision of national authorities, warning that journalists otherwise risk being perceived as 'thieves' pilfering sensitive material – a scenario that has indeed occurred. Ibrahim Hussein, director of the Syrian Center for Media Freedoms, highlighted the need for professional standards, urging reporters to prioritize their safety and ethical integrity. 'Journalists must also be familiar with local and international laws regarding handling forensic evidence. It is essential not to tamper with, move, or alter evidence unless necessary to preserve it,' he explained. Similarly, Mohammad Al-Sattouf, a member of the Journalists’ Association, emphasized the importance of verifying the authenticity of documents and preserving their integrity. He advised consulting experts to validate evidence and maintain confidentiality, particularly when dealing with sensitive investigations or witness testimonies. Ethical violations have also recently extended to the treatment of former detainees. Some media outlets, such as Al Jazeera, were criticized for bringing former prisoners back to their cells and asking them to reenact the conditions of their detention. Observers condemned this as a severe breach of journalistic ethics, turning reporters into interrogators. Al-Sattouf pointed out that journalists have an ethical duty to respect privacy and avoid publishing graphic images or content that violates the dignity of victims and their families. Instead, he stressed the need for balanced coverage that delivers the facts while upholding humanitarian principles. Journalist Ahmed Alayan condemned such practices as a descent into 'media madness.' He attributed these ethical breaches to the lack of professional standards in many media organizations, calling for immediate reform to prevent further harm. The proliferation of misinformation in Syria, compounded by years of violence and suppression, represents another significant challenge. Misleading narratives have fueled hatred and distorted facts, both locally and globally. Ahmed Primo, director of the verification platform Taqat, warned of the dangers of misinformation in the context of detention and imprisonment. He cited examples of well-intentioned misinformation that undermined the credibility of verified testimonies, videos and photos. Primo highlighted a case involving the BBC, where the network misled the public by claiming its correspondent in Damascus facilitated the release of a former detainee, who later turned out to be a security officer complicit in crimes. He also emphasized the critical role of the new Syrian authorities in maintaining evidence integrity. 'While we advocate for media freedom, there must be guidelines to ensure responsible reporting,' he said. The mishandling of evidence, Primo argued, risks obstructing justice. Sensitive materials must be preserved for prosecuting perpetrators rather than exploited for journalistic scoops. Since the collapse of the Syrian regime, the state-run media has remained largely paralyzed. Officials cite a lack of qualified personnel to manage even basic operations, such as running the state television network. Despite widespread public demands for a robust national media to report on ongoing developments, Syrian state media remains conspicuously absent, leaving a vacuum of reliable information. A source close to the Ministry of Information in the new Syrian government stated that the level of chaos in state institutions following the fall of the regime was not as extensive as might have been expected, considering the magnitude of the event. The source noted that the fall of the regime in such a manner could have resulted in even greater disorder. The source, who requested anonymity, highlighted the severity of the mishandling of documents, which could serve as criminal evidence, that occurred in prisons and security branches. However, this occurred due to the absence of capable personnel to safeguard these institutions after the regime’s collapse. In this context, Ibrahim Al-Qaddah, a member of the Syrian military cadre, said that the situation has now reached an acceptable level of stability. He affirmed that all institutions and their documents are currently protected, and the government has expressed its willingness to cooperate with any international body seeking to investigate crimes.

Hamas official says situation in Gaza makes compiling hostage lis...	Arab outlet cites official as saying talks between Israel and the terror group continue; Israel denies receiving list detailing live hostages in Hamas captivity A senior Hamas official told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed Thursday overnight that claims suggesting Mohammed Sinwar was inflexible and refused to provide a full list of living Israeli hostages as part of efforts to ensure a hostage and cease-fire deal are false. According to the official, Hamas has provided such a list — including those its members managed to contact through the factions responsible for holding them. Israel has consistently denied that such a list was delivered throughout the talks. The official added that the terror organization has held talks with other factions holding hostages, but that it was impossible to communicate with all of them due to the situation in Gaza. He further said Hamas has affirmed during negotiations its willingness to provide a complete list of living hostages once the situation in Gaza stabilizes and after a cease-fire is achieved. The official also noted that the local leadership of the Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing, operates in 'harmony' with the terror group’s political leadership, asserting there’s 'complete agreement' between them. He said Khalil al-Hayya, who served as former leader Yahya Sinwar’s deputy, has effectively been authorized to make decisions in the negotiations as the head of Hamas's negotiation team. Al-Hayya is part of a leadership council Hamas established following Sinwar’s assassination, which includes four other key Hamas figures: the movement’s leader abroad Khaled Mashal, Hamas leader in the West Bank Zaher Jabarin, the head of Hamas’s Shura Council Muhammad Darwish and senior official Nizar Awadallah. The outlet also reported that one unresolved issue pertains to the release of Palestinian prisoners. According to the report, the release of some 'high-profile' prisoners — including Marwan Barghouti, Ahmad Sa’adat, Abbas al-Sayed, Abdullah Barghouti, Ibrahim Hamed and Hassan Salameh, along with two senior Islamic Jihad officials — would be postponed to the final stage of the deal.

Shocking report on hell experienced by hostages rescued from Gaza...	A draft report by the Ministry of Health, based on testimonies from hostages who were released or rescued from Gaza, describes the difficult time they spent in captivity and the consequences. The immune system weakened by the lack of food, the mental state deteriorated due to the abuse they experienced - and the fear of 'immediate feeding syndrome after starvation' for hostages who return in the future Neglect, torture and humiliation: The Ministry of Health has recently completed work on a draft special report that includes hard-hitting testimonies from the hostages who were released in the previous deal or rescued from Hamas captivity in Gaza. Once the work on the report is complete, it will be transferred to the Justice Ministry and presented to the United Nations committee that deals with torture. 'It contains materials that tell the story of those who returned from captivity over the past year, some in the major return operation in the last week of November 2023, and some in other cases of rescue,' a senior official at the Health Ministry said of the report. The Health Ministry was careful to word the information provided in the report in a way that would prevent identification of the freed hostage and there is no mention of ages or family composition. The senior official at the Health Ministry added that the report 'includes information that the returning hostages did not share in the first weeks after returning home. As time passed, they allowed themselves to share more. It describes many aspects of neglect, torture, humiliation, and physical and mental abuse.' According to the draft, some of the hostages experienced a very large weight loss, and they experienced starvation and malnutrition. In adults, this was reflected in a loss of 8 to 15 kilograms, and in children there was an average loss of 10% of their pre-captivity weight, in some cases a loss of 18% of their weight. The report noted that this loss has significant consequences, such as 'muscle breakdown and a weakened immune system. As a result of appalling hygiene, and unclean water, hostages suffered from stomach pains and diarrhea during their time in captivity. All of this has serious psychological consequences, certainly when it comes to children.' It was also noted that, in preparation for the return operation last year, the captors fed the hostages. This was reflected in the blood tests of the survivors of captivity. The report describes the fear in Israel of what is defined as 'immediate feeding syndrome after starvation.' After 446 days in captivity, the fear that the captors will give the hostages still in Gaza to food gain weight - putting their lives at risk - is even greater. According to the draft report, the hostages were held alone in the dark for days, tied hand and foot, and given very little food. They were beaten all over their bodies, some had their hair pulled out, and in some cases their skin was burned with an iron heated over a hot fire. Others testified to a lack of showers and to being forced to defecate on themselves. It is also noted that several hostages described having their bandages changed without painkillers, and that they experienced immense pain under medical treatment. The hostages who were released were in very poor sanitary conditions, and sometimes it took days and hours before they were allowed to go to the bathroom. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The purpose of publishing the report is to tell the world what the hostages went through in Hamas captivity, given that the health of some of them has deteriorated in the long time that has passed since the previous hostage return deal. A senior official in the Health Ministry concluded: 'The most important thing is that those who can influence, certainly in the world, will understand that they need to put pressure on Hamas and make them return the hostages home.' Health Minister Uriel Bosso told Ynet: 'I see this as a significant report that describes the horrors the hostages endured and will expose to the world the cruelty of the enemies we face. The evidence presented in it is a wake-up call for the world to put more pressure on Hamas and its supporters to release everyone, now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b13c0kqskg	2024-12-25T23:32:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/16/r1gfuE008Mke/r1gfuE008Mke_0_96_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Ben-Gvir visits the Temple Mount and 'said a prayer'	Minister of National Security announces that he prayed at the holy site in honor of the Hanukkah holiday, contrary to the status quo; Prime MInister's Office responds that there is 'no change in the status quo'; Minister has called for the establishment of a synagogue on the Mount National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited the Temple Mount this Thursday morning and, according to his office, 'offered a prayer' there, in defiance of the status quo. According to Ben-Gvir's office, his ascent to the Mount was in honor of Hanukkah, and he prayed there for the peace of IDF soldiers, the return of the kidnapped alive and the fallen, and 'complete victory' in the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was informed of Ben Gvir's intention before he visited the Temple Mount, and the Prime Minister's Office was quick to respond to his announcement that 'the status quo on the Temple Mount has not changed.' In previous cases where Ben Gvir ascended the Temple Mount, the Prime Minister's Office was forced to disavow his statements. In the past, it has even stated that 'the determination of policy on the Temple Mount is directly subordinate to the government and its head.'

Syria tried to erase its Jewish history, but the fall of Assad ha...	Justice for Jews from Arab Countries uncovers the systematic displacement and cultural destruction of Syria’s Jewish population, and tells the story of a community even older than the Arabs themselves and Islam A systemic and deliberate elimination of the vibrant 2,500-year-old Jewish community in Syria took place largely between the first decades of the 20th century and 1958. In addition to constituting a brain drain and cultural loss to the country, it carries receipts of more than $10 billion by contemporary measures in seized property, assets and holdings. These are among the many findings in a blockbuster report released by Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC), a group representing Jews from the Middle East and North Africa. The report is the product of six years of painstaking forensic reporting, quantifying the theft and total erasure of a multi-faceted centuries-old indigenous culture of nearly one million people that existed in the Middle East for 1,500 years before the advent of Islam. With the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, JJAC released its first report – out of 11 – as part of this historic project. Its contents are available now for the first time. The remaining reports will be released over the coming months. According to Rabbi Dr. Elie Abadie, co-president of JJAC, the publication of this data perfectly fulfills the organization’s mission. 'We want to educate everybody, especially people who are the descendants of Jews from Arab countries, then the Jewish community and then everybody else,' Abadie said. 'With the revelation of this history comes a recognition of the injustice that was visited upon the indigenous Syrian Jewish community,' he added. 'It’s a story that very few people know about it. What [the Syrian government] did was uproot a community that goes back to the time of the destruction of the First Temple. They uprooted a community even older than the Arabs themselves, older than Islam. And they did it with impunity. They covered up the story and never really were taken to task for what they did,' Abadie asserted. The erasure of the Syrian Jewish culture is especially dramatic. 'The community was renowned for its substantial economic contributions. Jewish merchants played a role in foreign trade, managed significant banking networks, and engaged in international commerce connecting Syria with Baghdad, Persia and India,' states the report. However, from the 1930s onward, the Jews’ situation in Syria was imperiled by Arab nationalist movements that were targeting the local Jewish community. This took the form of 'fascist-inspired movements, the emergence of Nazi-style youth groups, increasing physical attacks, and growing antisemitic rhetoric,' according to the report. 'The post-World War II era saw the most aggressive persecution, including comprehensive property confiscation, severe movement restriction, systematic economic marginalization, violent incidents, and government-sanctioned harassment,' according to the report. The report’s 94-page Historical and Economic Analysis of Syria’s Jewish community details the researchers’ scope and methodology in uncovering and documenting seized assets; included is a breakdown of economic losses by category, such as rural assets, urban assets, and valuation of personal property and moveable assets. It also explains how the present-day valuations were calculated. Born in Lebanon, Abadie is the son of Syrian Jews from Aleppo. 'My parents suffered persecution,' he said. 'They escaped Aleppo – my mother in 1948 and my father in 1950 – and found safe haven in Lebanon, bribing immigration officials, train conductors,' and others along the way. But they suffered twice, he said, as they were eventually driven out of Lebanon in 1971. According to Abadie, Syria went into a tailspin after kicking out its Jewish population. 'It is not a matter of opinion but fact,' he stated. 'Bereft of creativity, money, finances and culture, what was left of Syria? Or Yemen? Or Lebanon? These countries became backward countries. They lost.' The JJAC report recounts that the Jewish community of Syria, mainly in Damascus and Aleppo, numbered 50,000 in the early 20th century but fell to 30,000 by 1948 and 5,000, some ten years later. By 1991, only 100 Syrian Jews remained in their native land, and of those, only four Syrian Jews are believed to be living there today. The cause of this dramatic attrition was 'continuous state-sponsored persecution and discriminatory policies,' according to the report. The timing of the report is significant given the abrupt regime change in Syria, said JJAC co-president Sylvain Abitbol, who serves with Abadie. 'The current narrative is that the Jews are Europeans and colonizers and that there is only one set of refugees because Jews have never been part of the landscape of the Middle East. We are coming out with a report that documents the presence of Jews in the Middle East for thousands of years,' he explained. The newly released report on Syria’s vanquished Jewish community is only the first in the series. It aims to prove that Jews are an indigenous people of the Middle East, having lived in the region continuously for millennia, fully 1,500 years before the advent of Islam. 'Occurring in the latter part of the 20th century, the breadth and scale of the near-total displacement of Jews from eleven Muslim countries ranks among the more significant cases of mass displacement in modern history. For over 75 years, the world has ignored some 1,000,000 Jews uprooted from the totalitarian regimes, dictatorships and monarchies of Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Morocco, Yemen, and Aden, as well as Iran. Today, less than 1% of those Jews remain,' states the report. 'We have been expelled from all those countries,' reiterated Abitbol, a Moroccan Jew who was forced to leave his country in 1967 at the age of 18. He went to France and then settled in Canada. Telling the truth about the expulsion of nearly one million Jews from Arab lands does not negate the Palestinian narrative, he said. 'But it does expand the lens to include the Jewish refugee saga.' Echoing Abadie, Abitbol spoke about the losses of the Jewish communities driven out of Arab lands and the vacuum that was left behind. 'We left assets, businesses, our homes, communal organizations,' he recounted. Despite the losses incurred by the Jewish community, he wishes to tell the leadership of the countries who drove out their Jews, 'Look at what you’ve lost! Imagine what would have been if we stayed in your country and prospered. Look at what we did in Israel. In France. We came and built. We contributed to society. We built houses. We built back.' The contemporary progressive argument that views Palestinian terrorism as an inevitable outcome of the establishment of the State of Israel is countered by the example of Jews like Abitbol, who were expelled and went on to excel in their adopted countries, eschewing vengeance. Abitbol received his engineering degree, built businesses, and went on to win Canada’s coveted Queen Elizabeth Jubilee Award for contributions to his new country. 'Did we scream? No. Did we stay angry? No. We got an education and worked hard. We are the People of the Book. One of the only things we were able to take with us was our education,' he said. But even within the global Jewish community, the story of the expulsion of the Jews from Arab lands is largely unknown. The reason for this is complicated, explained Abadie. Occurring on the heels of the Holocaust, the plight of the expelled Middle Eastern Jews appeared to pale in contrast to the murder and persecution of millions of European Jews, many of whom were also arriving in the new Jewish state at the same time. However, there are other reasons why this important narrative was suppressed internally. According to Abadie, the young State of Israel was eager to convey that the great influx of Jews from Arab lands was arriving motivated by Zionist zeal. And while this was not entirely untrue, the Zionism of the Middle Eastern Jews was spiritual and religious in nature, not political. 'Our early leaders wanted to pretend that the Arab Jews were coming of their own volition, not as refugees,' he said. 'They believed in Zion but in the sense that they had a connection to Israel, which they understood as the land that God promised to our forefathers. They understood Zionism as part of being a Jew, part of Jewish destiny.' And Israel was the country at that time that was opening her arms to them In fact, so stubbornly did the Israeli government resist embracing the truth that it took JJAC 10 years to convince it, in 2014, to recognize the Middle Eastern refugees by creating Yom HaPlitim, Jewish Refugee Day, which is now observed every year on November 30. The funder for JJAC’s ambitious project is anonymous. In addition to the timeliness of forensics reporting on the seizure of assets and property of Syria’s historic Jewish community, there is an important lesson to be learned from the true, unvarnished history and resilience of Syrian Jews whose worldwide community, numbering more than 100,000, now live primarily in the United States and Israel. One of those lessons is national pride Noam Harary is an independent film director and actor who lives in Brooklyn. 'Syrian is my primary signifier; it is how I identify, it is how I am portrayed, it is the food I lean to, it is the songs I like, the music I sing, the accents in my synagogue,' he explained. Harary’s father, Ralph, was a Syrian Jew born in Brooklyn. His family lived in Aleppo until 1909, when his grandfather came to the United States and worked to bring his family over. His mother, Miriam, is Israeli. While Harary also feels a kinship with his Israeli heritage, his heart and soul are Syrian, he stated. He said that growing up, he felt 'Arab first, Jewish second.' He laughed, considering how radically the world has changed in just a couple of decades since that time, and added that such a statement sounds absurd today. Harary gets emotional as he speaks about his father’s heritage and his own and his family’s history. 'It was only later in life that I started to understand that being a Syrian Jew was second-class,' he explained. 'The expulsion was slow and deliberate and deliberately ambiguous. We were purposely made to feel uncomfortable. There were anti-Jewish riots. It was hard to do business. We experienced Pharaoh’s hardened heart,' he said, using a biblical analogy. 'We were told, ‘You cannot leave my land!’ and then ‘Get out of my land!' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The expulsion of the Jews of Syria was indeed a nakba of sorts, Harary said, using the Arabic word for 'catastrophe' that Palestinians commonly use for the displacement of Palestinian refugees during Israel’s War of Independence. 'The Arab lands kicked out 1 million Jews over the last 100 years. It is remarkable as a Syrian Jew to understand that.' But emphasizing what Abitbol said, Harary described how Syrian Jews built vibrant communities of their own in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side, in Deal, New Jersey, and elsewhere. As an adult, he understands the once-annoying instruction Syrian parents gave their children to marry only other Syrian Jews to preserve their culture in the diaspora. When asked what made him proudest to be a Syrian Jew, Harary responded instantly: 'We are Jews from the cornerstone of civilization. Jews existed [in Syria] for centuries. As a people who are told we have to go home, I find it hard to understand what that means when my people were expelled from our home. I am proud of my Arabic heritage. I am proud of my Arabic food. We’re spicy people, the Latinos of the Middle East.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bkkylw9hye	2024-12-25T20:59:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/Skez9YeqSJg/Skez9YeqSJg_0_0_360_270_0_small.jpg
Israel considers a significant attack on Yemen targeting Houthi l...	After the fourth missile launch in a week toward Israel, Jerusalem admits that the Houthis are a tough nut to crack and understands that another air strike on Yemen will not lead to a solution; However, a fundamental change is expected only after the Trump administration takes office next month. Security sources: 'They will pay a heavy price, there will be an escalation' The series of missile launches from Yemen toward the territory of the State of Israel may change the balance of terror: After hundreds of thousands of Israelis woke up to sirens during the previous night overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday following a ballistic missile launched by the Houthis for the fourth time in the past week, and the second night in a row, Jerusalem is considering a significant attack deep inside Yemen, including harming the leadership of the Islamist terrorist organization. The issue of the possibility of a significant attack on Yemeni territory is being raised in talks with the Americans, and the parties are closely coordinating the continuation of the campaign. There is an understanding in Washington that the attacks must be intensified, and that the Yemenis are drunk on power and will not back down. Israel admits that the Houthis are a tough nut to crack, because they are clearly feeling good about themselves. Unlike the other elements of the Shiite axis, who have all suffered a morale blow, the Houthis are on a high because many in the world did not really know about their existence, and today they constitute a militant factor with great sympathy among the Arab public. The understanding in Israel is that another attack will not solve the problem, and therefore a fundamental and profound change is needed. In Jerusalem, they estimate that this can only happen after the Trump administration takes office on January 20, in the hope that the new-old president will take a tough stance against the Houthis. 'The Houthis will pay a heavy price, there will be an escalation in Israeli attacks,' according to security sources. 'But that's nothing compared to what will happen to them after the Trump administration takes office. The Americans are preparing to impose an embargo and heavy sanctions on them.' At the same time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to spread threatening messages toward the East. 'Today we are lighting the first candle of Chanukah to mark the victory of the Maccabees then, and also the victory of 'the Maccabees of today',' Netanyahu said Wednesday night at a candle lighting event with his office employees and their children. 'Like then, we are striking at our enemies, and those who thought they could cut the thread of our lives here then, this will apply to them all. The Houthis will also learn what Hamas, Hezbollah, the Assad regime and others have learned, and this will also take time. This lesson will be learned across the Middle East, I tell you, in those days at this season,' he added. Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also addressed the issue. Galant, who was dismissed from his post last month, said at the lighting of the first candle of Hanukkah at the Ramat Efal school, which was severely damaged last week by a missile launched by the Houthi militias , that there is now a real opportunity to act against the terrorist organization in Yemen and to concentrate Israel's efforts there, in the shadow of the increasing launches from this arena , as well as against the leadership of the terrorist organization. According to Gallant, joint Israeli-American action against the Houthis should be pushed for, which would constitute preparation for action against Iran 'in a short time.' Gallant hinted that the Houthi leaders should be targeted: 'At this time, new conditions remain. It is possible and necessary to concentrate more effort against them. It is possible to achieve different results against their leadership. We need to join the American effort, because joint action by Israel and the U.S. has a practical effect - and no less than that, it will constitute preparation for future actions that we will be forced to take against Iran in the not-too-distant future.'

Police sapper worked at three sites where interception fragments fell, and the mayor of Be'er Ya'akov reported that a large interception fragment fell in the yard of a house. Nine people were injured on their way to the protected area. On Wednesday evening, a drone launched from Yemen was detected in the Ashkelon area. An IDF spokesman updated that the unmanned aircraft exploded in an open area without causing any casualties. Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar said Wednesday: 'We operate with great force wherever we are called upon - with boldness, cunning, groundbreaking initiative, and reality-changing moves.

The IDF announced early Thursday morning that Air Force jets attacked a vehicle carrying a squad of terrorists from the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization overnight in the Nusseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip. This comes after the Palestinian news agency Shehab reported earlier that five journalists were killed in an attack on a vehicle near the Al-Awda Hospital in Nusseirat.

The company said it temporarily shut down a router that was causing system malfunctions and also suspended ticket sales for flights departing on Thursday. ANA Holdings, Japan's other major air carrier, saw no signs of an attack on its systems, a spokesperson said.

Mideast expert says diplomacy not enough to address Houthi threat...	Dr. Nir Boms says 'we need to put as much pressure as possible' on the Houthis and calls on incoming US administration to help Diplomacy alone cannot resolve Israel’s challenges with the Houthis, according to Dr. Nir Boms, a research fellow at the Moshe Dayan Center. 'We need to put as much pressure as possible,' Boms told ILTV, 'and some of this pressure is in the form of targeted military strikes on the relevant infrastructures.' Boms explained that while military action is essential, it comes with significant limitations. Given that Yemen is approximately 2,000 kilometers from Israel, such operations cannot occur frequently. 'This is a campaign that needs to get the help of other stakeholders that hopefully will help bring Yemen to a different place,' he said. Boms emphasized that the Houthis are not acting independently. 'This is not the Houthis on their own. This is one of the last fronts that remains in Iranian hands. That is why they are getting all the equipment and all the latest technology. This is not their doing. It’s Iran,' he explained. Looking ahead, Boms expressed cautious optimism about the role of American leadership. 'We need to hope that [the new] American leadership will be more assertive,' he said, referencing President-elect Donald Trump.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk0v11iqsyx	2024-12-25T18:47:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/05/rkUdBF3rp/rkUdBF3rp_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Why does Hanukkah remind us never to give up hope?	Rabbi Ariel Constantine talks about the light of Hanukkah amid difficult times in the State of Israel Hanukkah is a holiday of light and a reminder that 'you should never give up hope,' according to Rabbi Ariel Constantine of the Tel Aviv International Synagogue. 'We have special celebrations throughout the holiday to bring light to Tel Aviv, to the world,' the rabbi told ILTV on Wednesday, the first night of the eight-day Hanukkah holiday. 'Indeed, Hanukkah is a holiday light, a festival that is here to bring some light in dark times.' Constantine explained that Hanukkah falls in the month of Kislev, the darkest month of the year. The days are shortest and coldest, and it is often a time when people may feel like giving up hope. However, he said, 'the holiday teaches us that you should never give up hope. We should always have faith and always look for that little light.' In the Hanukkah story, the Maccabees found that little light amidst the ruins of the violated and desecrated temple during those dark times. They decided to light the menorah in the temple despite not having enough oil, believing that even a little light could make a big difference. 'God appreciated their efforts and extended that light throughout the eight days until they could bring new oil and the light could grow brighter and brighter,' the rabbi said, adding that today, in honor of that miracle, Jews add a new candle each night of the holiday. 'These are indeed trying times,' Constantine said. 'One hundred hostages still in Gaza, soldiers out there fighting for freedom. But we, the Jewish people, our national anthem is ‘The Hope’ – Hatikvah. We will never give up hope. We're always going to seek a better future.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sygmtv5bkx	2024-12-25T17:04:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/08/HyT7b2e8p/HyT7b2e8p_0_133_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israel summons Vatican ambassador over Pope's criticism, but says...	Following harsh remarks by Pope Francis accusing Israel of targeting children in Gaza, the Foreign Ministry summoned the Vatican ambassador to express its displeasure; Despite the summons, Foreign Ministry have said they do not view this as an official reprimand Following harsh statements made by Pope Francis against Israel in the past week, and under the directive of Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, Foreign Ministry Director General Eyal Bar-Tal summoned the Vatican's ambassador to Israel, Archbishop Adolfo Tito Yllana, for a meeting. The meeting, held on Tuesday at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem during the approach of the Christmas holiday, was not classified as a reprimand. However, Bar-Tal expressed Israel’s strong displeasure with the Pope’s comments. In response to the pope’s remarks, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein issued a rare and strongly worded statement, saying: 'Cruelty is when terrorists hide behind children while trying to kill Israeli children. Cruelty is holding 100 hostages for 442 days, including infants and children, and abusing them,' Marmorstein wrote in Israel’s official response. 'Unfortunately, the pope chose to ignore all of this, as well as the fact that Israel’s actions were directed at terrorists who used children as human shields. The pope’s comments are particularly disappointing, as they are disconnected from the real and factual context of Israel’s fight against jihadist terrorism – a multi-front war imposed on Israel since October 7.' On Saturday, Pope Francis accused Israel in a sermon to Vatican officials of spraying Palestinian children in Gaza with machine guns and bombing schools and hospitals. 'With great pain, I think of Gaza, of so much cruelty, of children sprayed with machine guns, of the bombings of schools and hospitals. Such cruelty,' the Pope said. On the following day, he escalated his tone, repeating in his weekly Mass that Israel is cruelly spraying children with machine guns.

Radwan documents uncovered in Lebanon reveal guidelines, and fear...	The Radwan Force documents found during operations in southern Lebanon add to understanding of elite unit, which gave its operatives detailed instructions on how to camouflage themselves in the field and avoid Israeli surveillance; 'The enemy must be made to think that we are on high alert,' states the document, which dealt with 'fear of Israeli eavesdropping' In addition to the many weapons that IDF forces located in southern Lebanon, it also found personal documents of the Radwan Force, the elite unit of the Hezbollah terrorist organization that suffered many losses during the war. The documents reveal, among other things, the unit's methods of operation, and some of them contain detailed instructions for operatives regarding camouflage in the field: 'It is forbidden to smoke hookahs or light a light,' and, due to concerns about Israeli eavesdropping, 'one must speak in encrypted form.' The documents are handwritten and, in addition to names, numbers and personal details about elements in the unit, we can learn about the unit's activities, whose goal before the October 7 massacre was to penetrate Israeli territory and take control of areas near the border. For example, one of the documents details the dimensions of six Hezbollah firing positions. Another page details instructions for the terrorist organization's operatives - 'How to avoid detection?' Among other things, it states that camouflage and cleanliness must be maintained during work, that hookahs are prohibited, and that lights must not be turned on while in bed. The operatives are also told that they must keep records at all times, and that they are not allowed to leave their shift before submitting a situation assessment. One of the documents seized was written in August 2020, and one section states that 'the enemy must be made to think that we are on high alert.' The same document also mentions a fear of Israeli eavesdropping: 'We must talk in encrypted form about internal affairs, because the Israelis are monitoring everything.' The page also dealt with the outbreak of the coronavirus, which was relevant at that time. In recent months, the IDF spokesman has revealed the Radwan Force's method of operation. In October, about a month after the start of the ground operation in Lebanon, Brigadier General Daniel Hagari said that 'for years Hezbollah has been planning how to invade our territory on command - and now we are revealing the method.' He noted that the forces had turned civilian villages in southern Lebanon into fortified combat complexes and fortified staging areas under dense vegetation. 'The organization built a system of underground combat complexes under dense vegetation, in which it kept various weapons,' he said.

Netanyahu set to attend Trump's inauguration in Washington DC	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, alongside global leaders including Argentina’s Javier Milei and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán; This marks Netanyahu’s first trip abroad since the ICC issued an arrest warrant against him Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to travel to the United States aboard the official Wing of Zion airplane to attend the second inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on January 20, according to sources close to the prime minister. Trump has invited 50 guests to his inauguration, including Netanyahu, with whom he reportedly speaks every two days. Other notable attendees include Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, both strong supporters of Israel. In addition, sources close to Netanyahu estimate that his wife, Sara, will return to Israel from Miami in the coming days. She traveled to the U.S. on November 27 and extended her stay by several days. Sara Netanyahu is expected to return to Israel after Christmas. Last month, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. If Netanyahu travels to the U.S., it will mark his first trip abroad since the warrants were issued. The warrants require all 123 member states of the ICC to arrest Netanyahu or Gallant upon their arrival and transfer them to the court. However, Netanyahu can safely visit the U.S., which is not a member of the ICC, though the flight route typically passes through the airspace of ICC member states. During her stay in the U.S., Sara Netanyahu and her son, Yair Netanyahu, met with Trump for dinner at his international golf club.

Jewelry for survival: The dark role of the Houthis' female brigad...	In a region plagued with a severe humanitarian crisis, the Houthis have devised a method to enforce terror and 'raise funds.' Houthi women, known as 'Zainabiyat,' compel other women, teenage girls and young children to attend 'Support Gaza' events and surrender their remaining jewelry 'for the cause.' A human rights organization report concluded: The women's brigades have carried out sexual assaults, beatings and rapes in detention centers Arbitrary arrests, looting, torture, and rape: The Houthis continue their attacks on Israel and, in the name of 'Support for Gaza,' impose terror on the territories they control in Yemen – a region already suffering from a severe humanitarian crisis. This terror is enforced, among other means, through a military arm composed entirely of women. The Houthi women, known as 'Zainabiyat,' work to recruit more and more women for 'war effort' activities using threats, theft, assaults and, at times, torture. The 'Zainabiyat' are essentially a tool for oppressing Yemeni women, forcibly recruiting them, and stealing their money – now under the pretext of supporting Gaza. The female Houthi militias are, in effect, a Yemeni version of similar phenomena seen in other Shiite-axis countries: whether it’s the Iranian regime's attempts to suppress and persecute the public, or Hezbollah's female arm in Lebanon. Saudi Arabia's Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper reports that the 'female arm' of the Houthis forced hundreds of Yemeni women and girls in the capital Sana'a, its rural areas, and the provinces of Hajjah and Ibb to participate in recruitment activities aimed at supporting the Houthis' missile and drone forces. Girls were documented carrying weapons, and even young children were 'recruited' in the name of the 'Support for Gaza' effort. Each year, Shia Muslims commemorate the birthday of Fatimah al-Zahra, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, who is considered a revered figure. Over the years, this date has become 'Women's Day' in several Muslim countries, marked by festive events. Yemen also celebrated this occasion last weekend, with the Houthis releasing footage of large-scale women's activities. However, these recordings fail to reveal the terror happening behind the scenes at events held under the banner of 'Women's Day.' Sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that, this year, the Houthis established dozens of women's field teams under the directive of their leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, to force Yemeni women to participate in recruitment activities for the war effort. Women from Sana'a, which is under militia control, told the newspaper that the Zainabiyat conduct surprise home visits to 'encourage' them to join these activities and donate any money or jewelry they possess, claiming that the support is directed to Gaza and is essential for confronting 'American and Israeli attacks.' The women, living in severe poverty, reported that the Zainabiyat use threats and intimidation during these 'recruitment attempts' — even targeting teenage girls. Um Abdullah, a housewife from the Al-Qa'a neighborhood in Sanaa, told the Saudi newspaper that she and other women were forced to attend a 'recruitment event.' She expressed her dissatisfaction with the fundraising, which is supposedly intended for Gaza and Lebanon, but in reality funds the Houthis' warfare while ignoring the dire living conditions in Yemen. Yemeni women, vulnerable to the Zainabiyat's threats, accuse the Houthi leadership of exploiting the Palestinian cause and the suffering of Gazans to enrich themselves through these so-called 'donations.' Reports indicate that the nucleus of the Houthi women's unit began to form in the city of Saada in northwestern Yemen, even before Sanaa fell to the Houthis in 2014. Over the years, they have played a central role in arresting and prosecuting opponents of the rebels. Their missions have expanded since the Houthis took control of the capital: They are now responsible for organizing protests, distributing food supplies, spreading the militia's ideology among women, spying on women's councils, and have even been entrusted with security and intelligence operations.

The Houthi women are trained to use weapons and drive military vehicles. They typically wear regular clothing with the traditional Muslim veil. Their tasks also include searching and raiding homes, inspecting phones and electronic devices, and monitoring online activities. According to some reports, they have also participated in planting landmines and explosive devices. In 2022, a human rights report revealed 1,444 violations committed by the military arm of the Houthi women's militia between December 2017 and October 2022. According to the report, the women's brigades carried out arbitrary arrests, looted property, committed sexual assaults, beatings, torture and rape in secret detention centers. They were also accused of forcibly recruiting teenage girls. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryv11yycrkx	2024-12-25T11:04:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/S12yVlPS1l/S12yVlPS1l_136_0_1046_588_0_small.jpg
IDF unveils Hezbollah's massive weapons arsenal	Extensive collection of weapons and equipment confiscated from Hezbollah's Radwan Forces, intended for a large-scale invasion of Israel goes on display; Seized arsenal includes 85,000 items, including advanced missiles, explosives and weapons, disrupting Hezbollah’s capabilities following recent ground operations in southern Lebanon The IDF revealed for the first time the massive arsenal seized from Hezbollah’s Radwan Forces in the border area with Lebanon. Nearly a month after the northern cease-fire began, the IDF on Wednesday showcased the significant collection of weapons and equipment Hezbollah had prepared for a large-scale invasion of Israel. The plan, described as far deadlier than the October 7 massacre in southern Israel, was thwarted during IDF ground operations. IDF forces confiscated at least 85,000 weapons and intelligence items, with additional findings still being uncovered along the Lebanon border. Tens of thousands of other pieces of weaponry were destroyed in Lebanon during the campaign but were not retrieved due to logistical limitations. The display, open to foreign media, featured anti-aircraft guns mounted on jeeps, hundreds of advanced anti-tank missiles (including long-range models), modern AK-47s, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles from both Eastern and Western manufacturers, explosives of varying sizes, and ammunition boxes on a scale suitable for a small, advanced army. The exhibition also included chemical warfare masks intended for use by Hezbollah fighters in gas and smoke-filled conditions, as well as GoPro cameras meant to document the planned invasion of the Galilee. According to IDF, the confiscated arsenal includes approximately: 6,840 RPG launchers, rockets, and anti-tank missile systems (including 340 Kornet missiles) 20 military vehicles 9,000 explosives and explosive devices 60,800 pieces of electronic equipment, communication devices, computers, and documents 2,250 artillery shells and high-trajectory missiles 2,700 light weapons 2,860 additional weapons and equipment 60 anti-aircraft missiles 300 observation tools and binoculars The IDF reported that ground maneuvers were conducted in about 30 Shiite villages along the 130-kilometer border, stretching from Rosh Hanikra to Mount Dov. However, Hezbollah still retains hundreds of thousands of weapons, including heavy rockets, precision missiles, and drones, although the majority of its arsenal was destroyed during Operation 'Northern Arrows,' according to the IDF. The IDF clarified that it did not enter approximately 50 additional Shiite villages used by Hezbollah, located on both sides of the Litani River. In recent weeks, Israeli forces in southern Lebanon have continued targeting Hezbollah operatives who violate the cease-fire agreement. Over the past month, more than 40 operatives have been eliminated, in addition to the approximately 3,000 Hezbollah fighters killed and 7,000 injured over the last year out of the group’s estimated 30,000 military personnel. Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army has begun deploying along the border, and IDF has withdrawn to Israeli territory from those areas. Engineering operations to destroy Hezbollah bunkers and internal combat tunnels are ongoing. The IDF emphasized that the initial 60-day period of the agreement does not represent a 'sacred deadline' and that the stages of the agreement will be implemented gradually under an 'American umbrella.' This is the first time the U.S. is leading the enforcement mechanism, which is already operational as Israeli residents return to evacuated Galilee communities.

Houthis claim its security services exposed 'network of Mossad sp...	Houthis say the 'spies' were recruited by a wanted figure who passed information to Israel and the US; Claim network was tasked with passing information on the locations of forces and weapons, tracking senior officials, and gathering information on the whereabouts of the rebel leader A few hours after launching another ballistic missile toward central Israel in the middle of the night, the Houthis issued an unusual statement Wednesday, reporting that the group's security services had exposed and arrested several spies in recent days who had been passing information to the Mossad. According to an official statement from the Houthis, the spies were recruited by a wanted figure named Hamid Hussein Fayed Majli, who would pass the information on to Israel and the US. 'The enemy tasked the spies with carrying out intelligence activities, including tracking and determining the locations of missiles, UAVs, naval forces and other military sites,' the Houthis claimed. According to their statement, the spies were also tasked with tracking and locating military, political and security leaders and social figures, and information was also collected on experts, laboratories, and missile and UAV launch vehicles. They also claimed that the location of the Houthi naval forces, their bases and weapons depots was monitored, and there was even an attempt to track and collect information on the whereabouts of their leader in Yemen, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. According to the Houthis, the spies were asked to pass on coordinates to Majli, so he could pass them on to the Mossad. 'Enemy intelligence asked the spies to infiltrate, recruit and plant agents and spies in the ranks of the security forces and the army,' claimed Iranian envoys in Yemen. Majali, the Houthi statement noted, was recruited by Saudi intelligence in 2008 and is linked to American and Israeli intelligence agencies. The same agencies 'tasked him at the beginning of the 'Al-Aqsa Flood,' the Palestinian name given to the war with the surprise attack on October 7, to carry out operations 'to attract and recruit spies.' 'The enemy intelligence wants to use espionage to stop the Yemeni people's support for Gaza, by attacking the Houthi military forces and senior officials,' the Houthis claimed. The Houthis said they would 'fulfill their responsibility to secure the home front and protect against infiltration attempts by the Americans and Israelis,' and threatened the death penalty for anyone who cooperates with them. 'We warn of the risk of working for the American and Israeli intelligence services - the penalty for doing so could be death. We call on everyone who is and was a partner in passing intelligence to the enemy to surrender themselves to the legal authorities. We will be able to reach them wherever they are. We call on everyone to be vigilant and report any suspicious movement or activity.' This is not the first time the Houthis have claimed to have captured spies. In June, the rebels claimed they uncovered an intelligence network 'linked to the Mossad and U.S. intelligence services.' They claimed that 'there is a lot of evidence and we are talking about dozens and perhaps hundreds of elements from various organizations and institutions taking part in the intelligence network.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network reported in June that the Houthis claimed that the network had been operating in the country since 2015, gathering information and also working to influence the economy. It was also reported that the network had succeeded in influencing decision-makers 'and in penetrating the state's mechanisms.' The Lebanese network said at the time that the network had 'provided American and Israeli intelligence with military information in order to weaken the army and its capabilities.' The Houthis later released videos showing the 'spies' who had been caught. The Saudi Asharq Al-Awsat reported that the Houthis raised their state of alert to the highest level, and 'moved most of their forces to the areas of the lines of contact with government forces' and ordered shipping companies to evacuate their warehouses in the port of Hodeidah, in preparation for an imminent Israeli attack, 'which will be different from its predecessors.' Local sources told the newspaper that the Houthis are also preparing for the possibility of a popular uprising against them. Houthi intelligence services have conveyed messages to residents in various areas to avoid talking on the phone or on social media about the sites that were hit by Israeli and U.S. attacks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjbzc6th1x	2024-12-25T10:05:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/15/BkQx600Vp0/BkQx600Vp0_0_234_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Syrian police impose curfew in Homs after unrest	yrian police have imposed an overnight curfew in the city of Homs, state media reported, after unrest there linked to demonstrations that residents said were led by members of the minority Alawite and Shiite Muslim religious communities. Reuters could not immediately confirm the demands of the demonstrators nor the degree of disturbance that took place. Some residents said the demonstrations were linked to pressure and violence in recent days aimed at members of the Alawite minority, a sect long seen as loyal to former President Bashar Assad, who was toppled by Sunni Islamist rebels on Dec. 8. State media said the curfew was being imposed for one night, from 6 p.m. local time until 8 a.m. on Thursday morning.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjn7qath1e	2024-12-25T09:10:00-08:00	
Defense Minister visits Philadelphi Corridor: 'We will ensure the...	Defense Minister Israel Katz visited the border between Gaza and Sinai, emphasizing Israel’s commitment to maintaining security control in Gaza, establishing buffer zones and creating control posts; His visit comes as negotiations with Hamas for a hostage deal face significant obstacles Defense Minister Israel Katz visited the Philadelphi Corridor, the border region between the Gaza Strip and Sinai, and reiterated Israel’s commitment to maintaining security control in Gaza. Amid challenges in the hostage negotiations with Hamas, Katz on Wednesday announced plans to establish buffer zones and 'control positions' to ensure long-term security. Katz was accompanied by the Southern Command chief, Major General Yaron Finkelman, and Gaza Division commander, Brigadier General Barak Hiram. According to his office, the minister received an operational and intelligence briefing from field commanders regarding IDF activities in the area. 'I came to Gaza to meet the commanders and fighters who are doing extraordinary work with courage, ingenuity and determination,' Katz said. 'Their mission is clear: to create the conditions for the release of the hostages and to ensure the security of the State of Israel.' He continued: 'Security will remain in the hands of the IDF, which will act decisively to eliminate threats, prevent tunnel activity, dismantle terrorist infrastructure, disrupt enemy organization efforts and thwart any attacks on Israel or its soldiers. We will ensure the threats we’ve seen – such as infiltrating tunnels and other dangers – do not return. IDF will retain security control and will have the authority to operate anywhere necessary to neutralize threats. 'We will guarantee that just as we have on the borders with Lebanon, Syria and in the east, no new threats will emerge against Israeli communities, citizens, or IDF troops. In Gaza, we will establish security zones, buffer areas, and control positions to protect our communities. Alongside these measures, we will pursue the two main objectives of this war: to bring all the hostages home and to defeat Hamas.' Katz underscored that 'there will no longer be a governing or military Hamas here. A new reality will emerge thanks to the daily fighting that continues even now. I met with soldiers, including reservists, all of whom are determined and saying, ‘Keep going, let us finish the mission to ensure security and bring the hostages home.’ That is exactly what we will do.' Katz’s remarks came shortly after Hamas accused Israel of introducing new conditions that allegedly delayed progress in the negotiations. 'Talks around a cease-fire and prisoner exchange are ongoing in Doha, with Qatari and Egyptian mediation. Hamas has shown responsibility and flexibility,' the terror group claimed. It accused Israel of introducing new demands, including withdrawal from Gaza areas, new cease-fire terms, names of hostages, and the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza. These demands, according to Hamas, are delaying an agreement that is 'within reach.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office responded, stating, 'The Hamas terrorist organization continues to lie, is reneging on understandings that have already been reached, and is continuing to create difficulties in the negotiations. However, Israel will continue its relentless efforts to return all of our hostages.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Philadelphi Corridor has been a focal point of contention in the negotiations for months. Israel captured the corridor in May, with Netanyahu repeatedly emphasizing its strategic importance, as it serves as a critical route that Hamas could use to smuggle weapons for future rearmament. Recent reports suggested Israel had agreed to a significant withdrawal from the corridor as part of a potential deal. However, an unnamed Israeli official denied these claims, stating, 'Israel has not agreed and will not agree to withdraw from most of the Philadelphi Corridor, as our presence there prevents Hamas from rearming and strengthening itself.' Earlier this month, Katz himself commented that the Philadelphi and Netzarim Corridors would not pose obstacles to reaching a deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ja82ksyl	2024-12-25T08:51:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/Hygjqf9FHkx/Hygjqf9FHkx_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Over 85,000 weapons, missiles and military items belonging to Hezbollah have been confiscated by the IDF in Southern Lebanon, according to the IDF. At the beginning of October 2024, the IDF began limited, localized, targeted ground raids to dismantle Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon. As part of the operations led by the IDF Northern Command, the forces operated against Hezbollah in more than 30 areas across southern Lebanon. The troops identified and destroyed terrorist infrastructure, eliminated terrorists, and located and confiscated numerous weapons. The IDF confiscated over 85,000 weapons, missiles, and military items, including rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles, RPGs, rifles, explosives, munitions, anti-aircraft missiles, observation devices, and military vehicles. The confiscated weapons were used by Hezbollah to attack Israeli civilians and were intended to be deployed as part of Hezbollah’s 'Conquer the Galilee' invasion plan. Hezbollah’s military capabilities have been significantly degraded as a result of the IDF’s ground raids, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1i4xhtbyx	2024-12-25T07:20:36-08:00	
98-year-old Holocaust survivor, whose 3 granchildren were killed ...	Yosef Viner, a Holocaust survivor who rebuilt his life in Israel, died at the age of 98, just a year after his grandchildren were killed in the Hamas massacre at Kibbutz Kfar Aza; His life, marked by resilience and tragedy, ended as the pain of unimaginable loss overwhelmed him once again Yosef Viner, a Holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to building a family in Israel, died on Wednesday morning at the age of 98, just a year after three of his grandchildren were killed in Hamas' brutal massacre at Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7. Viner’s life, as a grandfather and great-grandfather, began in the shadow of the Nazi atrocities and unfolded in the rebuilding and establishment of a life in Israel. However, his journey ended as the unbearable pain of loss struck him once more. Viner arrived in Israel after losing his entire family in the Holocaust. Following the massacre on October 7, Joseph penned a haunting account of his life journey and personal grief: 'I am Yosef Viner, 97 years old. I survived the fire of the Nazi beasts; my entire family perished. Disconnected from my roots, I built a memorial from basalt stones in their memory. Exhausted and despairing, I held onto the land and planted myself in Zion.' A family member of Joseph shared with Ynet today: 'Joseph was a strong man, a true survivor. But when they came to tell him about the murder of his grandchildren, it was the first time I ever saw him cry.' Here is the full text Joseph Wiener wrote, describing the horrors after the massacre: 'I am Yosef Viner, 97 years old. I survived the fire of the Nazi beasts; my entire family perished. Disconnected from my roots, I built a memorial from basalt stones in their memory. Exhausted and despairing, I held onto the land and planted myself in Zion.'

Hamas claims Israel imposes new conditions on cease-fire; Netanya...	Terror organization claims cease-fire and hostage release talks are 'serious,' but accuses Israel of setting new conditions on several issues. Prime Minister says 'Hamas is reneging on the understandings that were reached' A day after Israel's team negotiating a cease-fire and hostage deal returned from Qatar, Hamas issued a statement at noon on Wednesday claiming that the negotiations were progressing 'seriously,' but accused Israel of 'imposing new conditions' on several issues, which allegedly has delayed reaching an agreement. Shortly before the terrorist organization's statement, families of hostages held captive in Gaza delivered a statement from Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, on the 446th day of the war. After Hamas' statement, the Prime Minister's Office issued its own statement which said that 'The Hamas terrorist organization continues to lie, is reneging on understandings that have already been reached, and is continuing to create difficulties in the negotiations. However, Israel will continue its relentless efforts to return all of our hostages.' Hamas addressed the negotiations, claiming that 'negotiations on the cease-fire and prisoner exchange are continuing seriously in Doha, with Qatari and Egyptian mediation, and the movement has shown responsibility and flexibility.' In addition, the terrorist organization claimed that Israel 'has posed new issues and conditions related to withdrawal (from areas in Gaza), a cease-fire, hostages, and the return of displaced persons (to the northern Gaza Strip), which is delaying the achievement of the agreement - which was achievable.' At the same time, Egyptian sources claimed to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that 'the cease-fire negotiations in Gaza are 'steps away from the finish line.' Agreements have been reached on the points that were in dispute during the last negotiation period.' According to the sources, 'one of the points that is expected to be resolved is the one related to the lists of hostages and prisoners,' and they added that 'there is a proposal to delay the release of a list of 10 prisoners with heavy sentences whose names were provided by Hamas, including Marwan Barghouti.' Earlier, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum announced that the statement by their representatives comes 'against the backdrop of various reports regarding negotiations for the return of their loved ones.' 'There will be no victory and no security until they return' In her statement, Yishi Miren Lavie, wife of hostage Omri Miren, emphasized that '446 days ago, Omri was kidnapped in front of my eyes and in front of our little daughters' eyes, after we were held hostage for a few hours as a family. Some 446 days ago, I joined the community. A community that no one wants to be a part of. A community of more than 200 families. The community of the families of the kidnapped. Some 446 days ago, I did not even understand the magnitude, I did not even know how long this terrible journey together would continue.' 'Today, after 446 days, I know that I will never be able to disconnect from this community,' she added.. 'But I also know that the terrible journey that was forced upon us must end and the journey of rehabilitation must begin. For everyone. Everyone must be saved, everyone must return, whether it is to the embrace of the family or to a proper burial in an Israeli grave. I call out to the decision-makers - think of Roni and my mother. Hear them in your head as I hear them every day - 'Where is Dad?' 'When will Dad come back?', 'I want Dad.' Think of all the little children who are just waiting for a hug from their father, grandfather, aunt. Think of all the children of the State of Israel who have been denied the right to lead a normal life and who have been living in a state of war for more than a year. 'And my Omrili, if this reachesyou - like 446 days ago, today too: I love you, I'm waiting for you and I'm watching over our girls. I promised you with a farewell look then and I promise you today too, we will do everything until you return, until you see Roni and Alma running toward you. Until you hear the word 'father' again. We don't give up, we don't despair and we won't stop as one community fighting until everyone is here.' Shir Sigal , Keith's daughter, said she is making the statement 'as the daughter of Keith, who over a year ago was certain that he would be the next to be released home - a moment after he and my mother were brutally separated when she was returned to Israel in a deal.' According to her: 'There are moments in history when every decision is fateful, and these days are exactly like that. Every moment of postponement or hesitation, every delay in negotiations or in the process of returning our brothers and sisters home - could cost human lives and prevent us from being able to return the murdered and fallen for a proper burial in our country.' Shir added that 'from the stories of my mother and other hostages who were returned, and also according to all professional sources - it is absolutely clear: the hostages do not have time. We must return them home before the harsh winter in the tunnels. My mother, Aviva, survived 51 days of hell in Hamas captivity - and miraculously returned home. Since she was returned, she has been breathing this pain every moment. Her pain has no respite - pain for my father, her husband, and for all the children, parents, brothers and sisters who are still there.' Yuval Or, whose son was killed and whose grandchildren were kidnapped to Gaza, said: 'We did not choose to lose our son. We did not choose for our grandchildren to be kidnapped. But now we have a choice - to continue the cycle of blood or to stop it. We choose to stop.'

The possibilities range from an immediate deal within a few days, to no deal at all. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said regarding the return of the negotiating team from Doha that 'the negotiating team, which includes senior officials from the Mossad, Shin Bet and IDF, will return to Israel from Qatar, after a significant week of negotiations. The team returned for internal consultations in Israel regarding the continuation of negotiations for the return of our hostages.' The statement did not provide further details. In Israel, officials emphasized that the return of the team after 10 days in Qatar does not indicate a breakdown in talks. Following a prolonged negotiation process, the team now needs to conduct consultations. Israeli officials are placing blame on Hamas in Gaza, particularly on the leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Sinwar, for creating difficulties and refusing to provide a full list of hostages, allegedly in an attempt to extract further concessions. 'There’s no collapse of the talks, but we’ve reached a point where decisions need to be made in Israel whether to continue with a deal without the lists,' said an Israeli official familiar with the details. 'Hamas has consistently lied. Even last time, Hamas claimed it had no women among the hostages, which was false. The question now is whether to play into their hands. We need a solid foundation to proceed with the deal, to determine whether we are releasing prisoners in exchange for bodies or live hostages. The terms are different, and we won’t start an agreement based on lies.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjz6ccys1e	2024-12-25T06:51:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/S1Q8MpPYHJl/S1Q8MpPYHJl_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Bombardment by the Pakistani army in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province on Tuesday killed at least 46 people, most of whom were children and women, said the Afghan Taliban on Wednesday, while, vowing to retaliate against their neighbor. The bombing occurred at four locations in Afghanistan, deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said on Wednesday, adding that six people were also injured.

RIA cited Oboronlogistika, the ship's ultimate owner and a company that is part of the Russian Defense Ministry's military construction operations, as saying the vessel had been targeted in 'a terrorist act.' Oboronlogistika had previously said that the ship had been en route to the Russian far eastern port of Vladivostok with two giant port cranes lashed to its deck.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjapccyskl	2024-12-25T06:04:22-08:00

Houthis say arrested spies employed by Israel	The Houthis in Yemen claimed in an official statement that they had arrested a number of 'spies,' who they said were employed by Israeli and American intelligence. According to the Houthis, 'the enemy assigned the spies intelligence activity tasks, including monitoring missile force sites, drones, naval sites and other military sites.'

Israel expands rocket alert zones as Houthi missile attacks persi...	Houthi missile launches trigger growing alarm zones, from 68 localities last Thursday to 169 overnight; following failed Tel Aviv interception, IDF expanded alerts, sending over 300,000 more residents to shelters compared to previous night For the fourth time in a week, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered alarms across central Israel overnight. Millions of residents in 169 localities, including Beit Shemesh, Modiin, Ra’anana and Ramat Hasharon, were awakened by sirens at 4:22 a.m., marking the broadest alert coverage yet. The expanded alert system follows a failed interception on Saturday night, when a Houthi missile struck a school in Ramat Efal. The IDF acknowledged the delayed alert in that incident and announced adjustments to ensure wider warning zones. 'Lessons have been learned and implemented,' the military said. The new policy’s impact has been immediate. Compared to 143 localities affected the previous night, alarms were heard in 169 localities early Wednesday morning. This policy aims to mitigate risks from falling interceptor debris, which in recent incidents caused damage in residential areas, including Be’er Ya’akov. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF said that the latest missile was intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, with alarms activated as a precaution against potential falling debris. However, the expanded alert zones meant over 300,000 additional residents were directed to shelters compared to earlier missile launches. Until recently, alarms were not sounded for missiles intercepted outside Israeli territory. For example, two Houthi missile launches earlier this month were intercepted without triggering sirens. The IDF explained that the change was prompted by recent incidents, including the Ramat Efal strike, where a missile warhead breached the defense system and caused significant damage. The new approach reflects a balancing act between safety and the disruption caused by frequent alarms. 'The updated alert policy ensures maximum protection,' the IDF said, but it has also led to millions of Israelis being awakened almost nightly. As the Houthi missile campaign intensifies, Israeli authorities face growing challenges in managing both security risks and the psychological toll on the population. For now, the sirens—and the sleepless nights—are unlikely to abate. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r14ezkfhkx	2024-12-25T04:13:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/HkAe0NtSyg/HkAe0NtSyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Houthi leadership in Israel’s sights as some push for action on I...	Israeli lawmakers weighing 2 strategic approaches as tensions escalate; IDF advocates targeting Houthis directly to hold them accountable for their actions, while Mossad contends striking their Iranian patron in Tehran would send far more decisive message Many Israelis were forced to rush from their beds to the bomb shelter in the dead of night for the fourth time in a week. Although the ballistic missile launched from Yemen Wednesday morning was successfully intercepted, the Houthis continue to establish themselves as a central threat following the cease-fire in the north and the dismantling of much of Hamas' capabilities in the south. The combination of missiles and drones in this sector has created a reality where sirens sound every other day and even at night. As anticipated in Israel, the third Israeli Air Force strike in Yemen has only increased the Houthis' appetite to continue launching attacks. The Houthis even added a new drone infiltration route to the one they previously used — via the Mediterranean, crossing the Sinai Peninsula to Gaza and then to the western Negev. Meanwhile, Israel is still debating whether to strike Iran, as proposed by Mossad Director David Barnea, or Yemen, as suggested by the IDF. Barnea presented his proposal to the Security Cabinet, arguing that such a move could deter the Houthis and pressure Tehran to rein in their Yemeni branch. However, a senior IDF official countered, claiming that Iran's influence over the Houthis is not comparable to its hold over Hezbollah, describing the Houthis as 'a kind of independent and unruly child.' According to the official, such a strike would not achieve the goal of deterring the Houthis and could instead reopen a direct front with Iran. Barnea believes Iran is currently deterred by Israel, especially after the latest strike and even more so on the cusp of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. Defense Minister Israel Katz addressed the issue twice within 12 hours, reiterating that Israel would target the Houthis without mentioning Iran. 'We won’t tolerate the Houthis continuing to fire on the State of Israel,' Katz said. 'We’ll deal with the Houthi leaders in Sanaa and across Yemen.' Indeed, targeting the organization's leadership is a potential option, aligned with a policy where indiscriminate fire from Yemen toward Israel may be met with a similarly broad response. The challenges in this sector are well-known, with intelligence gaps being the foremost issue — not because the IDF’s intelligence and Mossad have neglected the threat but because they’ve faced far more urgent missions in Lebanon, Syria, Iran and Gaza. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The second challenge is the distance, which makes strikes complex and costly. On the other hand, these operations serve as live training for potential strikes in Iran. Throughout the war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has almost always sided with the Mossad chief's position over the military's when disagreements arose. These decisions have proven effective, as seen in operations like the pager operation and Hassan Nasrallah’s elimination. It’s possible Netanyahu will align with Barnea’s approach again. In the meantime, nighttime alarms courtesy of Yemen are likely to continue. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkuradfskx	2024-12-25T03:54:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/Hk4TtDtSyx/Hk4TtDtSyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel concerned Syria’s 'charm offensive' fooling the West	IDF demands Syrian villagers surrender weapons; Israel warns US about extremist Islamists in Syria’s new government despite Ahmad al-Sharaa’s conciliatory tone; The 'Houthi dilemma' adds further challenges As Donald Trump avoids commenting on U.S. operations in Syria, Israeli officials express concern over what they perceive as excessive enthusiasm from the outgoing American administration toward Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani. Direct dialogue between the U.S. and the rebels has been ongoing since the fall of the Assad regime, culminating in the lifting of a $10 million bounty on al-Sharaa’s head, once placed for his jihadist activities. While Washington acknowledges Israel’s security concerns, it advocates giving the new Syrian government under al-Sharaa a chance. Israeli officials, however, remain cautious, saying, 'The burden of proof is on al-Sharaa and his team. We must not forget their ideological roots.' The IDF is currently active in the buffer zone and the Syrian Golan Heights, areas it secured after Assad’s fall. Tensions in local villages have risen, despite some cooperation. In Jubata al-Hashab, IDF troops reportedly demanded residents surrender their weapons, promising military action if compliance was not met within 48 hours. Similar incidents occurred in other villages, including Khader and Maariah, where protests over the weekend led to clashes. Israel’s immediate priority is securing its northern border communities. Officials believe the IDF should maintain its presence while monitoring the new Syrian government’s alliances and regional dynamics. Al-Sharaa has publicly emphasized inclusivity, pledging parliamentary representation for all ethnic groups and avoiding conflict with Israel, Druze, Alawites or Turks. However, Israeli skepticism runs high, especially following the October 7 attacks, with concerns over a potential 'charm offensive' masking ulterior motives. Al-Sharaa, formerly affiliated with al-Qaeda and once the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra, has distanced himself from extremist Sunni terror groups, embracing Syrian nationalism instead. While he speaks of a unified, democratic Syria, Israeli officials question his ability to deliver on these promises. Meanwhile, Israel anticipates eventual tension with the new Syrian government over its presence in the buffer zone, particularly as al-Sharaa consolidates power. Observers suggest that adherence to the 1974 Disengagement Agreement could stabilize the region if Syrian forces refrain from threatening Israel, a dynamic that held for nearly five decades under Assad. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar expressed doubts during a classified session of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee: 'The new Damascus government mirrors Idlib’s extremist leadership. They present themselves as moderate to the West, which is eager to legitimize them to facilitate refugee repatriation.' Israel continues quiet dialogue with Turkey, whose interests in Syria are significant. Talks between Israeli intelligence agencies, including the Mossad and Shin Bet, and Turkey’s MIT intelligence service are underway. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for a policy review on relations with Turkey amid these discussions. The Houthi challenge The Houthis have intensified their missile launches toward Israel, with millions in central Israel awakened by alarms four times in the past week. A missile struck a school in Ramat Efal, while another landed near residential buildings in Tel Aviv, causing significant damage. Israel faces a strategic dilemma amid these attacks, with factors including the upcoming U.S. administration change on January 20, the Houthis' distant location complicating military action and the broader desire to address threats from Iran. Currently, U.S.-Israeli cooperation against the Houthis remains close. The U.S. leads a coalition of 12 nations targeting Houthi operations at sea, but its effectiveness has waned. With fewer commercial ships traversing the Red Sea and Suez Canal, the Houthis have largely shifted focus away from maritime attacks. Israeli officials note the Houthis are emboldened, in contrast to low morale among other Iranian-aligned groups, which have faced significant setbacks. Once obscure, the Houthi militia is now gaining support in the Arab world and has been sustaining operations against Israel for over a year. Israel plans to engage with the incoming Trump administration on addressing both the Houthi threat and the broader Iranian issue. Meanwhile, Sa’ar has launched a diplomatic campaign to expand the international designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization. Already labeled a terrorist group in the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the UAE, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Israel, Sa’ar emphasized the global risk they pose. 'The Houthis are a threat not just to Israel but to the region and world order. Their direct attacks on one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes challenge international stability. Declaring them a terrorist organization is the first and necessary step,' he said. Amid this backdrop, Defense Minister Israel Katz visited an Arrow missile defense battery with Air Defense Command head Brig. Gen. Gilad Biran. Katz praised the unit for their success in intercepting a ballistic missile launched by the Houthis overnight. Katz received an operational briefing from 136th Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Eyal Frankel and other officers. 'Israel has the best air defenses in the world,' Katz said. 'Millions rely on you. They wake up to alarms but trust you to handle the threat. We won’t tolerate continued Houthi attacks on Israel. Just as we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will deal with Houthi leaders in Sanaa and across Yemen.' Katz added, 'We will target their infrastructure and leadership to eliminate the threat. Those sponsoring Houthi terror in Hodeidah or Sanaa will pay the full price. We trust only the IDF to protect our citizens and won’t allow new threats to emerge. Today’s missile warfare is the first of its kind, and you will continue defending Israel’s skies while we strike decisively to remove these threats.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyeproks1l	2024-12-25T03:38:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/rkIrxquBJl/rkIrxquBJl_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg

Death or imprisonment': Syrian media workers fear new regime	While Syrian opposition channels that broadcast outside of the country celebrated Assad's fall, pro-regime channels and workers say they fear changes that could negatively impact them During the decades of Assad family rule in Syria, local media was mobilized to promote regime propaganda, while outlets supporting the opposition often operated outside the country, particularly after the civil war. The coup in Syria also shook the country’s media landscape, especially channels affiliated with the ousted president, Bashar Assad, who fled the country to Russia. These outlets suddenly found themselves without a regime or directives imposed from above. Some channels quickly replaced the old Syrian flag with the opposition’s flag on their social media profiles and continued reporting. Others took longer to process the dramatic developments and resume operations. This transition is marked by significant fear among journalists who covered the war from the regime’s perspective, as they now face the new government led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who’s attempting to reform his public image domestically and abroad. Freedoms in Syria were severely restricted under the Assads — both Hafez and his son Bashar — including freedom of expression and the press. The regime controlled the media to propagate its messages, limited the entry of foreign journalists, restricted independent newspapers and ceased the publication of printed newspapers entirely by 2020. Today, Syria ranks second-to-last in Reporters Without Borders' 2024 Press Freedom Index, just ahead of Eritrea. During the civil war, channels closely aligned with Assad’s regime operated alongside opposition outlets that offered their own narratives about the events in Syria, such as the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The launch of the Syrian rebels’ Operation Deterrence of Aggression, which ultimately led to the toppling of the Assad regime, further intensified the contrast between pro-regime and opposition media. Opposition outlets reported on the rebels’ progress, the capture of key sites and maps detailing their advances, while pro-regime media focused on portraying the 'resilience of the Syrian army' and echoed statements from the Syrian Defense Ministry. These channels repeatedly warned viewers against 'unverified rumors' circulating online, urging them to rely only on official reports. Eventually, these 'official' updates ceased altogether, with the Defense Ministry halting announcements on December 7, as the rebels approached Damascus. In a live broadcast on Syrian state television during these critical moments, one studio speaker paused mid-sentence as the rebels took control of the facility, remarking, 'There’s noise and the door is open.' Shortly thereafter, the rebels delivered a message to Syria and the entire world: 'We’ve won.' On December 8, as the rebels entered Damascus, the official Syrian news agency SANA suspended its reports; Syrian state television displayed the message: 'The rebels have won, the Assad regime has fallen,' and the pro-regime radio station Sham FM announced that it was ceasing broadcasts due to the situation on December 9. 'Sham FM is temporarily halting its programming and coverage until the general situation stabilizes, enabling us to provide reliable daily news for our people at home and abroad,' the station announced after the regime's downfall. 'The station sees itself as a Syrian institution committed to anything that will bring Syria to safety and restore normalcy to people’s lives. For now, we’ll broadcast Fairuz’s songs and plays by the Rahbani brothers.' Despite the temporary halt, Syrian media outlets gradually resumed operations, now reporting on the new leadership. SANA’s Telegram channel updated its logo and resumed activity under the rebels' flag, while Sham FM also returned to broadcasting, aligning its coverage with the new de factor leader’s meetings. However, despite the gradual return to work under the new flag, journalists who worked for the regime remain fearful for their lives. Syrian journalists who covered the civil war and Assad's regime now express deep concern about the new government. According to Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, fears stem from the new Syrian administration's decision that anyone who covered the war and served as part of the Assad regime’s propaganda machine — thereby directly or indirectly contributing to its crimes and massacres — will face fair trials under transitional justice. A Syrian journalist told the Lebanese paper that, for the first time in 14 years, she’s afraid not for herself but for her family, who could be harmed. 'My crime is being a journalist and my family’s crime is being related to a journalist,' she said. Another journalist added: 'We survived covering battles, but this time it seems our fate is inevitable — death or imprisonment — because of the profession we love and depend on for our livelihood.'

Israeli cities face sleepless nights of alarms amid Houthi missil...	Nearly half of Israelis awoke to alarms overnight, the fourth time this week amid Houthi missile attacks; interceptor fragments damage Be’er Ya’akov home and found in Modiin; UN Security Council to meet on Houthi attacks: 'Hold Iran accountable' In less than a week, half of Israel’s population has been jolted awake four times by alarms triggered by Houthi missile launches from Yemen, marking what appears to be a new campaign of attrition. While Israel's missile defense systems have intercepted the rockets outside its territory, the fallout is disrupting daily life and causing property damage. Early Wednesday, shrapnel from an interceptor damaged a home in Be’er Ya’akov. 'We ran to the shelter when the alarm sounded. Minutes later, we heard a loud boom,' said Mor Steinberg, a resident. 'A one-meter fragment landed on our balcony, damaging it and the air conditioner. It was hollow, but its size caused significant damage.' Her grandfather, Moshe, who worked on Israel’s Arrow missile system, reflected on the irony: 'I helped develop these systems, and now it feels like they’re chasing me,' he quipped. Be’er Ya’akov Mayor Nissim Gozlan praised the family for adhering to safety guidelines. 'Staying in the shelter for 10 minutes saved them from injury,' he said, urging residents to follow similar protocols. The attacks have prompted Israel to push for an emergency UN Security Council session on Monday. Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon called for accountability, urging the Council to condemn the attacks and enforce international law. Meanwhile, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the latest launch, boasting that their 'Palestine-2 hypersonic missile' targeted a 'military site in Jaffa.' The pre-dawn alarm at 4:22 a.m. disrupted residents in Tel Aviv, Herzliya, Rishon Lezion and several other cities. The missile was intercepted, but falling fragments caused several people to suffer shock and minor injuries. Magen David Adom reported nine injuries from falls while seeking shelter and two cases of shock. Defense Minister Israel Katz visited an Arrow missile battery and vowed action: 'We won’t tolerate continued Houthi attacks. Just as we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will deal with Houthi leaders in Sanaa and across Yemen.' Katz also warned Yemen’s Houthi backers: 'Those sponsoring Houthi terror will pay the full price.' The IDF concluded its investigation into a missile strike in Tel Aviv last week, citing a delayed alert due to unspecified reasons. Lessons have been learned, the military said, as Israel braces for further escalation. Not stopping, for Gaza The Houthis continue to pose a growing threat not only to Israel but also to the U.S. and international security. Earlier this week, in one of the most dangerous incidents for U.S. forces in the Middle East since the Gaza war began, a U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jet was accidentally shot down over the Red Sea by an American warship. The Pentagon confirmed the two pilots ejected safely but declined to clarify whether the misidentification stemmed directly from ongoing clashes with the Houthis. The incident underscores the challenges posed by Iran-backed Houthi forces, whose operations have escalated dramatically since the October 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel. Labeling their campaign as 'support for Gaza,' the Houthis have launched numerous missiles and drones not only at Israel, causing fatalities and damage, but also at civilian ships in the Red Sea, disrupting critical trade routes and even seizing vessels. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Biden administration faces a dilemma. While seeking to end Yemen’s civil war and ease tensions between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia—where years of Saudi airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians—the U.S. has avoided large-scale attacks on Houthi forces. President Biden removed the Houthis from the U.S. terror list upon entering office, and a UN-brokered cease-fire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia was reached in 2022. Over the past year, the U.S. has launched targeted strikes to disrupt Houthi operations in the Red Sea but refrained from attacking strategic infrastructure, frustrating Israel. Despite these limited measures, the Houthis’ attacks persist, presenting a severe threat to regional stability. Israel, which had avoided directly targeting the Houthis for months, conducted its first airstrike in July and has since struck twice more, including last week. These operations targeted strategic facilities, such as ports and energy infrastructure. Yet the Houthis have shown little sign of deterrence, continuing to fire missiles and drones. Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai notes the Houthis are undeterred by economic and infrastructure damage, as evidenced by their prolonged war against Saudi Arabia from 2015 to 2019, during which tens of thousands of Yemeni civilians died from bombings and famine. He argues that only a decisive blow to Houthi leadership and weaponry—similar to Israel's strategy against Hezbollah—could shift their stance. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Israelis to remain patient, emphasizing that Israel is not confronting the Houthis alone—a possible nod to hopes that the U.S. and its allies will intensify their strikes. Netanyahu vowed continued action: 'We will act with strength, determination and ingenuity. Even if it takes time, the result will be the same as with other terror groups,' he said Sunday, promising Monday that the strike in Yemen would not be the last. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ovsnfbkl	2024-12-24T23:20:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/Byman8XKByl/Byman8XKByl_0_372_961_541_0_small.jpg

Holy Land exodus: Why Bethlehem’s Christians are vanishing	Pope Francis criticized Israel’s actions in Gaza for the second time in two days, accusing Israel of cruelty and the killing of children This week, ILTV visited the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, one of Christianity’s oldest and holiest sites, believed to be the birthplace of Jesus. Yet, instead of holiday cheer, the church stands in a somber state, just as it did last year. There are no trees, no lights, and no decorations as the community mourns the challenges brought by 15 months of war. Bethlehem’s Christian population is struggling to endure. Separately, Pope Francis criticized Israel’s actions in Gaza for the second time in two days on Sunday, accusing Israel of cruelty and the killing of children. Israel responded by condemning the pope’s statements, calling them disconnected from the reality of its fight against jihadist terrorism. The controversy had already escalated last week with backlash over a nativity display at the Vatican. The display featured Jesus wrapped in a keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian nationalism. This sparked outrage, including an open letter from Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli, who accused the pope of perpetuating a 'dangerous blood libel' and distorting history. Amid these debates, new data highlights the precarious situation of Christians living under Palestinian Authority and Hamas control. A recent report from the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs revealed a sharp decline in the Christian population in these areas, citing violence, weak law enforcement, and religious coercion as the primary causes. In 1922, Christians made up 11% of the population in Palestinian Authority-controlled regions. Today, they account for less than 1%. In Gaza, the Christian population has dropped from 5,000 before Hamas seized power in 2007 to just 1,000 as of October 2023. Bethlehem’s plight mirrors these trends. In 1950, Christians represented 86% of the population in Bethlehem and its surrounding villages. Today, that number has dwindled to about 10%. The survival of Bethlehem’s Christian community depends heavily on tourism. Yet, with no tourists visiting, the community faces an uncertain future, struggling to sustain itself in increasingly difficult conditions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkavbxyhjl	2024-12-24T17:47:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/rkh11zgFHJl/rkh11zgFHJl_0_254_1200_676_0_small.jpg

How Israel’s Christian communities are keeping the Christmas spir...	Christmas festivities continue in Israel despite ongoing war On Christmas Eve, Israel's Christian population stands at 180,300 people, making up about 1.8% of the total population. Over the past year, the Christian community has grown by 0.6%, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics. Despite the ongoing war, the Christmas spirit remains vibrant in the Holy City of Jerusalem. At the YMCA, a stunning Christmas display is attracting visitors. The area features a beautifully decorated tree, festive lights, carol singing on various evenings, and even a lively bazaar. In the Christian Quarter of the Old City, hundreds of worshipers are expected to gather at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher for Christmas prayers. Nearby, the New Gate hosts a bustling Christmas market filled with festive cheer. The celebrations and decorations highlight Jerusalem's unique status as a holy city for all three monotheistic faiths—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This distinctiveness makes it a special place during the holiday season. In Jaffa, the community is also preparing for Christmas with authentic and festive experiences. The Jaffa flea market, known for its vibrant atmosphere, has transformed into a holiday bazaar. Although the streets are less crowded this year due to the war and a drop in tourism, the celebrations persist. A large Hanukkiah and a Christmas tree, lit by the Orthodox Scouts of Jaffa on December 15, stand as symbols of the season. Jaffa is celebrated for its rich culture, where Jewish and Arab communities come together—particularly as Hanukkah and Christmas overlap. The area is famous for its food, crafts, and unique gifts, drawing visitors seeking a blend of traditions. This year marks the second Christmas since the war with Hamas began. Just last week, Jaffa experienced a missile attack after the Houthis launched a missile from Yemen. The attack injured 16 people and caused damage to a public playground after the Iron Dome failed to intercept it. Despite these challenges, the festivities in Jaffa and Jerusalem continue, bringing light and unity during the holiday season. The celebrations are expected to conclude around January 19.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1c5ayyskg	2024-12-24T17:32:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/BkHoRyKBJe/BkHoRyKBJe_34_0_1125_633_0_small.jpg
Houthis threaten global stability: How long can the world ignore ...	Dan Fefferman: 'It's a threat that must be dealt with in an international coalition manner' The Houthis pose a significant threat to regional stability and must be addressed through an international coalition, according to Middle East expert Dan Fefferman. 'They've been a threat to regional stability for a number of years now, since they came on the scene,' Fefferman told ILTV News. 'They've fired multiple and very sophisticated ballistic and cruise missile attacks at Riyadh, at major oil facilities, at Abu Dhabi. A couple years ago, they fired over 400 missiles and drone strikes at Israel, primarily at the Tel Aviv area. And they've also severely interrupted international shipping going through the Red Sea. They've halted Suez Canal shipping by over 60% in the last year. So this is not just a threat to Israel. This is a threat to regional stability. This is a threat to international stability. And so it's a threat that must be dealt with in an international coalition manner.' Fefferman explained that the Houthis are a rebel group that has seized control of much of Yemen's territory and are increasingly supported by Iran. The group reportedly has around 20,000 fighters. Initially a smaller organization, the Houthis have expanded their influence and capabilities with Iranian backing and access to Russian arms. They now possess advanced technologies, including drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. Their maritime operations have disrupted vital shipping lanes, including the Red Sea, and they have even launched attacks on U.S. and other international naval vessels near Yemen’s coast. 'It's significant enough that it must be dealt with, and its capabilities keep growing from year to year, so long as they're allowed to grow,' Fefferman emphasized. The Houthis' growing influence and military power have made them a pressing concern not only for the Middle East but also for global stability, underscoring the urgent need for international action.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1rn5yfhje	2024-12-24T17:17:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/15/yk13718211/yk13718211_0_0_658_371_0_small.jpg
Erin Molan: Israel cannot coexist with the people who carried out...	Comment: 'It’s only a matter of time before we see October 7 over and over again' This monologue was delivered by former Sky News correspondent Erin Molan during her appearance in the ILTV News studio. I didn’t need to come to Israel in person to believe… To see evidence firsthand of the unthinkable atrocities committed on October 7… To hear firsthand what survivors were forced to endure… To feel firsthand the ground shake as bombs explode nearby… To convince myself that I’m on the right side of history… I already know that I am… But I’m so glad that I came… because even in my pre-existing state of unwavering conviction… I underestimated the level of depravity… The extent of the evil that occurred… The caliber of enemy that surrounds this tiny democratic nation fighting desperately for its life… I had read and seen and heard… but I couldn’t fully comprehend… until now… I stood inside the room where three beautiful little children—two my daughter’s age—watched their parents being murdered before suffocating and burning to death themselves… I walked where thousands of innocent young people ran for their lives at a music festival devoted to peace… I watched the raw footage from October 7… all of it… A dad desperately trying to save his two young boys… sprinting with them away from terrorists… before being killed in front of their eyes… then witnessed their shock, fear, and trauma… while the killers casually rummaged through their fridge like nothing had happened… I watched the sadistic beheading of a young Israeli man… hacking—again and again and again… I stepped onto the porch where two babies were kidnapped and still remain in Gaza—their toys lying untouched for hundreds of days… But do you know what cripples me more than anything… what scares me even more than what they did? Their reaction… in real time… That’s what I can’t comprehend—no matter how hard I try… The glee… the joy… the pure elation at what they were doing… The sick laughter and cheering when an innocent teenage girl was shot in the back… Their actions on that day were evil personified—but their reactions to it were even worse… The enemy of Israel, the Jewish people, and let’s be frank—all of us who believe in life and freedom and peace—they are not human. They can’t be. It is not possible. You cannot co-exist—ever—with the people I watched carry out October 7. None of us can… and unless we figure that out, as a world, and quickly, then it’s only a matter of time before we see October 7 over and over again… but next time… it will be in our own backyard…	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkanbythjx	2024-12-24T16:54:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/rJyQSQIr1l/rJyQSQIr1l_0_192_2176_1226_0_small.jpg
Could these Jewish doctors solve Israel's medical crisis?	The whole purpose of this great venture is to help physicians from all over the world make Aliyah' An event took place in Los Angeles, marking a significant step in strengthening Israel's healthcare system. MEDEX LA, the first program of its kind on the U.S. West Coast, brought together dozens of Jewish doctors considering Aliyah to help address Israel’s critical shortage of medical professionals. 'We're super excited to help anyone who's in a better professional world, especially doctors,' said Tony Gelbart, chairman of Nefesh B'Nefesh. 'We're incredibly humbled to have all these great people come to join us in Israel.' This initiative is part of a nationwide campaign led by Nefesh B’Nefesh, in collaboration with Israel’s Ministry of Aliyah and Integration, the Ministry of Health, and the Jewish Agency for Israel. The goal is to streamline the Aliyah process, ensuring Jewish doctors can seamlessly join Israel’s medical workforce. 'The whole purpose of this great venture is to help physicians from all over the world make Aliyah,' said Aflalo. 'To help them with the licensing process, specialty recognition, and Hebrew.' Since its founding in 2002, Nefesh B’Nefesh has facilitated Aliyah for over 80,000 North American Jews, boasting a remarkable 90% retention rate. The organization offers comprehensive services, from licensing assistance to relocation grants, to ensure a smooth transition for new immigrants. MEDEX LA is a flagship component of their new International Medical Aliyah Program, designed to address Israel’s urgent need for medical professionals. At the event, representatives from leading hospitals conducted real-time interviews, offering attendees employment opportunities. The personalized approach ensures doctors receive guidance tailored to their needs, especially for those relocating to underserved regions in Israel. 'This event gives them the ability to get their specialty recognized, but also to see how they can apply their specific talent to hospitals in Israel,' said Marc Rosenberg. 'They even get to meet potential supervisors or teammates.' Alongside MEDEX LA, an Aliyah fair organized by Nefesh B’Nefesh drew over 300 potential immigrants. The fair offered workshops on benefits, employment, and on-site fingerprinting services to simplify the immigration process. 'MEDEX event offered me the opportunity to do that kind of one-stop shop, and it's been amazing so far today,' said Kathryn Wolf, an attending doctor. 'We're hoping this will make the transition and job search easier as we make the big leap to Israel.' Powered by Nefesh B’Nefesh, MEDEX LA serves as more than just a job fair—it’s a bridge connecting Jewish doctors with Israel’s future. Similar events are planned in cities worldwide to meet the growing demand for medical professionals in Israel. 'In France, in London, Argentina, and now the West Coast of the U.S.—for the first time—it’s awesome,' said Rabbi Yehoshua Fass, executive director of Nefesh B’Nefesh. 'We’re expanding and reaching hundreds of physicians who are interested in making Aliyah.' For many attendees, MEDEX LA marks the beginning of a new chapter—a journey of healing, resilience, and Aliyah.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skabqktrkg	2024-12-24T16:49:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/05/S1vEJFDZyl/S1vEJFDZyl_64_0_937_527_0_small.jpg

Bethlehem’s residents think Donald Trump is the answer to ending ...	Many residents of the West Bank town hope that the incoming US president can usher in a renewed era of peace for Israel and the Palestinian Authority Arab Christian and Muslim residents of Bethlehem are pinning their hopes on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. They believe his inauguration could usher in a renewed era of peace for Israel and the Palestinian Authority – one that allows their communities to thrive once more. 'Trump will solve these problems,' Father Spiridon Sammour said this week. Sitting on the chancel in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, the priest lamented the absence of public Christmas celebrations for the second year in a row, overshadowed by the ongoing Gaza war. The city, once bustling with tourists, now lies empty and silent. Rocket attacks from Gaza have led to the cancellation of most international flights to Israel, leaving Bethlehem economically shattered and struggling to recover. 'Trump has promised to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine, and he will also stop the war between Hamas and Israel. We pray for that to be extinguished,' Sammour said. The priest emphasized the church’s prayers for world leaders, adding: 'God should let them lead people to peace. We pray for peace in the Holy Land.' Across Manger Square, the courtyard in front of the Church of the Nativity – believed by Christians to be the birthplace of Jesus – Muslims and Christians alike expressed hope in President-elect Donald Trump. Tour guide Abood Sobha, wandering the nearly empty square searching for tourists, was eager to share his thoughts. 'Hopefully, he will help us,' Sobha said about Trump. 'Trump said, ‘I want this war to end before I’m back as president.’ Hopefully, when Trump is president, he will help us stop this war and get our freedom.' Sobha’s brother, Alan, echoed his sentiments. 'I’m just praying for a cease-fire,' he said. He described Trump as a strong leader, adding: 'The Middle East needs a strong leader in America. Trump speaks our language.' Such statements are surprising, considering how many analysts have noted that Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza tend to dislike two leaders more than any others: Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In June, after Trump was convicted of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, Middle East analyst Khaled Abu Toameh said that Palestinians were 'elated.' 'Their biggest fear is that [Trump] will return to power, and they don’t want him back,' Abu Toameh said at the time. But in Bethlehem, the grim realities of 15 months of war and economic devastation have shifted some perspectives. Residents, worn down by conflict and hardship, are hungry for change. This week, as Christmas approached, Bethlehem was eerily quiet. Once again, public celebrations were canceled. The towering Christmas tree that typically adorns Manger Square was absent, as were the lights and festivities that usually draw crowds. Instead, Father Sammour shared somber reflections. He said that on Christmas Eve visitors from nearby West Bank communities and Israel would join His Beatitude Patriarch Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, for midnight Mass and then leave soon after. He expected another quiet Christmas similar to last year. 'Every year, you need a special ticket to get in,' Sammour explained, recalling how thousands of Christian tourists generally flock to the Holy Land for the holiday and visit Bethlehem on Christmas Eve. 'This year, it’s free because there are no tourists. There is no tree, no lights. As you see outside in the square - nothing. We hope and pray the situation will change soon.' Sammour described the current year as even worse than the last. 'No tourists, the hotels are closed, the restaurants are closed, the shops and factories are closed. Everything is broken down. It is very sad,' he said. When asked how residents survive, Sammour shrugged and replied, 'God is big.' The Church of the Nativity, built in 326 CE under the orders of Roman Emperor Constantine I and his mother, Saint Helena, has endured centuries of turmoil. Destroyed by the Samaritans in 529, it was rebuilt in 540 by Emperor Justinian. Now nearly 1,500 years old, it is one of the oldest churches in the world and the oldest in the Holy Land. Today, it is controlled by the Greek Orthodox Church, with sections also managed by Armenian Christians and Catholics. Although many in Bethlehem claim that Muslims and Christians live in harmony, the demographics suggest otherwise. A report published this week by the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs highlighted a sharp decline in the Christian population under Palestinian rule. In 1950, Christians made up 86% of Bethlehem’s population. By 2017, that figure had dwindled to just 10%. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Christian journalist and analyst Brian Schrauger noted that the Muslim majority has, at times, co-opted Christian narratives for political purposes. It was in Bethlehem around 10 years ago that the first baby Jesus lying on a keffiyeh was depicted – the same imagery that sparked controversy this year at a seasonal nativity scene at the Vatican, Schrauger said. He added that Christians in the region often avoid speaking out against their Muslim neighbors. 'They don’t want to be persecuted; they want to be able to do business,' Schrauger explained. However, many Christians are quietly leaving. 'During the Second Intifada, many fled. Now they are leaving again, partly because of the war but mostly because they feel trapped – by Israel, which has barred Palestinian workers from entering since October 7, 2023, and by their Islamic neighbors.' For those who remain, the desire for peace is unwavering. 'I want to ask just for peace,' one church visitor said. 'We don’t want any more problems; we don’t want any more wars.' -This article is written by Maayan Hoffman and reprinted with permission from The Media Line >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1qhisorjl	2024-12-24T12:48:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/BkJrqiuB1e/BkJrqiuB1e_0_228_1600_901_0_small.jpg

The Iranian delegation to the UN addressed the Security Council in the wake of Defense Minister Israel Katz's remarks, which acknowledged for the first time that Israel had assassinated Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and called for punishment. 'Katz publicly and shamelessly admitted that Israel was responsible for the assassination of Haniyeh, while he was visiting Tehran,' according to the Iranian delegation. 'This bold and shameless confession of the murder of a political leader on the sovereign territory of a UN member state once again emphasizes Israel's responsibility for its acts of terrorism and aggression. It also confirms the legitimacy of Iran's response on October 1. The UN must not allow impunity for a regime that blatantly defies international law.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcgbouhkg	2024-12-24T12:21:32-08:00	
Negotiating team returns from Qatar: Israel struggles to understa...	Team returns after a 'significant week' of negotiations, Prime Minister's Office says, without providing further details; Most deal components are nearly finalized, but Hamas continues to refuse to provide a complete list of living hostages The Gaza cease-fire negotiating team, which includes senior officials from the Mossad, Shin Bet, and IDF, 'will return to Israel from Qatar after a significant week of talks,' the Prime Minister's Office reported on Tuesday evening. 'The team is returning for internal consultations in Israel regarding the continuation of the negotiations for the return of our hostages,' the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement, with no further details provided. Negotiations for the release of hostages held by Hamas, who have been held in captivity for 445 days, are ongoing, but it remains unclear whether an agreement will be reached. The possibilities range from an immediate deal in the coming days to no agreement at all. In Israel, officials emphasized that the return of the team after 10 days in Qatar does not indicate a breakdown in talks. Following a prolonged negotiation process, the team now needs to conduct consultations. Israeli officials are placing blame on Hamas in Gaza, particularly on the leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Sinwar, for creating difficulties and refusing to provide a full list of hostages, allegedly in an attempt to extract further concessions. 'There’s no collapse of the talks, but we’ve reached a point where decisions need to be made in Israel whether to continue with a deal without the lists,' said an Israeli official familiar with the details. 'Hamas has consistently lied. Even last time, Hamas claimed it had no women among the hostages, which was false. The question now is whether to play into their hands. We need a solid foundation to proceed with the deal, to determine whether we are releasing prisoners in exchange for bodies or live hostages. The terms are different, and we won’t start an agreement based on lies.' Ruby Chen, the father of soldier Itay Chen, who is among the hostages, expressed his frustration, saying he is waiting for Hamas' response. He also noted that Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent statement in The Wall Street Journal – saying he would not agree to a cease-fire until Hamas is removed – did not help foster trust between the parties. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The gap between Israel and Hamas on the terms of the deal reportedly is not large, which allows for the possibility of an agreement. Both sides seem to agree on certain issues, such as the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah Crossing, as well as the terms of the cease-fire and the gradual release of hostages. There is also consensus on what is required from Israel in the deal. What is required Hamas, however, is to release a full list of live hostages, which would include categories such as women, children, soldiers, the elderly, sick and injured. A previous list of 33 hostages included some who have since died, and Noga Argamani, who was rescued. Israeli officials estimate that a significant number of hostages will be released in the first phase of the deal, a demand to which Hamas is refusing to agree so far. A delicate negotiation The key question now for Israel is whether Hamas truly wants a deal. This remains the primary point of contention in the talks and, with no clear resolution in sight, the outcome remains uncertain. It could happen tomorrow – or never. Israeli officials believe Hamas will not give up. But the group may find it difficult to relinquish its hold on such valuable assets – its living hostages — even though its members face no real danger. If some of the hostages are released, Hamas will be left with what is often called a 'Gilad Shalit' situation, referring to the Israeli soldier released in a 2011 deal in exchange for 1,027 prisoners. This leaves many wondering what Hamas intends to do next. It is possible they believe Israel lacks the strength to press its demands. Egyptians, Qataris and Americans are all putting pressure on Hamas, but so far, it has not responded. While there had been optimism in recent days due to ongoing daily communication with Hamas and some progress in talks, it is now difficult to predict what will happen. According to sources, if an agreement is reached, the release of hostages would happen immediately once a cease-fire begins, with the first phase likely to take place within a day or two. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skcrz9os1x	2024-12-24T12:14:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/H1YTDzPS1e/H1YTDzPS1e_0_103_1280_721_0_small.jpg
IDF releases probe into murder of 6 hostages in Rafah tunnel: 'As...	The IDF presented the families of Hersh, Uri, Eden, Alex, Almog and Carmel with the final investigation into their murders while in Hamas captivity; Military finds that its activities in the area had a 'circumstantial influence on the terrorists' decision to murder the 6 hostages' The IDF on Tuesday afternoon presented the families of Hamas hostages Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino with the final investigation into the incident in which they were executed by their captors in a tunnel in Rafah in August, while IDF forces were operating in the area. The investigation presented by the Southern Command indicates that the IDF had assessed that the likelihood of hostages being present in the area was medium to low. However, the troops were instructed to operate under the assumption that hostages were in the area and to act with the necessary caution. They conducted ongoing situational assessments on the matter in coordination with relevant professional officials. At the same time, it appears that if such information had been available, the forces would not have operated in the area or would have operated in a completely different manner. However, the IDF spokesman's statement noted that 'the IDF’s ground activities in the area, although gradual and cautious, had a circumstantial influence on the terrorists' decision to murder the six hostages.' The IDF says that, since the incident, changes have been made and lessons learned regarding ground operations methods in fighting in the Gaza Strip, the utilization of weapons and intelligence, and additional technologies introduced to prevent such incidents from happening again as much as possible. The affair further illustrated the assessment in the IDF that Hamas executes Israeli hostages as a regular policy if it hears IDF forces approaching the cells holding them. The findings also show that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was accidentally killed about a month and a half after the murder of the hostages, was in the area near the six hostages, but did not necessarily meet them or hold them himself. Farhan Qadi, the hostage who was found alive in a nearby tunnel a few days prior to the execution of the six hostages, also testified, according to the findings of the investigation, that he did not encounter Sinwar or meet other hostages. Farhan testified that he did not see Sinwar and that he was required to stay in place and not move by his captors who escaped from the tunnel in which he was being held. On August 27, 2024, Qadi was rescued from an underground compound, having been found alone and without prior intelligence regarding his location. Following the rescue, the troops conducted a dedicated situational assessment regarding the possibility of finding additional hostages in the area, and halted operations for the next 24 hours. Even after the rescue, the IDF did not possess intelligence indicating the presence of additional hostages in the area at that time, according to the investigation. After Qadi was found alive and before the bodies of the kidnapped were located, three terrorists were identified who were moving in the area, according to the IDF. The soldiers did not fire at them for an extended period of time, but did everything possible to capture them alive. On the afternoon of August 31, 2024, the troops of the division located the six hostages in the underground tunnel. The hostages were no longer alive and had signs of gunshot wounds on their bodies. According to the findings of the pathological report, the estimated date of the murder of the six hostages was August 29, 2024. IDF troops discovered the tunnel shaft where the six hostages were found on August 30, 2024, after they had been murdered. The final investigation reiterates a significant finding that already emerged in the initial investigation, which was made public, which found that two terrorists who were eliminated in the area at that time by forces from the Nahal Brigade were very likely, according to forensic findings that were located, to be the ones who held and murdered the six hostages. The IDF Spokesperson's Office said this evening that 'the investigation indicates that on August 15, 2024, troops of the 162nd Division launched an operation to defeat Hamas's al-Tel Sultan Battalion, following approximately three months of operational activity in Rafah. The troops engaged in intense combat with Hamas terrorists deep inside the area of Tel al-Sultan, during which they located a central underground tunnel system in the area.' The statement continues that 'in order to continue operations in the area, including the investigation and location of the underground tunnel system, a dedicated command center was established, led by Shayetet 13 and the 162nd Division, in collaboration with other security authorities. The command center integrated special forces, various intelligence units, precise underground operational capabilities, and the use of specialized equipment and technology, including for the potential location of hostages in the area.' Although there was a low-medium probability of hostages being found in the area, the IDF said that the forces were instructed to operate under the assumption that there were hostages in the area, to act with the necessary caution, and carried out ongoing situation assessments on the subject in cooperation with the relevant professional bodies. On August 31, IDF forces located the bodies of the six hostagesin a tunnel 20 meters deep in the Tel Sultan neighborhood of Rafah, which is a kilometer away from the one where hostage Farhan Qadi was found. The IDF did not know exactly where the six were in the months before, but it knew that there were hostages in the area, and therefore the operation in Rafah was 'gradual and slow' since the ground fighting began there. During the operation, there was no encounter with the terrorists who murdered the six and fled, but they were apparently eliminated in the fighting that continued there above ground. The hostages were found with gunshot wounds to the head and other places. They were murdered about 24 hours before IDF forces arrived at the tunnel. Severe neglect was evident on their bodies. Among other things, it was evident that they had not showered for a long time, and signs of being tied up were found on one of the hostages. In addition, there were indications that the hostages had sustained injuries during the kidnapping, which were treated over time. The bodies of the six were found scattered in the tunnel in clusters, and they were not lying side by side. It is not possible to determine whether there was any struggle before they were murdered by the terrorists. The hostages were held in a very small and narrow tunnel, where they had difficulty standing upright, and only two of them could lie in it horizontally at the same time. There were no air vents in the tunnel, and the hostages had difficulty breathing in it. In addition, the hostages had no toilets or showers, and they were given bottles of water that were used for showers as well as drinking. They had very little food in captivity, and lost significant weight. Eden Yerushalmi's body was found weighing only 36 kg (about 79 pounds).

Herzi Halevi, summarized the findings of the investigation and said that this was 'a painful and tragic event, with the extremely difficult outcome of the brutal murder of six hostages by Hamas.' The Chief of Staff also determined, based on the investigation, that the hostages were murdered by gunfire from Hamas terrorists during IDF forces' operations in the area, 'however the circumstances of the events that took place in the tunnel that led to the murders are unclear, and the likelihood of these circumstances becoming clear in the future is low.'

Israel, IAI ink multi-billion deal to expand Arrow-3 interceptors...	Defense Ministry purchased a new stock of Arrow-3 interceptors from the Israel Aerospace Industries to enhance protection against ballistic missile threats; Each interceptor costs approximately $4 million, and the move follows an uptick in missile attacks by the Houthis from Yemen The Defense Ministry and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) signed a major production contract Wednesday to expand the supply of Arrow-3 missile defense interceptors for the Israeli military. The deal, valued at billions of shekels, marks a significant boost to Israel’s air defense capabilities. The agreement, led by the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) within the Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&D), will provide the IDF with a large number of Arrow-3 interceptors. The signing ceremony, held at the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv, was attended by Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, director general of the ministry; Brig. Gen. (Ret.) Dr. Daniel Gold, head of the DDR&D; IAI CEO Boaz Levy; and other senior officials. The Arrow system, which includes the Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 interceptors, was jointly developed by Israel and the United States to counter long-range ballistic missile threats. During recent conflicts, the system demonstrated exceptional performance, intercepting ballistic missiles with high success rates. The Arrow-3 achieved a historic milestone during the current war, becoming the first system to conduct an operational interception in space. It played a critical role in defending against missile barrages from Iran and the Houthi militia in Yemen, including on April 14, 2024 and October 1, 2024. 'The Arrow-3 system has proven to be an unparalleled defense asset,' Zamir said. 'With this agreement, we reaffirm our commitment to Israeli innovation and the security of our nation.' Strengthening defense and economy The Arrow-3 program is a cornerstone of Israel’s multi-layered missile defense strategy, which also includes David’s Sling and Iron Dome. IAI leads the system’s development through its MLM Division, with support from U.S. partner Stark Aerospace and Israeli firms such as Elbit Systems, Tomer and Rafael. Zamir emphasized the dual benefits of the deal, noting that it would not only bolster national security but also inject billions into the local economy, supporting thousands of jobs. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Boaz Levy, CEO of IAI, highlighted the technological achievements of the system. 'The Arrow-3 is a testament to Israel’s innovative spirit and strategic cooperation with the U.S. It operates at exceptional altitudes with unmatched precision, reinforcing our defense capabilities and ensuring a technological edge over adversaries,' Levy said. Defense Minister Israel Katz called the agreement a 'strategic milestone,' adding: 'This deal reflects the strength of Israel’s defense industry and the groundbreaking capabilities of the Arrow-3 system, which has set a global standard in missile defense.' Gold praised the Arrow-3 as 'the pinnacle of Israeli technology,' noting its role in countering extensive ballistic barrages during the war. 'This system is not just a technological marvel but a symbol of Israel’s resilience and strategic superiority,' Gold said. The agreement underscores the Ministry of Defense’s commitment to advancing Israel’s defense infrastructure while supporting its technological independence, the ministry said in a statement. Officials say the deal will ensure the IDF remains prepared for emerging threats and maintains its qualitative edge on the battlefield. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj94ruubyg	2024-12-24T10:40:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/30/BJeYn36P0C/BJeYn36P0C_0_0_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Suspect in New York City subway fire killing charged with murder,...	The man accused of killing a woman on a New York City subway train by setting her on fire was charged with murder and arson in an initial court appearance on Tuesday. Sebastian Zapeta, a 33-year-old man who police say lives at a homeless shelter in Brooklyn, was charged with three counts in a criminal complaint at the Brooklyn criminal court: first-degree murder, second-degree murder and first-degree arson. According to the police account, Zapeta used a lighter to ignite the clothes of a woman who appeared to be sleeping on a stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station on Sunday. He then used a shirt to fan the fire until the woman was engulfed in flames, the complaint said.The woman was pronounced dead at the scene after the fire was extinguished. The city's medical examiner said the cause of death was smoke inhalation and thermal injuries. Police are still working to identify her, according to the complaint. During the arraignment, Judge Jung Park ordered that Zapeta be held in jail. He is due back in court on Friday where he is due to enter a plea. All three crimes with which Zapeta is charged are felonies that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkjkkyuhkx	2024-12-24T10:18:42-08:00

IDF presents results of inquiry into deaths of 6 hostages	The IDF presented the families of killed hostages HCarmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Ori Danino with the final investigation into their execution in a tunnel in Rafah in August, while army forces were operating in the area. The investigation shows that the IDF assessed that the likelihood of hostages being present in the area was medium to low. However, it also shows that if such information had been available, the forces would not have operated in the area or would have operated completely differently. It also shows that after hostage Farhan Qadi was found in a nearby tunnel about two weeks earlier, a freeze and reassessment was carried out regarding the presence of hostages, but the fighting did not stop.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rysend00bjg	2024-12-24T09:26:20-08:00

US journalist missing in Syria since 2012 is believed to be alive...	American journalist Austin Tice is believed to be still alive, according to the head of an international aid group. Nizar Zakka, who runs the Hostage Aid Worldwide organization, said there has never been any proof that Tice, who has been missing since 2012, is dead. Zakka told reporters in Damascus on Tuesday that Tice was alive in January and being held by the authorities of ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad. He added that U.S. President Joe Biden said in August that Tice was alive. Zakka said he believes Tice was transferred between security agencies over the past 12 years, including in an area where Iranian-backed fighters were operating. Asked if it was possible Tice had been taken out of the country, Zakka said Assad most likely kept him in Syria as a potential bargaining chip. Biden said Dec. 8 that his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, although he also acknowledged that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvjvd00syl	2024-12-24T09:05:06-08:00

Father of former hostage Emily Hand will not return to Ireland af...	Thomas Hand, whose 10-year-old daughter was released after 50 days in Hamas captivity, may never return to the country of his birth; 'They were really instrumental in getting Emily back,' he acknowledges, but 'recognizing Palestine as a state, very soon after their massive terrorist attack was almost a reward' The Irish father of a young girl kidnapped by Hamas has said he would think twice about returning to the country of his birth given the deepening tensions between Israel and Ireland. Thomas Hand, whose daughter Emily spent 50 days in Gaza after she was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, will always be deeply grateful to the Irish government for helping to bring her home. 'They were really instrumental in getting Emily back – they did a hell of a lot,' he said in an exclusive interview this week. Emily, now 10, was initially thought to have been killed in the October 7 attacks, but just under a month later Hand was informed that his daughter was still alive and being held hostage in Gaza. 'Within a few days of finding out that Emily wasn’t dead but kidnapped, the first trip we took was to Ireland,' the 64-year-old told the Jewish News. 'We met with the Prime Minister, president and lots of MPs – it was purely a political visit to make them put pressure on Hamas and they definitely did.' And yet despite his gratitude, Hand said he would 'hesitate' to return to his birthplace given the current situation. It comes just days after Israel announced the closure of its embassy in Dublin due to the worsening relations between the two countries. Defending the move, foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar earlier this week accused the Irish government of 'antisemitism based on the delegitimization and dehumanization of Israel.' In recent months, Ireland has formally recognized the State of Palestine, said that it would execute an arrest warrant on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and backed South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ. News of the embassy’s closure did not come as a surprise to Hand. 'I expected them to do it a lot earlier,' he said, because Israel regards Ireland as doing 'too many anti-Israel things.' Father and daughter are from Kibbutz Be’eri, which was the site of some of the worst horrors on October 7 and where 101 people were murdered. That day Hand was at his home on the kibbutz, while his daughter was on a sleepover at a friend’s house nearby. Ireland’s recognition of a Palestinian state has come in for some harsh criticism from Hand. 'Recognizing Palestine as a state, very soon after their massive terrorist attack – it was almost a reward,' he said. 'They [the Irish government] must have seen all the atrocious videos that Hamas put online themselves and yet they were recognised. For me personally, it looked like they were being rewarded for what they did.' Hand, who like his daughter is a dual Israeli-Irish citizen, was not happy about the embassy’s closure as he believes cutting the lines for diplomacy is 'never a good thing.' 'But I guess they had to show some kind of sign that we’re not very happy with the decisions being made by the Irish government,' he said. Born and raised Catholic he now describes himself as an atheist and said he would 'probably hesitate' before returning to Ireland due to the strength of anti-Israel feeling. 'I’m pretty well recognized nowadays. I could be very easily attacked,' he said, as he recalled coming face to face with anti-Israel demonstrators while in Ireland. The problem, he believes, is deeply entrenched. 'They [the Irish] simply don’t understand the history of the place. Myself, before I came here, I had Palestinian sympathies – I was a sympathizer.' But living in Be’eri, just a few kilometers from Gaza, changed his outlook. 'They fired thousands and thousands and thousands of rockets at us continuously,' he said. 'Ireland mistakenly sees Israel as the super power, the strength, the oppressor and of course they have sympathies for the Palestinian people,' he said. 'Well, if they understood the history of the place, they’d realise there is no comparison.' Emily is 'fantastic,' he said, and just like a 'normal little girl'. Hand and his daughter were reunited just over a year ago, when she was released by Hamas on November 26. Like so many other residents of Beeri and other kibbutzim in the area, the pair spent months living in hotel accommodation by the Dead Sea – until recently. Back in September, they – along with many others affected by the crisis – were moved to live in 'prefab houses' on another kibbutz close to Beer Sheva. 'The kibbutz expanded their fence and then new housing was built pretty rapidly, amazingly,' he said. When asked if he would return to Be’eri, he said: 'In a heartbeat. If I didn’t have Emily, I would have been back months ago.' He said that at least 150 residents, many of whom are older and without children, have returned to Be’eri but that the overall reconstruction work has not yet begun. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We’re still demolishing the houses that are irreparable in Beeri. There’s no new building going on yet – to build up again that amount of housing is going to take time. But that’s the dream one day, just to go back there,' he said. Would he not feel nervous? 'We were always nervous,' he said. 'Constantly being attacked by missiles, rockets, on a weekly basis. That’s been our norm for the last 20 odd years, since Hamas came into power. 'We’re used to living with that and I don’t believe the Israeli army will ever let that happen again. Hopefully. Everything will depend on the state of the army, the state of Hamas and whatever government is in power at the time, in the future.' -Reprinted with permission from Jewish News >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hktoxudsje	2024-12-24T08:58:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/26/HJO70Mgr6/HJO70Mgr6_0_109_576_325_0_small.jpg
Kurdish-led forces launch counterattack against Turkish-backed Sy...	Spokesperson of the Women’s Protection Unit, an all-female militia fighting under the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, says they are just over seven miles from the center of the key city of Manbij in their counter-offensive; 'We will not be pushed out of negotiations on the future of Syria' The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said Tuesday they have launched a counter-offensive against the Ankara-backed Syrian National Army to take back areas near Syria’s northern border with Turkey. The SDF is Washington’s critical ally in Syria, targeting sleeper cells of the extremist Islamic State group scattered across the country’s east. Since the fall of the totalitarian rule of Bashar Assad earlier this month, clashes have intensified between the U.S.-backed group and the Syrian National Army (SNA), which captured the key city of Manbij and the areas surrounding it. The intense weekslong clashes come at a time when Syria, battered by over a decade of war and economic misery, is negotiating its political future following half a century under the Assad dynasty’s rule. Ruken Jamal, spokesperson of the Women’s Protection Unit, or YPJ, under the Syrian Democratic Forces, told The Associated Press that their fighters are just over seven miles away from the center of Manbij in their ongoing counter-offensive. She accused Ankara of trying to weaken the group’s influence in negotiations over Syria’s political future through the SNA. 'Syria is now in a new phase, and discussions are underway about the future of the country,' Jamal said. 'Turkey is trying, through its attacks, to distract us with battles and exclude us from the negotiations in Damascus.' The Britain-based opposition war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, says since the SNA’s offensive in northern Syria against the Kurds started earlier this month, dozens from both sides have been killed. Ankara sees the SDF as an affiliate of its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which it classifies as a terrorist organization. Turkish-backed armed groups alongside Turkish jets for years have attacked positions where the SDF are largely present across northern Syria, in a bid to create a buffer zone free from the group along the large shared border. While the SNA was involved in the lightning insurgency – led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – that toppled Assad, it has continued its push against the SDF, seen as Syria’s second key actor for its political future. On Monday, the SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami said the group’s forces pushed back the Turkish-backed rebels from areas near the Tishrin Dam on the Euphrates, a key source of hydroelectric power. He said the SDF also destroyed a tank belonging to the rebels southeast of Manbij. The British-based war monitor said on Tuesday that the Kurdish-led group, following overnight fighting, has reclaimed four villages in the areas near the strategic dam. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Turkish jets also pounded the strategic border town of Kobani in recent days. During Syria’s uprising-turned-conflict, the Kurds carved out an enclave of autonomous rule across northeastern Syria, never fully allying entirely with Assad in Damascus nor the rebels trying to overthrow him. Even with the Assad family out of the picture, it appears that Ankara’s position won’t change, with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan’s landmark visit to Syria maintaining a strong position on the Kurdish-led group in his meeting with de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa of HTS. 'It has turned the region into a cauldron of terror with PKK members and far-left groups who have come from Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Europe,' Fidan said in a news conference after the meeting. 'The international community is turning a blind eye to this lawlessness because of the wardenship it provides' (against the Islamic State). With the ongoing fighting, SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi has expressed concern about a strong Islamic State resurgence due to the power vacuum in Syria and the ongoing fighting, which has left the Kurdish-led group unable to carry out its attacks and raids on the extremist group’s scattered sleeper cells. Tens of thousands of children, family members, and supporters of Islamic State terrorists are still held in large detention centers in northeastern Syria, in areas under SDF control. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skvak8urjl	2024-12-24T08:28:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/Byeid9BDEJx/Byeid9BDEJx_0_306_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

It doesn't feel like Christmas in Syria as tree in town square se...	Thousands of Syrian Christians protest the burning of a Christmas tree by jihadist rebels in a Christian-majority town; The incident raises fears about minority rights under Ahmad al-Sharaa's leadership, as HTS tries to present a moderate image to the international community In Syria, thousands of Christians took to the streets on Tuesday to protest the burning of a Christmas tree in a predominantly Christian town in the center of the country. The incident, reportedly carried out by foreign jihadist rebels, has intensified fears among Christians and other minorities about the new leadership under the jihadist rebel group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Despite their attempts to project a moderate image and promises to safeguard all minorities, the attack has raised serious concerns about what the future holds under their rule. The attack, which enraged Syria's Christian minority—already significantly reduced during the country’s brutal civil war – took place in the town of al-Suqaylabiyah in Hama province, where the majority of residents are Christians. Video footage of the incident shows masked gunmen pouring flammable liquid on a large Christmas tree in the town square before setting it ablaze. The culprits’ identities remain unclear. However, the new HTS-led government, under the leadership of Ahmad al-Sharaa, rushed to condemn the act, claiming it was carried out by non-Syrian fighters. Many foreign jihadists, who view their involvement in the Syrian conflict as fulfilling a religious duty, have joined the ranks of rebel groups, including HTS. Reports from Sky News Arabia suggested that the attackers were Chechens, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights identified them as Uzbeks affiliated with the jihadist group Ansar al-Tawhid. According to the Observatory, the armed men threatened locals with their weapons, preventing them from approaching the tree. However, firefighters managed to extinguish the flames after the attackers fled. Some reports indicate the suspects were later arrested. The Observatory, which operates from London and is aligned with rebel groups, issued a statement accusing such incidents of undermining national stability and efforts toward peaceful coexistence among Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious communities. Protests erupted immediately after the incident. In a viral video, a Muslim cleric representing HTS addressed local residents, claiming that the attackers 'are not Syrians' and vowing they would face punishment. He promised the Christmas tree would be rebuilt and relit the following morning. However, these assurances have done little to calm Syria’s Christian community. Protests continued on Tuesday across several locations, including the capital Damascus, where demonstrators marched with large wooden crosses and waved the Free Syria flag, which the rebels adopted as their symbol after toppling Assad’s regime. 'Let us sacrifice our souls for the cross!' chanted protesters in Damascus’s Bab Touma neighborhood. 'We demand rights for Christians!' One protester, identified as George, told AFP: 'If we cannot live with our Christian faith in our own country as we’ve always done, then we no longer belong here.' He added that despite repeated promises to protect minorities, Christians continue to face 'a great deal of injustice,' disguised as 'isolated incidents.' This incident comes at a particularly sensitive time for the new rebel government led by al-Sharaa, who has been working to present a more moderate image to the world. His goal is to have the severe sanctions imposed during Assad’s rule lifted. Al-Sharaa, who once had ties to al-Qaida, has spent years insisting that he has cut all connections to the organization and has moderated his views. His supporters point to the reported protection of Christians under HTS rule in Idlib province in recent years as evidence of his shift in leadership style. Idlib, the group’s stronghold, was the launching point for last month’s surprise offensive that quickly led to the collapse of the old regime. While al-Sharaa’s promises have been met with skepticism in the West, they have also sparked some cautious optimism that Syria could be on a new path – perhaps even toward a democratic future. Although the U.S. and its allies have yet to remove HTS from their list of terrorist organizations, diplomatic relations with al-Sharaa’s government have been renewed. Notably, the U.S. also withdrew the $10 million bounty it once offered for al-Sharaa’s capture a decade ago. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As part of his efforts to create a stable new regime and prevent further internal clashes among rebel factions, al-Sharaa has pledged to disband all armed factions and merge them under the Ministry of Defense. On Tuesday, the new government announced that al-Sharaa and faction leaders had reached an agreement to implement this plan. Photos from the meeting show al-Sharaa alongside faction leaders, including Marhaf Abu Qasra, who previously served as the head of HTS’s military wing and was recently appointed as the head of the Ministry of Defense. In practice, this consolidation means that al-Sharaa and his allies will retain military power in the so-called 'new Syria.' While his government pushes for international recognition, incidents like the burning of the Christmas tree threaten to undermine his attempts to rebuild trust and stability in a deeply fractured nation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hysfa4ub1l	2024-12-24T06:19:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/HyVXTM7dS1g/HyVXTM7dS1g_0_335_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

A strike at Starbucks will expand to over 300 U.S. stores on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 workers expected to walk off the job before the five-day work stoppage ends later on Christmas Eve, the workers' union said. Starbucks Workers United, representing employees at 525 stores nationwide, said more than 60 U.S. stores across 12 major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle, were shut on Monday. Talks between Starbucks and the union had hit an impasse with unresolved issues over wages, staffing and schedules, leading to the strike that began on Friday. The Christmas Eve strike on Tuesday was projected to be the largest ever at the coffee chain, the union added. 'These strikes are an initial show of strength, and we're just getting started,' an Oregon barista said in a union statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkmlcsos1x	2024-12-24T05:50:38-08:00	
Saudi executions rose sharply in 2024	Saudi Arabia executed 330 people this year, the highest number in decades, despite de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman's 2022 assertion that the death penalty had been eliminated except for murder cases under his vision for a new open kingdom. The latest execution toll, compiled from execution announcements by human rights NGO Reprieve and verified by Reuters, is a big jump from the 172 total for last year and 196 for 2022. Reprieve said it was the highest ever recorded. Saudi Arabia denies accusations of human rights abuses and says its actions are aimed at protecting national security. More than 150 people were executed for non-lethal crimes this year, according to the tally, which rights groups say is contrary to international law. Those executions were mainly related to alleged drug smuggling amid a flood of amphetamine-like captagon from Syria under ousted President Bashar Assad. They also included people charged with non-lethal terrorism, a charge rights groups say is often used against those who have participated in anti-government protests. The total includes more than 100 foreign nationals from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkdgfhdr1l	2024-12-24T05:48:01-08:00	
Iran lifts ban on WhatsApp and Google Play, state media says	Iranian authorities have lifted a ban on Meta's instant messaging platform WhatsApp and Google Play as a first step to scale back internet restrictions, Iranian state media reported on Tuesday. The Islamic Republic has some of the strictest controls on Internet access in the world, but its blocks on U.S.-based social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are routinely bypassed by tech-savvy Iranians using virtual private networks. 'A positive majority vote has been reached to lift limitations on access to some popular foreign platforms such as WhatsApp and Google Play', Iran's official IRNA news agency said on Tuesday, referring to a meeting on the matter headed by President Masoud Pezeshkian. 'Today the first step in removing internet limitations... has been taken,' IRNA cited Iran's Minister of Information and Communications Technology Sattar Hashemi as saying. Social media platforms were widely used in anti-government protests in Iran. In September the United States called on Big Tech to help evade online censorship in countries that heavily sensor the internet, including Iran.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byzpdrusjx	2024-12-24T05:45:04-08:00	
Katz: 'Those who sponsor Houthi terror will pay the full price'	Defense Minister Israel Katz visited on Tuesday the Arrow missile defense battery responsible for intercepting a missile launched from Yemen overnight. Katz reiterated Israel’s commitment to countering Houthi aggression, saying, 'We will not tolerate continued missile fire on Israel by the Houthis.' Katz drew parallels to past operations targeting high-profile adversaries, saying, 'As we dealt with Sinwar in Gaza, Haniyeh in Tehran and Nasrallah in Beirut, we will deal with Houthi leaders in Sanaa and throughout Yemen.' He vowed to dismantle both Houthi leadership and their infrastructure, declaring, 'We will act to eliminate the threat and neutralize any danger to Israel to achieve our objectives.

Nasrallah's funeral and pager operation report: Hezbollah recalib...	Iran-backed terror group admits to suffering 'major blow' by Israel and says will continue looking into pager explosion operation and construct a mausoleum for Nasrallah A month into the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, the Shiite terrorist organization is recalibrating its course and preparing for what’s next amid the heavy blows it sustained during the war. Among other matters, the terror group is deliberating where to bury its former leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was eliminated in September. Senior Hezbollah officials who spoke with the London-based Arab outlet Asharq Al-Awsat outlined the organization's current priorities: holding a comprehensive assessment of the fighting with Israel, continuing investigations into the explosions of pagers and walkie-talkie devices that harmed thousands of its operatives and arranging funerals for Nasrallah and his cousin and apparent successor, Hashem Safieddine who was also eliminated shortly after. According to the sources, Hezbollah is now focused on 'internal reorganization' and rebuilding its political and organizational structure after losing dozens of prominent military, political and administrative figures during the war. The officials noted that Hezbollah will carry out a thorough evaluation of the 'previous political phase' to identify its mistakes in light of the geopolitical changes that took place in the Middle East over the past year. They acknowledged that the terror organization 'suffered a major blow' following its support for Gaza, culminating in the deaths of Nasrallah, Safieddine and top military commanders. They also stressed that the investigation into the pager explosions will continue 'until the truth is revealed.' Discussions about Nasrallah's burial site have recently gained momentum. According to the officials, Hezbollah owns a plot of land along the old road leading to Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport, which it plans to convert into a memorial and burial site of its former secretary-general. Earlier this month, the Lebanese newspaper Ad-Diyar reported that the exact location of the burial site remains undecided, as Hezbollah intends to construct a mausoleum for Nasrallah and Safieddine, similar to the one it built for former Hezbollah leader Abbas al-Musawi. The report mentioned three potential locations for the mausoleum — two in Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahieh) and one along the old airport road. 'The site will be chosen based on available space and its capacity to accommodate visitors,' the report said. Sources who spoke with Asharq Al-Awsat also addressed the cease-fire with Israel, saying that 'throughout the cease-fire period, Hezbollah has acted with restraint and hasn’t allowed Israel to provoke it into renewing the war.' 'The organization is leaving charge to Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati and the army leadership to handle Israeli violations through the body overseeing the cease-fire,' they added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Regarding the Syrian front and the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, Hezbollah sources claimed that the organization maintains a military and security presence along the hills of northern and eastern Beqaa. The move was made to counter potential infiltration by groups affiliated with the Islamic State (ISIS) into these areas and from there into Shiite towns. 'Hezbollah's presence in these areas continues, despite receiving assurances that ISIS-affiliated groups won’t enter the Shiite towns,' they said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1purmdh1l	2024-12-24T03:43:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/06/HkzHdEad11kg/HkzHdEad11kg_0_168_2200_1238_0_small.jpg

Satellite images reveal IDF corridor in northern Gaza: 'Half of J...	Experts say tactic mirrors Netzarim Corridor but targets densely populated urban areas; one-third of buildings razed, one-eighth of pre-war population remains Fresh satellite imagery shows Israel carried out mass demolition and erected military fortifications in residential areas of northern Gaza, The Washington Post reported on Monday. The operations, which began October 5 in Jabaliya, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, have displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, with Israel stating the campaign will continue 'as long as necessary.' According to the UN, over 100,000 Palestinians have fled the area in the past 11 weeks, leaving fewer than 50,000 residents—one-eighth of the pre-war population. Humanitarian groups reported severe restrictions on aid reaching the region. Satellite images show entire neighborhoods razed, new roads constructed and extensive military fortifications established. Almost half of Jabaliya’s refugee camp has been destroyed or cleared, with a military corridor now connecting western and eastern roads, creating a pathway from the sea to the Israeli border. Experts likened the new corridor to the Netzarim Corridor, which once split Gaza into two. However, they noted that unlike the primarily agricultural areas of the Netzarim Corridor, these operations are in densely populated urban zones, describing it as 'the demolition of Palestinian cities.' The IDF has reportedly built elevated defense platforms for nearly 150 military vehicles around Jabaliya by late October, with additional fortifications and roads appearing in satellite images through mid-December. Palestinian residents and UN satellite data show over 5,000 buildings in Jabaliya, 3,600 in Beit Lahia and 2,000 in Beit Hanoun have been razed since the war began. Despite Israeli warnings delivered via leaflets, phone calls and drones urging civilians to evacuate, residents said, 'There is no refuge from Israeli strikes.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Human rights groups have criticized the mass evacuations, saying IDF actions align with strategies outlined in the controversial 'Generals' Plan,' which proposed designating northern Gaza a closed military zone, forcing mass evacuations and besieging the area until terrorists surrendered or were killed. Israel has denied allegations of forced displacement. Defense Minister Israel Katz and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer wrote to the Biden administration, saying, 'Israel does not have a policy of forcibly evacuating civilians from Gaza, including the north.' The Post highlighted statements from former defense minister Moshe Ya’alon accusing the IDF of 'ethnic cleansing' and 'war crimes.' Palestinian accounts detailed relentless attacks on civilian neighborhoods, mass separations during evacuations and alleged abuse of those trying to flee. A U.S. State Department spokesperson told reporters last week that they had 'not seen' evidence of forced evacuations in Gaza, adding that such actions would constitute a 'red line' for the U.S. government. Satellite imagery also revealed significant changes to Gaza’s geography, with IDF fortifications mirroring tactics used in past buffer zones, such as the Netzarim Corridor and Philadelphi Corridor. The military corridor now divides northern Gaza, enabling what one expert described as 'more systematic clearing operations' while imposing de facto borders restricting movement to the south. Satellite images show increasing destruction in Beit Lahia between November 15 and December 15. With the war ongoing, negotiations over cease-fires and hostage exchanges remain contentious. Hamas has demanded that families be allowed to return to northern Gaza as part of any truce, a key sticking point in talks with Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkvyr7objl	2024-12-24T03:28:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/24/HyhK0CPrkg/HyhK0CPrkg_0_36_1920_1081_0_small.jpg
Arab League members urge political transition and stability in po...	Arab nations urge stability in Syria, backing a political process while avoiding foreign interference; concerns grow over armed factions and leadership uncertainties amid calls for unity and peace Official Arab responses were cautious after the Syrian opposition factions, headed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Muhammed al-Golani, announced the formula of 'following up on developments in the situation in Damascus and emphasizing standing with the Syrians' choices.' Prevalent in Arab responses were demands, including the start of an integrated political process and warnings against sliding into chaos. According to experts for The Media Line, ambiguity and uncertainty about the future surround the current Syrian scene. Therefore, the Arab position will not be directed toward anyone specific, and most of it will develop and evolve with time, awaiting more clarity of vision. The experts also indicate that there are two possible paths for any Arab scenario. The first is supporting institutions and accepting the leaders of the current transitional path, and the second is restoring the Arab presence in Syria while acknowledging the current reality and following up on its developments. This means not leaving political decisions to any non-Arab intervention and freezing decisions regarding Syria’s seat in the Arab League until a new authority arrives or until the current leaders are accepted. Regarding al-Sharaa’s background, he previously joined al-Qaeda in Iraq shortly before the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and fought for three years in the Iraqi insurgency. After being captured by U.S. forces, he was imprisoned from 2006 to 2011. His release coincided with the Syrian revolution, and he founded Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, in 2012 with al-Qaeda’s support to participate in the Syrian civil war against Bashar Assad’s government. As the emir of Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Sharaa built a stronghold in the northwestern Idlib province and opposed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s attempts to merge Nusra into the Islamic State. This disagreement led to open conflict between Nusra and ISIS. The U.S. State Department designated al-Sharaa a 'global terrorist' in May 2013 and four years later announced a $10 million reward for information leading to his capture. He announced in an audio recording on September 28, 2014, that he would 'fight the United States and its allies and urged his fighters not to accept Western assistance in their fight against ISIS.' However, in February 2021, he backed down from threatening the U.S., saying that 'Hayat Tahrir al-Sham does not pose any threat to the United States, and the U.S. administration must remove it from its list of terrorist organizations.' Since his split from al-Qaeda, al-Sharaa also severed ties with Jabhat al-Nusra, merging it with other organizations to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in 2017. He then began collecting taxes and providing public services in the Syrian province of Idlib, which he controlled. The King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, who also chairs the current session of the Arab League, was the first to send a letter to al-Sharaa, in which he praised 'the cooperation of the Presidency of the Syrian Political Affairs Department with the Arab ambassadors residing in Damascus.' King Hamad also stressed in his letter published by the official Bahrain News Agency, 'the importance of preserving the sovereignty, stability, safety, and unity of the Syrian Republic, and achieving the aspirations of the Syrian people, and the readiness of the Kingdom of Bahrain to continue consultation and coordination with the Syrian Republic, and to support regional and international organizations to achieve what is in the best interests of the Syrian people.' The Saudi Foreign Ministry published a statement calling on the international community to stand by Syria 'without interfering in its internal affairs, and to join efforts to preserve the unity of Syria and the cohesion of its people in a way that protects it from sliding into chaos and division.' Meanwhile, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry confirmed in an official statement 'its support for the Syrian state and people and its support for Syria’s sovereignty.' It also called for 'the start of a comprehensive and integrated political process that establishes a new phase of consensus and internal peace.' Qatar’s Foreign Ministry stressed in a statement 'the need to preserve national institutions and the unity of the state in a way that prevents it from slipping into chaos, and its firm stand by the Syrian people and their choices.' Jordanian King Abdullah II confirmed in a Royal Court statement that his country 'stands by the Syrian brothers and respects their will and choices.' Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi stressed via a post on X that his country 'will provide all possible support to the brotherly Syrian people in their efforts to rebuild their homeland and institutions. It will support any political process launched by the Syrian people to preserve their rights.' He also stressed 'the need to protect Syria from slipping into chaos.' The pro-Assad Iraqi government confirmed in a statement by its spokesman, Bassem Al-Awadi, that it 'is continuing international contacts with brotherly and friendly countries, in order to push efforts toward stability, and preserve security, public order, lives and property for the brotherly Syrian people.' He also stressed 'the importance of not interfering in Syria's internal affairs, or supporting one party for the benefit of another,' affirming that 'intervention will only push the situation in Syria toward more conflict and division, and the first to be harmed will be the Syrian people.' From recent public events, it seems that Syria’s al-Sharaa will not be able to distance himself from those around him who are accused of terrorism. An Egyptian citizen named Mahmoud Fathy, who was convicted of terrorist crimes, including killing the Egyptian Attorney General Hisham Barakat in a bombing on June 29, 2015, has appeared next to al-Sharaa in several recent photos. Fathy is wanted by Egyptian authorities, who consider him an active terrorist according to official statements, and he has had several death sentences issued against him. Regarding the two options for support that Arab countries foresee for Syria, Egyptian political analyst Dr. Amr Shabaky told The Media Line: 'The first is to support institutions and the transitional and peaceful path of power, and the second is to restore Arab presence and not leave it to any non-Arab interventions, including recognition of the reality and dealing with its developments in a way that preserves the stability and safety of Syria and the security of the region.' Shabaky added: 'Current indicators indicate that there is an acknowledgment of the Syrians' options regardless of fears of armed factions, which will be dealt with based on practices, and that the most important thing now is to support Syrian institutions to avoid repeating the experience of Iraq and Libya.' Saudi political journalist Khaled Al-Awadi told The Media Line that 'the Arab position will remain reserved, but it will not allow any foreign intervention, especially since previous experiences were bad in Libya, Yemen, Iraq, and even Syria.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to Al-Awadi, 'The Arabs will deal according to what these armed factions deal with, and there are questions that cannot be answered at present, related to the strength of the terrorist organization of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the extent to which these armed factions in Hayat Tahrir al-Sham accept other factions such as the SDF and others.' He argued that no one wants Syria to slide into a civil war again. 'This option is frightening for all Arabs, as the Arab countries fear this.' Jaber Hamoud, a Kuwaiti journalist, told The Media Line: 'I expect the Arab position toward Ahmad al-Sharaa to change now in Syria because of the Arabs’ desire for stability in Syria, especially after years of Bashar Assad’s rule.' Continued Hamoud: 'Bashar al-Assad was a criminal, and he did not have a good policy with the Gulf states or all the Arab states, so his fall will not represent anything important. The most important thing is that the future in Syria will be better than its predecessor.' Hamoud doesn’t expect violent conflicts inside Syria, 'as the Sunnis constitute about 90% of the population, and the Alawites hate Bashar Assad, and everyone is tired of the war that lasted 13 years and wants peace.' According to Jordanian journalist Mohammad Al-Jousi, the Arab countries have been and continue to stand by the Syrian people since 2011 and after the beginning of the Syrian refugee crisis in many Arab countries. 'After the fall of the Syrian regime, the Arab countries are now concerned with the return of security and stability to Syria, and that events be contained quickly by holding transitional presidential elections, for a period filled with hope for stability,' he told The Media Line. Al-Jousi continued: 'With the stabilization of the situation, attention will turn to the return of refugees and the reconstruction of Syria, as the greatest burden will be on the neighboring countries that hosted the refugees, which requires them to play a role in facilitating their return.' 'The Arab role will focus on unifying the Syrian opposition and presenting a roadmap for a political solution, as any internal division may open the way for foreign powers to enhance their influence,' he added. Mohammed Al-Rawi, an Iraqi political analyst, told The Media Line: 'Currently, we see it as natural for Arab countries to freeze Syria’s seat in the Arab League and for the seat to remain vacant until a president is officially elected for Syria, which could last a whole year.' According to Al-Rawi, Al-Sharaa will be eliminated soon, and a new face will appear on the scene, and the Arabs will deal with him. However, if Al-Sharaa is killed, 'there will be major clashes between the armed factions, each of which will accuse the other of being behind his assassination,' he cautioned. Meanwhile, for the Gulf states, Saudi political analyst Jassim Al-Saeedi told The Media Line that 'the most important thing is that the government is not affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and that those accused of terrorism are not in power in Syria.' He continued: 'If there are actually civil elections, a political vision, and a new constitution elected by the Syrian people, all Arab states, including the Gulf states, will stand by Syria. In any other case, there will be no support.'

I will rebuild this country for her if need be': Going back to K...	A father revisits his family’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri with his 5-year-old daughter, who hid in a closet as terrorists roamed their house on October 7; 'We brought her back for the first time in over a year so she could see Be’eri still stands,' father says Omri Shefroni, who lost four family members in the Kibbutz Be’eri massacre on October 7, spent 12 harrowing hours locked in a safe room with his family as Hamas terrorists roamed their living room. On Sunday morning, in an emotional interview with Ynet, he shared that, for the first time since that traumatic day, he took his five-year-old daughter, Arbel, back to his parents’ house in the kibbutz—and to the closet where she had hidden. 'We feared this moment for a long time, but we realized it was essential to help her process the experience. It was an emotional and difficult visit,' he said. 'She doesn’t remember much,' Shefroni explained, 'but she does remember being in the closet. That’s where we hid her and her two cousins as we waited for rescue, knowing it wouldn’t come quickly, with the terrorists just outside the safe room door. They even shot at the door, and two bullets penetrated it.' Despite the terror surrounding them, he added, 'She felt safe there, as far as we can understand. The anxiety, fear and helplessness we felt are impossible to put into words—there’s nothing rational about that situation.' Shefroni explained that the decision to revisit the house came after extensive consultations with Arbel’s therapist and psychologists. 'Part of the process,' he said, 'is ensuring her emotions and memories surface in a positive and constructive way, rather than haunting her mind and soul, while also ensuring she doesn’t suppress them. That was the intention. Arbel doesn’t remember much, but there are details etched in her memory that are slowly emerging.' Shefroni also addressed recent reports about progress in negotiations for a hostage release deal, which is expected to unfold in stages. 'There are still hostages from Be’eri in Gaza. I deeply hope the deal everyone is discussing will come to fruition and include all of them.' He added, 'There’s an ongoing effort to make people forget that we were left completely alone during the attack, abandoned, with no one truly taking responsibility for what happened—except for some incredible civilians, who stepped up on October 7, and they continue to bear that responsibility even now.' Shefroni spoke about his work with the 'Kumu' movement, which he co-founded alongside Yonatan Shamriz and other partners. 'We’re working to create a new reality here, one that reflects the strength of our people and the citizens of this country, showing that real change is possible,' he said. Yonatan’s brother, Alon Shamriz, was kidnapped on October 7 and tragically killed by the IDF in Shijaiyah alongside Yotam Chaim and Samer Talalka. When asked about Defense Minister Israel Katz's deadline for IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi to complete investigations into the massacre by next month, Shefroni responded, 'The defense minister is right. I personally fought to ensure these investigations would take place, but he’s ignoring the other side of the equation—political leadership holds significant and equal responsibility alongside the military. 'The IDF failed completely that day, and any Knesset member or minister who says so is correct. But they cannot absolve themselves of responsibility either. What we’re seeing is a total failure of leadership, and it’s been ongoing for over a year. Yes, we unequivocally expect a state commission of inquiry. That is the only way to truly examine these events.' A lifelong resident of Kibbutz Be’eri, now living in Givat Haviva in the Menashe Regional Council, Shefroni shared his longing to return. 'I visited on that Shabbat. My entire family lived there. Since then, I’ve felt a strong pull to go back. I hope we’ll make it happen, but I can’t promise. Arbel and her brother Maayan have lives and friends elsewhere, and these decisions are not simple. But I want to return, and Be’eri will undoubtedly recover. It will happen—though only after the hostages from Be’eri and the others are brought back. Without them, neither the kibbutz, the state, nor anything else here can truly heal.' Blast from the past Shefroni wrote on social media about his first visit with Arbel to the house where they had hidden during the massacre. 'She was four years and one month old when we hid her in the closet to protect her from the terrorists who were roaming our living room. Luckily, they didn’t try to open the door, though two bullets pierced through it like a hot knife through butter. If they had, we wouldn’t be here today.' Reflecting on the experience, he said, 'The moments of terror and helplessness are deeply burned into my soul, resurfacing every time I look at my children and realize that I’m the only one who can protect them—and that I won’t always be able to.' Shefroni also described the horrifying scenes during their evacuation from Be’eri at first light on October 8. 'As we drove along Route 232—the ‘Road of Blood’—we passed dozens of burned vehicles and bodies scattered around them. Someone had hung signs reading, ‘The Road of Abandonment 7/10.’ Elsewhere, someone had gone out of their way to stop at each sign and erase the words. Maybe they thought erasing them would make us forget, but we won’t. The abandonment cannot be erased.' He added, 'In the safe room where we hid, across from the closet where we concealed the children, my father hung three photos: Dror, who was five and a half when my older brother, Sagi, fled a burning house with her and hid her outside from the terrorists behind laundry baskets; my younger brother Ron being evacuated from the safe room with his partner and their eight-month-old son, Hillel, escorted by soldiers; and one of Arbel and me in the armored vehicle early Sunday morning, freezing because the soldiers had turned the air conditioning to full blast. She remembers we rode in an ‘ice bus.’' Hope for the future Shefroni concluded, 'We brought her back to Be’eri for the first time in over a year so she could see Be’eri still stands. That her grandfather’s house has been repaired and still exists. That there is no longer war or terrorists there. Be’eri stands, and it will continue to stand and rebuild. Its resilient people are rebuilding it and will keep doing so, but they will never forget. They are still waiting for their friends, the hostages, to return.'

Palestinian Authority bans Al Jazeera in West Bank over terror cr...	Palestinian movement says decision comes following Qatari outlet's slanted coverage of clashes between its security forces and terrorists in Jenin The Fatah movement on Monday issued a ban on Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera and prohibited its entry into the West Bank, citing the channel's coverage of the Palestinian Authority's operations in the Jenin refugee camp as incitement against Palestinian security forces. The forces are leading an operation targeting armed terrorists affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The channel, which has become a mouthpiece for the Hamas terrorist organization, systematically portrays the Palestinian Authority negatively and incites against the security forces' activities in a manner that endangers their lives. Al Jazeera personnel were barred from covering the funeral of an officer killed in the Jenin refugee camp on Tuesday. 'To all Al Jazeera employees working in Palestinian territories, we hope you reflect on your actions and resign from this biased channel that has destroyed and continues to destroy the Arab world,' Fatah wrote to the channel's staff. 'Al Jazeera floods the media with lies, especially in Palestine, siding with a group of hostile mercenaries in the Jenin camp and trying to present them as heroes resisting the occupation,' it added.

Former Hamas hostage Hanna Katzir dies at 77	Hamas captivity survivor and longtime caregiver at Nir Oz dies a year after her release in a hostage deal; her husband was murdered in the October 7 attack, and her son was killed in captivity; 'Her heart couldn’t bear the suffering,' says daughter Kibbutz Nir Oz announced Tuesday morning the passing of Hanna Katzir, 77, a member of the kibbutz who was freed from Hamas captivity last year in the first phase of a hostage exchange deal. Katzir is the first released hostage to have passed away. 'It is with deep sorrow that we announce the passing of Hanna Katzir, a beloved member of Kibbutz Nir Oz,' the kibbutz said in a statement. 'After months of struggle and a complicated medical condition following her release, she has left us.' Katzir had been hospitalized in critical condition shortly after her release, with her health deteriorating in December. Katzir will be laid to rest Tuesday at 4:00 p.m. at the kibbutz cemetery. Carmit Palti-Katzir, Hanna’s daughter, described her as 'a loving, devoted wife and mother who was full of love.' She added, 'Her heart could not bear the terrible suffering since October 7.' Speaking of the hostages still in captivity, Palti-Katzir called for urgent action. 'Every day in captivity endangers the lives of our loved ones. A comprehensive agreement to bring back our 100 brothers and sisters must be reached immediately.' Katzir was abducted from her home in Nir Oz on October 7 during the Hamas-led assault. Her husband, Rami Katzir, 79, was murdered by the attackers. Hanna later learned that her son, Elad, 47, had also been taken hostage. In April, the IDF confirmed that Elad had been killed in captivity, and his body was recovered from Khan Yunis. Hanna Katzir was the mother of three children and grandmother to six. Known for her dedication, she had cared for children in the kibbutz for many years. 'When she returned home after being freed, the first thing she asked was, ‘Where is Dad?’' her daughter recalled. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1zteyobjg	2024-12-23T22:40:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/23/SkQhDcXzp/SkQhDcXzp_0_97_976_550_0_small.jpg

A Sunni Christmas? Syria's Christians uneasy about Islamists unde...	Ahmad al-Sharaa’s leadership promises unity and respect for Christians, but fears persist over minority treatment and emigration; Lebanon’s economic crisis dims celebrations, with southern villages lacking power as residents rebuild from devastation Christmas has arrived, and Christians in Syria, Lebanon and neighboring Arab countries are preparing for the holiday amid a backdrop of recent upheavals in the region. In Syria, Christmas trees have been lit in the streets, including in the capital Damascus. However, for many Christians, the holiday spirit is tempered by mixed feelings—joy on one hand and uncertainty about the new regime on the other. Although the lives of Christians in Syria have remained relatively stable since the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, there is growing apprehension about what the future might hold under the rule of religiously motivated armed factions. While the new Syrian government, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has pledged to dismantle these groups, it also portrays itself as a unifying force, aiming to represent all religions and communities in Syrian society. The festive atmosphere across Damascus and other parts of Syria is tinged with fundamental questions about the future of Christians in the reshaped Syrian state. In interviews with Arab media, Syrian Christians have expressed both hope and concern. 'Right now, we are preparing for Christmas and hoping the rebel operations administration will assist us. Syria belongs to everyone, open to all religions,' said one Christian resident. Another added, 'We have lived together—Muslims and Christians—all our lives, loving one another and celebrating holidays together.' Apprehension aside, some see the illuminated Christmas trees lining the streets as a positive sign of better days ahead. Speaking to the Saudi news network Al Arabiya, Mohammad Sabra, a negotiator for the Syrian opposition during the Geneva peace talks, noted that while some fear the new regime will adopt a religious tone, it was Assad's regime that actively sowed division among Syrians. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted that when armed factions first took control of various areas in Syria, they distributed bread and gifts to children in Christian neighborhoods, assuring residents they had nothing to fear. However, in Homs, some claimed militants attempted to close alcohol shops and remove crosses from Christian-owned vehicles. These incidents, though troubling, appeared to be isolated and counter to the official policies of Syria's new leadership. 'Rebels are asking Christians to continue practicing their religious traditions and fully celebrate Christmas,' said a resident named Ammar Fahouri in an interview. 'We are still afraid of the uncertain future and haven’t yet reached a stage of full confidence, but their words, actions and respect for everyone help ease some of the fear.' Meanwhile, a businessman from Aleppo expressed skepticism: 'We are still in the stage of promises. Is this propaganda to build trust abroad, only to change later, or is it genuine? Time will tell.' Jiris Jabra, a Christian resident of Tartus, said he felt relieved by Assad's departure: 'We are optimistic because those who overthrew the regime are taking steps to ensure safety and security.' The report also noted that many Christians fled their homes as rebels advanced but returned within days to protect their properties. 'In 30–40 years, there will be no Christians in Syria' The article pointed out that during decades of Assad family rule, Christians and Muslims coexisted with minimal friction. However, the civil war tested Christian communities severely. As the conflict took on sectarian dimensions, many Christians sided with the regime or refrained from opposing it openly. Church leaders, in particular, had longstanding ties to the regime and its intelligence services. Although there is no precise count of the Christian population in Syria, estimates from international charities and local communities peg the number between 200,000 and 600,000—no more than 1.5% of the population. Before the war, Christians made up about 10% of Syria’s population, but the significant exodus of refugees drastically reduced their numbers. The treatment of minorities is now a critical test for Syria’s opposition forces, particularly for al-Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham organization, which has, in recent years, emphasized its break from its jihadist origins. The Wall Street Journal further reported that many young Christians are emigrating from Syria. A young Christian travel agency owner from Aleppo told the paper that, despite his optimism for Syria’s future, he is still contemplating emigration, believing the region will remain mired in conflict. 'In 30–40 years, there will be no Christians in Syria because everyone will have left,' he said. 'Those who cannot leave will either be old or dead.' The report warned that this ongoing emigration could threaten the historical presence of Christians in Syria. Marguerite Kalenderian, an Armenian Christian who previously lived in northwest Syria but emigrated to Dubai in 2021, expressed concern about the new leadership. 'They were part of ISIS and Al Qaeda—how can I trust someone who was a terrorist just two days ago?' she asked, reflecting fears about possible restrictions on freedoms, including forcing women to cover their hair. In southern Lebanon, Christmas trees remain unlit due to lack of electricity Lebanon is also celebrating Christmas, though the festivities are shadowed by economic hardship and the aftermath of the war. The country, already in the grips of a severe financial crisis, has seen its situation further worsen. This holiday season, Lebanon is relying heavily on tourism to generate much-needed revenue. Social media videos show glimpses of the holiday spirit in Beirut, despite the challenges. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Lebanese army has leveraged the holiday season by hosting a booth at a Christmas exhibition in the Forum De Beyrouth event complex in the capital. Facing numerous challenges and tasked with additional missions following the cease-fire with Israel, the army is now actively recruiting soldiers and raising funds. At the event, the army displayed a sign listing 'volunteer terms for the army,' which has also circulated on social media in recent weeks to attract new recruits. In southern Lebanon, however, holiday atmosphere is far more subdued. In ravaged border villages and areas still experiencing military activity, Christmas celebrations are muted. The Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar shared a video showing a resident of the Christian village Dardara, near Tyre, placing a Christmas tree atop the ruins of the local church, which was damaged in airstrikes. Hezbollah had reportedly used sites, including religious institutions, for hiding, storing ammunition and launching attacks on Israeli territory. According to the report, the Christmas tree in the village remained unlit because electricity had not yet been restored, and most residents had yet to return. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkquchvb1g	2024-12-23T22:12:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/SJ11c6a38ryx/SJ11c6a38ryx_0_436_1079_608_0_small.jpg

Terror meets the army': West Bank terror sees downtrend amid IDF...	Military data from 2024 shows number of West Bank terror attacks lowered significantly year-on-year amid increased military operations and lessons learned from October 7 A significant decline in West Bank terror incidents was seen throughout 2024 as seen by recent military data. According to security officials, 'only' 254 terror attacks took place compared to 847 in 2023 and 342 in 2022. The data also showed other violent incidents including hurling rocks and incidents also reduced with 1,188 incidents in 2024 compared to 3,256 in 2023 and 3,779 in 2022. However, the number of Israeli casualties, including civilians and IDF soldiers, remained relatively stable over the past three years. Some 497 Palestinians were killed in clashes with the IDF in 2024, compared to 504 in 2023 and 155 in 2022. Security officials claimed 97% of those killed were terrorists. Some 2,350 Hamas operatives have been arrested by the IDF Central Command since the war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023. Jewish nationalist crime incidents also decreased, with 663 recorded in 2024 compared to 1,045 in 2023 and 947 in 2022. Whether this reflects a drop in activity or enforcement is unclear. IDF Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth coined the term 'terror meets the army – civilians live routine,' guiding the IDF's strategy to push terror threats away from communities and roads. The IDF identified high-risk areas in the region and implemented engineering measures to distance Palestinian villages and potential terrorists from Israeli locations. The army also established positions deep in Palestinian territory and restricted its divisions operating in the area, reducing civilian friction. After lessons learned from October 7, Jewish settlements were provided with weapons to ensure readiness in extreme scenarios until the military arrives. The West Bank barrier has also been bolstered, with significant sections rebuilt and new technologies are being implemented to aid forces. The nature of terror in the West Bank has evolved over recent years. In 2015, a wave of 'lone wolf' attacks —unaffiliated individuals committing stabbings — proved hard to preempt and often inspired copycat attacks. While this phenomenon persists to a lesser degree, local terror cells directed by Hamas and other terror organizations have resurged, leading to a rise in suicide attacks, especially via car bombings. In the past three years, a new threat has emerged: armed groups hidden in refugee camps. These groups, especially in the northern West Bank, operate like small terror organizations with hierarchical structures. Backed by substantial funding, they’ve set up command centers, hideouts and infrastructure. Terror camps are equipped with surveillance cameras and explosive traps, with terrorists often engaging the IDF in firefights. This model was inspired by the Lion's Den terror group in Nablus, which was dismantled by Israeli forces in 2022, though its successors remain active. While these 'camp brigades' lack unified coordination, Hamas and Iran fund and attempt to influence them. Armed parades in refugee camps, often just minutes from central Israel, present another challenge. These events are typically surrounded by civilians, making immediate responses complex. However, security forces identify and target the terrorists after the fact. Jordan’s eastern border with Israel poses its own difficulties. Despite the peace agreement with the country, Iran and Hamas frequently attempt to smuggle advanced weapons through the region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: This is often done by smugglers tossing weapons over the fence, later retrieved by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs. To counter this, the IDF has established a new division along the border, implemented new technological measures and enhanced cooperation with Jordanian forces. The Palestinian Authority's (PA) security forces have been conducting operations against armed terrorists in Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps for nearly two weeks. Progress has been relatively positive, though it's too early to determine its outcome. The PA aims to demonstrate governance and order, hoping the operation will bolster its case for taking control of Gaza after the war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1kms0vryx	2024-12-23T22:00:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/20/HkNC5vukp/HkNC5vukp_0_11_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Sadly, the IDF continues to treat families of the lookout soldiers in a disgraceful manner.' Adv. Bar-Tal explained that after IDF announced it would share the recordings, it delivered only partial documentation from Friday, October 6, until around 6:30 p.m., alongside a few seconds from 4:47 a.m. on Saturday, October 7. 'All other recordings, including those from Friday night into Saturday and the morning of the attack, were not provided to families,' he said. 'To clarify, the Supreme Court petition will still proceed. The IDF’s conduct, along with these partial recordings, will not lead to withdrawal of the petition.' Yigal, father of lookout soldier Hadar Cohen, who was killed at the outpost, shared his frustration with Ynet: 'We received recordings from the morning of October 6 until that evening, and that’s it. Hadar was on duty from 8 p.m. until midnight,' he said, explaining that her voice was absent from the recordings entirely. 'This is very disappointing,' Yigal said. 'We waited so long for this and feel extremely let down. We didn’t hear Hadar at all in the recordings—they end before her shift even began. We were waiting to hear her voice, but they didn’t tell us what we would hear, and now we know she isn’t included.' 'It’s incredibly strange, an unbearable heartbreak—it feels unreal,' he added, describing his emotions. 'It’s inconceivable that, right before such an attack, no trace of their communication remains. We feel like things are being hidden from us.' Eyal, father of lookout soldier Roni Eshel, shared that his family has not yet received the recordings but, based on conversations with other families, he understood their disappointment.

The Houthis cannot be deterred': The militia that defies the US ...	Yemeni rebels threaten Israel and global stability, paralyzing Red Sea trade despite US-led strikes; senior US officials express 'shock' over their advanced weapons, raising fears of increased Iranian support; Trump’s return may signal tougher US stance In one of the most dangerous incidents for U.S. forces in the Middle East since the onset of the war in Gaza, a U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jet was accidentally shot down over the Red Sea by an American warship over the weekend. The incident coincided with U.S. airstrikes targeting Houthi positions in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Both pilots safely ejected and were rescued, while the Houthi rebels quickly claimed responsibility for the downing. However, the Pentagon has not clarified whether the friendly fire was directly linked to the ongoing combat against the Iranian-backed group. The episode underscores the broader challenge posed by Iranian proxies, not only to Israel but also to the United States and the international community. Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the Houthis have launched what they describe as a campaign of 'support for Gaza.' This campaign has included barrages of missiles and swarms of drones targeting Israel—some of which caused casualties—and strikes on civilian vessels in the Red Sea, effectively crippling one of the world’s critical trade routes. One civilian ship was even seized. The Houthi attacks place the Biden administration in a difficult position, as they coincide with U.S. efforts to mediate an end to Yemen’s civil war and the Saudi-Houthi conflict. That war, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians in Saudi airstrikes, failed to defeat the Iranian-aligned militia. President Joe Biden removed the Houthis from the U.S. list of terrorist organizations upon entering office, and a UN-brokered cease-fire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia was reached in 2022. Over the past year, the U.S. has avoided direct, large-scale attacks on Houthi targets, seeking to preserve diplomatic efforts and prevent broader escalation in the region. Still, Washington formed an international coalition to conduct limited strikes aimed at deterring Houthi activity in the Red Sea. Israel, meanwhile, has expressed frustration over what it perceives as insufficient U.S. actions against the militia. Israel largely refrained from responding to Houthi attacks for months but launched its first strike in July, followed by additional attacks in September and last week. These strikes targeted strategic sites such as energy facilities and ports. Yet the Houthis vowed to continue their missile and drone campaigns. Earlier Monday, the IDF intercepted a drone launched from Yemen—following two failed interceptions of ballistic missiles last week. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Israelis to 'remain patient and steadfast' and hinted at a coordinated international effort against the Houthis, possibly involving expanded U.S. operations. 'We will act with strength, determination and ingenuity,' Netanyahu said Monday. 'Even if it takes time, the result will be the same as with other terrorist arms.' He promised that Israel’s recent strike in Yemen 'will not be the last.' As tensions remain high, the possibility of intensified U.S. and allied action could grow, particularly with President-elect Donald Trump set to re-enter the White House next month. However, the U.S.-led coalition’s ability to deter the Houthis has come into question as they had shown resilience against years of relentless Saudi airstrikes, often disregarding the severe suffering of Yemeni civilians. Two-thirds of Yemen’s population lives under Houthi control. A report Monday in The Wall Street Journal highlighted growing concerns in Washington and among international allies over the Houthis’ acquisition of advanced missile and drone technologies from Iran. Western sources have also alleged Russian involvement, pointing to intelligence about Western ships in the Red Sea supplying the Houthis. According to a U.S. defense official cited in the report, the coalition has destroyed 450 Houthi-launched drones. Despite these efforts, the Houthis' technological capabilities continue to pose significant challenges, exemplified by last week’s failure of Israel’s missile defense systems to intercept two ballistic missiles. One struck a school in Ramat Efal, while the other hit a playground in Tel Aviv. As noted by Ynet military analyst Rob Ben-Yishai, experts who spoke to The Journal believe that the Houthis on Saturday fired a derivative of an Iranian-made ballistic missile with a maneuverable re-entry vehicle, designed to evade defense systems. 'The scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,' a United Nations report said in November. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: William LaPlante, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, warned last month that the Houthis 'are getting scary' and that he was 'just shocked' at technologies they now have access to. The rapid evolution of the Houthis’ capabilities has alarmed analysts. 'In 2004, they were a besieged group hiding in the mountains,' said Mohammed Albasha, a U.S.-based Middle East security analyst for Basha Report. 'Now, they’re chasing U.S. carriers with drones and missiles and striking 2,000 kilometers away in central Israel.' This transformation, analysts say, could intensify if Iran increases its support for the Houthis as it faces setbacks in Lebanon and Syria. Even if the U.S. escalates its operations, experts question whether the Houthis can be deterred. Osamah Al Rawhani, a director for the Yemen-based Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, an independent think tank, told The Wall Street Journal: 'The Houthis don’t care what they lose as Yemenis. They want to win as a militia and take on global powers.' Dr. Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), echoed the sentiment. The Houthis 'don’t have a lot to lose' and 'They cannot be deterred.' Trump has not yet outlined specific plans to address the Houthi threat. However, during his election campaign, Trump subtly criticized the Biden administration’s military actions in the region, writing in August in a post on X that ' Bombs are dropping all over the place' in the Middle East. Given his hardline stance on Iran, analysts anticipate a tougher U.S. policy on the Houthis under his leadership. Mike Waltz, Trump’s incoming national security advisor, signaled this shift during a podcast interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, promising to re-designate the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). 'They remain an outstanding issue,' Waltz said. 'I guarantee what you’re going to see very soon is a redesignation of them for what they are — a terrorist organization.' President Biden removed the Houthis from the FTO list shortly after taking office, citing humanitarian concerns and the need to facilitate aid deliveries to Yemen’s civilians amid a dire humanitarian crisis. The FTO designation, first implemented by Trump in the waning days of his first term, carried severe sanctions, including penalties for any entities providing material support to the group. In January 2023, following renewed Houthi attacks, Biden placed them on the less severe Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) list, which imposes sanctions but lacks the sweeping restrictions of FTO classification. Critics have argued that the SDGT label does not do enough to curb the group’s aggression. Ben-Yishai predicted that Trump would lift the operational constraints Biden placed on U.S. forces in Yemen, potentially paving the way for a coordinated U.S.-Israel campaign to neutralize the Houthi threat. Such a strategy could involve targeting the Houthis’ leadership and degrading their ballistic missiles, drones, launch systems and production facilities—actions that Ben-Yishai said would mirror successful Israeli operations against Hezbollah’s strategic assets in Lebanon and the Assad regime’s capabilities in Syria. Israel would likely require significant cooperation from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region with aircraft carriers, missile destroyers and other assets. The geographic distance and intelligence challenges make unilateral Israeli action improbable. Ben-Yishai argued that a coordinated effort could prevent the Houthis from further destabilizing global order and the economy. He noted that while the Houthis are undeterred by strikes on their state infrastructure, leadership decapitation and precision attacks on their military capabilities could shift the balance. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk8oo7wb1e	2024-12-23T11:00:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/HkkC11PNryg/HkkC11PNryg_0_223_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Echoes of rebellion: Exiled activists see hope for change in Iran...	Two years after the start of the Women, Life, Freedom protests, Iranians abroad highlight the regime’s growing instability and find parallels in regional shifts, including Syria’s recent political developments Over the past two years, Iran has witnessed an unrelenting crackdown on its citizens, triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini at the hands of the morality police. The Women, Life, Freedom movement that followed Amini’s death became both a symbol of nationwide resistance and the catalyst for a devastating response from the regime. According to data provided by the Iran Human Rights organization, at least 166 people were executed in Iranian prisons in November 2024 alone, the highest monthly execution rate since 2007. That number includes four women, 12 Afghan nationals, one Jewish person, and a man with intellectual disabilities. Since the start of 2024, more than 850 people have been executed in Iran, surpassing the 2023 numbers. More women have been executed in Iran so far in 2024 than in any year in the past decade. Iran Human Rights founder Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam told The Media Line that Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah played a role in the increasing rate of Iranian executions. 'Since tensions in the region increased, especially after the killing of Nasrallah, we’ve seen a dramatic rise in executions,' he said. 'The regime executed 310 people in two months. Those executed came mostly from marginalized segments of the society and were deprived of fair trial rights.' Only 4% of November’s executions were officially reported by the regime. 'The reports that come out from the Iranian authorities’ side only show a very small part of what is happening,' Amiry-Moghaddam explained. 'For instance, official Iranian media announce between 10% and 20% of all executions. Without our numbers, the execution trends wouldn’t even be visible internationally.' As it stands, the international community is aware of the executions going on in Iran. 'The problem is the willingness to act,' Amiry-Moghaddam said. 'Human rights don’t have a high priority in international politics.' He pointed to indifference regarding state-sanctioned oppression of women as another example of international unconcern for human rights abuses. 'There is no justification for this,' he said. 'The Women, Life, Freedom movement is not just about Iran, it is going against gender apartheid, which has not been recognized internationally as a crime yet.' In September 2023, the Iranian parliament passed a stricter law requiring women to cover their hair and punishing businesses that serve women with uncovered hair. The regime paused the implementation of the law one week ago, in a move analysts say was meant to prevent widespread protests. 'Pragmatically, the regime sees that the backlash of enforcing the law now would be much higher than in 2022, especially since they’ve lost confidence after recent failures and defeats across the region,' Amiry-Moghaddam said. 'Its proxies have suffered major defeats, and the Islamic Republic is weaker than ever. People are aware of it.' Amiry-Moghaddam and his family left Iran in the 1980s. He was just 11 years old when the family fled, first to Pakistan and then to Norway. His parents thought they would be able to return in a few years once things improved, but that hasn’t happened yet. His concern for his countrymen led him to establish Iran Human Rights in 2005 to raise awareness of the regime’s brutality. 'It is very risky work. People inside Iran can be arrested for cooperating with us,' he said. 'They may be accused of espionage, which could result in severe punishment, even death. For this reason, we use secure platforms and anonymous networks to communicate, ensuring that information cannot be traced back to us or our sources.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Being in regular contact with people on the ground sometimes leads him to forget he’s not in Iran, Amiry-Moghaddam. 'Hopefully, even we from the diaspora will be able to go back to our country soon after the regime’s fall, and rebuild everything from scratch,' he said. 'In the meantime, we help from here.' Jeyran and Babak Moghadam are two Iranians who paid the price for trying to protest the regime from within the country. Originally from Tehran, Jeyran had spent years studying in Spain when she was offered a position as Spanish professor at Tehran University in 2014. 'I got into the university system by pretending to align with the regime, but once inside, I worked to help students challenge their oppression. I gave them texts in Spanish regarding the importance of human rights and the fight against dictatorships. Teaching became my way to inspire the younger generation,' she told The Media Line. She even organized illegal gatherings with her students to find ways to fight the regime. One student in her lecture turned out to be a spy, and Jeyran was brought in for questioning by the regime and tortured. 'During interrogations, they threatened me and insulted me for hours,' she said. 'The last time, they locked me in a cell and crushed my hand inside a door. I suffered not only physical but also mental pain. My hand still hurts every time it rains or gets cold. This was my souvenir from the regime.' Her husband, Babak, a pediatrician, also went against the regime on multiple occasions. He organized demonstrations with other doctors and treated injured protesters in their home. 'The regime discovered this, and he was taken many times in for questioning, until one day when he disappeared completely, and I didn’t know what happened to him,' Jeyran said. 'After a week, he came home, and by his face, I could tell he was beaten harshly. He was dumped in the desert, barefoot, and he was forced to walk home. Yet he continued his activism.' Jeyran was offered a teaching position in Germany through a program aimed at hiring professors whose lives are in danger. She left Iran on August 8, 2023, and hasn’t returned since. 'Two years have passed. I believe freedom is near, even though the road ahead will be tough. I hope the people of Iran may kick out the regime, as Syrians recently did.' 'I had to decide immediately, pack my life in weeks, and leave everything behind,' she said. 'My life was at stake in Iran, and I needed to take this opportunity and bring my husband with me.' Babak was set to be arrested again before their flight, and the regime tried to prevent him from leaving the country. Protests broke out at the airport, and he and Jeyran were able to safely board the plane. 'It was a miracle he escaped, but the regime promised that once he sets foot in Iran, he will be arrested for sure,' Jeyran said. The couple have been living in Germany for more than a year now, but both still have family members in Iran. 'My husband received threatening calls while he was staying here and our family members as well,' Jeyran said. 'Despite that, we and our families are all willing to face the consequences to advocate for what is right.' Jeyran entered Germany legally, but her Iranian passport has now expired, and she is unable to request a new one from the regime. 'I am effectively stateless, unable to leave or travel,' she said. In addition, Babak is burdened with the bureaucratic headache of life as a refugee, despite both him and Jeyran having stable jobs. Despite the challenges of life in exile, Jeyran has hope for a better future. 'I gave the regime four to five years when Mahsa Amini’s murder ignited the protests,' Jeyran said. 'Two years have passed. I believe freedom is near, even though the road ahead will be tough. I hope the people of Iran may kick out the regime, as Syrians recently did.'

Images of alleged RPG use by Palestinian security forces in Jenin...	Palestinian Authority denies footage originated in Jenin, claiming such weapons weren't used in their operations; Israeli security reviews suggest otherwise, indicating images likely from Jenin and show weapons seized, not deployed, by PA forces Footage circulating on social media on Monday purportedly shows members of Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces wielding RPG launchers in the Jenin refugee camp as part of an ongoing crackdown on local terror groups. While the PA denied the images were from Jenin, a review by the Israeli security establishment concluded otherwise, indicating that the launchers are likely linked to weapons seized during the PA’s internal campaign rather than arms actively used by the forces. Israeli defense officials are investigating the rare images, which appear to depict a PA special forces operative holding an RPG launcher. Preliminary assessments suggest the weapon has low operational capability and was not used during recent clashes in Jenin. The presence of such weaponry, unprecedented in the West Bank, is considered significant, as similar arms have been smuggled by Iran through the porous border with Jordan. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: PA security forces typically operate with AK-47 rifles, a limited number of machine guns and sniper rifles. Requests to Israel for additional arms have been denied in the past year, despite recommendations from Israeli Central Command to bolster PA forces. Israeli officials speculate the RPG launcher may eventually be handed over to the IDF. A senior PA official denied the authenticity of the images, alleging they were part of an incitement campaign by rivals such as Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad to fuel public opposition to the PA. 'These photos were not taken in Jenin, and PA forces have not used RPGs in the operation,' the official told Ynet. The controversy prompted statements from Israeli regional leaders. Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council, urged immediate military action, saying, 'I demand that the defense minister and prime minister immediately launch a ground operation in Jenin, similar to what was carried out in Gaza and the north, to prevent a repeat of the October 7 scenes in Judea and Samaria and central Israel. 'It is no coincidence that Jenin has become the capital of terror. If the terrorists feel confident enough to brandish RPGs and heavy weapons, it means they are testing us. We must respond with an iron fist to stop this threat to Samaria—and from Samaria to the cities of central Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1nf9zprjx	2024-12-23T08:28:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/rkmwNgPSJl/rkmwNgPSJl_0_578_828_467_0_small.jpg

Two women rebuild community after surviving October 7 kibbutz mas...	After surviving the Be’eri massacre, Adi Weiss and Bar Karbona turned tragedy into action, spearheading efforts to rebuild their community in a new temporary home; their project provides a haven for healing, as they focus on restoring Be’eri and securing the hostages' return Adi Weiss and Bar Karbona are not just two professional, talented women—they are also mothers and survivors of the massacre at Kibbutz Be’eri. Their story, which began in tragedy, has evolved into an inspiring journey of recovery and rebuilding—in every sense of the word. On the morning of October 7, during Simchat Torah and the kibbutz’s communal celebration, Adi, 39, and Bar, 34, woke up to a barrage of rockets and sirens. 'We realized something very unusual was happening,' recalls Bar, who took shelter in the safe room with her partner, Tom, and their infant son, Albi, who had not yet turned one. At the same time, Adi also took refuge in her safe room with her three children, while her partner, Yuval, rushed out to fight the terrorists as part of the Kibbutz's auxiliary squad. For hours, both women were trapped in their safe rooms without food, water, or electricity, while Hamas terrorists tried to break down their doors. Nearby homes burned, and the sounds of automatic gunfire, explosions, and shouting in Arabic surrounded them. By the end of that horrific day, they were rescued but had suffered devastating losses: Bar’s mother-in-law, Galit Karbona, and Adi’s father-in-law and brother-in-law, Mati and Amir Weiss, were brutally murdered. 'When I realized they had been killed,' Adi recounts, 'I tried not to let the kids sense it. I played a game with them called ‘Kva Kva De La Huma’ and told them that Grandpa and Grandma’s batteries had run out.' That night, as the two women fled and walked through the ruins of the kibbutz, they already understood: 'We realized we had nowhere to go back to.' Along with the remaining kibbutz members who had not been murdered or kidnapped, they were evacuated to the Dead Sea. 'Within a week, it became clear to us that we had no home and that we needed to find a temporary place to live for ourselves and our community,' says Adi. 'We didn’t yet know who had been kidnapped or killed, and neither of us had even buried our loved ones, but we understood we had to act,' Bar adds. Bar, an architect by trade, and Adi, a project manager in the planning field, had not been friends and barely knew each other. At the hotel, they connected in what they describe as a 'shared destiny,' joining forces for one mission: finding a new home for their community. Today, after successfully completing the project (led by Yasky Architects) and seeing the residents move into their new homes, they share their story and that of their new living space. 'We didn’t really know each other before,' says Bar, 'but it was through the planning process that we connected. I felt obligated to the kibbutz and my community, based on all the knowledge I had gained.' Adi adds, 'It gave both of us a reason to get up in the morning and cope. It became our psychological therapy. We connected from the very first moment, spending 18 hours a day together.' The two explain: 'We used every connection we had and called every relevant person: the Southern District Planner, the head of the Planning Administration, representatives from the Israel Land Authority, and officials from the Ministry of Construction and Housing. We called everyone and said, ‘You must help us find a place to live.’' After initiating rounds of meetings with various officials, they discovered that Kibbutz Hatzerim, near Be’er Sheva, had already begun work on a new neighborhood. Adi recalls, 'From that moment, without planning or intending to, we found ourselves immersed in the project of our lives. All the experience we had gained and the connections we had made led us to this point—to plan our ‘temporary kibbutz’ in Hatzerim and to begin the restoration of our beloved and beautiful Be’eri, which had been completely destroyed.' Beyond their lobbying efforts, the two actively dove into the project’s plans and began influencing the neighborhood’s design to meet the needs of Be’eri’s residents. They transformed their hotel room at the Dead Sea into an office, opened their laptops, spread out maps of the area, and threw themselves into the task of a lifetime. 'We worked on improving the homes, the living conditions, and the neighborhood, maximizing public buildings and quality of life,' they explain. 'We kept the community updated on the project’s progress and visited the site regularly to ensure everything was moving according to plan. There were many delays in the project, and we had to repeatedly go back to the members and explain why they occurred.' Adi and Bar insisted on the construction of a dental clinic, like the one that had existed in their kibbutz, where five people were murdered. The original clinic is slated for demolition soon. They also influenced the size of the homes, their interior design, outdoor spaces, additional lawns, and even planned a communal garden. 'We wanted to feel as at home as possible,' Adi explains, 'and to have a place for gatherings, events, or even just to have coffee together.' Bar adds, 'We managed to create a sense of home here. After a year in a hotel, we were waiting for this moment. This is what we were looking for. It’s not Be’eri, true, but it’s the space we envisioned to help us move forward from an emotional standpoint.'

From the planning stage to occupancy, there are many obstacles to traverse. 'These are processes that typically take years,' Bar explains, 'sometimes even a decade. Here, everything had to happen as quickly as possible. Every day of delay was another day in a hotel.' For them, this is not just another project—it is, quite literally, the 'project of their lives.' It includes 287 homes in five different sizes, six kindergartens, four educational institutions, a dining hall, offices, a medical clinic, a dental clinic, a clothing warehouse, a local shop, a playground, and a community garden. The two understood that this wasn’t just planning for strangers but for their own friends and community. 'That was the most complex part—our deep personal involvement.' Adi shares, 'Slowly but surely, a neighborhood started to take shape, and suddenly, our kids were riding bikes on the sidewalks again, and families were having picnics on the grass. It’s moving to the point of tears.' They conclude, 'Now that the neighborhood has stabilized and all the members have moved into their homes, it’s time to start working on rebuilding Be’eri. The real recovery can only begin once all the hostages have come home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sjzrqedhyg	2024-12-23T07:24:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/Hkqu0hu8BJl/Hkqu0hu8BJl_0_22_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Stickers across NYC promise free gifts, QR codes redirect to anti...	Campaign spearheaded by BDS activists accuses Israel of war crimes; QR codes on stickers direct users to videos featuring graphic images of injured children in Gaza alongside calls for boycott Fake stickers promoting QR codes promising 'free gifts' have been appearing on the windows of restaurants and stores across New York City. These stickers, emblazoned with enticing offers like free McDonald’s burgers or Starbucks coffee, have instead been redirecting unsuspecting users to graphic videos and incendiary messages targeting Israel. The campaign, spearheaded by activists within the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, accuses Israel of war crimes and encourages boycotts against companies perceived as supportive of the Jewish state. The stickers, which have been sighted on storefronts of major chains such as McDonald’s, Starbucks and Zara in Manhattan, lure passersby with QR codes that claim to unlock exclusive deals. Upon scanning, users are exposed to distressing images of injured Palestinian children accompanied by calls for action against Israel, including demands for boycotts and allegations of complicity in human rights violations. One sticker placed on the window of a McDonald’s in Midtown falsely advertised free food but instead led to a digital flyer accusing the fast-food giant of 'McGenocide' for its alleged provision of meals to the Israel Defense Forces. Similar stickers at Starbucks locations falsely promised free beverages, redirecting users to anti-Israel propaganda videos. The campaign appears to be orchestrated by NJ PalAction, an activist group that has claimed responsibility for placing these stickers on storefronts in 68 locations across Manhattan. 'Curious customers who scan the codes are confronted with horrific images from Gaza where Israel continues to murder, maim, starve and displace Palestinians for over 430 days. They are reminded that these brands are complicit and have no place on this year’s holiday shopping list,' the organization stated on social media. 'No celebration until liberation We call for an immediate arms embargo, an end to the siege on Gaza, and an end to 76 years of dispossession, occupation and apartheid in Palestine by Israel and the U.S.,' the statement also said. In addition to disseminating its message, the group has used social media to encourage supporters to create and distribute these deceptive stickers in their own neighborhoods. It offers downloadable PDFs for at-home printing, contingent on proof of a donation to organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) or the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF). Both organizations have faced scrutiny over alleged ties to extremist groups. Local residents have expressed alarm over the accessibility of these materials to children and the graphic nature of the videos linked through the QR codes.

'It’s nothing less than an act of Jew hatred disguised as political activism.' Beyond the moral outrage, there are also legal questions surrounding the campaign. According to Filitti the stickers not only deface private property but also misuse the intellectual property of major corporations. Companies targeted by the campaign, including Starbucks and McDonald’s, have yet to respond publicly. Filitti emphasized the importance of pursuing legal action against the activist. 'These actions constitute vandalism and the deliberate spreading of disinformation. Companies must hold those responsible accountable in court,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjar5jwh1l	2024-12-23T05:54:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/HyLI00xPHye/HyLI00xPHye_0_84_1242_700_0_small.jpg
Desalination plant, café resort: How IDF prepares for extended st...	The IDF has launched a seawater desalination plant in northern Gaza, producing tens of thousands of liters daily for drinking and bathing—the first of its kind in enemy territory; nearby, a retreat center offers soldiers a café, massages, Internet and hotel-style meals, boosting morale during wartime Adjacent to a newly operational seawater desalination plant designed to serve soldiers in Gaza, the IDF has constructed a small beachfront retreat for its troops. This unique respite, situated amid the devastation of enemy territory, offers soldiers a rare break from their grueling missions in the Gaza Strip. The retreat, established 14 months after the tanks and APCs of the Givati and 401st Armored Brigades first breached Gaza's gates on October 27, 2023, is an impressive haven of civilian-style comfort. Set amidst the rubble of the war-torn region, the complex includes artificial turf surrounded by modern, portable buildings. These spaces offer officers and their subordinates a chance to converse in a relaxed, private setting reminiscent of rear-base training facilities in Israel. Within the facility, soldiers have access to mental health support from counselors and remote consultations with physicians via the Tyto device, as well as on-site care from a nurse and a paramedic. The paramedic, Shami—a 64-year-old reservist and medical assistant at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center—explains, 'We have 99% of the medications they might need here. It works well.' Nearby, a physical therapist provides massages for sore backs and legs, while a mobile dental clinic, staffed by a young dentist and assistant, offers essential care. Throughout the retreat, beanbags are scattered for lounging. One soldier relaxes with an iced energy drink, while another enjoys a hot cappuccino paired with meringue cookies. Soldiers can shower and use pristine restroom facilities that feel 'just like home.' In the center of the green lawn, a long table is laden with lavish breakfasts reminiscent of a hotel buffet. For lunch and dinner, a barbecue station operates nonstop, serving more than the standard wings and hotdogs—steaks and other premium cuts are grilled to perfection. The retreat is adorned with the flags of visiting platoons and battalions, alongside a festive inflatable gateway to welcome each arriving unit. There's even a barber room where soldiers line up for haircuts from a reservist barber who left his business in Be’er Sheva to serve his fellow troops. Additional comforts include a coffee bar with a large espresso machine, popcorn and cotton candy stations, and a lounge offering Belgian waffles and fresh pretzels. For spiritual nourishment, soldiers can visit a corner stocked with religious texts, tefillin sets, and prayer shawls, offered in a welcoming, non-coercive manner. Hygiene kits—including deodorants, toothbrushes, toothpaste, underwear, and socks—are distributed, alongside an area to upgrade personal combat gear like kneepads and gloves. The facility’s recreation area is still a work in progress, as evidenced by the PlayStation corner currently hosting only a demo game. Meanwhile, charging stations are scattered throughout to help soldiers recharge their phones and stay connected with loved ones back home. A separate room houses efficient washing machines and dryers, allowing troops to refresh their uniforms. The crashing waves of the nearby beach provide a soothing backdrop, though soldiers are prohibited from accessing the shoreline, separated by barriers of concertina wire. Despite this, the view of the sea and the retreat's tranquil ambiance offer a much-needed escape. 'We’ve learned to cook for ourselves during combat operations, and we receive fresh meals several times a week,' describes Sergeant Yaron Rabinovitch from the Nahal Brigade’s 50th Battalion. Taking a bite of a hamburger wrap, he adds, 'Each platoon gets a day here about every 10 days. It’s rejuvenating. By the end of the third round, we get a short leave back home. This has been a game-changer.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Brigadier General Haim Malachi, the IDF's Chief Logistics Officer, who escorted me to the site in an armored jeep, shared, 'Once a platoon finishes its day of rest here, we clean and reset the facility overnight for the next group, like a production line. This is something we've never done before.' The logistics team takes pride in their efforts. Chief Warrant Officer David Turjeman, head of food services for the Southern Command, enthusiastically showcases the array of premium refreshments stored in the retreat’s refrigerators. 'You know this is Gaza, right? Yet we’ve created a sense of home here, with iced coffee, espresso, protein shakes, toast, shakshuka, fresh fruit, and even ice cream on warmer days.' The retreat also features a cutting-edge desalination plant, capable of producing 60,000 liters of drinking water daily. 'This is unprecedented in a combat zone,' notes Colonel Michael Azulai, the Southern Command’s logistics officer. 'The facility's deployment reflects our readiness for prolonged operations, even if a ceasefire is reached in the context of a hostage exchange.' On the evening of my visit, a platoon from the Nahal 50th Battalion was enjoying a break after intense fighting in Jabalia. For these troops, this is no quick incursion but part of a sustained military presence. Similar refreshment centers have been established elsewhere along Gaza's key corridors, including on the Philadelphi Route, but none match the scope and quality of this new retreat. Second Lieutenant Elishama Shpilman, a tank commander with the 401st Brigade, describes the improved working conditions: 'Instead of dealing with sand and dust in the field, we now repair tracks and replace parts on a clean, level surface. My team’s tank has covered all of Jabalia.' Sergeant Rabinovitch sums up the sentiment: 'We didn’t get a house, but the food is amazing, and the drinks are great. Last week in Jabalia, we learned to grill on our own. Overall, we’re happy.' His friend, Sergeant Daniel Vakrat, nods in agreement: 'We didn’t expect anything like this. It’s an incredible morale booster.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkxlqywh1x	2024-12-23T05:39:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/SkNh3W0HBJl/SkNh3W0HBJl_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

King Charles to deliver Christmas message from former hospital ch...	King Charles will deliver his traditional Christmas Day message from a former hospital chapel, Buckingham Palace said on Monday, in a break from tradition and a nod to the British monarch's ongoing treatment for cancer. In February, the palace revealed the 76-year-old, who became king in 2022, had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer detected in tests after a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate. Last week, a palace source said his treatment was moving in a positive direction and would continue into next year. For his annual pre-recorded Christmas Day broadcast to be aired on Wednesday, Charles has selected the Fitzrovia Chapel, an ornate former church on the site of a former hospital in central London. Last year, Charles delivered his message from Buckingham Palace. The Daily Telegraph, which had earlier learned of the location, reported that Charles himself had chosen the chapel as he faced his own health issues. A source told the paper the monarch wanted his message to feel fresher and more modern.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1m7fyvs1e	2024-12-23T04:45:07-08:00

After losing Syria, Iran is considering turning Beirut into a 'sm...	An anonymous source 'familiar with discussions in Tehran' warns in the London Times that the Islamic Republic is exploring the possibility of smuggling weapons to Hezbollah through the Lebanese capital's airport, a move that could lead to the collapse of the cease-fire Following the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, Iran is now considering turning Beirut International Airport into its new smuggling hub and thus supplying weapons to Hezbollah by air, the Times of London reported Monday. According to the newspaper, the report is based on a Middle Eastern source 'familiar with discussions taking place in Tehran.' Iran was for years Syrian dictator Bashar Assad 's main ally, along with Russia, and in exchange for sending weapons and militias to help him suppress the rebels during the civil war Damascus allowed Tehran to operate freely on its territory, both to smuggle weapons to Hezbollah and to directly attack Israel from Syrian territory. Now that Assad's opponents control Damascus, and rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani promises that his country will no longer be a 'threat' to its neighbors and will not allow any non-state entity to possess weapons, Tehran has lost a critical supply route for its Shiite militia in Lebanon. The Times of London notes that flights from Tehran's international airport to Beirut resumed a few days ago, but they no longer pass through Syrian airspace. The source who spoke to the British newspaper said that Western countries 'are concerned that, having lost Damascus as its main transit point in the region for arms smuggling, it will now try to turn Beirut airport into its new logistics center, just as it did in Syria.' The source warned that such a move 'could lead to the next escalation,' and the Times noted that it would be a violation of the cease-fire agreement recently signed between Israel and Hezbollah. The Times notes, however, that a bold step such as transferring weapons to Hezbollah through Beirut airport, an act that would mean taking over Lebanon's largest civilian airport, or alternatively by sea, would involve too great a risk for Hezbollah and Iran in their current situation, after the blows they have suffered not only militarily but also in terms of image and politics. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry stated Monday morning that Tehran supports Syria's sovereignty after the fall of Assad, and emphasized that Iran currently has no direct contact with the country's new rulers. 'Our principled position regarding Syria is clear,' he said, 'and it is the need to preserve its sovereignty and integrity and allow the Syrian people to determine their future without foreign interference.' At the same time, the ministry spokesman emphasized that Syria must not become a 'den of terror.' The Iranian spokesman warned against U.S. intervention in Syria, saying that its intervention in the affairs of other countries has in the past only led to division, terrorism and undermining stability and security Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The Americans' latest statements regarding Syria reveal their intentions to control and interfere in countries. The Syrian people are capable of making decisions for themselves and determining the future of their country and its relations with other countries,' he said. At the same time, the Russian news agency Tass reported Monday morning that an official Russian delegation, led by deputy prime ministers Alexei Overchuk and Vitaly Savelev arrived in Tehran for a visit. According to the report, during the visit they will meet with anian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The delegation's visit comes against the backdrop of intensified military cooperation between the two countries, which is reflected, among other things, in the mass of drones that Tehran has supplied to Moscow for its war in Ukraine, but also the severe strategic blow they suffered with the fall of the Assad regime.

Assad's wife 'did not ask for a divorce', Russia asserts	Turkish media reports that Russia has frozen Assad's assets and restricted his movements, and this led his wife to file an official divorce petition wit the court in a bid to leave for Britain; Kremlin strongly rejects the report: They 'do not correspond to reality' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied on Monday reports that the wife of fugitive Syrian dictator Bashar Assad has filed for divorce and is leaving Russia for London, and that Russian authorities have imposed travel restrictions on him and frozen his assets. At a press conference Monday morning, Peskov said that these reports 'do not correspond to reality.' Russia, was Assad's main ally, and in the middle of the last decade it mobilized to help his regime through a bombing campaign that seemed to have subdued the rebels and secured the dictator's future. When Assad's opponents launched a surprise attack on his forces last month, this time while Russia was mired in the war in Ukraine, Moscow failed to save him again, and at the last minute it evacuated him to its territory through its air force base in western Syria. Russian President Vladimir Putin later granted political asylum to him, his wife Asma, and their three children – sons Hafez, 24, and Karim, 21, and daughter Zain, 22. On Sunday, Turkish media reported that, although the Syrian dictator has been granted asylum in Moscow, he is under close surveillance by the authorities there and is prohibited from leaving the Russian capital or engaging in any political activity. The reports also claimed that Assad's extensive assets have been frozen by the Russian government, a fact that further harms his quality of life and that of his family. Against this backdrop, Turkish media reported, Asma Assad filed a formal request with a Russian court to divorce her husband, leave the country and travel to her homeland, Britain. Asma Assad holds British citizenship, and only moved to Syria in 2000, when she married the dictator, a few months after he came to power. At a press conference Monday morning, the Kremlin spokesman denied all these reports. After the overthrow of Assad's regime earlier this month, foreign media reported that the U.S. State Department estimated that the fortune of the ousted president and his wife was around $2 billion, spread across a variety of bank accounts, shell companies, tax havens and real estate ventures across the globe, so it is likely that they still have access to vast sums of money. In addition, it was reported that Assad's extended family owns at least 20 apartments in Moscow, and that their net worth is close to $40 million. The reports in Turkey raise the question of whether his access to money and assets is now blocked, and where exactly he is staying in the Russian capital. The move to Russia comes at a difficult time for the Assad family, not only because of the humiliating escape from Syria. In May of this year, Asma announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer for a second time, this time leukemia, and that she would be required to isolate herself and absent from events and activities. Her announcement comes almost five years after she announced that she had recovered from breast cancer, a disease that the Arab world followed closely during her illness. Some are now wondering whether Asma Assad will receive her treatments in Russia. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last week, after more than eight days of silence, the ousted dictator Assad made his first official statement about his whereabouts in Russia. A message posted on his office's Telegram channel claimed that he had not fled Syria at all, but had first tried to travel to the Syrian city of Latakia to 'monitor the fighting from there,' and that he had been forced to evacuate to Russia only because there was no way to leave the attacked Russian air base where he was staying, and because an order had come from Moscow to evacuate people from the facility. In a statement he issued, Assad emphasized that he was the man who, from the first day of the Syrian civil war, 'refused to negotiate to save his country for personal gain or to compromise on the future of his people,' and that just as he ' never abandoned the resistance in Palestine and Lebanon and did not betray the allies who stood by me, there is no chance that such a man would abandon his people or betray the army and his country.' In his statement, he claimed that, by supporting his opponents, the world was in effect presenting terrorists as a revolutionary movement that was vying for his favor, and expressed hope 'that Syria would once again be free and independent.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj4mm6lrke	2024-12-23T02:17:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/07/HyPrSx1141l/HyPrSx1141l_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

Biden commutes sentences of 37 of 40 inmates on federal death row	U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday commuted the sentences for 37 out of 40 federal inmates on death row, converting them to life in prison without parole before he hands over power to President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20. Biden's move will frustrate Trump's plan to resume a rapid pace of executions. Unlike executive orders, clemency decisions cannot be reversed by a president's successor, although the death penalty can be sought more aggressively in future cases. Trump restarted federal executions after a nearly 20-year pause during his first term in office from 2017 to 2021. Biden, who ran for president opposing the death penalty, put federal executions on hold when he took office in January 2021. In recent weeks, he has faced pressure from congressional Democrats, opponents of capital punishment and religious leaders such as Pope Francis to commute federal death sentences before he leaves. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden said in a statement. 'But guided by my conscience and my experience ... I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level,' he said. 'In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryhiw68rye	2024-12-23T01:55:15-08:00	
South Korea says sees signs of North Korea preparing more troops,...	South Korea's military said on Monday it has detected signs of North Korea preparing to send more troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Pyongyang has already provided 240mm multiple rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled howitzers to Russia, and was seen preparing to produce more suicide drones to be shipped there after leader Kim Jong Un guided a test last month, according to Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). 'Suicide drones are one of the tasks that Kim Jong Un has focused on,' a JCS official said, adding that the North had expressed its intention to give them to Russia. Such drones have been widely used in the Ukraine war, and Kim ordered a mass production of the aerial weapons and an update of military theory and education, citing intensifying global competition, state media reported. Seoul, Washington and Kyiv have said there are around 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia. The JCS said at least 1,100 of them had been killed or wounded, in line with last week's briefing by South Korea's spy agency which reported some 100 deaths with another 1,000 wounded in the Kursk region.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ppe6urke	2024-12-23T01:53:29-08:00	
Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq agree to stop attacking Israel, a se...	Iraq's pro-Iranian militia Al-Nujaba Movement has reached an agreement with the Iraqi prime minister to halt military operations against Israel, according to a report in Lebanon; 'The resistance will stop operations in support of Gaza and will not interfere in political changes in Syria' a senior militia official explained. Iraq's pro-Iranian militia Al-Nujaba Movement has reached an agreement with Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani to cease military operations against Israel, according to a report Monday in the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, affiliated with Hezbollah, citing a senior militia official. 'The resistance will stop military operations against Israel as part of its support for Gaza and will not interfere in political changes in Syria,' the senior official said. This came as part of a dialogue between the two sides, against the backdrop of regional and international demands to disband the militias and hand over their weapons to the state, according to the news report. The same official said that 'the factions have decided not to interfere in Syrian affairs and to monitor the situation from a distance while also awaiting the policy directions of US President-elect Donald Trump, particularly regarding the Middle East and Iran.' He added that Tehran gave them the freedom to decide regarding the Syrian arena. Since the outbreak of the war on October 7, 2023, the pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, which are in very close contact with Hezbollah, have attacked Israel and began to accept responsibility for firing into its territory - as they saw themselves as another front in the Iranian axis fighting Israel 'in support of Gaza.' Even after the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect about a month ago, elements of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an organization made up of pro-Iranian militias, announced that they would continue their military activity against Israel and said that they had nothing to do with the cease-fire in Lebanon. 'At the last meeting of the resistance, it was agreed to continue attacks against Israel until it completely stops its attacks on Gaza and stops threatening to attack Iraq,' the sources said. The Islamic Resistance in Iran is a relatively new union operating over the last year, made up of several veteran militias supported by Iran: Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq, Al-Nujaba, Ansar Allah al-Awfiya and Al-Imam Ali. A trickle of drones and missiles from Iraq and Syria has been recorded in the past year, and the organization has been known to publish claims of responsibility for attacks on Israel, whether using missiles or drones, and has sometimes also published videos of the launches. There have been many times that drones fired from Iraq did not reach Israel at all, other times they were intercepted; but when they did hit they caused casualties. In October, Sgt. Daniel Aviv Haim Sofer, 19, and Corporal Tal Dror, 19, were killed in a strike by such a drone. The Iraqi government, for its part, has worked to avoid being drawn into the regional conflict, but has failed to deal with the attacks being carried out from its territory and to rein in the militias. Baghdad even turned to Washington last month, asking the Americans to intervene with Israel to prevent a response to the attacks. 'Washington was aware of the possible consequences of Israeli attacks in Iraq and promised to help,' said an Iraqi Foreign Ministry official. Four militia sources said at the time that the Hezbollah Iraqi and Al-Nujaba Brigades, two organizations within the coalition that are leading the attacks on Israel, warned Prime Minister Al-Sudani not to pressure them to stop their operations, and pledged to continue as long as Israel continues to fight in Gaza and Lebanon. The issue has created divisions among the parties in Iraq’s ruling coalition, which all support the Palestinian struggle and see Israel as an enemy, but disagree about the extent of Iraq’s involvement in the regional conflict. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has not only acted against Israel, the U.S. forces operating in bases in Iraq and Syria are another of its targets. The pro-Iranian militias are interested in removing the United States from Iraq and, in recent months, reports have also been published about progress in talks between the United States and the Iraqi government regarding the date for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country. It is not clear how true the reports are on the subject, or whether they are merely intended to calm the militias, who threaten to escalate their activities against the Americans whenever they see no progress. The organization is attacking the American bases, it claims, also because of the U.S. assistance to Israel in the Iron Swords war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkpqw2lskl	2024-12-23T01:50:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/24/Sk0sMDgRR/Sk0sMDgRR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Huge deal: Israel sells air defense system to Slovakia for 2 bill...	Barak MX Integrated Air Defense System, produced by Israel Aerospace Industries, counters threats from fighter jets, helicopters, drones and missiles; It's the largest deal ever signed between the two countries The Ministry of Defense is selling the BARAK MX Integrated Air Defense System, produced by Israel Aerospace Industries, to Slovakia for over 2 billion NIS (approximately $550 million). This is the largest defense export deal ever between the two countries. The deal, led by the Defense Exports Control Agency at the International Defense Cooperation Directorate of the Ministry of Defense (SIBAT), 'will further strengthen the bond between the two nations and enhance Slovakia's defense capabilities,' the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The BARAK MX system, which will be integrated into Slovakia's defense infrastructure, is an advanced air defense system that is designed to counter current and future aerial threats, including ballistic threats. Its operational success in Israel and around the world underscores its reliability and effectiveness, making it a valuable addition to Slovakia's defense infrastructure, according to the ministry. The system is known for its flexible capability to counter threats from various sources, including fighter jets, helicopters, UAVs, cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles. With three interceptors for operational ranges of 35, 70, and 150 km, each equipped with an active radar seeker, dual-pulse engine, and powerful warhead, the system delivers unparalleled interception performance against a wide range of threats. The deal was led by the head of SIBAT, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Yair Kulas, CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Boaz Levy, and Executive VP of Systems, Missiles, and Space Group at IAI, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Guy Barlev. It was signed on Monday by Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir at the Ministry’s headquarters in Tel Aviv During the current war, Israel has sold weapons to the world worth 13 billion shekels. The volume of Israel's defense exports has doubled within five years, making Israel is one of the 10 largest arms exporters in the world, a list led by the United States.

According to the report, Beirut could become a hub for weapons shipments to terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. This is due to the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, which effectively cut off the land supply route for the Shiite terrorist organization. Direct flights from Tehran to Beirut resumed in recent days, but so far do not pass through Syrian airspace.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk7awjls1g	2024-12-22T23:40:52-08:00	
Shock in New York: Man sets passenger who fell asleep on subway t...	Man caught on video 'calmly' walking toward a woman who was dozing in a subway car and set her on fire; He then sat on a bench across the street and watched the scene; Boys recognized him hours later and the man, identified as an immigrant from Guatemala, was arrested New York City police announced Sunday they have in custody a 'person of interest' in the early morning death of a woman who they believe may have fallen asleep on a stationary subway train before being intentionally lit on fire by a man she didn’t know. Transit police apprehended the suspect, identified as an immigrant from Guatemala who came to the U.S. in 2018, after receiving a report from three high school students who had recognized the man. They had seen images of the suspect taken from surveillance and police body cam video and widely distributed by police. 'New Yorkers came through again,' said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who described the case as 'one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.' Tisch said the suspect and the woman, both of whom have not been identified, were riding a subway train without any interaction between them to the end of the line in Brooklyn at around 7:30 a.m. After the train came to a stop, surveillance video from the subway car showed the man 'calmly' walk up to the victim, who was seated motionless, possibly sleeping, and set her clothing on fire with what appeared to be a lighter. The woman’s clothing then 'became fully engulfed in a matter of seconds,' Tisch said. Officers on a routine patrol at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station smelled and saw smoke and discovered the woman on fire, standing in the middle of the subway car. After the fire was extinguished, emergency medical personnel declared the woman dead at the scene. Unbeknownst to the officers, the suspect had remained at the scene and was seated on a bench on the subway platform, just outside the train car, Tisch said. Body cameras worn by the officers caught a 'very clear, detailed look' at the suspect and those images were publicly disseminated. After later receiving a 911 call from the teenagers, other transit officers identified the man on another subway train and radioed ahead to the next station, where more officers kept the train doors closed, searched each car and ultimately apprehended him without incident, said Chief of Transit Joseph Gulotta. The man had a lighter in his pocket when he was taken into custody, Tisch said. Gulotta said the investigation was continuing, including whether the woman was homeless and the background of the suspect. The case marked the second fatality on a New York subway Sunday. At 12:35 a.m., police responded to an emergency call for an assault in progress at the 61st Street-Woodside Station in Queens and found a 37-year-old man with a stab wound to his torso and a 26-year-old man with multiple slashes throughout his body. The older man was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital while the younger man was in stable condition, police said. An investigation was continuing. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul this year has sent New York National Guard members to the city’s subway system to help police conduct random searches of riders’ bags for weapons following a series of high-profile crimes on city trains. Hochul recently deployed additional members to help patrol during the holiday season. About a year ago, Hochul supported funding to install video cameras on every train car in the New York subway system, said Michael Kemper, chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He and other officials on Sunday credited the cameras with helping to track down the suspect so quickly. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The fact that the alleged killer is a Guatemalan immigrant who, according to local media, entered the country in 2018 is expected to further inflame the debate over the issue of immigrants, one of the most charged political issues in the United States. President-elect Donald Trump has been promising his voters for years to stop the flow of illegal infiltrators into the country, and during his election campaign he vowed to carry out the 'largest deportation of immigrants in history.' Throughout the campaign, he and his supporters highlighted murders and rapes committed by immigrants, including that of Laken Riley , a 22-year-old student from Georgia who was murdered by a Venezuelan immigrant. The New York City subway system sees about 4 million ridership trips each day, and while crime is relatively rare, horrific murders occur every year. As of November 2024, there have been nine murders on the New York City subway system this year, compared to five during the same period last year. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjfgp9uhkl	2024-12-22T23:38:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/SkWPr5IByg/SkWPr5IByg_51_33_2129_1198_0_small.jpg

IDF prepares to stay on Syrian Mount Hermon for the whole winter	Military constructing bases at two elevations on Syrian soil, incorporating hypothermia treatment rooms and reinforced structures to withstand heavy snow loads; Teams working urgently to complete the bases before the first snowstorm hits The IDF is in the midst of an intricate logistical operation, racing against the clock to establish military outposts at high altitudes on Mount Hermon before the arrival of the season’s first snowstorm, according to a report on Monday. The IDF’s Technological and Logistics Directorate has opened access routes to the Syrian summit, facilitating the transport of tons of construction materials and equipment. According to the plan, the IDF will maintain a military presence on Syrian Mount Hermon – which borders Lebanon – at least until the end of the current winter. Two primary outposts are being constructed on Syrian soil. The first, located at an elevation of 2,400 meters (7,874 feet), will feature specially reinforced modular buildings designed to house troops even under snow accumulations of up to six meters (nearly 20 feet). At 2,800 meters (9,186 feet), near the peak of Syrian Mount Hermon, another base is being prepared. This new site will serve as a hub for IDF forces and is modeled after a Syrian military outpost abandoned by Assad regime troops approximately two weeks ago. IDF logistics teams are renovating the compound, cleaning, painting, repairing infrastructure and equipping it with essential facilities, including communications systems, living quarters, food storage containers and a massive water tank capable of holding 20,000 liters. To combat freezing conditions, specialized de-icing systems are being installed to ensure military equipment and tools remain operational in subzero temperatures. The IDF also plans to deploy a newly acquired snow-melting machine, a technique inspired by foreign armies operating in similar extreme conditions. The goal is to sustain both operational and logistical functionality in temperatures as low as -10°C (14°F), even under a potential prolonged supply cutoff due to severe weather. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: To meet these demands, the IDF’s Logistics Brigade has dispatched teams from its Southern and Central commands to Syrian Mount Hermon. Working around the clock, including night shifts, the teams are reinforcing critical structures to withstand the heavy weight of snow accumulation. Additionally, the IDF is equipping the outposts with hypothermia treatment rooms to provide swift and effective care to soldiers without requiring evacuation. Kitchens, gas cylinders for on-site cooking, and an ample stockpile of dry, frozen and canned food are being prepared to ensure readiness for any prolonged isolation scenario. A broader winter preparedness initiative is already underway for troops in the Golan Heights, recently captured by the IDF. Thousands of specialized cold-weather items, including ski masks, snow boots, three sets of thermal uniforms, insulated overalls and tactical gloves, are being distributed to soldiers. For accommodations, the IDF has opted to station troops in fortified outposts, supplementing them with portable living containers equipped with heating and generators to ensure comfort in harsh conditions. As the operation unfolds, the IDF remains focused on completing these critical preparations before the region’s weather deteriorates further, safeguarding both the operational effectiveness and welfare of its soldiers in this strategic, high-altitude terrain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjryhyubyx	2024-12-22T22:33:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/yk14196271/yk14196271_0_84_946_532_0_small.jpg

Mossad agents reveal details of exploding pager operation against...	Now they'll have to guess what the next step is'; Two recently retired Mossad agents gave a behind-the-scenes look at the operation that sent thousands of Hezbollah operatives tot he hospital in an interview on the US investigative news magazine '60 Minutes'; 'We created a pretend world' Two recently retired senior Israeli intelligence agents shared new details about a deadly clandestine operation years in the making that targeted Hezbollah terrorist operatives in Lebanon and Syria using exploding pagers and walkie talkies. The former Mossad agents appeared overnight between Sunday and Monday on the CBS investigative news magazine '60 Minutes' to provide behind-the-scenes information about Operation Pager, that ended three months ago by causing injuries to thousands of Hezbollah operatives. Journalist Lesley Stahl held one of the alleged pagers prepared by the Mossad during the interview. The agents, who according to the network were among those who led the operation, spoke to her masked, their voices distorted, and described how they carried out the operation that began a decade ago - first by selling thousands of walkie-talkies to the organization and then pagers, all of which were planted with explosives. The Mossad began the operation based on walkie-talkies, with the idea that Hezbollah operatives would carry them in their vests - close to their chest and heart. One of the agents, using the pseudonym 'Michael,' said that Hezbollah had purchased 16,000 devices manufactured by the Mossad 'at a good price.' 'We created a pretend world,' said the officer. 'We are a global production company. We write the screenplay, we're the directors, we're the producers, we're the main actors, and the world is our stage. He noted that the price 'couldn't be too low or they'd be suspicious.' The Mossad also had to conceal its involvement in the sale and ensure that the radios could not be linked to Israel, so shell companies were set up to infiltrate the supply chain. As the use of these types of radios became less common, the agents said, the operation to distribute another, more advanced device began. The intelligence organization discovered that Hezbollah was buying pagers from a Taiwanese company called Gold Apollo, which was unaware of the explosives being inserted into the devices. The second agent, who went by the pseudonym 'Gabriel,' told of the day he presented the pager to Mossad head Dedi Barnea - one that had been enlarged to accommodate explosives. 'He was furious, he was telling us, 'There is no chance that anyone will buy such a big device. It's not comfortable in their pocket. It's heavy,'' he said. Barnea sent 'Gabriel' to redesign it, but eventually the second agent convinced the Mossad head that it would work and the device would be purchased as is. The Mossad hired the marketing manager of Gold Apollo to offer Hezbollah an upgrade to the existing devices. 'When they are buying from us, they have zero clue that they are buying from the Mossad. We make like 'Truman Show,' everything is controlled by us behind the scene. In their experience, everything is normal. Everything was 100% kosher including businessman, marketing, engineers, showroom, everything,' according to Gabriel. By September 2024, Hezbollah had already purchased about 5,000 pagers. 'We have an incredible array of possibilities of creating foreign companies that have no way being traced back to Israel. Shell companies over shell companies to affect the supply chain to our favor,' said agent Michael. The devices were advertised as high-end products, with upgrades, new features, and water resistance. For marketing purposes, fake YouTube advertisements were created, showing the device in a glass of water, covered in soil, and they were touted as having a very long battery life. 'It become the best product in the beeper area in the world,' said Gabriel. Stahl asked if they had been approached by other customers, not just from Hezbollah. Gabriel said that the shell company received several requests from potential customers. 'Obviously we didn't send to anyone. We just quote them with expensive price,' he said. The Mossad conducted experiments on dummies wearing padded gloves, in order to plan the amount of explosives that would only harm the person carrying the pager and not those around them, according to Gabriel, who emphasized that the plan was meant to harm only Hezbollah members and not anyone near them. The devices had no intelligence capabilities and could not be used for surveillance, only as small bombs. This is a very stupid device by nature. This is the reason they're using it. There's almost no way how to tap it. It's only receiving messages and-- several grams of explosive,' Gabriel explained. The agents said the Mossad looked at several options for the pager’s ringtones. They wanted to find a sound that would compel the owner of the device to take it out of his pocket. The intelligence agency also looked at how long it took a person to answer a pager, finding it to be an average of seven seconds. The person who gave the order to carry out the operation on September 17 was the head of the Mossad, Barnea, after learning that Hezbollah might be suspicious of the devices. In total, the explosion of the pagers and radios killed about 30 people, including two children, and injured about 3,000. Two days after the pager attack, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed on September 27, gave a speech that 60 minutes described as 'subdued,' in contrast to his other speeches. 'If you look at his eyes, he was defeated. He already lose the war. And his soldier look at him during that speech. And they saw a broken leader. And this was the tipping point of the war,' agent Gabriel said. The retired Mossad agent also said that some of the people who were close to Nasrallah in the bunker were carrying the beepers on the day of the attack. According to him, 'With his in own eyes, he saw them collapsing.' The interviewer asked in response: 'How do you know?' Gabriel replied: 'It's a strong rumor.' The agents were asked if the Mossad plan had achieved its goal. 'The aim, it wasn't killing Hezbollah terrorists,' Gabriel explains. 'If he just dead, so he's dead. But if he's wounded, you have to take him to the hospital, take care of him. You need to invest money and efforts. And those people without hands and eyes are living proof, walking in Lebanon, of 'don't mess with us.' They are walking proof of our superiority all around the Middle East.' The day after the pagers exploded, people were afraid to turn on the air conditioners in Lebanon because they were afraid that they would explode. So there was-- there is real fear,' agent Michael noted. We want them to feel vulnerable, which they are. We can't use the pagers again because we already did that. We've already moved on to the next thing. And they'll have to keep on trying to guess what the next thing is.' 'Michael' said that, following the operation, 'the wind was taken out of Hezbollah's fight,' and expressed hope that the situation in Lebanon will influence Hamas and the release of the hostages in Gaza. 'They're looking at their sides and they're seeing no one next to them. They are completely isolated now.'

In the program's promo, it was noted that it was one of the 'largest operations in contemporary history,' in which 'an intelligence organization achieves the feat of an entire army.' The pager operation was launched on September 17, amid fears that it would soon be discovered. On the first day of the operation, the pagers of Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon and Syria exploded - and the next day, on September 18, their walkie-talkies also exploded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwwt00isyg	2024-12-22T22:00:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/HkSJFnWH1g/HkSJFnWH1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

What about Syria? The hypocrisy behind the world’s selective outr...	Comment: If you remained silent on Assad’s torture you are hypocritical and racist Following the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, new evidence of his crimes against humanity is coming to light—evidence that should prompt anyone with a moral conscience to ask: Why didn’t we do more? While the international media, human rights groups, and the UN focused their criticism on Israel during the Gaza war, the atrocities committed by Assad were largely ignored. It seems the absence of Jewish involvement meant there was little coverage: 'No Jews, no news.' The Scale of Devastation Since the Syrian Civil War began in 2011, more than 6 million Syrians have been displaced, and over 580,000 have been killed. Among the victims were 4,000 Palestinians from the Yarmouk refugee camp, which Assad attacked, displacing 100,000 more. Where were the emergency UN sessions on the plight of these Palestinians? Where were the campus protests, 24/7 media coverage, or marches against this mass slaughter of Arabs? Chemical Weapons and Torture Assad’s regime violated international law by repeatedly using chemical weapons such as mustard gas, chlorine gas, and sarin gas against civilians. The regime also operated over 100 detention centers, holding hundreds of thousands of prisoners in inhumane conditions. In Sednaya Prison, known as the 'slaughterhouse,' detainees endured mass executions, electrocution, whipping, rape, mutilation, and sleep deprivation. Women who were raped were forced to give birth and raise their children in prison cells—children who had never seen sunlight until a few weeks ago. Today, countless Syrians remain missing, and mass graves, including graves holding over 100,000 victims, are still being discovered. The UN’s Response The UN has long been aware of these crimes. Despite evidence of chemical weapons use and other atrocities, in 2022, the UN Human Rights Council praised Assad’s human rights record. Between 2015 and 2022, the UN General Assembly passed 125 resolutions condemning Israel, compared to just nine against Syria. Incredibly, days before Assad’s fall, the UN demanded that Israel return the Golan Heights to his regime. All the while, Assad’s government held a position within the UN responsible for upholding human rights. Silence from Human Rights Groups and Media Early in the civil war, organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International addressed the situation in Syria. However, they have since shifted focus, channeling significant resources into campaigns labeling Israel an apartheid state or accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Amnesty International even invented a new definition of genocide solely to smear Israel. The media’s performance has been no better. Assad’s crimes received relatively little coverage compared to the intense scrutiny placed on Israel during the Gaza war, even as thousands of Arabs languished in Assad’s prisons. The Hypocrisy of Selective Outrage While the UN and media consistently scrutinize Israel, Assad was allowed to commit atrocities without accountability. If you remained silent on Assad’s torture and slaughter of Arabs throughout his rule but express outrage over Israel’s legal actions in Gaza, conducted in accordance with international law, then your stance is not pro-Palestinian or anti-war—it is simply hypocritical and racist.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy11ugw8byg	2024-12-22T19:17:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/BJsW11cMNyg/BJsW11cMNyg_0_194_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Guatemalan authorities raid Lev Tahor Cult, rescue 160 children f...	There is suspicion of possible crimes of human trafficking and other offences,' according to the regional prosecutor Guatemalan authorities raided the Lev Tahor community over the weekend, rescuing 160 children and teens following allegations of rape, human trafficking, forced marriage, and other forms of abuse. Lev Tahor, known as an extremist Jewish cult, was founded in 1988 in Israel and settled in Guatemala between 2014 and 2017. The operation was supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which had been assisting Guatemalan authorities in their investigation since the escape of four minors in November. 'There is suspicion of possible crimes of human trafficking and other offences, specifically in the form of forced pregnancy, abuse against minors, and rape,' said regional prosecutor Dimas Jimenez. 'It is suspected that these crimes were committed by a member of the community called Lev Tahor against minors belonging to that community.' Authorities also reported finding suspected remains of a child on the premises during the raid. In addition to the children, 40 women were rescued. The operation involved dozens of police officers and social workers. Lev Tahor has a long history of legal trouble. In 2021, two cult leaders were convicted in New York for kidnapping and child sexual exploitation. In 2022, the cult’s leader was arrested in Mexico, and children were rescued from the group’s compound. This latest intervention highlights ongoing international efforts to dismantle Lev Tahor’s network and protect vulnerable individuals from exploitation.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syv5evib1g	2024-12-22T19:04:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/rJsVWw8SJx/rJsVWw8SJx_1_60_801_451_0_small.jpg
People in the media often message me saying, 'That was amazing—I...	Australian journalist Erin Molan has emerged as a powerful voice for Israel; speaking to Ynetnews, she shares about the impact of the October 7 Hamas attack on her life and the challenges of countering distorted media narratives; 'They're scared that they might get threats—I'm much more worried about a world that allows terrorism to flourish' Amid rising anti-Israel sentiment in the global media, one voice has stood out: Erin Molan, a former Australian sports journalist turned advocate for truth and justice. Molan, who is visiting Israel for the first time, has emerged as a staunch defender of the country, challenging global narratives with clarity and conviction, often at great personal cost. Molan, best known in Australia as the first woman to host the Footy Show and a prominent figure in sports media, had little prior connection to Israel or its politics. 'I had to ask someone what the kippah was called just two months ago,' she admitted in an interview with Ynetnews. 'I have no association or affiliation, I have no bias, I have no agenda, I'm not Jewish, I'm not from Israel. Anything that you could possibly think of to come at me with won't work. I am an Australian who's never been here before. Now I have a lot of Jewish friends, but before October 7, I had one school mom friend, and I really didn't know anyone else in the Jewish community that well. What I do is speak the truth, and I stand up for what is right. It blows my mind that the rest of the world doesn't see it as clearly as I do, and it scares me as well.' Her advocacy began after the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel which left over 1,200 people and saw 251 people taken hostage, sparking the ongoing war against the terrorist group in the Gaza Strip. The horrors of that day resonated deeply with Molan, who saw parallels with her late father, Major General Jim Molan, a highly respected Australian military leader and former senator who passed away months before the Hamas onslaught. She describes waking up in the middle of that fateful night with her young daughter beside her, the horrifying news of the Hamas attacks in Israel compelled her to do something she hadn’t done since losing her father earlier that year—she reached for the phone to call him. 'I don't really believe in spirituality or signs or anything like that, but Dad was this incredible ally of Israel,' Molan shared. 'He came to Israel many times, and after my editorials started going viral, my mom sent me this screenshot. Dad had come to Israel in 2014 to investigate the war [Operation Protective Edge] and the headline of his investigation with a bunch of foreign retired generals was 'They put us to shame in how they conduct warfare.' As one of Australia’s most experienced military leaders, having commanded forces in Iraq and East Timor, his unwavering moral compass left an indelible mark on his daughter. 'Even when he was fighting ISIS or al-Qaeda, we would say to him as kids, 'Why do you have to follow the rules when they don't?' and Dad would say, 'if we don't follow the rules and stand up for what we believe in, what's the point? What are we fighting for? We're fighting to protect what we believe in, and if we stoop to their level, if we do what they do, if we throw away what matters to us, then there's no point. We might as well not even fight to save anything because we don't have anything.'' With her father’s principles in mind, Molan examined the events of October 7 and Israel’s response, leaving no doubt in her mind. 'There are enough experts in the world who also have no agenda who say that when it comes to minimizing civilian casualties, Israel does it almost better than anyone else in the world,' she said. 'I feel so sorry for a country that has had some of the most appalling things in the world done to it. The depravity, the evil, the horror of it, and I look at a reaction of a world that should be saying, 'What can we do to help you?' Instead, the world went, 'How can we make this your fault? How can we condemn you?' And that's crazy,' Molan said. Molan’s clear-eyed assessment and her willingness to speak out set her apart from other journalists in Australia and globally, but she also revealed a sobering reality about her industry. 'I know for a fact that a lot of people in the media will send me messages who are on different networks and who host different shows and say, 'That was amazing what you said, I wish I could do that too.' I think a lot of people are scared about the reaction,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'They're scared that they might get threats as well, they're scared that they might lose contracts or lose jobs, they're worried about polarizing themselves. I'm much more worried about a world that allows terrorism to flourish than I am about anything personal. You can have everything in the world, but if terrorism is allowed to continue at the trajectory it's going with the support of seemingly the masses in the world, particularly young people, we are completely screwed. Nothing else matters.' After her first editorial condemning the October 7 Hamas attacks, Molan said she was unprepared for the wave of backlash that followed. Molan had previously faced threats during her career as a sports broadcaster, but the response to her pro-Israel stance was on 'another level.' 'I was the first woman to host football and sport, so you can imagine some of the awful things that I would get online—people threatened to rape my unborn child, to kill me—utterly ridiculous,' she shares. 'I could never have imagined it would be so bad that I would need a police escort to go to work. I needed to give my six-year-old daughter to her father for a period of time because there were so many random but really specific death threats. There were ones about my daughter's preschool, there were ones about 'I know you go to this area, I know you live here.' I went to the police and these weren't considered to just be idiots in their mom's basements sending messages. There were pretty serious players in this space.' Family and friends suggested she avoid the topic altogether for her own safety, but Molan stood firm. 'That's not me. I'm not capable of that. I have this kind of perspective and mentality with anything—pick your hard,' she explained. 'I look at this as choosing the hard of speaking out now with the chance that it might make a difference, it might help in some tiny way to shift the narrative, which in turn will help canvas support, which in turn will help heap pressure on Hamas, which in turn will help free the hostages, end the threat, etc. or I can be silent now, and my hard will be 5-10 years down the track when terrorism, the claws of it, which we've already seen, have come to my country, have come to Europe, have come. It's not an Israeli problem. It's a problem of Australia and Europe and the U.S. and all the democratic world. It's a problem for Islamic countries, it's a problem for everyone. Everyone in the world is impacted negatively by this, and right now we can say, 'Oh, it's far away.' It's not. It's already here.' When asked about the recent surge in antisemitic incidents in Australia, including the arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue and other instances of vandalism, Molan didn’t mince words. 'It's crazy. It's very simple to explain in my opinion,' she said. 'You're always going to have people who have bad intentions. But when I look at the response of the Australian government, buying into such falsehoods and perpetuating them—they're committing genocide or Netanyahu's a war criminal— what it says to every person in Australia is that they must be evil.' Molan expressed deep disappointment in the Australian government’s response to the Middle East crisis, describing it as 'utterly disgraceful.' 'There have been moments of real national shame that I have felt us turning our back on an ally, on a country that has been incredible to us for many, many years, and it really shames me,' she said. However, she believes the gap between the Australian public and its politicians is significant. 'I genuinely believe the vast majority of Australians stand with Israel and stand against terror. The issue is that we have a very loud vocal minority, like anywhere else in the world. If we are silent, the people who are rational, who understand the conflict, who understand the difference between good and evil, then we allow way too much space for them to take up. One should not be swayed by the pro-Palestinian riots and protests. The silent majority knows the truth,' she explains. 'I used to cover car racing, and I would do an eight- or ten-hour car race and all I would put in my one-minute news package at night would be the crashes because that's the big spectacle, that's the best thing to watch, not reality. Fifty cars did not crash, including the car that won, but I'll show you those because I want you watching because it's advertising, you've got to generate engagement. I look at that with the antisemitism in Australia as well, it gets headlines. Yes, it's been horrific in so many ways, but it does not by any stretch of the imagination represent the vast majority of people in my country.' Like many modern conflicts, the war in Gaza is being fought not only on the battlefield but also in the court of global public opinion—a front where Israel has struggled, facing widespread protests, international condemnations and even arms embargoes. When asked what Israel could do differently to address global perceptions, Molan responded with a mix of frustration and clarity. 'I look at what you went through on October 7,' she says, 'for a country to have to think, 'We need a PR strategy for this.' is absolutely batshit crazy. You suffered the worst loss of life since the Holocaust. It wasn't just killing people; it was evil, malicious torture. It was children watching their parents die and then burned alive. I can't comprehend the level of depravity that I witnessed in those videos and at those sites, and the world wants you to figure out a plan to come out looking like the good people? 'The vast majority see this for what it is, but when you've got algorithms, social media, when you've got very rich, influential countries that wish you harm, who support terrorism, putting millions and billions of dollars into this space, the issue is not your lack of good PR. You as a country and a people don't need PR. You were massacred by evil terrorists. You need the evil players to stop being able to do what they do, which is attempt to mindwash the masses.' Molan also shared a poignant moment from her advocacy journey. 'A regular bloke, and he's Australian, he's not Jewish, wrote to me, 'My morals haven't changed and my values haven't changed, but after watching your clips, the side that I now know they align with has.' How powerful is that? It's just a shift where people go, 'I care about kids in Gaza.' The way to save them is to stop the terrorists, not condemning Israel or flying the flags of Hamas in the streets or at your university, or at our Christmas celebration. The way to save the kids that we all apparently care about is to eradicate the terrorists who are killing them.' Molan argues that the coverage of the war in Gaza in Australian media often misses the mark, leaving critical truths overshadowed by misleading narratives that many Australians, occupied by their everyday lives, lack the time or resources to dig deeper into. 'I was in the car the other day driving and the start of the ABC bulletin was something to the effect of, 'We are on day 400 and something of Israel's illegal invasion of Gaza,'' she said. 'It wasn't an illegal invasion. The terrorists came in and murdered over 1,000 people and stole people, 100 of whom are still there. Israel's trying to get its people back and trying to stop the terrorists from doing the same thing over and over and over. But if you're just listening to that, and you're not as engaged, then that's your narrative. 'People quote the death toll as though it is fact rather than saying these are Hamas numbers. What they should say is 'we're not saying they're not right, but they're not renowned for being particularly accurate people.' I watch news shows that spout as fact things that are not true. I feel like the mainstream media has gone absolutely crazy. Molan has faced speculation about whether her outspoken support for Israel played a role in her dismissal from Sky News Australia earlier this month. However, she says making that link 'wouldn’t make sense' given other staunch pro-Israeli voices on the network. Although the experience was initially 'gut-wrenching,' Molan is looking ahead and exploring new platforms and opportunities. 'I feel this incredible sense of gratitude, hope and excitement. I feel like this is a blessing in disguise. I'm so excited about what's to come,' she concludes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjclegusye	2024-12-22T15:01:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/23/SJCgHQIHkl/SJCgHQIHkl_0_40_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israel tells Syria it won't accept Jihadist presence in southern ...	Message sent to de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa stresses Israel intends to maintain its security and will consider leaving buffer zone should stable government be established Jerusalem issued a message to Syria’s de factor leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani) saying any attempt by jihadists to move to the country’s south won’t be tolerated. The message further clarified that if a responsible governmental authority forms in Syria, Israel might consider transferring control of the buffer zone to it. Until then, Israel will continue to ensure its own security. This comes a week after al-Sharaa said he had no intention of clashing with Israel. A few days later, al-Sharaa said that Syria would adhere to the disengagement agreement signed in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. He called on the international community to ensure that Israel remains committed to the agreement as well. Meanwhile, Jerusalem added in its message to Syria's new leadership that the Israeli military's presence in the buffer zone is motivated by defense and security concerns, particularly in preparation for potential incidents like those of October 7, 2023, originating from Syria. 'We won’t allow that to happen,' officials in Jerusalem stressed. During a recent Security Cabinet meeting held at the IDF Northern Command, participants discussed the situation in Syria and Lebanon, delving into security briefings they received. Israel understands that the rebels are trying to present a specific image to the Western world, but Jerusalem remains vigilant regarding developments in Syria. The deterioration of security on the Syrian side since the fall of Assad's regime prompted Israeli forces to advance into the buffer zone between the two countries to neutralize threats. According to Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen network, Israeli forces have established seven permanent positions along the buffer zone in rural areas of Damascus, Daraa and Quneitra. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The report noted that two of these positions, located in the Mount Hermon area, 'overlook Damascus and its western suburbs.' Syrian channels have regularly reported on the Israeli military's advances toward Syrian villages, interactions with the local population and operations at various sites near the border in recent weeks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjza311irje	2024-12-22T13:40:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/SJ119dg8H1l/SJ119dg8H1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Iranian discontent brews amid crippling power shortage	Analysis: Iran's devastating economic situation threatens to push frustrated population further amid losses to Hezbollah and fall of Assad regime Iran is facing significant distress these days. Hezbollah’s beating from Israel, the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House next month are increasing the pressure on Theran’s leadership. If that weren't enough, domestic developments — particularly the economic situation — are exacerbating internal unrest, which could spark popular uprisings at any moment. The country is struggling with a power shortage and cannot meet demand amid the harsh winter sweeping Iran. President Masoud Pezeshkian's remarks have only fueled public anger and underscored the Iranian leadership's detachment from the everyday lives of ordinary citizens. Earlier this month, the president suggested Iranians 'dress warmly' at home, as he does, instead of trying to use heating. Just days ago, he urged citizens to lower their heating by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6°F) to reduce electricity consumption. The backlash on social media has been severe and critical. The worsening electricity crisis has led authorities to take several measures, including closing schools, government offices and shopping centers, as well as turning off streetlights on highways and in urban areas. Iran’s electricity sector relies primarily (85%) on natural gas, but decreased production has forced authorities to increasingly use diesel-powered stations — a pollutant that raises urban air pollution to dangerous levels. Iranian officials blame international sanctions on the gas and oil sector for the crisis, but others argue that mismanagement and the Ayatollah regime's skewed priorities have brought Iran’s electricity industry to the brink of collapse. Misguided priorities The regime’s distorted priorities tie closely to the Assad regime’s collapse and the severe blow to the Shiite axis Iran has cultivated in the region over recent years. Despite sanctions against it, Iran has managed to generate annual revenues of $35–45 billion from its oil and gas sector in recent years. Instead of using these revenues to improve infrastructure, including in the energy sector, the Ayatollah regime has diverted billions of dollars to failing projects such as bolstering Assad's rule and into Hezbollah. These investments have gone to waste and the Iranian public is starting to ask questions. At a press briefing held this week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei was asked about the 'lost funds' Iran invested in Syria, estimated at approximately $50 billion. Beyond military aid, Iran has provided Syria with oil and established industrial projects, such as a car assembly plant, under strategic cooperation agreements with Assad's regime. Baghaei claimed that the reported investment figure was 'exaggerated,' yet he declined to specify the actual value of resources Iran funneled to Syria over the past 13 years to keep Assad in power. As Iran's internal struggles worsen, the issue of investing in the Shiite axis will continue to surface in public discourse. Economic turmoil Geopolitical developments have also led to an unprecedented plunge in the Iranian currency’s value. This week, the black-market exchange rate for the U.S. dollar reached approximately 780,000 Iranian rials. For comparison, the exchange rate stood at roughly 703,000 rials on the day Trump was re-elected. The Iranian rial’s rapid depreciation stems from public fear of what’s to come, prompting many to place their trust in the U.S. dollar. Another contributing factor to the rial’s drop was a change in the Central Bank of Iran’s exchange rate policy, allocating dollars to traders based on the free-market rate instead of a fixed rate. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Nonetheless, the central bank injected $200 million into the market this week, slightly lowering the rate to 766,000 rials. It’s difficult to predict Iran’s next steps given the growing internal crisis. The Iranian leadership is split between the 'moderate' camp, represented by Pezeshkian who advocates for a new nuclear agreement with the West to ease sanctions and improve the economy and the ultra-conservative faction close to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, which believes now is the right time to accelerate uranium enrichment on the path to developing a nuclear bomb. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1xjmw8h1l	2024-12-22T12:44:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/ByltYpPWH1x/ByltYpPWH1x_419_1_2176_1224_0_small.jpg

Go for the head': Mossad chief urges strike on Iran over Yemen a...	David Barnea recommends at high-level discussions targeting Iran in response to missile and drone launches of Yemeni militia; Netanyahu vows decisive action against Houthis Mossad Director David Barnea has recommended targeting Iran rather than the Houthis in response to recent missile attacks on Israel, arguing that Israel should 'go for the head, Iran,' officials familiar with recent high-level discussions told Ynet on Sunday. A report in the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat cited Israeli security sources who believe the Houthis operate with relative independence but receive significant Iranian support, including funding, equipment, expertise and missile guidance. Recent investigations revealed that missiles launched by the Houthis toward Israel featured advanced technologies, such as extended fuel capacities, allowing them to hover over targets longer and complicating interception. Israel's Arrow missile defense system reportedly struggled to counter these missiles effectively. Israeli political sources also disclosed ongoing efforts to convince the U.S. to launch a dual military operation targeting both Houthi forces in Yemen and Iran. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday decisive action against Houthi missile attacks on Israel. Speaking after a meeting of the Security Cabinet in the IDF Northern Command, Netanyahu linked the Houthis to Iran’s 'Axis of Evil' and emphasized international cooperation against their actions. 'As we have acted decisively against other terror arms of Iran’s Axis of Evil, we will act against the Houthis,' Netanyahu said. 'In this case, we are not acting alone. The U.S. and other nations see the Houthis as a threat not only to international shipping but to the global order.' He assured Israelis that, despite potential delays, the results would mirror Israel’s successes against other terror groups. 'I ask citizens to remain patient and steadfast, as you have so far,' he added. 'Follow Home Front Command guidelines closely. You do that, and we will take care of everything else.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ahead of the Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu and ministers reviewed a display of weapons seized by Israeli forces in southern Lebanese villages during ground operations. The briefing, led by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Northern Command head Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, highlighted the discovery of Hezbollah weapons and ammunition stored in private homes. Netanyahu also visited a mock tunnel designed to replicate command centers found during operations in Lebanon. Meanwhile, the U.S. military confirmed that an F/A-18 fighter jet was damaged by 'friendly fire' during an operation against Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday. The two pilots were rescued, with one sustaining minor injuries. The Houthis claimed responsibility for downing the aircraft, saying their forces repelled the attack on their positions in Sanaa. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree asserted that their forces had also targeted the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier and its associated destroyers using eight cruise missiles and 17 drones during simultaneous operations. Saree claimed the attack forced the carrier group to retreat and vowed continued action as long as the Gaza war persists. Overnight Saturday, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen struck Tel Aviv after evading Israeli interception attempts, directly wounding 16 people and injuring 21 others as they sought shelter. The IDF confirmed an investigation into the failure of the missile defense systems and said that lessons learned are already being implemented to improve both interception capabilities and early warning systems. 'The air defense array is not airtight,' the IDF said. 'We urge the public to continue following Home Front Command directives to ensure safety.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byne3j8byl	2024-12-22T11:02:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/20/ryuFJNzoC/ryuFJNzoC_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg
Pope says Israel 'machine-gunning children' in Gaza	Pontiff continues to condemn Israel's actions against Hamas, equating them to war crimes; Foreign Ministry rebukes claims Pope Francis continued to escalate his criticism of Israel, accusing it of 'machine-gunning of children' and carrying out the 'bombing of schools and hospitals' in Gaza during his weekly mass on Sunday. The pontiff's remarks came just a day after he condemned Israel following an airstrike in Gaza that killed seven children from one family. 'Yesterday, children were bombed. This is cruelty. This is not war. I wanted to say this because it touches the heart,' he told members of the Holy See's government. Israeli officials have accused Pope Francis of causing 'significant damage' to Israel’s standing in the Christian world and alleged a double standard in the Vatican's approach to the country. In a pointed statement, the Foreign Ministry responded to his comments, saying, 'Cruelty is terrorists hiding behind children while trying to murder Israeli children. Cruelty is holding 100 hostages for 442 days, including babies and children, and abusing them. 'Unfortunately, the pope chose to ignore all of this, as well as the fact that Israel's actions targeted terrorists using children as human shields. His remarks are particularly disappointing as they are disconnected from the true and factual context of Israel’s fight against jihadist terrorism—a multi-front war that was forced upon it starting on October 7.' Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli sharply criticized those comments in an unusual open letter published by Italian newspaper Il Foglio on Friday. Chikli said the pope's remarks amounted to a 'trivialization' of the term genocide. 'As a nation that lost six million of its people in the Holocaust, we have a unique sensitivity to the misuse of the term 'genocide' — a misuse that brings us closer to Holocaust denial,' he wrote. The Vatican has intensified its criticism of Israel in recent months, abandoning even a pretense of balance — signaling a concerning policy shift by the pope. His recent stance stands in contrast to the Holy See's modern tradition of neutrality. Recently, he published a book suggesting an examination of whether the situation in Gaza 'meets the technical definition of genocide,' an accusation Israel vehemently denies. At the end of September, the pope also criticized Israel's 'immoral use of force' in Gaza and Lebanon. The Vatican has recognized the State of Palestine and maintained diplomatic relations with it since 2013 while supporting a two-state solution. Henrique Zimmermann, an Israeli journalist reporting for international media and a close associate of the pope, has met him seven times in the past three months. 'I spoke to him about it and told him why I believe he's making a big mistake by saying what's happening in Gaza is genocide. He told me I was right,' Zimmermann said. 'He said he never accused Israel of genocide. He said he was asked whether he thought it was genocide and he replied that experts should determine that — not him.' Regarding the pope's participation in the event featuring Jesus in a cradle with a keffiyeh, Zimmermann explained, 'The installation was created by the Bethlehem community and I don't think the pope even noticed the keffiyeh.' 'There was a justified outcry in the Jewish world after the event, including from his close friends. Rabbis from Argentina, who've been his friends for 30 years, pointed out, 'You know better than anyone that Jesus is Jewish, not Palestinian.' So the pope ordered the keffiyeh removed,' he added. Zimmermann further said that the pope faces intense pressure from various factions within the Church who sympathize with Palestinians in Gaza. 'He receives a lot of criticism from the Arab world for being pro-Israel and for having many Jewish friends,' Zimmermann said. 'He's been in contact with the church in Gaza since October 7, which houses 610 Christians. They update him on what's happening and often poison his views.' 'Every time we meet, I see all kinds of materials sent to him in Spanish by official Palestinian entities and Palestinian embassies in South America about 'the generals' plan,' what Israel is doing and the harm to children and women. There's nothing representing the Israeli side,' he said. 'The new ambassador has much goodwill but has just arrived and met with the pope only once or twice. The pope also has friends in communities near the Gaza border and he consistently mentioned the issue of returning the hostages in various speeches for months. He was also involved in behind-the-scenes efforts to secure the hostages' release, including with U.S. President Joe Biden.' 'We cannot afford to oppose the most influential person on Earth' Zimmermann stressed that Israel cannot afford to confront someone who leads 2.4 billion people worldwide and whose every word is quoted. 'His influence exceeds that of the U.S. president. We cannot afford to oppose the most influential person on Earth,' he said. 'He defines antisemitism as a sin.

Taliban purge academics, reshape Afghan education with ‘extremist...	The Taliban appear to be engaging in a systematic approach to seek ideological revenge and promote the 'Talibanization' of universities in Afghanistan, purging opposition, eroding academic freedom and forcing a brain drain After completely eradicating women from the education system, the Afghan Taliban have now turned their focus to silencing male professors who challenge their ideological and ethnic agenda. Reports reveal that the Taliban have overhauled university curricula and forcibly removed dissenting academics. Deans who have challenged the imposed rules and expressed their disagreement with strict ideologies have been subjected to dismissal, intimidation and exile. Sources also suggest professors who oppose the Taliban's changes or fail to comply are being systematically labeled as ideological opponents. In a stark display of their repression, 12 professors from Sayed Jamaluddin Afghani University in Kunar province were dismissed, accused of being 'Salafists.' These individuals have been punished for advocating academic freedom and resisting the constraints imposed upon them. Sources confirmed to The Media Line that among the dismissed professors were eight from the Faculty of Sharia, two from the Faculty of Agriculture and two from the Faculty of Education. Growing concerns have been raised regarding the Taliban’s escalating revenge-seeking actions and ideological clashes against university professors and their curricula, as the group actively pursues a systematic approach to seek ideological revenge and promote the 'Talibanization' of universities in Afghanistan. The academic institutions, which were once safe spaces for independent thinking and intellectual development, are now being restructured to conform to the rigid beliefs of the Taliban. The Taliban appear to be planning an even larger purge to eliminate opposition and suppress any remaining voices of dissent, further eroding academic freedom in the country. By undermining academic institutions, the Taliban have dismantled the foundations of critical thinking and intellectual diversity, leaving Afghanistan’s education system increasingly isolated, regressive and dominated by a single narrative. In the past, the Taliban fired professors who went abroad, including about 50 professors in Balkh province, 300 in Herat and dozens in other provinces. Moreover, professors who had won scholarships to study abroad were substituted by Taliban-linked figures. Many terrified educators and students look to exit the country, which has resulted in a continued drainage of the intellectual capital out of Afghanistan. Abdul Majid, a senior professor at the Faculty of Sharia at Sayed Jamaluddin Afghani University and one of the Salafi academics forced to resign, has since fled Afghanistan. Now seeking refuge with his family, Majid expressed deep concern over the Taliban’s tightening grip on the education sector. Speaking to The Media Line, he warned: 'The outlook and prospect for Afghanistan's educational system are bleak and threatening. The hopes and motivations among students and professors are shrinking very fast, with many planning to leave the country.' Majid highlighted that 'many academics and students view the Taliban's approach to universities and academic institutions as an act of 'educational demolition,' transforming once-thriving centers of learning into mere madrassas (seminaries) aimed solely at propagating their ideology.' Majid referred to the Taliban's endless ideological confrontations and unprofessional behavior toward academics, saying, 'They change curricula, engage in ideological confrontations and give priority to clerics over qualified educators. These practices, besides the lack of legal structure and clerical dominance, have driven many professors to leave universities.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ali Maisam Nazary, head of foreign relations for the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, told The Media Line: 'To advance their extremist agenda, the Taliban are systematically eliminating experienced academics from Afghanistan's educational institutions, replacing them with individuals lacking the necessary academic qualifications to indoctrinate the nation's youth.' 'The consequences of this policy are far-reaching. By promoting a curriculum designed to indoctrinate rather than educate, the Taliban is creating a new generation of youth who are more susceptible to extremist ideologies,' he added. Nazary emphasized that 'the youth, melded in this distorted educational system, could be easily lured by other terrorist groups to perpetuate the cycle of violence and radicalization around the globe.' Commenting on the PhD professors and intellectual students who have been leaving the country, Nazary said, 'This brain drain takes away Afghanistan's finest brains—skilled and most educated—thereby causing innovation, research and other key sectors like education, health and technology to be put behind.' 'Without them,' he continued, 'the country faces stagnation and a growing gap in international competitiveness, which will bequeath its next generation with less room for growth and self-sustainability.' Kamal Alam, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and an expert on Afghanistan, told The Media Line, 'Anyone who has observed and warned against the notion of a ‘reformed Taliban’ will find their current actions unsurprising.' Alam noted that the 'Taliban remain a regressive, puritanical regime with limited education and a narrow interpretation of Islam.' He emphasized that there is little evidence to suggest the Taliban can contribute positively to education, women’s rights or even the broader rights of men. Alam further pointed out their inability to engage constructively with fellow Muslim counterparts on genuine Islamic principles at the international level, highlighting the group’s limitations. 'No progress or enlightenment can be expected from the Taliban’s oppressive methods, whether in academia, governance or their connections with terrorist organizations,' he concluded. Qudrat Ullah Qudrat, a Paris-based Afghan student, told The Media Line, 'The Taliban in Afghanistan have been strategically and methodically working to shape the minds of the younger generation by imposing their beliefs and values through the education system.' Qudrat underlined that 'this systematic takeover involves various actions, including infiltrating schools and universities, appointing sympathetic individuals to key educational positions, rewriting curricula to align with their extremist views and silencing dissenting voices or alternative perspectives.' 'This strategy perpetuates a cycle of violence and extremism, severely undermining Afghanistan’s prospects for peace and stability,' he added. He confirmed that the Taliban have dismissed deans and other educators who disagree with their views, replacing them with loyalists, which has forced many talented academics to flee the country, 'weakening Afghanistan’s future.' Additionally, Qudrat highlighted 'the Taliban’s deliberate targeting of specific religious groups, noting that such actions will further divide the country and exacerbate existing social conflicts, leaving Afghanistan more fractured and vulnerable.' Qudrat also referenced and rephrased a recent statement by Neda Mohammad Nadeem, the acting head of the Taliban’s Ministry of Higher Education, who implied that the academic qualifications of 'Taliban fighters' should be determined by the number of mine-laying operations they have conducted. Meanwhile, Dr. Khairullah Zadran, a senior official at the Afghan Ministry of Education, told The Media Line 'that reports on targeting professors belonging to particular groups are baseless.' He explained that 'the curriculum is being revised to align with Islamic Sharia and maintained that Islam is not against modern education' and asserted that 'every employee is free to resign for any reason, as no law prohibits it.' According to Zadran, 'Previous governments had given women too much freedom in education.' This, he said, resulted in 'social and immoral problems.' In response, Zadran said that the Taliban is working on a plan to bring back senior professors who left the country during earlier periods of instability. By barring girls from secondary schools and universities, the Taliban are denying millions of young women the chance to learn and, in effect, denying the country their contributions to social, economic and cultural development. In a further effort to erase women from both education and active participation in society, Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada issued a decree this month banning women from attending medical and paramedical professional institutions. The decision closes one of the last remaining pathways for women to access higher education in Afghanistan. It comes after the closure of universities to women in December 2022, which had already forced many into medical facilities as a last resort.

Palestinian officer killed in Jenin as West Bank crackdown on Ira...	On day 17 of PA’s operation in Jenin, officer Sahr Arhil killed by terrorist gunfire; PA vows to expand crackdown across West Bank, targeting groups tied to 'the long arm of Iran and Hamas,' calling fight defense of national interests On the 17th day of the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) Operation Protect the Homeland in Jenin, tensions escalated as PA security forces clashed with fighters from the Jenin Brigade, a group linked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) attempting to assert control over the refugee camp. The violence turned deadly Sunday when Sahr Arhil, a member of the Presidential Guard from Tulkarem, was killed by terrorist gunfire. Two other security officers were wounded, one severely. PA security forces spokesperson Anwar Rajab condemned the attack, calling it a 'heinous crime' that would only strengthen efforts to pursue 'outlaws.' He described the operation as part of a broader Palestinian security and political vision to protect national interests and urged residents to support efforts to combat groups he labeled as 'lacking national culture.' The PA has signaled plans to expand the operation beyond Jenin to other West Bank areas. A senior PA official described the campaign as a fight against the 'long arm of Iran, Hamas and PIJ,' accusing them of destabilizing the region. 'We won’t allow foreign agendas to control our people,' the official said. 'We’ve seen the consequences of Hamas rule in Gaza—we won’t let them destroy the West Bank.' A rare report by two Washington Post correspondents highlighted the unusual confrontation between the PA security forces and Jenin Brigade gunmen. The newspaper noted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to the PA resuming governance in Gaza, but cited a former Egyptian official claiming Israel had agreed to a temporary PA role managing the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The authority launched Operation Protect the Homeland this month to retake control of Jenin camp by targeting 'outlaws' and those 'spreading chaos and anarchy and harming civil peace,' Rajab told The Post. 'All these actions and policies undermine the work of the PA, and these groups give Israel an excuse to implement its plans in the West Bank.' According to Rajab, the operation’s 'achievements' have included arresting more than two dozen wanted persons, wounding others, dismantling dozens of explosives and 'advancing on important axes' into the refugee camp. Security forces have killed three people: a fighter, a 19-year-old passerby on a motorcycle and a 14-year-old boy. Both sides appear to be showing relative restraint. 'We don’t want to see a single drop of blood being shed,' Sabri Saidam, a member of Fatah’s central committee, told The Post. 'What we would like to achieve is a state of calm, to sit down with different factions and agree on the way forward.' A Palestinian official close to PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private discussions, said that the Palestinian leader has decided that the PA 'will impose its authority and there is no turning back.' But two weeks into the crackdown, militants still roam freely in the Jenin camp. Gunfire rings out day and night. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has suspended schools. Businesses are shut. In the Damaj and Hawashin neighborhoods, heavily damaged in an Israeli raid in September, some families have been without electricity and water for days. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2xuthsjg	2024-12-22T08:47:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/BJWM4aTNJx/BJWM4aTNJx_0_227_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

On Independence Day 1974, a Super Frelon helicopter crashed in flames on Mount Hermon during a rescue mission, killing all six crew members; fifty years later, its front rotor was recovered following Israel's capture of the Syrian Hermon Fifty years after one of Israel’s deadliest aviation accidents, soldiers from the elite Shaldag Unit recovered over the weekend the front rotor of a Super Frelon helicopter that crashed on Syria’s Mount Hermon during the 1974 Independence Day war. The rotor was transferred to Israel for further examination, providing closure for a tragedy that claimed six lives. The crash occurred on the evening of April 24, 1974, less than two weeks after the 'Machanayim Disaster,' when two Yasur helicopters collided, killing eight soldiers and crew. During the Independence Day mission, a Super Frelon helicopter from the 114th Squadron was dispatched to evacuate casualties from a paratrooper brigade stationed at an outpost near the Syrian Hermon.

Netanyahu vows decisive action against Houthi threats	PM highlights US-led international cooperation against Iranian-backed rebels, assures Israelis results would mirror Israel’s successes against other terror groups; 'Follow Home Front Command guidelines closely, and we will take care of everything else' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday vowed decisive action against Houthi missile attacks on Israel. Speaking after a meeting of the Security Cabinet in the IDF Northern Command, Netanyahu linked the Houthis to Iran’s 'Axis of Evil' and emphasized international cooperation against their actions. 'As we have acted decisively against other terror arms of Iran’s Axis of Evil, we will act against the Houthis,' Netanyahu said. 'In this case, we are not acting alone. The U.S. and other nations see the Houthis as a threat not only to international shipping but to the global order.' He assured Israelis that, despite potential delays, the results would mirror Israel’s successes against other terror groups. 'I ask citizens to remain patient and steadfast, as you have so far,' he added. 'Follow Home Front Command guidelines closely. You do that, and we will take care of everything else.'

Engineering teams are working across more than 40 towns and surrounding areas to remove military debris and ensure safety for returning residents. 'This is part of broader efforts to create the conditions for residents to return to their homes safely,' the IDF said. 'Teams are clearing communities of military equipment, cleaning debris and removing unexploded munitions with support from local authorities.' Lt. Col. Shlomi Katzin of the 769th Brigade emphasized the cooperation between the military, emergency services and local governments. 'Our mission is to restore security, tranquility and the beauty of the north that we all know and cherish,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1kdyths1x	2024-12-22T07:46:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/ryOvwUbHJx/ryOvwUbHJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
California license plate sparks outrage for appearing to mock Oct...	California DMV apologizes and revokes license plate reading 'LOLOCT7' after being interpreted as mocking October 7 Hamas attack victims; Filipino-American owner’s family claims 'Lolo' means 'grandfather' in Tagalog The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) apologized this week for issuing a personalized license plate that some interpreted as mocking victims of the October 7 Hamas attack. The DMV revoked the plate, citing its policy against hateful messages, despite the vehicle owner’s claim that the controversy stemmed from a misunderstanding. The plate, which read 'LOLOCT7,' gained attention after the advocacy group StopAntisemitism shared a photo of a Tesla Cybertruck with the plate at a Culver City intersection near Los Angeles. Critics argued the combination of characters could be read as celebrating the attack, with 'LOL' (laugh out loud) and 'OCT7' referencing the date of the Hamas assault. StopAntisemitism called on the DMV to cancel the plate, accusing it of 'celebrating the October 7th terrorist attack' and calling it a 'vile mockery.' The DMV responded by issuing a formal apology and announcing the plate’s revocation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We sincerely apologize that these personalized plates were not properly rejected during the review process,' the DMV said in a statement. 'The use of hateful language violates is not only a clear violation of our policies but also a violation of our core values to proudly serve the public and ensure safe and welcoming roadways.' However, the vehicle owner’s son, a Filipino-American who requested anonymity, said the plate’s meaning had been misunderstood. He explained that 'LOLO' means 'grandfather' in Tagalog, the national language of the Philippines, while 'CT' refers to the Cybertruck model, and the number 7 represents the owner’s seven grandchildren. He added that this explanation had been provided to the DMV before the plate’s approval. 'We have great empathy for anyone who has experienced any hatred,' the son told ABC7. 'And we would really appreciate, in turn, for anyone that's seeing this or hearing this to have any empathy toward our family because we had no ill intent for anything.' California allows drivers to request personalized license plates combining letters and numbers with symbolic meaning. However, like most U.S. states, it imposes restrictions on messages deemed racist, political, religious or vulgar. The incident highlights broader debates over personalized license plates. In Maine, a decade-old law barring state officials from rejecting offensive plates was repealed after plates with vulgar terms such as profanity and explicit sexual references became common. The state has since reinstated restrictions to curb the trend. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydtp3rbkg	2024-12-22T07:24:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/SyG6t9BHkl/SyG6t9BHkl_88_68_247_139_0_small.jpg

Iran's Khamenei asserts 'Zionists haven’t won' in Syria	Iranian supreme leader dismisses claims Hamas and Hezbollah are proxies, saying they act on faith, warns post-Assad Syria’s youth may rise up against its leaders Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday tried to downplay the impact of the Assad regime’s recent overthrow in Syria, alongside heavy losses suffered by Hezbollah and Hamas. He dismissed claims that these groups operate as Iranian proxies but rather act on their own beliefs, not at Tehran’s direction. 'The Islamic Republic doesn’t have proxy forces. Yemen fights due to their faith. Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad fight because their beliefs compel them to do so,' Khamenei said in a speech also attended by Muhammad Mahdi Nasrallah, the son of slain Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. He insisted Iran does not rely on such groups, adding, 'If one day we plan to take action, we do not need proxy forces.' Khamenei accused the U.S. and Israel of orchestrating the Syrian conflict to gain control of its resources. 'Now they feel victory, the Americans, the Zionist regime and those who accompanied them,' he said, adding, 'The Iranian people will trample anyone who accepts the role of a mercenary of America.' Iran was the Assad regime's main ally alongside Russia, and for years helped it suppress regime opponents with the help of pro-Iranian militias, partly in exchange for allowing it to flow weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon through Syria and allowing Tehran's militias to operate from its territory against Israel. The collapse of Assad's regime earlier this month, which came after Hezbollah suffered a severe blow at the hands of Israel, was seen as a fatal blow to the Shiite 'Axis of Resistance' that Iran had built in the region. After the toppling of Assad, rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, declared that the new Syria would not present a threat to any country in its vicinity and would no longer be subject to Iran's whims. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Iranian officials have emphasized that communication channels have been established with Syria’s new leadership under al-Sharaa, though the details of these ties remain unclear. Tehran faces a challenging relationship with the new government, after years of backing Bashar Assad in a brutal crackdown on opposition forces. In his speech Sunday, Khamenei appeared confrontational toward al-Sharaa’s administration, suggesting young Syrians, facing insecurity after Assad’s fall, could rise against the new leadership. 'What can he do? He should stand with strong will against those who designed and those who implemented the insecurity,' Khamenei said. 'God willing, he will overcome them.' Khamenei also accused Israel and the United States of fomenting chaos in Syria. 'You Zionists haven’t won; you’ve been defeated. Yes, you were able to advance a few kilometers in Syria where there wasn’t even one soldier with a gun to stop you. That’s not victory,' he said, predicting Syrian resistance to foreign influence. 'The courageous, devout, young people of Syria will definitely expel you from there,' he added. Khamenei ridiculed Israel’s claims of victory in its war with Hamas, accusing the country of failing to achieve its goals despite extensive casualties. 'The Zionists try to show they’re the victors. You wretched people! Where have you won? Have you won in Gaza? Have you destroyed Hamas? Have you freed your own prisoners? Is this victory to kill over 40,000 people without being able to achieve even one of your goals?' Khamenei said. Meanwhile, diplomatic outreach to Syria’s new leadership continues to grow. Al-Sharaa met Sunday with prominent Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt in Damascus. Al-Sharaa criticized the Assad regime’s history of interference in Lebanon, often through Hezbollah, and pledged to chart a different course. 'Syria will no longer be a case of negative interference in Lebanon,' he said, emphasizing respect for Lebanese sovereignty and a desire for stronger bilateral ties. 'We hope to have strategic relations with Lebanon and to start a new history with it,' al-Sharaa added. 'Lebanon needs a strong economy and political stability, and Syria will support it.' Turkey, a key player in Assad’s overthrow, is also strengthening ties with Syria’s new government. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met with al-Sharaa on Sunday, marking the highest-level contact between Turkey and the new Syrian leadership. Turkey, seen as the driving force behind the opposition’s surprise offensive that toppled Assad, is poised to leverage its influence over al-Sharaa’s administration, particularly against Kurdish forces in northern Syria. This influence could also be directed toward advancing Turkey’s regional interests, including its stance against Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjnki5bsyg	2024-12-22T06:46:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/HkCcadHBkx/HkCcadHBkx_0_143_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Jerusalem residents charged with spying for Hezbollah	Abed Al-Salam and Taar Asili indicted for contact with foreign agent and sharing intelligence with Hezbollah operative during war; prosecutors seek their detention until trial The State Prosecutor’s Office filed an indictment Sunday against two Jerusalem residents, Abed Al-Salam, 33, and Taar Asili, 35, alleging they collaborated with a Hezbollah operative and provided sensitive information to the terrorist organization during the war. One of the defendants also faces charges of attempting to carry a weapon without a permit. The indictment claims the two men made contact with a woman identified as Dania through a WhatsApp group. Despite learning she was a Hezbollah operative, they continued sharing information with her. Al-Salam allegedly sent her photographs of the Caesarea area at her request, while Asili provided news articles about Israel and its security situation. The indictment further details that the men were instructed to establish contact with a senior Hezbollah intelligence figure known as 'Al-Hajj.' Asili reportedly purchased a new SIM card for this purpose but refused a request to take photographs near the northern town of Metula which lies on the Lebanese border. Additionally, Al-Salam is accused of being photographed holding a weapon during a visit to Jenin in the West Bank, with the weapon belonging to a local individual identified as 'Abu Kharb.' Both men are charged with contact with a foreign agent and providing information to the enemy. Al-Salam faces an additional charge for attempting to carry a weapon without a permit. Prosecutors have requested their detention until the conclusion of legal proceedings. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The case is one of several recent espionage incidents involving foreign operatives, many linked to Iran, attempting to undermine Israel’s security. Last week, authorities revealed the arrest of Ardler (Israel) Amoyal, 23, from Jerusalem, who is suspected of contacting Iranian intelligence agents and completing security-related assignments in exchange for payment. Earlier this month, Artyom Zolotarev, 33, of Nof HaGalil, was arrested on suspicion of working for Iranian intelligence. His alleged tasks included arson and spraying graffiti, and his arrest came during a joint operation by Shin Bet and police. In October, seven Israelis of Azerbaijani descent were accused of maintaining contact with Iranian operatives over two years. Some allegedly provided intelligence on military bases that were later targeted by Iranian missile strikes and trailed a senior Israeli official in a potential assassination plot.

Zelensky says Ukraine's membership of NATO is 'achievable'	Ukraine's membership of NATO is 'achievable,' but Kyiv will have to fight to persuade allies to make it happen, President Volodymyr Zelensky told Ukrainian diplomats in a speech on Sunday. Ukraine has repeatedly urged NATO to invite Kyiv to become a member. The Western military alliance has said Ukraine will join its ranks one day but has not set a date or issued an invitation. Moscow has cited the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO as one of the principal justifications for its 2022 invasion. Kyiv says membership in the Western alliance's mutual defense pact, or an equivalent form of security guarantee, would be crucial to any peace plan to ensure that Russia does not attack again. 'We all understand that Ukraine's invitation to NATO and membership in the alliance can only be a political decision,' Zelensky told diplomats at a gathering in Kyiv. 'Alliance for Ukraine is achievable, but it is achievable only if we fight for this decision at all the necessary levels.' Zelensky said allies needed to know what Ukraine can bring to NATO and how its membership in the alliance would stabilize global relations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjime9sryl	2024-12-22T04:31:33-08:00	
Estimated damage from Houthi missile that hit central Israel scho...	Missile caused heavy damage to the elementary school near Tel Aviv, despite being 'partially intercepted' Once again, there has been huge damage from rockets falling on Gush Dan in central Israel. The damage from the missile fired from Yemen at an elementary school in Ramat Efal neighborhood of Ramat Gan amounts to approximately 40 million shekels, according to estimates by the Tax Authority. The heavy damage was caused mainly to the school and also to nearby buildings and apartments, Ynet has learned. In comparison, a missile from Iran that hit the prestigious C&S residential complex in northern Tel Aviv on October 1, right before Rosh Hashanah, caused enormous damage to the apartments and restaurants there, which, as reported by Ynet, amounted to approximately 50 million shekels. Only a few weeks ago, repairs were completed at the site and the restaurants, including the famous Turquoise, reopened to diners. Compared to the heavy damage caused in Ramat Efal over the weekend from the missile that the IDF determined was 'partially intercepted,' the damage from the missile that was not intercepted at all and hit a public park in Jaffa on Friday night likely will amount to 'only' a few million shekels, with most of the damage caused to the park itself, as well as broken windows and damage to furniture in hundreds of apartments and businesses in the area. The Tax Authority told Ynet that the current estimate is that about 350-400 claims will be filed by residents in the area.

Ynet recently reported that the direct damage in the northern Lebanese border towns and the Golan Heights is estimated at about 2 billion shekels, and the indirect damage to businesses is estimated at another 3 billion shekels. The direct damage from missile strikes in the Gaza Strip is estimated at about 1.5 billion shekels, and in recent weeks reconstruction of the buildings that were completely damaged in the kibbutzim on the border with Gaza has already begun. The direct damage from the strike last month in Ramat Gan was estimated at 100 million shekels, while the indirect damage following the shutdown of economic activity on the main commercial street is estimated to be about 250 million shekels. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1imqybske	2024-12-22T04:18:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/BJBPir11B1e/BJBPir11B1e_0_187_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Gunmen in the streets, snipers on the rooftops, shooting all the ...	Rare clash between Palestinian Authority security forces and the armed Jenin Brigades in the West Bank city as observed by the Washington Post; The PA hints at a similar model in Gaza Jenin Brigades fighters race through alleys flooded with sewage to evade the gunfire that echoes all around. 'Quickly,' one of the fighters urges his comrades as they pass through patrols and barricades of the Palestinian Authority security forces. 'Watch out,' another cautions at an intersection where an improvised explosive device had been planted. This could have been a response to the IDF raid on the city and the refugee camp in the northern West Bank, but instead it is a report after two Washington Post reporters witnessed up close a rare battle of the Jenin fighters against their internal enemy: the Palestinian Authority . It happened two weeks ago. After many years, Palestinian security forces launched an arrest operation in the crowded refugee camp in an attempt to regain control. The PA, supported by Western countries, is trying to prove that it can manage security in the limited areas it controls in the West Bank, as a reminder to the world that it also seeks to control the Gaza Strip the day after the war ends. The U.S. newspaper reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza as a governing body. However, according to a former senior Egyptian official who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity, Israel has agreed to let the Palestinian Authority manage the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt for a short period. The PA launched 'Operation Protect the Homeland' in November to retake control of Jenin camp by targeting 'outlaws' and those 'spreading chaos and anarchy and harming civil peace,' security forces spokesman Anwar Rajab told The Post. 'All these actions and policies undermine the work of the PA, and these groups give Israel an excuse to implement its plans in the West Bank.' According to Rajab, the 'achievements' of the operation included the arrest of dozens of wanted individuals, the injury of others, the detonation of dozens of explosive devices, and the advancement of important routes into the refugee camp. The security forces killed three people during the operation: a gunman, a 19-year-old young man riding a motorcycle, and a 14-year-old boy. Still, both sides appear to be showing relative restraint, according to the report. 'Don’t want to see a single drop of blood being shed' According to the Ramallah Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between terrorists and civilians, at least 21 people were killed in the long IDF raid on Jenin in September. The IDF said 14 terrorists were killed. The PA also occasionally clashes with armed Palestinians. Since the October 7 massacre, PA security forces have killed 13 Palestinians, including eight in total in Jenin. 'We don't want to see a single drop of blood shed,' Sabri Saidam, an advisor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and a member of his Fatah central committee, told The Washington Post. 'What we would like to achieve is a state of calm, to sit down with different factions and agree on the way forward.' A senior Palestinian source close to the PA chairman said on condition of anonymity that Abbas has decided that the Palestinian Authority will 'impose its authority and there is no turning back.' But two weeks after the PA operation began, gunmen are still roaming freely in the Jenin refugee camp. The sound of gunfire can be heard around the clock. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has closed schools, and businesses are also closed. In some of the neighborhoods, which were badly damaged in the Israeli raid in September, some families were left without electricity and water for days, according to the report. Masked security personnel patrol the government hospital in Jenin. Snipers are stationed on the roof to prevent armed men from trying to hide in its grounds, a hospital source said. The Post's reporters heard gunfire from the roof. The source said several bullets pierced a window in the office, and patients and staff are afraid to come. There is an enormous amount of anger at the security forces in the West Bank. Their men operate in a limited area and, according to agreements with Israel, they are not allowed to deal with violence from settlers and, of course, IDF raids. Many Palestinians see the forces as subcontractors of Israel and a tool of Abbas for corruption and the suppression of internal opposition. '24 hours later there will be someone new in their place' 'The people want ‘law and order’, but apply the law right and people will stand with you,' said Arwad, 35, who spoke on the condition his last name be withheld out of concern for reprisal from Palestinian and Israeli authorities. 'When the Israeli soldiers and jeeps come here, where is the law?' Arwad's brother and father are in Israeli prison. Other relatives of his were killed by IDF fire. Even if the authority arrests wanted terrorists, he said, 'the resistance will continue. Twenty-four hours later there will be someone new in their place.' According to Rajab, the operation in Jenin targeted suspects wanted for criminal offenses, including shooting at hospitals and making explosive devices. He said this escalated when gunmen stole and burned two security force vehicles, and a car bomb exploded near a police station. On the ground, attempts were made to mediate a cease-fire between the gunmen and the security forces but, according to Firas Abu al-Wafa, Fatah's secretary-general in Jenin, the PA refused to compromise. Saidam said talks continue and 'the security apparatus is adamant to impose law and order.' Wafa added that 'If the situation in Jenin stabilizes, then the whole West Bank will be stable.' But if it doesn’t, 'there will not be stability across the West Bank.'

Women and children waved Palestinian flags. 'We hope that the security forces leave the camp, because it’s forbidden to shed blood,' said a camp resident, who has a child that was previously killed by IDF fire.

Iran's Supreme Leader on Sunday said that young Syrians will resist the new government emerging after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad as he again accused the United States and Israel of sowing chaos in the country. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in an address on Sunday that the 'young Syrian has nothing to lose' and suffers from insecurity following Assad's fall. 'What can he do? He should stand with strong will against those who designed and those who implemented the insecurity,' Khamenei said. 'God willing, he will overcome them.' He accused the United States and Israel of plotting against Assad's government in order to seize resources, saying: 'Now they feel victory, the Americans, the Zionist regime and those who accompanied them.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1e6wdbbke	2024-12-22T02:29:32-08:00	
Israel's missile defense under scrutiny: Successful Houthi strike...	Two failed interceptions of Houthi missiles launched from Yemen within two days raise concerns about Israel's missile defense; A strike in Jaffa injured 12, while experts highlight technical challenges, delayed alarms and Iran's involvement in arming the Houthis with advanced weaponry; 'Not only do we learn from interceptions, but so does the other side' Over two days, two attempts to intercept Houthi missiles launched from Yemen failed. On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, the IDF claimed to have achieved a partial interception of the missile, though its warhead exploded and struck a school in Ramat Efal, near Tel Aviv. By the night between Friday and Saturday, it was already clear the interception attempt had failed: several interceptors launched at the ballistic missile missed their target, and it hit the center of a public park in Jaffa, injuring a dozen people and causing damage to nearby apartments. 'The fire is scattered; I don’t see an escalation. But it’s evident that even a single missile heading toward central Israel sends many people into shelters,' said Tal Inbar, an expert in aviation, space and missile policy, and a senior research fellow at the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, during an interview with Ynet studio on Sunday morning. 'Every interception is analyzed. The more interceptors are deployed, the better the performance of the systems becomes,' he added. Inbar also referred to the Houthis’ capabilities. 'I don’t know of a reliable source that can specify the number of missiles they possess, but we do know the types of missiles. Ultimately, this is Iranian import, guided deeply by them. Not only do we learn from interceptions, but so does the other side.' Brigadier General (Res.) Ran Kochav, former commander of the Air Defense Array, stated: 'The cases are different, but the proximity is no coincidence. Both are Iranian missiles launched by the Houthis. In the first case in Ramat Efal, despite the partial interception and the approximate hit on the missile, significant parts, including the warhead, fell. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but there was significant damage. On Saturday morning, however, there was a miss – a significant failure without interception. There was a late warning, and the missile hit the ground.' However, Kochav asserted that he does not believe this incident indicates the use of advanced weaponry. 'When there’s an interception success rate of approximately 90%, one out of every 10 launches fails to be intercepted. Over 37,000 rockets and missiles have been launched toward Israel from Yemen, Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. Sometimes it’s a technical malfunction; other times, operational error.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Kochav addressed the delayed alarms in Jaffa and its surroundings. 'There’s a mutual responsibility between civilians and the Home Front Command, and this time it was a malfunction – perhaps even human error. The warning time provided was shorter than required, and it’s very possible that this needs to be extended or corrected. Generally, there’s always a dilemma about when and how to activate the warning,' he said. 'I trust my colleagues in the Air Force to improve. I don’t believe the guidelines for civilians need to change, but this issue should be addressed within the military, within the Home Front Command,' he concluded, adding: 'This pattern of the Houthis firing at us every day or two must stop. I’m not sure the answer lies in tit-for-tat responses.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1mzaprbyl	2024-12-22T02:24:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/rkmraUNB1g/rkmraUNB1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Turkey says it believes Kurdish fighters will be forced out of al...	Turkey believes Syria's new rulers, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) armed group which Ankara backs, will drive Kurdish YPG fighters from all territory they occupy in northeastern Syria, Defense Minister Yasar Guler said on Sunday. Turkey regards the Syrian YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for 40 years and are deemed terrorists by Ankara, Washington, and the European Union. 'We believe that the new leadership in Syria and the Syrian National Army, which is an important part of its army, along with the Syrian people, will free all territories occupied by terrorist organizations,' Guler said during a visit to Turkish troops on the Syrian border with military commanders. Ankara has demanded the Syrian Kurdish fighters disband, and has called on Washington to withdraw its support. The U.S. military acknowledged last week it has 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria, twice as many as it had said previously.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qptvbbjx	2024-12-22T01:46:52-08:00

Trump appoints 'The Apprentice' producer as special envoy to UK	President-elect has appointed Mark Burnett as his special envoy to the UK; The producer is also behind the shows 'Survivor' and 'Shark Tank,' and also served as chairman of the MGM television company; Trump: 'Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role' President Donald Trump is in the midst of selecting a cabinet for his return to the White House on January 20, and the process is looking more like a reality TV show than good governance. After announcing the nomination of Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary and the appointment of another Fox News host, Dr. Mehmet Oz, as the head of the U.S. Health Insurance Administration, Trump announced the appointment of 'The Apprentice' producer Mark Burnett as his special envoy to the United Kingdom. In doing so, the president-elect is closing the circle with the man who brought him back into the spotlight 20 years ago as a television personality and saved him from financial collapse as a businessman. 'With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday. Burnett is part of the production team of successful reality shows such as 'Survivor' and 'The Voice,' but is particularly recognized as the one who executed the production of 'The Apprentice' and led it to tremendous prosperity on the NBC network from its rise in 2004 until its decline after 15 seasons in 2017. He was responsible for casting Trump, then a well-known businessman and a fading New York real estate mogul. Two decades later, the president-elect expressed his appreciation for this success. 'Mark was known as the creator and producer of some of the greatest television shows ever, most notably 'The Apprentice,' and it's worth mentioning that he won 13 Emmy Awards.' Over the years, Trump has praised Burnett for his contributions to his career in the entertainment industry and, according to one of the producers of 'The Apprentice,' Bill Pruitt, the Trump's public image was shaped by the show. 'We created a myth,' he said in an interview this year. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Burnett, who also previously served as president of MGM Studios, thanked Trump for his selection in a statemen:. 'I am truly honored to serve The United States of America and President Trump as his Special Envoy to the United Kingdom.' As the president's special envoy, Burnett's appointment does not require Senate confirmation. This is in contrast to the expected appointment of banker Warren Stevens, one of Trump's major donors, who was selected to serve as the United States ambassador to London. Why is a special envoy from the president needed in the United Kingdom, with which the United Kingdom has had normal relations for years? According to the appointment statement, Burnett 'will work to strengthen international relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities and cultural exchange.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1hb58rbyx	2024-12-22T00:50:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/22/r1hA0mHSkl/r1hA0mHSkl_0_46_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
