Lawmaker proposes bill to deport regime supporters among asylum s...	Knesset member Yulia Malinovsky of the Israel Beitenu Party introduced a bill on Sunday to deport asylum seekers who support the regime in their home country. The proposal states that regime supporters would be deported to their country of origin or a third nation, regardless of criminal activity. 'There is no logic in granting asylum to those whose lives aren’t at risk in their home country,' Malinovsky said. Last month, it was reported that the Eritrean government paid bail for detained regime supporters in Israel linked to violence, theft and vandalism.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkuipjhr1x	2024-12-22T06:19:09-08:00	
Houthis claim downed US F-18 jet in Yemen	Houthi forces successfully thwarted an attack by the U.S.-UK coalition in Yemen on Saturday night, the Iranian-backed rebel group's military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, claimed Sunday evening. According to Saree, the Houthis targeted the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and multiple destroyers using eight cruise missiles and 17 drones. He alleged the operation resulted in the downing of an F-18 jet, forcing enemy aircraft to retreat from Yemeni airspace and causing the coalition’s attack to fail. The U.S. has not confirmed the claims.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rywgtsrbyl	2024-12-22T06:17:39-08:00

Jerusalem residents charged with spying for Hezbollah	Abed Al-Salam and Taar Asili indicted for contact with foreign agent and sharing intelligence with Hezbollah operative during war; prosecutors seek their detention until trial The State Prosecutor’s Office filed an indictment Sunday against two Jerusalem residents, Abed Al-Salam, 33, and Taar Asili, 35, alleging they collaborated with a Hezbollah operative and provided sensitive information to the terrorist organization during the war. One of the defendants also faces charges of attempting to carry a weapon without a permit. The indictment claims the two men made contact with a woman identified as Dania through a WhatsApp group. Despite learning she was a Hezbollah operative, they continued sharing information with her. Al-Salam allegedly sent her photographs of the Caesarea area at her request, while Asili provided news articles about Israel and its security situation. The indictment further details that the men were instructed to establish contact with a senior Hezbollah intelligence figure known as 'Al-Hajj.' Asili reportedly purchased a new SIM card for this purpose but refused a request to take photographs near the northern town of Metula which lies on the Lebanese border. Additionally, Al-Salam is accused of being photographed holding a weapon during a visit to Jenin in the West Bank, with the weapon belonging to a local individual identified as 'Abu Kharb.' Both men are charged with contact with a foreign agent and providing information to the enemy. Al-Salam faces an additional charge for attempting to carry a weapon without a permit. Prosecutors have requested their detention until the conclusion of legal proceedings.

Last week, authorities revealed the arrest of Ardler (Israel) Amoyal, 23, from Jerusalem, who is suspected of contacting Iranian intelligence agents and completing security-related assignments in exchange for payment. Earlier this month, Artyom Zolotarev, 33, of Nof HaGalil, was arrested on suspicion of working for Iranian intelligence. His alleged tasks included arson and spraying graffiti, and his arrest came during a joint operation by Shin Bet and police. In October, seven Israelis of Azerbaijani descent were accused of maintaining contact with Iranian operatives over two years. Some allegedly provided intelligence on military bases that were later targeted by Iranian missile strikes and trailed a senior Israeli official in a potential assassination plot.

Zelensky says Ukraine's membership of NATO is 'achievable'	Ukraine's membership of NATO is 'achievable,' but Kyiv will have to fight to persuade allies to make it happen, President Volodymyr Zelensky told Ukrainian diplomats in a speech on Sunday. Ukraine has repeatedly urged NATO to invite Kyiv to become a member. The Western military alliance has said Ukraine will join its ranks one day but has not set a date or issued an invitation. Moscow has cited the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO as one of the principal justifications for its 2022 invasion. Kyiv says membership in the Western alliance's mutual defense pact, or an equivalent form of security guarantee, would be crucial to any peace plan to ensure that Russia does not attack again. 'We all understand that Ukraine's invitation to NATO and membership in the alliance can only be a political decision,' Zelensky told diplomats at a gathering in Kyiv. 'Alliance for Ukraine is achievable, but it is achievable only if we fight for this decision at all the necessary levels.' Zelensky said allies needed to know what Ukraine can bring to NATO and how its membership in the alliance would stabilize global relations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjime9sryl	2024-12-22T04:31:33-08:00	
Estimated damage from Houthi missile that hit central Israel scho...	Missile caused heavy damage to the elementary school near Tel Aviv, despite being 'partially intercepted' Once again, there has been huge damage from rockets falling on Gush Dan in central Israel. The damage from the missile fired from Yemen at an elementary school in Ramat Efal neighborhood of Ramat Gan amounts to approximately 40 million shekels, according to estimates by the Tax Authority. The heavy damage was caused mainly to the school and also to nearby buildings and apartments, Ynet has learned. In comparison, a missile from Iran that hit the prestigious C&S residential complex in northern Tel Aviv on October 1, right before Rosh Hashanah, caused enormous damage to the apartments and restaurants there, which, as reported by Ynet, amounted to approximately 50 million shekels. Only a few weeks ago, repairs were completed at the site and the restaurants, including the famous Turquoise, reopened to diners. Compared to the heavy damage caused in Ramat Efal over the weekend from the missile that the IDF determined was 'partially intercepted,' the damage from the missile that was not intercepted at all and hit a public park in Jaffa on Friday night likely will amount to 'only' a few million shekels, with most of the damage caused to the park itself, as well as broken windows and damage to furniture in hundreds of apartments and businesses in the area. The Tax Authority told Ynet that the current estimate is that about 350-400 claims will be filed by residents in the area.

Gunmen in the streets, snipers on the rooftops, shooting all the ...	Rare clash between Palestinian Authority security forces and the armed Jenin Brigades in the West Bank city as observed by the Washington Post; The PA hints at a similar model in Gaza Jenin Brigades fighters race through alleys flooded with sewage to evade the gunfire that echoes all around. 'Quickly,' one of the fighters urges his comrades as they pass through patrols and barricades of the Palestinian Authority security forces. 'Watch out,' another cautions at an intersection where an improvised explosive device had been planted. This could have been a response to the IDF raid on the city and the refugee camp in the northern West Bank, but instead it is a report after two Washington Post reporters witnessed up close a rare battle of the Jenin fighters against their internal enemy: the Palestinian Authority . It happened two weeks ago. After many years, Palestinian security forces launched an arrest operation in the crowded refugee camp in an attempt to regain control. The PA, supported by Western countries, is trying to prove that it can manage security in the limited areas it controls in the West Bank, as a reminder to the world that it also seeks to control the Gaza Strip the day after the war ends. The U.S. newspaper reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza as a governing body. However, according to a former senior Egyptian official who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity, Israel has agreed to let the Palestinian Authority manage the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt for a short period. The PA launched 'Operation Protect the Homeland' in November to retake control of Jenin camp by targeting 'outlaws' and those 'spreading chaos and anarchy and harming civil peace,' security forces spokesman Anwar Rajab told The Post. 'All these actions and policies undermine the work of the PA, and these groups give Israel an excuse to implement its plans in the West Bank.' According to Rajab, the 'achievements' of the operation included the arrest of dozens of wanted individuals, the injury of others, the detonation of dozens of explosive devices, and the advancement of important routes into the refugee camp. The security forces killed three people during the operation: a gunman, a 19-year-old young man riding a motorcycle, and a 14-year-old boy. Still, both sides appear to be showing relative restraint, according to the report. 'Don’t want to see a single drop of blood being shed' According to the Ramallah Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between terrorists and civilians, at least 21 people were killed in the long IDF raid on Jenin in September. The IDF said 14 terrorists were killed. The PA also occasionally clashes with armed Palestinians. Since the October 7 massacre, PA security forces have killed 13 Palestinians, including eight in total in Jenin. 'We don't want to see a single drop of blood shed,' Sabri Saidam, an advisor to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and a member of his Fatah central committee, told The Washington Post. 'What we would like to achieve is a state of calm, to sit down with different factions and agree on the way forward.' A senior Palestinian source close to the PA chairman said on condition of anonymity that Abbas has decided that the Palestinian Authority will 'impose its authority and there is no turning back.' But two weeks after the PA operation began, gunmen are still roaming freely in the Jenin refugee camp. The sound of gunfire can be heard around the clock. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has closed schools, and businesses are also closed. In some of the neighborhoods, which were badly damaged in the Israeli raid in September, some families were left without electricity and water for days, according to the report. Masked security personnel patrol the government hospital in Jenin. Snipers are stationed on the roof to prevent armed men from trying to hide in its grounds, a hospital source said. The Post's reporters heard gunfire from the roof. The source said several bullets pierced a window in the office, and patients and staff are afraid to come. There is an enormous amount of anger at the security forces in the West Bank. Their men operate in a limited area and, according to agreements with Israel, they are not allowed to deal with violence from settlers and, of course, IDF raids. Many Palestinians see the forces as subcontractors of Israel and a tool of Abbas for corruption and the suppression of internal opposition. '24 hours later there will be someone new in their place' 'The people want ‘law and order’, but apply the law right and people will stand with you,' said Arwad, 35, who spoke on the condition his last name be withheld out of concern for reprisal from Palestinian and Israeli authorities. 'When the Israeli soldiers and jeeps come here, where is the law?' Arwad's brother and father are in Israeli prison. Other relatives of his were killed by IDF fire. Even if the authority arrests wanted terrorists, he said, 'the resistance will continue. Twenty-four hours later there will be someone new in their place.' According to Rajab, the operation in Jenin targeted suspects wanted for criminal offenses, including shooting at hospitals and making explosive devices. He said this escalated when gunmen stole and burned two security force vehicles, and a car bomb exploded near a police station. On the ground, attempts were made to mediate a cease-fire between the gunmen and the security forces but, according to Firas Abu al-Wafa, Fatah's secretary-general in Jenin, the PA refused to compromise. Saidam said talks continue and 'the security apparatus is adamant to impose law and order.' Wafa added that 'If the situation in Jenin stabilizes, then the whole West Bank will be stable.' But if it doesn’t, 'there will not be stability across the West Bank.'

Israel's missile defense under scrutiny: Successful Houthi strike...	Two failed interceptions of Houthi missiles launched from Yemen within two days raise concerns about Israel's missile defense; A strike in Jaffa injured 12, while experts highlight technical challenges, delayed alarms and Iran's involvement in arming the Houthis with advanced weaponry; 'Not only do we learn from interceptions, but so does the other side' Over two days, two attempts to intercept Houthi missiles launched from Yemen failed. On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, the IDF claimed to have achieved a partial interception of the missile, though its warhead exploded and struck a school in Ramat Efal, near Tel Aviv. By the night between Friday and Saturday, it was already clear the interception attempt had failed: several interceptors launched at the ballistic missile missed their target, and it hit the center of a public park in Jaffa, injuring a dozen people and causing damage to nearby apartments. 'The fire is scattered; I don’t see an escalation. But it’s evident that even a single missile heading toward central Israel sends many people into shelters,' said Tal Inbar, an expert in aviation, space and missile policy, and a senior research fellow at the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, during an interview with Ynet studio on Sunday morning. 'Every interception is analyzed. The more interceptors are deployed, the better the performance of the systems becomes,' he added. Inbar also referred to the Houthis’ capabilities. 'I don’t know of a reliable source that can specify the number of missiles they possess, but we do know the types of missiles. Ultimately, this is Iranian import, guided deeply by them. Not only do we learn from interceptions, but so does the other side.' Brigadier General (Res.) Ran Kochav, former commander of the Air Defense Array, stated: 'The cases are different, but the proximity is no coincidence. Both are Iranian missiles launched by the Houthis. In the first case in Ramat Efal, despite the partial interception and the approximate hit on the missile, significant parts, including the warhead, fell. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but there was significant damage. On Saturday morning, however, there was a miss – a significant failure without interception. There was a late warning, and the missile hit the ground.' However, Kochav asserted that he does not believe this incident indicates the use of advanced weaponry. 'When there’s an interception success rate of approximately 90%, one out of every 10 launches fails to be intercepted. Over 37,000 rockets and missiles have been launched toward Israel from Yemen, Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. Sometimes it’s a technical malfunction; other times, operational error.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Kochav addressed the delayed alarms in Jaffa and its surroundings. 'There’s a mutual responsibility between civilians and the Home Front Command, and this time it was a malfunction – perhaps even human error. The warning time provided was shorter than required, and it’s very possible that this needs to be extended or corrected. Generally, there’s always a dilemma about when and how to activate the warning,' he said. 'I trust my colleagues in the Air Force to improve. I don’t believe the guidelines for civilians need to change, but this issue should be addressed within the military, within the Home Front Command,' he concluded, adding: 'This pattern of the Houthis firing at us every day or two must stop. I’m not sure the answer lies in tit-for-tat responses.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1mzaprbyl	2024-12-22T02:24:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/rkmraUNB1g/rkmraUNB1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Turkey believes Syria's new rulers, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) armed group which Ankara backs, will drive Kurdish YPG fighters from all territory they occupy in northeastern Syria, Defense Minister Yasar Guler said on Sunday. Turkey regards the Syrian YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for 40 years and are deemed terrorists by Ankara, Washington, and the European Union. 'We believe that the new leadership in Syria and the Syrian National Army, which is an important part of its army, along with the Syrian people, will free all territories occupied by terrorist organizations,' Guler said during a visit to Turkish troops on the Syrian border with military commanders. Ankara has demanded the Syrian Kurdish fighters disband, and has called on Washington to withdraw its support. The U.S. military acknowledged last week it has 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria, twice as many as it had said previously.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qptvbbjx	2024-12-22T01:46:52-08:00

Trump appoints 'The Apprentice' producer as special envoy to UK	President-elect has appointed Mark Burnett as his special envoy to the UK; The producer is also behind the shows 'Survivor' and 'Shark Tank,' and also served as chairman of the MGM television company; Trump: 'Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role' President Donald Trump is in the midst of selecting a cabinet for his return to the White House on January 20, and the process is looking more like a reality TV show than good governance. After announcing the nomination of Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary and the appointment of another Fox News host, Dr. Mehmet Oz, as the head of the U.S. Health Insurance Administration, Trump announced the appointment of 'The Apprentice' producer Mark Burnett as his special envoy to the United Kingdom. In doing so, the president-elect is closing the circle with the man who brought him back into the spotlight 20 years ago as a television personality and saved him from financial collapse as a businessman. 'With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday. Burnett is part of the production team of successful reality shows such as 'Survivor' and 'The Voice,' but is particularly recognized as the one who executed the production of 'The Apprentice' and led it to tremendous prosperity on the NBC network from its rise in 2004 until its decline after 15 seasons in 2017. He was responsible for casting Trump, then a well-known businessman and a fading New York real estate mogul. Two decades later, the president-elect expressed his appreciation for this success. 'Mark was known as the creator and producer of some of the greatest television shows ever, most notably 'The Apprentice,' and it's worth mentioning that he won 13 Emmy Awards.' Over the years, Trump has praised Burnett for his contributions to his career in the entertainment industry and, according to one of the producers of 'The Apprentice,' Bill Pruitt, the Trump's public image was shaped by the show.

This is in contrast to the expected appointment of banker Warren Stevens, one of Trump's major donors, who was selected to serve as the United States ambassador to London. Why is a special envoy from the president needed in the United Kingdom, with which the United Kingdom has had normal relations for years?

US fighter jet shot down over Red Sea in apparent friendly fire i...	F/A-18 shot down during US attack against the Houthis; 2 US pilots rescued alive; This is the most serious incident to endanger American soldiers in more than a year of operations against the Houthis in Yemen; Overnight, U.S. warplanes targeted Houthi military sites Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent 'friendly fire' incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become over the ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. military’s Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn’t specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. 'The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,' Central Command said in a statement. From the military’s description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the 'Red Rippers' of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. It wasn’t immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past. Since the Truman’s arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen that the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a 'missile storage facility' and a 'command-and-control facility,' without elaborating. Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. The Houthis later acknowledged the aircraft being shot down in the Red Sea. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.

The US attacks came less than a day after a Houthi missile evaded Israeli defenses and landed in Tel Aviv. Overnight between Saturday and Sunday, Israeli fighter jets were recorded flying at low altitude in the Gush Dan area to patrol against Houthi drones following the increasing number of launches by the Houthis in recent days. On Saturday, half a day after the launch of the missile that caused extensive damage in Jaffa and injured 16 people, a combat helicopter intercepted a drone, likely launched from Yemen. On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, at the same time as a Houthi missile hit a school in in the Ramat Gan neighborhood of Ramat Afal, Israel attacked for the third time since the start of the war in Yemen - and for the first time in the capital Sanaa. Dozens of fighter jets and other aircraft flew some 2,000 kilometers in that attack. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1lt47bh1g	2024-12-21T20:50:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/05/20/9255056/9255056_55_0_1191_670_0_small.jpg
Turkey will do 'whatever it takes' if Syria can't address Kurd mi...	Turkey will do 'whatever it takes' to ensure its security if the new Syrian administration cannot address Ankara's concerns about U.S.-allied Kurdish groups it views as terrorist groups, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Saturday. Turkey regards the YPG, the militant group spearheading the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for 40 years and are deemed terrorists by Ankara, Washington, and the European Union. Hostilities have escalated since the toppling of Bashar al-Assad. In an interview with France 24, Fidan said Ankara's preferred option was for the new administration in Damascus to address the problem in line with Syria's territorial unity, sovereignty and integrity, adding that the YPG should be disbanded immediately. He also said Turkey was not in favor of any foreign bases, including Russian ones, remaining in Syria, but that the choice was up to the Syrian people.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1poaghhyx	2024-12-21T20:10:13-08:00

Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels at the time. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. 'The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,' Central Command said in a statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byqq2gsb1l	2024-12-21T20:00:41-08:00

The operation also saw the downing of multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rknok3eske	2024-12-21T12:59:18-08:00	
Second Arrow needed': IDF reviews strategy amid Houthi escalatio...	After 2 failed Houthi missile interceptions, senior official urges policy shift: 'Misses can happen, but the solution is launching an additional interceptor'; officials say no advancements in Houthi capabilities detected, but Yemeni rebels 'centers of gravity' remain elusive 'The moment the first missile missed, a second one should have been launched,' a senior IDF official said Saturday evening following the investigation into the failed interception of a missile fired from Yemen, which struck Tel Aviv, causing extensive damage. The official added that the same approach should have been applied in Thursday's attack, when a Houthi missile caused significant damage to a school in Ramat Efal. Ynet has learned that in the past, the Arrow air defense system has fired a second missile against ballistic missiles like those fired by the Houthis toward Israel. The Israeli air defense array’s recent hiccups necessitate a reassessment of interception policies. According to sources familiar with the issue, the last two incidents did not involve an upgrade in Houthi capabilities or weaponry. However, the Yemeni terror group is believed to be learning and improving, which demands a similar response from the IDF. Until now, defense officials have been cautious about launching a second interceptor due to practical concerns: each Arrow missile costs millions of dollars, alongside other operational considerations that remain classified. Still, no such policy is set in stone. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We should have acted differently, and we will adopt a broader interception policy,' a senior defense official said. 'We've made progress in threat analysis. Misses can happen, but the solution is launching an additional interceptor. Both today and Thursday, it’s likely that a second missile would have hit the target.' Military Intelligence had assessed that the Houthis would escalate their attacks on Israel following the Israeli Air Force’s strikes in Yemen, a prediction that has already materialized. The IDF now expects the pace of missile and drone launches to increase further. On Saturday afternoon, another drone, likely launched from Yemen, was intercepted after entering southern Israel near the Gaza border. A dramatic video captured an attack helicopter firing on the drone, which exploded mid-air. Earlier in the week, another Houthi drone was intercepted off the coast of Tel Aviv on Thursday, while both a missile and a drone were shot down on Monday. According to the IDF, the Houthis have fired over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel since the war began, most of which were intercepted or failed to reach Israeli territory. Learning from past attempts, the Houthis have altered their drone routes. Whereas they previously approached central Israel via the sea, drones are now entering through the Sinai Peninsula into Gaza and then targeting southern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel is seeking a more effective response, focusing on identifying so-called 'centers of gravity' to neutralize. However, no definitive targets have been identified yet. Attention is now shifting to January 20, when Donald Trump is set to assume office, raising hopes that his administration might increase pressure on the Houthis. While the United States, alongside Britain, launched airstrikes in Yemen this week, the Houthis appear undeterred. The concept of 'deterrence' holds little weight in the Houthi playbook. The IDF itself cannot yet engage in full-scale combat against the Houthis, making international coalition-building essential. Such a coalition would address a threat that impacts global shipping lanes and the world economy. It is unlikely that a challenge with global ramifications can be resolved by debating whether Israel launches one or two Arrow missiles. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkbz434hkg	2024-12-21T12:53:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/ryxmS14B1g/ryxmS14B1g_1_32_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israeli military operation in Syria ‘wise and correct,’ Druze lea...	‘Proud Israeli’ Majdal Shams Mayor Dolan Abu Saleh: 'I love to be part of society in the State of Israel… we want this feeling to be mutual and not one-sided' Israelis across the country were shocked last week by news of the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime and of the Israeli military occupation of certain areas of Syria. This development reverberated strongly in Majdal Shams, a Druze town on the Golan Heights that has been under Israeli control since 1967. The Media Line sat down with Majdal Shams Mayor Dolan Abu Saleh for an exclusive interview about how Israel’s Druze population is reacting to these events. Majdal Shams is considered the unofficial Druze capital of the Golan Heights and is home to nearly 12,000 residents, all of whom are Druze. Druze people make up the majority of the 24,000 Arabs living throughout the Golan. An additional 100,000 or so Israeli Druze live outside of the Golan in northern Israel and around Haifa. The town’s ties to Syria run deep. For many families, there are relatives on the other side of the border, creating a complex set of loyalties and concerns. Abu Saleh, now in his fourth term as mayor, spoke at length about the dramatic changes in Syria and their impact on the Druze community. 'For every family here, there’s family on the other side,' he said, stressing the deeply personal nature of these political shifts. He described the fall of Assad as a transformative event, noting, 'The people here are very, very happy that the dictator, the murderer of the people, is no longer in power. They hope there will be a new Syria of peace, humanity and human rights.' Concerns heightened in Majdal Shams after the terrorist atrocities of October 7, 2023. 'Until October 7, the civil war in Syria did not pose a significant threat to residents of the Golan,' Abu Saleh said. After that date, people worried about possible infiltration from Syria. 'Hezbollah operated freely in Syria under Assad,' he noted, explaining why residents feared that violence could spill over the border. 'All this time, we saw cooperation between Hezbollah and Assad,' he said. The fall of Assad also brought the Druze community’s historical questions of loyalty and identity into sharper focus. When Israel occupied the Golan Heights in 1967 and annexed the territory in 1981, it offered Druze residents Israeli citizenship, but many continued to identify as Syrian. Today, Druze in the Golan remains eligible for Israeli citizenship, and the number of applicants has grown in recent years. Data from 2022 show that around 20% of Majdal Shams residents hold Israeli citizenship, while the rest have permanent residency without citizenship. Abu Saleh described himself as 'a proud Israeli citizen,' explaining that Israel provides security and a high standard of human rights. 'I love this place very much. I love to be part of society in the State of Israel,' he added. 'Both personally and as a community, we want to feel an indivisible part of the State of Israel, not only in name, but also through receiving budgets and sharing resources from the state, and that this feeling will be mutual and not one-sided.' Before discussing the broader historical context, Abu Saleh outlined his personal and political journey. He has served two terms as an appointed council head before being elected in Majdal Shams’ first and subsequent elections, now totaling four terms in office. He explained that the local council is administered under the Interior Ministry and that the town receives funding from Israeli government offices, just like any other local authority in Israel. Majdal Shams drew wider attention in July 2024, when a Hezbollah rocket attack killed 12 children in the town. Abu Saleh called it 'a great human tragedy,' adding that some of those wounded remained hospitalized for months. The community received substantial philanthropic support from Israeli organizations and from the Jewish community abroad. 'Many philanthropic actors came and embraced the families,' he said. This sympathy and support contributed to the sense that the Druze of Majdal Shams are integral to Israel’s fabric, not simply because of geography, but because of shared values and security concerns. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Regarding current security measures, Abu Saleh said the town works closely with local Israeli military divisions and the military’s Home Front Command, sometimes going beyond the official guidelines. Only about 60% of homes in Majdal Shams have bomb shelters, and the municipality is aware that more must be done to protect residents. He praised Israel’s decision to enter Syria to create a buffer zone, calling it 'a wise and correct step' to protect Israeli citizens before threats cross into the country. Israel’s actions in Syria have drawn criticism from countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, but Abu Saleh defended the move. 'The State of Israel needs to create a barrier that will protect its residents and citizens,' he said. 'If the State of Israel is threatened in the future, it can manage the war outside its borders. That means that before its residents and citizens are harmed, it will be there to protect them.' Before the outbreak of Syria’s civil war, Druze students from the Golan often attended Damascus University. Abu Saleh acknowledged that it was a positive experience for many at the time, but today, he favors Israeli academia. He believes that Golan Druze who complete their studies in Israel, have an easier time joining the Israeli labor market. Residents of Majdal Shams now work in fields such as medicine, engineering, construction, high-tech and civil service, and most families also engage in agriculture. He emphasized that women in Majdal Shams play an active role, holding many central positions in local government and making up at least half of those working in professional fields. Abu Saleh’s eldest daughter is preparing for an academic career, and his wife runs the family business. He called for more factories and high-tech firms to set up locally, creating opportunities for women who prefer to work close to home. Regarding Syria’s future under the de facto leadership of Abu Mohammed al-Golani, some Druze are worried, but Abu Saleh sees reasons for optimism. He noted that new authorities released prisoners and preserved government institutions, which may indicate a focus on human well-being. Still, he stressed the importance of ensuring that minority groups, like the Kurds, are not harmed and called for international dialogue with Turkey’s president to address concerns over Kurdish safety. Reflecting on his responsibilities as mayor during these tumultuous times, Abu Saleh acknowledged that the job is a great challenge. 'The whole world looks at how a leader acts in such a situation,' he said. 'We will continue to protect our residents and the State of Israel, which protects us, and work toward a future where everyone can thrive.' To mark the fall of the Assad regime, some residents of Majdal Shams raised the flag of the Syrian opposition last week. 'Seeing the Syrian flag fly in Majdal Shams instead of the flag of the Syrian regime is very different and very significant,' Abu Saleh said. 'But we, as a local authority that is under Israeli sovereignty, want to see here in the State of Israel the flag of the State of Israel, because the State of Israel is the one that gives us security.' 'I think that we all hope for a situation in which Syria will receive the flag of Israel in Damascus. Until then, we will think about cooperating in raising the flags in a friendly manner.'

Not Israel this time: Airstrikes rock Yemen’s capital Sanaa	Day after Houthi missile strike on Tel Aviv, international coalition bombs Houthi strongholds, with reports of explosions and fighter jets over Sanaa; strikes, targeting military sites, follow Israel’s third Yemen operation since war began Less than 24 hours after a Houthi ballistic missile struck Tel Aviv, Yemen's Houthi-affiliated Al-Masirah channel reported airstrikes in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, Saturday night. Hezbollah-linked Al Mayadeen reported a powerful explosion and sightings of fighter jets over the city. While some outlets, including Iraq’s pro-Iran Sabereen News, claimed the strikes were carried out by Israel, reports from Al Hadath and other sources indicated that an international coalition conducted the airstrikes targeting Houthi military positions. According to Al Hadath, the strikes hit three key locations in Sanaa, including fuel depots, power plants and other military targets. This followed Israel's own strike on Yemen earlier in the week, marking the third such operation since the October 7 war began and the first to hit the Houthi stronghold of Sanaa. In a statement, the IDF detailed that over 60 bombs were dropped during a mission involving dozens of aircraft covering nearly 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles). The IDF shared video footage of precision strikes on eight tugboats in Houthi-controlled ports, with audio of pilots confirming successful hits: 'Alpha, beautiful hit,' one pilot was heard saying. The operation, named 'White City,' aimed to cripple Houthi port operations, with strikes on Rass Isa, Hodeidah and Al-Salif. The IDF claimed a severe economic impact on the Houthis, though Reuters reported conflicting accounts, with sources in Hodeidah claiming port activity remains partially operational. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The strikes began at 3:15 a.m. with a first wave targeting coastal areas and a second wave at 4:30 a.m. on sites in Sanaa, involving 14 fighter jets. Power outages and significant damage were reported, with at least nine fatalities, according to local sources. The strike came just hours after a Houthi missile hit a school in Ramat Efal, collapsing the building. The missile was partially intercepted by the Arrow system, but its warhead exploded on impact. Since October 7, the Houthis have launched over 200 missiles and 170 drones toward Israel, most of which have been intercepted or failed to reach Israeli territory. While the IDF emphasized the strikes were planned weeks in advance and unrelated to the missile launch, they mark a clear escalation in efforts to dismantle Houthi military capabilities. The Houthis continue to claim they are undeterred, framing their actions as a campaign in support of Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1qp8inskl	2024-12-21T11:57:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/SJ00zroNr1g/SJ00zroNr1g_0_346_958_540_0_small.jpg

Pope calls Gaza airstrikes 'cruelty' after Israeli minister's cri...	Pontiff condemns Israeli actions in Gaza after Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli accused him of trivializing genocide for suggesting offensive bears genocidal traits Pope Francis on Saturday again condemned Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, a day after an Israeli government minister publicly denounced the pontiff for suggesting the global community should study whether the military offensive there constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people. Francis opened his annual Christmas address to the Catholic cardinals who lead the Vatican's various departments with what appeared to be a reference to Israeli airstrikes on Friday that killed at least 25 Palestinians in Gaza. 'Yesterday, children were bombed,' said the pope. 'This is cruelty. This is not war. I wanted to say this because it touches the heart.' The pope, as leader of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church, is usually careful about taking sides in conflicts, but he has recently been more outspoken about Israel's military campaign against Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In book excerpts published last month, the pontiff said some international experts said that 'what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide.' Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli sharply criticized those comments in an unusual open letter published by Italian newspaper Il Foglio on Friday. Chikli said the pope's remarks amounted to a 'trivialization' of the term genocide. Francis also said on Saturday that the Catholic bishop of Jerusalem, known as a patriarch, had tried to enter the Gaza Strip on Friday to visit Catholics there, but was denied entry. The patriarch's office told Reuters it was not able to comment on the pope's remarks about the patriarch being denied entry. The IDF said on Saturday the patriarch's entry had been approved and he would enter Gaza on Sunday, barring any major security issues. Aid from the patriarch's office entered last week, the military said. Israel allows clerics to enter Gaza and 'works in cooperation with the Christian community to make it easier for the Christian population that remains in the Gaza Strip — including coordinating its removal from the Gaza Strip to a third country,' a statement from the military said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk3plc4hje	2024-12-21T10:36:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/ByQFsuVryx/ByQFsuVryx_0_0_1365_769_0_small.jpg

‘The murderers aren’t scary at all, they’re as much victims as th...	At Neve Tirtza, Israel’s only women’s prison, a 17-year-old inmate shares a cell with an 80-year-old and a toddler who has spent his entire life behind bars; 'When women enter prison, their entire world falls apart,' says the commander, 'we provide tools to help them reintegrate into society' Neve Tirza, Israel’s only women’s prison, presents a complex reality of pain and rehabilitation. The facility houses a wide range of inmates, from mothers convicted of murdering their children to a young woman raising her baby within the prison walls. Recently, the institution made headlines for its crumbling infrastructure and outdated physical conditions. Now, we choose to focus on the human stories unfolding behind its peeling walls and rusted bars. A child who thinks prison is home The prison’s Savyon Wing, ironically named after the groundsel flower symbolizing bloom and growth, is one of the most somber areas in Israel’s corrections system. Here, women once known as 'mothers' are serving sentences for the unthinkable crime of murdering their children. Among them are Karina Bril, convicted of killing her two children in Jerusalem; Marie Pizem, sentenced for the murder of her daughter Rose, whose body was found in a suitcase in Tel Aviv’s Yarkon River; and Sigal Itskovich, accused of murdering her son in their Herzliya home. A short walk from the wing, at the end of a corridor, is a very different story. In a modest room with bunk beds and a crib, a young mother is trying to create a semblance of normalcy for her toddler during her relatively short prison term. The cracked gray walls are adorned with colorful childlike drawings—a small effort to brighten the bleak environment. Here, amid confinement, she struggles to maintain her role as a mother in a place where freedom has been taken from her. 'I’m serving 18 months and hope to be released early. It’s hard raising a child here, but I chose not to give up on being with him,' she explains. 'He was just 40 days old when he came to prison with me. The hardest part is that there are no other children here, and he doesn’t have experiences like other kids. But the most important thing is that he’s with me. My sentence is under two years, and the court approved this arrangement. Other mothers aren’t given this option.' 'All the inmates treat him like ‘the wing’s child.’ They play with him and are kind to him. I take him to routine checkups at the well-baby clinic with a prison escort. He watches TV, and the guards take him to the yard to play. He thinks this is his home,' she says. When asked about her fears of returning to prison in the future, she firmly responds: 'I will never come back here. When he’s 18, I’ll tell him about this time. He might ask about his childhood, and I’ll have to explain that he spent his first year behind bars.' Between violence and trauma Neve Tirtza’s wings are divided into specialized sections, each tailored to the diverse needs of its inmates and detainees. The Savyon Wing houses women without a history of drug use or those who have completed long-term rehabilitation. It primarily accommodates detainees serving lengthy terms and is known for its population of inmates with no disciplinary infractions. Other wings cater to various stages of detention and rehabilitation. Wing 1, referred to as the 'Advanced Wing,' is designated for inmates and detainees in the later stages of rehabilitation. In contrast, Wing 2 serves as an entry-level wing for newly detained women, including short-term detainees. This wing is deliberately devoid of televisions to prevent any risk of disrupting legal proceedings. The Therapeutic Wing (Wing 3) includes two specialized departments, each with 16 beds: the 'Circles' department focuses on addressing violence, while the 'Alma' department specializes in trauma treatment. Adjacent to this is Wing 4, a smaller ward serving as an intermediate step in the rehabilitation process. Wing 6, or the Rehabilitation Wing, is intended for inmates in the advanced stages of their sentences. Four women in this wing even participate in community work programs. The facility also includes Wing 8, a section for minors that allows for integration with adult inmates under court approval. A distinctive feature of Neve Tirtza is the integration of convicted inmates and detainees across all wings. This approach enables women, even before their trials conclude, to engage in educational and occupational activities, benefiting from therapeutic resources available within the prison from the early stages of detention. 'Inmates who had killed their own children help care for the baby' Y., a former inmate, shares her experience in prison: 'It wasn’t easy. I went through dozens of arrests, but this was unlike anything else. It was extraordinarily challenging. The physical conditions were harsh, especially the overcrowding. I was in a small, 10-square-meter room with four other women, and at times even five. For half the day, we were crammed in there together. 'I was placed with women who had committed minor offenses, but that didn’t make them easier to share a room with. There were thieves and con artists; our relationships were fine, but far from perfect. Honestly? The murderers weren’t scary at all. As women, we understand what might drive someone to commit such an act. They’re as much victims as they are criminals. 'One well-known inmate who killed her son, for example, went through a significant process. I spent many hours with her. She’s eager to tell her story, but getting approval for that is a massive challenge. If someone manages it, they’ll find a fascinating tale. She’s quiet and unassuming, not at all like the image of her as the ‘queen of the prison.’ Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'On my first day there, I was thrown into a completely different world from my normal life, and what I encountered shook me. The other inmates actually treated me with great respect. I thought they’d dismiss me as some snob who was there for a few weeks, but it was the opposite. They welcomed me warmly and made me a sort of ‘queen of the cell.’ They wouldn’t even let me wash the dishes or clean the floors.' 'Inmates who had killed their own children help care for the baby in the wing; his mother doesn’t fear letting them hold him. But even here, there are fears—not of the women themselves but of being transferred to lower-status wings where the conditions are unbearable' The day in prison starts early, at 5:30 a.m., with a headcount of the inmates. 'After that, we go back to sleep because there’s nothing else to do,' Y. says. At 6:30 a.m., breakfast is served – a cup of milk and cottage cheese. At 7:00 a.m., the cells are opened, and the women get ready and head off to their assigned tasks. 'At 10:30, we’re locked back in the cells until 12:30, and then we’re let out for lunch.' 'After lunch, there are ‘free hours,’ when we’re allowed into a small 14.5-meter yard surrounded by barbed wire fences. I tried going there a few times, but it was even more depressing than staying in the wing itself. I saw a mother showing her child birds through the fences – it was heartbreaking.' 'Mothers in the wing support each other, even when it comes to caring for the children. Inmates who had killed their own children help care for the baby in the wing; his mother doesn’t fear letting them hold him. But even here, there are fears—not of the women themselves but of being transferred to lower-status wings where the conditions are unbearable.' 'On my release day, I left quietly without telling anyone. We went to the bakery across from the prison, had a cappuccino, and then headed home. Life seemingly went back to normal, but it leaves a mark. For example, when I entered a mall and saw security guards, I instinctively raised my hands for a search. The experience leaves scars and thoughts that linger. I still worry about the women I left behind and feel like I’m living half here and half there. Sitting in the yard, surrounded by barbed wire, with other offenders was something I’ll never forget. Playing truth or dare between those fences and hearing stories that brought everything back up—it’s an experience that stays with you,' Y. recounts. 'The first time I saw children playing—I just cried' Vered Refaeli began her career as a prison guard at Neve Tirtza and came full circle when she was appointed its commander a year and a half ago. In a farewell interview, she highlighted the unique challenges of running Israel’s only women’s prison as opposed to other detention facilities. 'Unlike other facilities where cells are designated for detainees only, here we house both detainees and sentenced inmates. A prisoner remains here from the moment of arrest until release, which creates unique management challenges,' Refaeli explained. Refaeli joined the Israel Prison Service after a close friend shared her positive experience. 'From the moment I started, I knew this was my path. I aspired to return here as a commander. It’s a demanding 24/7 role, but I love what I do. I have support from home and manage to balance work and family,' she said. 'We are an executive authority, and I do everything I can to ensure that the inmates leave better prepared to rejoin society. The female inmate population here differs significantly from male prisoners,' she said. 'Men often belong to gangs or organized crime, while women tend to commit crimes due to emotional or situational distress. When they enter prison, their entire world falls apart. About 60% of the women here come from a background of prostitution, so this facility has a strong rehabilitative purpose. 'On the one hand, there’s discipline and clear rules, but on the other, we provide tools to help them reintegrate into society. There are success stories, but unfortunately, there are failures too. Some inmates are released only to return quickly to the cycle of prostitution and the streets, while others seize the opportunity with both hands.' Discussing the success of rehabilitation programs at the prison, Refaeli said, 'We are seeing more and more successes. The facts speak for themselves—recidivism rates among women are significantly lower than among men. This is particularly striking when you look at the big picture: out of 22,000 inmates in the Israel Prison Service, only 188 are women.' The challenges, however, remain complex and varied. 'Every inmate who arrives with media attention poses a unique challenge for integration into the prison wings,' she explained. 'But we are committed to treating everyone the same, regardless of the headlines their cases may have generated. I’ve seen high-profile inmates seamlessly integrate into wing duties and become just like everyone else.' For Refaeli, the most emotional moments come during family visits. 'Once a month, as part of a special program, children come to visit their mothers in prison. The first time I saw these visits—the laughter and the children playing—I just cried. As a mother, it really hit me,' she shared. These experiences, she admitted, have had a personal impact. 'I find myself asking more questions about everything, especially when it comes to children. My kids know about my work—they’ve even visited here. But yes, it’s something that leaves a mark. It messes you up a little inside.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjzo7k4rye	2024-12-21T10:09:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/Sysir00wNyg/Sysir00wNyg_0_91_1280_721_0_small.jpg
IDF: Sirens in Kibbutz Holit—false alarm		https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk5mmtvrkg	2024-12-21T08:59:50-08:00	
Slovenian broadcaster calls for Israel to be barred from Eurovisi...	The Slovenian public broadcaster formally urged the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) on Saturday to disqualify Israel from participating in Eurovision 2025, set to be held in Basel, Switzerland. In a letter to the EBU, the broadcaster cited ongoing political concerns as the basis for its appeal, becoming the first European nation to call for Israel's exclusion from the contest. Two additional proposals were reportedly raised in Slovenia: withdrawing from the competition if Israel participates or blacking out the screen during Israel's performance. However, these more drastic measures were shelved for now. The call follows a tense atmosphere surrounding Israel’s participation in Eurovision 2024, where several countries had pushed for Israel’s removal amid political tensions. Although those efforts failed, the Israeli delegation, led by singer Eden Golan, faced significant backlash throughout the competition. The EBU has not yet responded to the Slovenian broadcaster’s appeal. Eurovision 2025 is scheduled to take place in May, with delegations from dozens of countries expected to attend.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1kzfdnsyg	2024-12-21T08:22:00-08:00	
‘There’s no such thing as 100% protection, solution lies in offen...	For the second time this week, a missile from Yemen evaded interception; the IDF says lessons are being implemented, while experts stress it’s too early to draw conclusions; 'Results align with statistical expectations; it’s a journey and there's no end in sight yet' On Thursday, the IDF said that it scored a 'partial interception' after the warhead of a Houthi ballistic missile from Yemen exploded at a school in Ramat Efal, causing the building to collapse. However, in the latest missile launch early Saturday, it was clear the interception attempt had failed. Multiple interceptors fired at the missile missed their target, including the Arrow system. The missile struck a public park in Tel Aviv, narrowly avoiding a major disaster. Twelve people were lightly injured, and nearby apartments sustained heavy damage. The recent Houthi attacks serve as a stark reminder that the war is far from over and highlight the challenges Israel has faced in intercepting thousands of projectiles launched since the October 7 Hamas massacre. These include ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones launched from Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran and Yemen. While Iran has shown restraint in the wake of severe setbacks and concerns over Donald Trump’s return to the White House, fighting with Hezbollah has ceased under a truce, and Hamas’ military capabilities have been decimated. The Houthis, however, persist in what they call a 'campaign of support' for Gaza. Even recent Israeli airstrikes in Yemen have not deterred further missile launches. Brig. Gen. (res.) Zvika Haimovich, a former commander of the Israeli Air Force's Air Defense Array, confirmed that unlike the incident in Ramat Efal, this time the interception attempt unequivocally failed. 'In this case, the clichés proved true—there’s no such thing as 100% protection or a foolproof guarantee,' Haimovich told Ynet. 'No matter how many weapons systems are involved—Arrow, David’s Sling or Iron Dome—success isn’t certain. You use every available tool for the specific threat, but you cannot ensure an interception in every scenario.' Despite the two interception failures, Haimovich emphasizes that the overall interception rate remains high and cautions against drawing premature conclusions. 'Two separate incidents happened close together in terms of time and the threat from Yemen. I wouldn’t link them or jump to far-reaching conclusions. We’re talking about dozens, even hundreds of launches—and over a broader time frame, the results align with statistical expectations,' he said. According to the IDF, the Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and 170 drones toward Israel since the war began on October 7 last year. Most were intercepted or failed to reach Israeli territory. Saturday afternoon, another drone that entered the Gaza periphery—likely launched from Yemen—was intercepted. A dramatic video showed an attack helicopter engaging the drone, which exploded mid-air. Earlier this week, a Houthi drone was intercepted off Tel Aviv’s coast, and both a missile and a drone from Yemen were shot down on Monday. 'We’ve been at war for 15 months, and it’s not going to end tonight,' Haimovich added. 'The systems have performed excellently so far and will continue to do so. This is a competition, a process of mutual learning between us and our adversaries—Iran, the Houthis and various militias. Each side is trying to stay one step ahead of the other. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'While the threat has evolved, so have our capabilities. Since the beginning of the war, our Iron Dome, Arrow and David’s Sling systems have shown significant improvement, thanks to this ongoing learning process. It’s a journey with a beginning, a middle and no end in sight yet.' The IDF said that the failed interception overnight is still under investigation, with some lessons already implemented in interception and alert systems. 'No further details regarding aerial defense activities and the alert system can be given due to information security considerations,' the military said in a statement. 'We emphasize that aerial defense is not hermetic and the public must follow the Home Front Command instructions.' Brig. Gen. (res.) Doron Gavish, also a former Air Defense Array commander, explained the process behind the system's operations: 'The air defense array functions in stages. First, the target is detected. Then, its type is identified, followed by the interception process. The initial stages worked as intended, which is why an alert was issued. However, the interception phase failed, likely due to a technical malfunction that caused the miss.' Gavish dismissed the possibility that a new type of missile had been used in the attack. 'What we encountered is the same missile from the same family that has been launched at Israel previously,' he said. 'Hundreds of missiles have been fired at Israel, and in the overwhelming majority of cases, the systems’ performance—especially the Arrow system—has been effective.' He emphasized that the incident underscores repeated warnings from the IDF that the public must adhere to Home Front Command instructions, as air defense systems are not foolproof. 'This is not a new threat,' he noted. Gavish argued that the solution lies not just in defense but also in offense: 'Defense is meant to mitigate the threat and save lives, but to truly address the enemy, offensive action is also necessary. We’ve seen the Air Force operating there, and in my view, if the Houthis continue launching missiles, this will not be the last strike.' Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai highlighted the difficulty of obtaining high-quality intelligence on the Houthis, given their distance from Israel. He stressed the urgency of quickly gathering intelligence to strike missile production and launch sites, noting that the Iran-backed Houthis have only a limited number of such facilities. On Israel’s interception challenges, Ben-Yishai pointed to the future deployment of the Iron Beam laser defense system, which will enhance the country’s air defense capabilities. Ben-Yishai outlined two potential reasons for the failed interception overnight. The first is that the missile was launched on a 'flattened' ballistic trajectory or from an unexpected direction, meaning Israel’s or U.S. warning systems in Saudi Arabia failed to detect it in time, leaving interceptors unable to maneuver effectively. The second, and more likely scenario, according to him, is that Iran has developed a maneuverable warhead. Such a warhead separates from the missile during the final third of its trajectory and maneuvers mid-flight—executing pre-programmed course changes—to hit its designated target. The warhead of any ballistic missile is hypersonic. Once it re-enters the atmosphere, it uses small rocket engines or fins for navigation during its maneuvering phase. This maneuvering, conducted at speeds of Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound), poses a significant challenge for air defense systems. Ben-Yishai noted that this could explain why the warhead of Thursday morning’s missile struck a building in Ramat Efal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjj1pv4ske	2024-12-21T08:09:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/21/rkmraUNB1g/rkmraUNB1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

How Iran recruits minors in Europe for attacks on Israeli targets...	Bloomberg reveals growing concern in Europe, especially Scandinavia, over Iranian operatives recruiting teens via social media to target Israeli sites; officials hope Iran’s setbacks may shift its focus to rebuilding internally instead of spreading terror In a series of unsettling incidents across Europe, young criminals, some as young as 13, are being recruited by Iranian-linked operatives to target Israeli and Jewish interests, according to a Bloomberg report. The report lists several disturbing incidents of teenagers and adolescents directed by their handlers to carry out such attacks. In Sweden, a 15-year-old boy attempted to locate the Israeli embassy with a loaded gun in a taxi, while in Gothenburg, a 13-year-old fired shots at an Israeli defense firm. In another case, a 16-year-old planted explosives outside the same facility. Authorities attribute these actions to Iran-affiliated actors exploiting local criminal networks to further Tehran’s agenda in Europe. The attacks, as reported by Bloomberg, underscore how Iran’s covert operations against Israel are extending beyond the Middle East, raising concerns among European governments about social tensions tied to immigration. Both Sweden and Norway have issued warnings about Iranian-backed operations, with Norway temporarily raising its terror alert in October and deploying armed police to its borders. The report notes that Iranian operatives are using social media platforms like Telegram, TikTok and WhatsApp to recruit minors and young adults, often from immigrant communities. Payments for these illicit activities range from €120 for a petrol bomb attack to €1,500 for an assassination. While some recruits are motivated by ideological frustrations over Israel’s actions in Gaza, others are drawn by financial incentives and, in some cases, are unaware they are acting on behalf of a foreign power. The Swedish Security Service confirmed instances of recruits being oblivious to their Iranian connections. 'There are cases where the proxies aren’t aware or don’t realize that they are acting on behalf of a foreign power,' the agency said in a statement earlier this year. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For example, a 15-year-old suspect targeting the Israeli embassy in Stockholm in May was intercepted by police before reaching his destination. The suspect had to call for directions to the embassy, highlighting the amateur nature of some of these plots. The incidents detailed in the report are part of a broader Iranian effort to destabilize Europe while maintaining its regional influence amid setbacks in its proxy network. The October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel prompted a severe Israeli response, weakening Iran’s regional allies such as Hezbollah and Hamas. Despite these losses, experts warn that Iranian-linked operations in Europe remain a significant threat. Peter Nesser, a terrorism researcher at Norway’s defense research institute, explained to Bloomberg that Iranian actors 'reach out to potential mercenaries on platforms like Telegram, TikTok or WhatsApp.' These platforms are also used to 'direct and advise recruits during their illegal operations.' One high-profile attack involved a 16-year-old in Sweden using homemade explosives against Israeli defense company Elbit Systems. The report notes that while investigations were unable to trace the financiers, prosecutors believe the attackers were acting under Iranian direction. Sweden’s immigrant communities, struggling with integration and economic disparity, have become fertile ground for recruitment. Around 20% of Sweden's population is foreign-born, with 40% of migrants reporting a lack of integration. Organized crime gangs, already entrenched in these communities, are being exploited by hostile state actors like Iran. Neighboring Norway has begun observing similar patterns, with warnings of 'Swedish conditions' becoming a regular feature in political debates. Norwegian authorities are increasingly concerned about the spread of youth-driven violence and gang recruitment. The report highlights how the rise in youth-driven violence has fueled support for far-right parties in Sweden and Norway. In Sweden, the far-right Sweden Democrats have influenced policies, including the introduction of youth prisons for offenders under 15. Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store has also pledged tougher measures on youth crime, while the opposition Progress Party is advocating stricter policies ahead of next year’s elections. As European governments navigate these challenges, warn that Iran might intensify its covert operations in Europe. Nesser told the publication that Tehran could either retreat to rebuild domestically or escalate attacks to project power abroad. 'They might also try to create more havoc,' Nesser said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyp9b8er1l	2024-12-21T05:53:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/05/30/B1h4FGINA/B1h4FGINA_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF helicopter intercepts suspected Houthi-launched drone over southern Israel, hours after ballistic missile struck following failed interception attempts; military says lessons from incident being implemented but declines to provide details Less than 12 hours after a ballistic missile from Yemen caused significant damage in Tel Aviv, alarms sounded again in southern Israel on Saturday, signaling another suspected attack from Yemen. The IDF confirmed that a drone penetrated Israeli airspace near the Gaza periphery communities of Talmei Eliyahu, Ein HaBesor and Gevulot. An IDF combat helicopter intercepted the drone, believed to have been launched from Yemen, with dramatic footage of the interception shared by officials. Meanwhile, the IDF provided preliminary findings from its investigation into the earlier missile strike on Tel Aviv's Jaffa quarter, which struck a residential area shortly after air raid sirens were activated. This marks the second Houthi missile to hit central Israel in three days, following a strike near Ramat Efal.

'The incident is still being thoroughly examined,' the military said, adding that some lessons learned from the event are already being implemented to improve interception capabilities and warning systems, though it did not disclose further details due to 'information security considerations.' Officials emphasized that while efforts to enhance air defense are ongoing, the system cannot guarantee full protection. '[T]he public must follow the Home Front Command instructions,' the IDF statement concluded. The missile strike on Jaffa caused extensive damage to buildings in the area, and six people were injured by shattered glass, requiring hospitalization.

The children’s voice: The 9-year-old leading Israeli advocacy	Ben Carasso, a fourth-grade student, proves that there is no minimum age required for supporting Israel on the international stage While many adults struggle with the challenges of Israeli advocacy, unexpectedly a nine-year-old boy from Tel Aviv manages to deliver the message in the most authentic manner possible. Ben Carasso, a third generation to Holocaust survivors, has decided to take a mission upon himself: to be the voice of Israeli children during the war. 'I may be nine years old, however, I carry a hundred years of family history on my shoulders. Ever since my great-grandfather made aliya', Ben says with a mature smile. 'I am familiar with my family’s past, which is inseparable from Israel’s and the Jewish people’s history'. Despite the national task, he has taken upon himself, Ben makes sure to emphasize being a child, like all children: 'I go to school, train in floor and apparatus gymnastics, meet with friends and go to the Scouts'. How do you combine childhood routine with a national mission? 'This is what intrigues children around the world', he explains. 'I am a child, just like them, but the war changes my whole routine. In my videos, I share the reality –from friendship with a child who was evacuated from Kiryat Shemona to the pain I feel about my friend’s father who was kidnapped and murdered in Gaza'. What would you like to be when you grow up? Perhaps an ambassador? 'There are many possibilities, but I will certainly continue to do everything for the benefit of Israeli public diplomacy'. How do you find the current Israeli public diplomacy status? 'It’s not simple. I see how our enemies attack us, even myself, through comments to the videos. There is a significant lack of knowledge and ignorance about us in the world. We have a lot of work ahead in spreading the truth, and the children’s voice must be heard'. Boundless advocacy Through English-language advocacy videos, Ben reaches audiences in many countries - from Canada to Australia to Brazil to Iran. One of his videos even reached half a million views, an impressive achievement that led to collaborations with senior Israeli advocacy leaders. This week, Ben will go aboard on an advocacy trip to London, where he will talk to schoolchildren and students about life in Israel and give them tools to deal with antisemitism.

Ben can approach a diverse audience, especially children and youth from around the world, with whom he speaks at eye level'. Eylon Levy, who was the 'National Public Speaker' during the war, adds: 'Ben is an ideal example of the civic outreach project. He proves that years of experience or academic degrees are not required to be an advocating ambassador for Israel - you just have to do it and be bonded with the right messages.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bjsycz4bye	2024-12-21T02:00:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/20/Hyl94Rszyl/Hyl94Rszyl_0_239_600_338_0_small.jpg

Loud explosion and shattered windows: Central Israel residents re...	Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis continue to threaten Israel after failed interception leads to ballistic missile landing near Jaffa playground and injuring 16; 'The sirens started but we didn't make it to shelter' For the ninth time this month, Yemen’s Houthis launched a missile or drone toward Israel, causing significant damage. Forty-nine hours after a ballistic missile hit Ramat Ef’al after being partially intercepted, attempts to intercept another ground-to-ground missile fired from Yemen failed Saturday overnight, resulting in a hit near a playground in Jaffa. Sixteen people received minor injuries, 21 were hurt on their way to shelters or suffered anxiety and the damage to nearby buildings was extensive. This took place despite the third Israeli Air Force strike in Yemen since the war began — and the first in the Houthis’ stronghold of Sanaa. Footage showed severe damage to apartments in nearby buildings, with debris scattered in a child’s bedroom and on a child’s bed. 'The siren started, but we didn’t make it to the shelter. There was a very loud explosion, all the windows shattered, the blinds broke and the bed was covered in glass. Everything’s ruined, everything’s broken,' said Dolly Tamar Eliyahu and Ben Nof, residents of one of the damaged buildings. Ezra Bador, another resident of the building, said: 'Just as I was heading to the shelter, there was a serious explosion resulting in broken blinds and windows. It’s terrifying. My balcony and bedroom sustained heavy damage. One of the windows completely fell out.' Karin Goldschmidt and Eden Tsesleski, who live in a neighboring building, recounted, 'We ran to the staircase on the third floor but didn’t make it to the shelter. It felt like the explosion was right above us — the whole building shook. 'After the explosion, we moved on to the shelter, waited for about 15 minutes, then came out to see the damage. The apartment was hit; all the glass is shattered.' Hadra Abu-Hatzeira, who lives near the impact site, said, 'The explosion happened before the siren sounded, so I didn’t make it to the shelter. The house shook and the windows shattered. It was frightening and shocking. 'My kids wanted to take me somewhere else but I refused — I’m staying here. My medication’s at home, I’m ill, and I won’t leave. The siren nearly made me faint; I have epilepsy. I’m terrified, but for now, I’m staying in the neighborhood.' Meir Ohana, a resident of a nearby building, recounted, 'I woke up to check on my cat and just then, there was a serious explosion. If I hadn’t gotten up, the glass would’ve shattered over my bed. We didn’t hear the siren — it was very faint.' He added that all residents of the building were evacuated following the strike. A paramedic from Magen David Adom’s (MDA) motorcycle unit, Yosef Kurdi, recounted: 'I was at home when I heard a loud explosion. I immediately went to the scene and saw extensive blast damage to the nearby buildings. Large MDA teams arrived quickly and we began scanning the buildings as the injured started coming out of their homes.' MDA paramedic Noam Weisbuch and senior paramedic Noa Shimoni added, 'The scene was complex because the blast damage affected apartments in the surrounding buildings. Initially, we treated several people with minor injuries from shattered glass and anxiety.' 'We searched the apartments, treated and evacuated 16 people who sustained minor injuries, including a 3-year-old girl and provided care to those suffering from anxiety,' they added.

US drops $10 million bounty on new Syrian ruler	US delegation meets Ahmad al-Sharaa in Damascus, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara Leaf calls him 'pragmatic' and voices hope for Syrian-led future; announcement follows US strike killing Islamic State leader in Syria Abu Yusif The United States announced Friday the removal of a $10 million bounty on Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of Syria’s jihadist movement. The decision came after Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf met al-Sharaa in Damascus, following his emergence as Syria’s de facto leader after President Bashar Assad’s ousting. 'We discussed the critical need to ensure terrorist groups cannot pose a threat inside Syria or externally, including to the U.S. and our partners in the region,' Leaf said. 'Based on our discussion, I told him that we would not be pursuing the Rewards for Justice reward offered.' Leaf emphasized the importance of unity and sovereignty, saying, 'We fully support a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that results in an inclusive and representative government which respects the rights of all Syrians, including women, and Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious communities.' She added that U.S. policy seeks to stabilize Syria economically and politically, free from Iranian and Russian interference. In a significant move, three senior U.S. diplomats, including Leaf, Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens and newly appointed Syria Special Advisor Daniel Rubinstein, visited Damascus for the first time in 12 years. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Their mission focused on engaging directly with Syrian civil society and new leadership as the country transitions post-Assad. The visit does not signal an immediate reopening of the U.S. Embassy, officials clarified, saying that recognition will depend on concrete actions by Syria's new leaders. Leaf described al-Sharaa as 'pragmatic' and said Iran would have no role in Syria’s future. 'Iran’s destructive influence has no place here, but Turkey will have a role due to its security interests as a neighboring country,' she added. The Biden administration had previously grappled with how to engage with Syria’s new leadership, given the designation of leading rebel groups as terrorist organizations. Leaf highlighted that the U.S. calls for an inclusive political process respecting human rights and minorities, noting internal pressure on Syria’s interim leadership to meet these demands in exchange for lifting sanctions. The U.S. State Department reiterated its commitment to supporting Syrians’ vision for their future and announced plans to engage directly with Syrian activists, civil society leaders and diverse communities to guide U.S. policy. Meanwhile, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) announced on Friday the elimination of Islamic State leader Abu Yusif in an airstrike in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor province. The strike, which also killed another Islamic State operative, was part of CENTCOM’s mission to disrupt terror networks. 'We will aggressively target these leaders and operatives, including those trying to conduct operations external to Syria,' CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla said, citing concerns over ISIS's intent to free more than 8,000 detained terrorists in Syria. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hynxwh7hje	2024-12-20T10:51:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/S17LLJB7Ekl/S17LLJB7Ekl_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Impossible without Shin Bet': IDF struggles to finalize probe in...	Senior IDF officers review only intelligence portion of October 7 probe, with issues like Air Force and Southern Command's roles pending; General Staff officials insist Shin Bet, responsible for monitoring Hamas SIM cards, must be included The IDF General Staff convened Friday to review the most sensitive investigation into the failures surrounding the October 7 Hamas attacks, focusing on the night leading into the assault. However, the presentation was only partially completed, addressing intelligence shortcomings but leaving operational issues—such as the actions of the Operations Directorate, Southern Command and the Air Force—unresolved. Tensions surfaced during the session, with senior officers criticizing the exclusion of the Shin Bet security agency from the process. 'It’s impossible to investigate the events of October 7 without Shin Bet,' a senior IDF official told Ynet. Shin Bet is primarily responsible for intelligence in Gaza, including the Hamas SIM card monitoring project—a key warning system that failed to signal the impending assault. 'We will not finalize this investigation without Shin Bet’s input,' the official added. Key figures scrutinized include IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Operations Directorate Head Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk, Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and then-Military Intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, who resigned over the failures. According to the IDF, responsibility for assessing the events fell largely to the Southern Command’s intelligence officer, who underestimated the attack as a localized raid rather than a full-scale war. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Discussions also highlighted that Southern Command chief Finkelman arrived at the command center only an hour after the attack began at 6:30 a.m., following an intelligence assessment that did not warrant heightened alert levels. Chief of Staff Halevi convened a situation assessment at 8 a.m., further delaying the involvement of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-defense minister Yoav Gallant until the attack was well underway. The Shin Bet has yet to present its findings, despite holding critical intelligence on Hamas’ shift to emergency protocols, as revealed through SIM card activity. This omission led to inadequate preparedness across IDF units, including Gaza Division forces. Concerns over revealing intelligence sources reportedly constrained Shin Bet’s warnings. Adding to the challenges, the IDF faces mounting pressure to conclude its broader investigations, including assessments of Southern Command, Gaza Division and specific border communities. Defense Minister Israel Katz had set a January deadline for completing the probes, but military officials now acknowledge they are unlikely to meet it. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkc064xs1x	2024-12-20T10:04:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/20/rJBk114mByl/rJBk114mByl_0_8_853_481_0_small.jpg

In first in-person contact, US officials meet Syria's HTS in Dama...	U.S. diplomats visiting Damascus held Washington's first in-person official meetings with Syria's new de facto rulers led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on Friday and discussed with the former al Qaeda affiliate the future of Syria's political transition. The United States, other Western powers and many Syrians were glad to see militias led by HTS topple President Bashar Assad, but it is not clear whether the group will impose strict Islamic rule or show flexibility and move toward democracy. Western governments are gradually opening channels to HTS and its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former commander of an al Qaeda franchise in Syria, and starting to debate whether to remove the group's terrorist designation. The U.S. delegation's trip follows contacts with France and Britain in recent days. The State Department's top Middle East diplomat Barbara Leaf, Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens and Senior Advisor Daniel Rubinstein, who now is tasked with leading the Department's Syria engagement, are the first U.S. diplomats to travel to Damascus since Assad's rule collapsed. 'They met with representatives of HTS to discuss transition principles endorsed by the United States,' a State Department spokesperson said. 'They also discussed regional events and the imperative of the fight against ISIS,' the spokesperson added. The delegation engaged with civil society groups and members of different communities in Syria 'about their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,' the spokesperson said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhgr7qbje	2024-12-20T08:11:46-08:00	
Germany denies citizenship to Syrian migrant over refusal to ackn...	Palestinian who lived in Syria until 2016 denied German citizenship after saying in interview, 'Israel is not a state'; court upholds decision, citing requirement to recognize Israel’s right to exist for citizenship approval A German court has ruled against granting citizenship to a Syrian migrant who refused to recognize Israel's right to exist, according to court records made public this week. The man, a Palestinian born and raised in Syria who moved to Germany in 2016, applied for citizenship in August 2022 in Regensburg, Bavaria. Despite passing the citizenship test in November 2022, German intelligence flagged the applicant for frequenting a Salafist mosque, displaying aggressive behavior in discussions with authorities and expressing extreme views toward Israel. In a follow-up interview in August 2023, the applicant said, 'There is no Israel. There are Jewish people, but Israel is not a state.' When pressed, he reiterated his stance, adding, 'I don’t want to talk about Israel anymore,' and hinted at his opinion that Jews should 'vacate the area for Arabs.' Despite multiple opportunities to revise his statements, he did not retract them. After his application was denied, the man claimed he recognized Israel as defined by the Oslo Accords but criticized Israel's policies in the so-called 'occupied territories.' His lawyer argued that the questions posed were 'leading and complex,' asserting his client was a 'tolerant and cosmopolitan individual' whose limited German language skills hampered his ability to address Israel's complicated history. The lawyer also maintained that anti-Zionism should not be equated with antisemitism. Regensburg authorities countered, saying the applicant showed 'no fundamental understanding of democracy,' and his refusal to recognize Israel’s existence reflected 'deep-seated anti-Zionist antisemitism.' The administrative court upheld the city’s decision in October, emphasizing that German citizenship requires alignment with the country's core values, including recognition of Israel’s right to exist under international law. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In his ruling, the judge noted, 'To obtain a German passport, individuals must accept Germany's moral obligations, including the recognition of Israel's existence.' This case precedes a new law enacted in June by Germany’s outgoing government, which mandates that citizenship tests include questions on Jewish life in Germany and Israel’s right to exist to safeguard Jewish security. The Regensburg decision aligns with the principles of the law, reinforcing its aims even before its implementation. Antisemitic symbols at the Christmas market An evangelical church in Darmstadt, Germany, has suspended Pastor Manfred Werner after antisemitic and anti-Israel items were displayed for sale at a 'Christmas Market for Peace and Anti-Colonialism.' Part of the market's proceeds were intended to support aid for Palestinians. The event, held last weekend and co-organized by the local evangelical community and the group Darmstadt for Palestine, featured items including maps of 'Palestine' that excluded Israel, symbols of Hamas—an organization banned in Germany—and stickers with slogans such as 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.' Another item displayed the phrase 'Never Again for Everyone,' drawing a parallel between the Holocaust and the situation in Gaza. The market also showcased red inverted triangle symbols associated with Hamas, which denies Israel's right to exist. Pastor Werner, who will miss Christmas services due to the suspension, reported receiving death threats following the incident. He apologized to his congregation and the local Jewish community, saying, 'Certain groups exploited our hospitality and naivety, pushing us into a position I have avoided my entire life.' The church has filed a police complaint, asserting that while it supports humanitarian aid for those in Gaza, it categorically rejects language delegitimizing Israel or supporting Hamas. However, church leaders faced criticism for not addressing the event's title, which labeled Israel as a colonialist force. Critics argued the incident could have been avoided if church organizers had reviewed the Instagram content of Darmstadt for Palestine beforehand. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycxqfqhjl	2024-12-20T07:05:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/06/17/10040891/10040891_0_57_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Katz also noted that despite advancements in long-range weaponry, 'elevation and control of key observation points remain vital.

Erdogan urges West, US to halt Israeli invasion of Syria	Speaking at Cairo summit of eight Muslim-majority nations in coalition's first meeting since fall of Assad, Turkish president declares Turkey has no intention of withdrawing from Syria Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that the U.S. and the West must prevent Israel from invading Syria. Erdogan was in Cairo for a summit of eight Muslim-majority countries, in their first sit-down since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad. He said Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan would soon be visiting Syria to work on the 'new structure' to be established in the country. 'If Syria establishes a truly stable structure with this new formation, it will, in my view, hold a very strong position in the Islamic world,' he said adding the Turkey will not leave Syria. In an interview with the BBC on Thursday, Syria's rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said his country was exhausted by war and posed no threats to the West or any of its neighbors. He claimed Israel should not be concerned over pro-Iran or Hezbollah militias on its borders. 'those threats are a thing of the past,' he said.

In a speech in the Turkish parliament on Friday, Gulistan Kilic Kocyigit, co-chair of the DEM Party, condemned the killing of the journalists. 'This attack is a crime against humanity,' she said.

The delegation will also seek information about U.S. journalist Austin Tice, who was taken captive during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2012, and other American citizens who went missing under Assad. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjtameqs1x	2024-12-20T06:34:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/17/SkxDrEHNp/SkxDrEHNp_0_216_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Air Force pilot on Yemen strike: 'After we release the munitions,...	Major D., 26, pilot describes Yemen strike as his longest mission, requiring problem-solving mid-flight, peak focus for a precise attack on Houthi targets and a safe return home after the high-stakes operation Major D. touched down at the Ramon Air Base at 5:30 a.m. Thursday, just as the sun rose, completing the longest flight of his career. The 26-year-old F-16 pilot had spent six hours in the narrow cockpit, flying 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) to Yemen for a precision strike while a ballistic missile headed in the opposite direction toward Israel. His jet was one of 14 aircraft participating in the operation targeting Houthi sites in Yemen. For the first time, strikes hit the capital Sanaa, alongside other coastal port cities. The mission involved five targets with dozens of components, obliterated by 80 heavy bombs. D. and his squadron prepared meticulously for the operation over two weeks. To endure the grueling hours in the air, D. prioritized rest, including a nap the afternoon before the flight, ensuring he was physically ready for one of the most perilous missions of his career. 'The main difficulty is performing at the critical moment during such a long mission, requiring me to stay sharp and alert at all times,' D. told Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth. 'The flight there was easier because there was plenty to do—inspecting weapon systems, navigating crowded skies and mid-flight refueling, which is always more challenging in the dark. Approaching within 10 meters of a refueling plane at night is no easy task,' he explained. During the mission, D. and his navigator faced a tense moment when a fuel tank malfunction indicator lit up. Far from Israeli territory, they had to resolve the issue mid-air to avoid delaying the operation. 'We practice many scenarios in advance because technical or operational issues often arise on such long flights,' he said, emphasizing the pilots' preparation for such contingencies. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The critical moment, the 'money time,' is when we release the munitions. There is no take two. Watching the bomb drop and strike the Houthi tugboats was a powerful experience,' he recounted. 'When I saw the bright light of impact, I knew I hit the target. After that, some of the tension eased, and during the return flight, we could chat about personal matters—both with each other and with the other pilots.' D. said he and the others did encounter anti-aircraft fire, despite Iran supplying the rebels with ground-to-air missile systems. 'An officer in the Air Force war room synchronized all elements of the operation, from intelligence to communications, armaments and aerial command,' he explained. 'This kind of mission demands precise coordination of dozens of factors, all condensed into a few tense hours.' Another challenge was avoiding contact with civilian aircraft. 'We didn’t know a missile had been launched at Israel at the same time we were heading to Yemen,' D. said, underscoring the complexities of operating in international airspace. Assessing the strike’s impact on oil and energy facilities posed additional hurdles. 'It’s harder to evaluate results when the targets are so far away, unlike in Lebanon or Gaza,' D. noted. 'In this case, we carried out the strike in a unique way and used open-source intelligence the next morning to confirm the results through reports and footage from Yemen.' D. remains resolute about future missions. 'If they want a war of attrition, they’ll get one. At least we hit our targets—and we have more in the bank.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rywiacgs1x	2024-12-20T04:02:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/S1mKSWfB1g/S1mKSWfB1g_0_66_1280_721_0_small.jpg
D. sat for six hours in his F-16 cockpit to hit targets in Yemen	26-year-old pilot says the strike on Houthis was the longest mission in his career that involved solving problems mid-fight and maintaining full alert to carry out a successful attack and fly safely home Major D. landed back in Tel Aviv at 5.30 AM on Thursday in his F-16 fighter jet, just as the sun was coming up over the Ramon airbase. The 26-year-old pilot had just completed the longest flight in his career thus far, sitting for 6-hours in a narrow cockpit and flying 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) from Israel, to attack in Yemen, while a ballistic missile was heading the other way, toward Israel. His jet, was one of 14 planes involved in the strike on Houthi targets in Yemen including for the first time, in the capital Sanaa located in the center of the country. There were five targets, with dozens of components, that were hit by 80 heavy bombs in the capital and in the port cities along the coast. D. and his mates prepared for the mission for two weeks. D. tried to get a good night's sleep before the strike including a nap in the afternoon ahead of the flight, to prepare his body for hours in the air and one of the more dangerous missions he had been assigned. 'The main difficulty is performing at the critical time in such an long mission, requiring me to be sharp and alert at all times,' he tells Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth. 'The way there was easier because there was quite a bit to do - inspection of the weapons systems, navigation in a crowded sky and refueling mid-flight which is always harder in the dark. Its no easy task to approach 10 meters at night in such a big plane,' he says. D. and his navigator had a tense moment when a light indicating a malfunction in the fuel tank was turned on. They had to fix the problem in the air, far from Israel, so as not to delay the mission. 'We practice many scenarios and reactions in advance because there are always technical or operational problems on such long fights.' He says the pilots are prepared for them. 'The money-time is when we drop the munitions. There is no take two. To see the bomb fall, and hit the Houthi tug-boats was a powerful moment,' he says. 'When I saw the bright light, I understood I hit the mark. Then some of the tension was released and on the flight back, we could talk about personal stuff, between ourselves and with the other pilots.' D. and the others did not encounter anti-aircraft fire although Iran supplied the Houthi rebels with ground-to-air missile systems. An officer in the Air Force war room prepared the pilots and synchronized the air control units and the aerial command plane that was on the mission. 'This kind of operation demands a precise connection of dozens of factors, intelligence, communications, computers, armaments, planning, information security – that are all concentrated into a few tense hours.' D. said another challenge was to avoid contact with civilian aircraft.

Israel’s regional war is over'	Chuck Freilich: 'We won this war, and it's a major success' Israel's regional war has come to an end, according to Chuck Freilich, senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) and former Deputy National Security Advisor. 'The war ended a long time ago—at least with Hamas and Gaza,' Freilich told ILTV News. 'I would say the war ended in Gaza in January, and since then, what we have had are a few limited operations.' Freilich noted that the conflict with Hezbollah concluded about a month ago, while Iran is currently weakened, and Syria's Assad regime has collapsed. 'We won this war, and it's a major success, especially if you consider the horrific way in which it began,' he said. 'Israel has done a great deal to ensure its security, I would say, for the medium to long term. And it's a huge achievement. We should start changing the discourse on these matters.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syrgfkqbyx	2024-12-20T03:56:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/10/H1zOo4So6/H1zOo4So6_0_162_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Should Israel maintain a civilian presence in Gaza for security?	Ariel Kahana: 'Once civilians live there, you gain support internally and, at times, even externally' If Israel wants to ensure the safety of its citizens in the south, it must maintain a civilian and security presence in Gaza, according to Israel Hayom diplomatic commentator Ariel Kahana. Speaking earlier this week to ILTV, as Israel nears a potential ceasefire-for-hostage deal with Hamas, Kahana emphasized that a presence in Gaza, similar to Israel's approach in Judea and Samaria, is crucial for national security. 'If you don’t have a civilian presence, at some point the international community pushes you out, or you want to avoid more casualties in Israel,' Kahana explained. 'Once civilians live there, you gain support internally and, at times, even externally.' Kahana expressed confidence that the hostage deal would move forward, with broad support from the Israeli Knesset. However, he cautioned that releasing hundreds of terrorists poses significant risks, as past experiences have shown. He pointed to October 7, orchestrated by terrorists released in 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit deal, as a stark reminder of these dangers. Shalit, an Israeli soldier, was captured by Hamas in June 2006 and held until October 2011. 'There is no doubt whatsoever that terrorists released from Israeli jails often return to terror, rebuild Hamas, or plan new attacks,' Kahana said. 'It’s a clear and undeniable risk.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjmrhrghkg	2024-12-20T03:03:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/29/r1vxmyrYR/r1vxmyrYR_0_77_736_415_0_small.jpg
World's oldest complete Ten Commandments tablet sold for over $5 ...	The buyer, who chose to remain anonymous, plans to donate the artifact to an unnamed Israeli institution The world's oldest complete Ten Commandments tablet has been sold at auction for over $5 million. The buyer, who chose to remain anonymous, plans to donate the artifact to an unnamed Israeli institution, according to Sotheby’s auction house in New York. The 155-pound marble slab, inscribed with the commandments in Paleo-Hebrew script, dates back to 300-800 A.D. It is the only complete example of its kind from antiquity. The final gavel fell after more than 10 minutes of intense international bidding, fetching a price far beyond expectations. The tablet was unearthed in 1913 during railroad excavations along Israel’s southern coast but was initially overlooked as historically significant. It served as a paving stone in a local home until 1943, when it was purchased by a scholar who recognized its importance. While the inscription closely follows the Biblical commandments familiar to both Jewish and Christian traditions, it omits the third commandment against taking the name of the Lord in vain. Instead, it includes a directive to worship on Mount Gerizim, a holy site for the Samaritan community. The donation to an Israeli museum will ensure this extraordinary artifact is preserved and accessible for future generations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkmencmbyl	2024-12-20T02:27:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/13/HJ00Z8DFEJe/HJ00Z8DFEJe_0_14_632_356_0_small.jpg
Is now the time to stop Iran's nuclear program?	Cliff May: ' think there’s a possibility for something to happen in a new Trump administration' Now is the moment for the Western world to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, says Cliff May of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. In an interview with ILTV News, May explained that with Hamas weakened and seeking a ceasefire, Hezbollah contained, and the Assad regime in Syria collapsing, this is the ideal time for Israel or the United States to 'totally destroy the Islamic Republic of Iran’s ability to make and deliver nuclear weapons.' However, May expressed doubt that the U.S. would take action under President Joe Biden’s leadership.

Proposed law seeks to block Palestinian statehood	While many Israelis and Knesset members oppose the creation of a Palestinian state, it’s unclear if incoming U.S. President Donald Trump shares this stance The Knesset's Land of Israel Caucus is set to push the 'Israel Security Law,' which would require at least 80 MKs to approve any agreement involving territorial concessions, including those in Judea and Samaria. This law aims to block the creation of a Palestinian state in future agreements. At the initiative of the Land of Israel Caucus, the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee, led by MK Simcha Rothman—who also co-chairs the Caucus—will soon hold hearings on a proposed bill to expand Israel's Referendum Law. The amendment would apply to all of Judea and Samaria, as well as to Israel's territorial waters. The bill, backed by 23 MKs from factions like Likud, Religious Zionism, Otzma Yehudit, Shas, and others, calls for Rothman to convene a special hearing to amend Israel’s Basic Law: Referendum. The amendment would require a referendum or a special majority of 80 MKs to approve any deal involving territorial transfers or the establishment of a Palestinian state. Notably, this law would close the loophole that allowed former Prime Minister Yair Lapid to transfer territorial waters to Lebanon in a previous agreement. While many Israelis and Knesset members oppose the creation of a Palestinian state, it’s unclear if incoming U.S. President Donald Trump shares this stance. Moreover, Saudi Arabia has made the establishment of a Palestinian state a condition for peace with Israel. If this bill progresses, international reactions, even from allies, will be worth watching.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy11ptamh1l	2024-12-20T02:03:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/22/HkWctMAGJg/HkWctMAGJg_0_139_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu to skip 80th anniversary of Auschwitz liberation fearin...	Polish deputy foreign minister tells daily newspaper his country is obliged to respect the rulings of the ICC which issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his then defense minister for alleged war crimes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend the ceremony marking 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz in Poland, out of concern he may be arrested after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes committed during the ongoing Gaza war, the Polish Rzeczpospolita daily newspaper reported on Friday. The paper quoted deputy Polish foreign minister Władysław Bartoszewski, responsible for coordination of the ceremony scheduled to take place on January 27 with the participation of dozens of world leaders who said, 'We are obliged to respect the decisions of the ICC.' Jews were the vast majority of victims in the largest of the Nazi death camps but despite that, the leader of the Jewish state will be absent from the ceremony, while dozens of other world leaders are expected to attend. The paper said Foreign Minister Gideon Saar would likely represent Israel on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, although some officials said Israel would be represented by Education Minister Yoav Kisch. According to the Polish newspaper's report, Israeli authorities did not even request the prime minister's attendance in the ceremony. They knew what the response from Warsaw would be. President Issac Herzog is also expected to be absent, unlike the ceremony a decade ago that marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz camp, when then president Reuven Rivlin was in attendance.

Syrian shake-up stokes Israeli concerns over Jordanian border	Israel-Jordan relations face strain amid Gaza war and regional instability; concerns over Syria’s turmoil, border security and tensions over Jerusalem’s holy site challenge the fragile peace between the neighbors Thirty years into the fragile peace between Israel and Jordan, scenes of instability in Syria have raised concerns within the government and defense echelon that a similar scenario in the Hashemite Kingdom would spill over into Israel. Peace between the two neighbors has almost always been characterized by tension and a tricky balance between political interests and conflicting loyalties. Israel’s engagement in a lengthy regional war, which began over a year ago when the Gaza-based Hamas terrorist group stunned Israel in a massive attack, has further challenged the relationship. Throughout the war, there have been demonstrations in front of Israel’s embassy in the Jordanian capital of Amman. Jordan sent humanitarian aid to Gaza during this period on several occasions, another sign of the constant efforts to maneuver between a highly pro-Palestinian public sentiment and its pro-Western alliance with both Israel and the United States. 'Jordan was always considered the weakest and most unstable actor in the region, and yet the most stable at the same time,' Cl. Res. Ron Schatzberg, the Economic Cooperation Foundation co-director and an expert on Israel-Jordan relations, said. 'Its strength lies in its weakness, and its government shows a certain openness to extremist elements in order to allow them to vent while applying substantial covert intelligence efforts to contain them.' The ripple effects of the fall of the Bashar Assad regime at the hands of the extreme Islamist movements in Syria could potentially reach Jordan. This event would have a dramatic impact on Israel. Jordan’s strategic position in the region has everyone eyeing it. Earlier this week, Israeli media reported that the heads of the Secret Service and the military intelligence unit visited Jordan to discuss the latest regional developments and their implications. The two countries share a 480-kilometer-long border, which is Israel’s longest. It is estimated that around half of Jordan’s population is of Palestinian descent, making relations with Israel a contentious issue in the Hashemite Kingdom. Throughout the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Jordan has tried to position itself as the guardian of the Palestinian cause. There have been numerous attempts throughout the war to smuggle weapons into Israel, mostly from Syria, through the border aimed at reaching Palestinians in the West Bank in order to carry out attacks in Israel. In recent months, there have been several attacks along the border, including the murder of three Israeli border crossing employees shot dead by a Jordanian terrorist. According to data from the Israeli Population and Immigration Authority, there has been an increase in the number of illegal infiltrations through the border with Jordan in recent years. The fence along the lengthy border is incomplete, and the topography, sometimes mountainous but filled with tangled flora, makes surveillance challenging. 'There have been numerous attempts throughout the war to smuggle weapons into Israel, mostly from Syria, through the border aimed at reaching Palestinians in the West Bank in order to carry out attacks in Israel,' Dr. Ofir Winter, Senior Researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University, said. 'Iran has been trying to undermine the Jordanian regime in order to make Jordan another arena in its ‘axis of resistance’ against Israel.' Israeli media has reported that the army is acting in order to upgrade its presence along the porous border, including improving the barrier there and establishing a new brigade solely dedicated to the area. Jordan also has borders with Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, each hostile to Israel in varying degrees. Amer Sabaileh, a political analyst from Jordan, noted that while 'we cannot deny' that these incidents have occurred, 'to take these steps just from the Israeli side... It means that they are applying unilateral positions to the Jordanian government.' 'It's obvious that Israelis today are thinking just individually, let's say, about their security and about the need to see this moment of what's going on in the Middle East, or in the front, where the people can go in, that they need to secure and fall under the fear of having another presence at the table,' Sabaileh continued. It means, unfortunately, that what they might be doing does not show that this comes to the country with whom they share a peace treaty. 'It means, unfortunately, that what they might be doing does not show that this comes to the country with whom they share a peace treaty. It's something that they do just for themselves, securing themselves without caring too much about who is attempting the other side.' Adding to the complexities of the relationship, Jordan has custodianship over a holy site in Jerusalem, under contested Israeli sovereignty, highlighting the importance of the relationship and its delicacy. Called the Temple Mount by Jews and the Noble Sanctuary by Muslims, it is a hot spot holy to both Jews and Muslims and is at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There are limits to Jewish visitation near the compound, including a prohibition against Jewish prayer. These limits have been tested repeatedly by Jewish nationalists in recent years and in the past two years, especially since the swearing-in of Israel’s most far-right government to govern. As ultra-nationalist elements are a cornerstone of the current coalition led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, relations between Amman and Jerusalem have become increasingly strained. Relations between Netanyahu and Jordanian King Abdullah II were tumultuous even before the current government came to power. Over the years, there have been reports of the Jordanian king refusing to take calls from the Israeli premier. Despite the tensions often accompanying poor relations, diplomatic and security ties have continued throughout the years. 'The personal tension between the two leaders rose during the war because of the increasing difficulty Jordan had maneuvering between its strategic need to maintain the peace agreement with Israel and the public demand to annul it,' said Winter. Sabaileh said that he believes 'peace on the Jordanian and different sides is peace by obligation.' When comparing the Kingdom to other countries in the region, he stated, 'The Emirates model is a different model and different concept because they don't share borders.' 'They don't have heritage that's complex. It's just they decide the peace, so it's much easier.' Winter noted that 'Jordan is especially sensitive to any development in the Palestinian arena due to its demographic make-up and the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Kingdom.' According to Winter, there are several reasons for the increased friction between the two. First, there is concern that the war in Gaza will spill over into the territories under Palestinian control in the West Bank. Extreme ultra-nationalist voices in the Netanyahu government have called for the establishment of a Palestinian state in Jordan. This move would allow them to expel West Bank Palestinians. 'The greatest fear of the Hashemite Kingdom is the people in Israel who believe Jordan should be a Palestinian state,' said Schatzberg. 'In the eyes of the Jordanian regime, the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank would guarantee the survival of the Jordanian kingdom.' According to Schatzberg, instability in the Palestinian West Bank, which borders Jordan, is perceived as a far greater threat to its stability than scenarios similar to what was witnessed in neighboring Syria earlier this month. 'There isn’t a lot of appetite for such an overthrow in Jordan, which saw how often in the Arab Spring governments were replaced by even more oppressive governments,' he said. 'However, there is always fear that there will be extremist elements who will take advantage of a population in a dire financial situation. Netanyahu and his coalition partners rule out the establishment of a Palestinian state, a position that many Israelis have increasingly adopted in the wake of Hamas’ attack on Israel last year. In addition, Jordan is concerned by the erosion of the status quo in the Jerusalem holy site. But also, it has a difference of opinion with Israel regarding the fate of Gaza at the end of the war. While Israel refuses to accept the return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which currently controls the West Bank, to Gaza, Jordan views the PA as the leading candidate to rule the territory. 'There is no immediate threat to Jordan’s stability,' Winter explained. 'But any instability could pose a direct threat to Israel’s national security. Jordan and Israel have close security cooperation, and Jordan serves as a buffer between Israel and potential threats from Iran, its proxies and Islamist, pro-Palestinian elements. Any destabilization along the border will require Israel to deploy more forces in order to protect the border, which will be a significant burden, both in terms of its defense and financially.' Definitely, problems can arise. We have a difficult economic situation. We have desperation as well. But I don’t think that the same elements that make Syria collapse quickly are there in Jordan. Sabaileh agreed with the sentiment. 'Definitely, problems can arise. We have a difficult economic situation. We have desperation as well. But I don't think that the same elements that make Syria collapse quickly are there in Jordan.' In May and September of this year, when Iran attacked Israel directly with a barrage of missiles and drones, Jordan played an instrumental role in thwarting the attack. Criticized by pro-Palestinians and Arab states opposed to Israel, it was a position Jordan adopted without giving it much publicity, as it has done regarding much of its cooperation with Israel. 'The whole relationship is kept under the radar by the Jordanians,' said Schatzberg. 'The more the relations with Israel are in the headlines, it creates unrest amongst the public. The Palestinians in Jordan are always suspicious of the regime, its degree of cooperation with Israel and to what extent it actually looks out for Palestinian interests.'

The fence along the lengthy border is incomplete, and the topography, sometimes mountainous but filled with tangled flora, makes surveillance challenging. 'There have been numerous attempts throughout the war to smuggle weapons into Israel, mostly from Syria, through the border aimed at reaching Palestinians in the West Bank in order to carry out attacks in Israel,' Dr. Ofir Winter, Senior Researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University, said. 'Iran has been trying to undermine the Jordanian regime in order to make Jordan another arena in its ‘axis of resistance’ against Israel.' Israeli media has reported that the army is acting in order to upgrade its presence along the porous border, including improving the barrier there and establishing a new brigade solely dedicated to the area. Jordan also has borders with Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, each hostile to Israel in varying degrees. Amer Sabaileh, a political analyst from Jordan, noted that while 'we cannot deny' that these incidents have occurred, 'to take these steps just from the Israeli side... It means that they are applying unilateral positions to the Jordanian government.' 'It's obvious that Israelis today are thinking just individually, let's say, about their security and about the need to see this moment of what's going on in the Middle East, or in the front, where the people can go in, that they need to secure and fall under the fear of having another presence at the table,' Sabaileh continued. It means, unfortunately, that what they might be doing does not show that this comes to the country with whom they share a peace treaty. 'It means, unfortunately, that what they might be doing does not show that this comes to the country with whom they share a peace treaty. It's something that they do just for themselves, securing themselves without caring too much about who is attempting the other side.' Adding to the complexities of the relationship, Jordan has custodianship over a holy site in Jerusalem, under contested Israeli sovereignty, highlighting the importance of the relationship and its delicacy. Called the Temple Mount by Jews and the Noble Sanctuary by Muslims, it is a hot spot holy to both Jews and Muslims and is at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There are limits to Jewish visitation near the compound, including a prohibition against Jewish prayer. These limits have been tested repeatedly by Jewish nationalists in recent years and in the past two years, especially since the swearing-in of Israel’s most far-right government to govern. As ultra-nationalist elements are a cornerstone of the current coalition led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, relations between Amman and Jerusalem have become increasingly strained. Relations between Netanyahu and Jordanian King Abdullah II were tumultuous even before the current government came to power. Over the years, there have been reports of the Jordanian king refusing to take calls from the Israeli premier. Despite the tensions often accompanying poor relations, diplomatic and security ties have continued throughout the years. 'The personal tension between the two leaders rose during the war because of the increasing difficulty Jordan had maneuvering between its strategic need to maintain the peace agreement with Israel and the public demand to annul it,' said Winter. Sabaileh said that he believes 'peace on the Jordanian and different sides is peace by obligation.' When comparing the Kingdom to other countries in the region, he stated, 'The Emirates model is a different model and different concept because they don't share borders.' 'They don't have heritage that's complex. It's just they decide the peace, so it's much easier.' Winter noted that 'Jordan is especially sensitive to any development in the Palestinian arena due to its demographic make-up and the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Kingdom.' According to Winter, there are several reasons for the increased friction between the two. First, there is concern that the war in Gaza will spill over into the territories under Palestinian control in the West Bank. Extreme ultra-nationalist voices in the Netanyahu government have called for the establishment of a Palestinian state in Jordan. This move would allow them to expel West Bank Palestinians. 'The greatest fear of the Hashemite Kingdom is the people in Israel who believe Jordan should be a Palestinian state,' said Schatzberg. 'In the eyes of the Jordanian regime, the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank would guarantee the survival of the Jordanian kingdom.' According to Schatzberg, instability in the Palestinian West Bank, which borders Jordan, is perceived as a far greater threat to its stability than scenarios similar to what was witnessed in neighboring Syria earlier this month. 'There isn’t a lot of appetite for such an overthrow in Jordan, which saw how often in the Arab Spring governments were replaced by even more oppressive governments,' he said. 'However, there is always fear that there will be extremist elements who will take advantage of a population in a dire financial situation. Netanyahu and his coalition partners rule out the establishment of a Palestinian state, a position that many Israelis have increasingly adopted in the wake of Hamas’ attack on Israel last year. In addition, Jordan is concerned by the erosion of the status quo in the Jerusalem holy site. But also, it has a difference of opinion with Israel regarding the fate of Gaza at the end of the war. While Israel refuses to accept the return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which currently controls the West Bank, to Gaza, Jordan views the PA as the leading candidate to rule the territory. 'There is no immediate threat to Jordan’s stability,' Winter explained. 'But any instability could pose a direct threat to Israel’s national security. Jordan and Israel have close security cooperation, and Jordan serves as a buffer between Israel and potential threats from Iran, its proxies, and Islamist, pro-Palestinian elements. Any destabilization along the border will require Israel to deploy more forces in order to protect the border, which will be a significant burden, both in terms of its defense and financially.' Definitely, problems can arise. We have a difficult economic situation. We have desperation as well. But I don’t think that the same elements that make Syria collapse quickly are there in Jordan. Sabaileh agreed with the sentiment. 'Definitely, problems can arise. We have a difficult economic situation. We have desperation as well. But I don't think that the same elements that make Syria collapse quickly are there in Jordan.' In May and September of this year, when Iran attacked Israel directly with a barrage of missiles and drones, Jordan played an instrumental role in thwarting the attack. Criticized by pro-Palestinians and Arab states opposed to Israel, it was a position Jordan adopted without giving it much publicity, as it has done regarding much of its cooperation with Israel. 'The whole relationship is kept under the radar by the Jordanians,' said Schatzberg. 'The more the relations with Israel are in the headlines, it creates unrest amongst the public. The Palestinians in Jordan are always suspicious of the regime, its degree of cooperation with Israel, and to what extent it actually looks out for Palestinian interests.'

Sweden will no longer fund UNRWA aid agency, minister says	Swedish Aid Minister, Benjamin Dousa says his country plans to increase its overall humanitarian assistance to Gaza next year via alternative agencies such as the World Food Program Sweden will no longer fund the U.N. refugee agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) but instead provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza via other channels, the Nordic country's aid minister, Benjamin Dousa, told Swedish broadcaster TV4 on Friday. Israel, which will ban UNRWA's operations in the country from late January, has repeatedly accused the agency of being involved in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel that triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. Sweden's decision to end funding for UNRWA was in response to the Israeli ban, as it will make channeling aid to the Palestinians via the agency more difficult, Dousa said. Sweden plans to increase its overall humanitarian assistance to Gaza next year, he added. 'There are several other organizations in Gaza, I have just been there and met several of them,' the minister said, naming the U.N. World Food Program as one potential recipient.

The Iranian arm Israel is finding hard to cut off	Israeli strikes in the Yemeni capital mark the end of restraint against the Iran-backed Houthis that remain one of Tehran's final operating proxies; Power cuts make Yemeni citizens fear serious war against Israel When Israeli Air Force fighter jets were already in the air last night to strike 2,000 km (1243 miles) from Israel and end weeks of restraint in response to repeated Houthi attacks, it was another reminder that the war in this country has not disappeared. Meanwhile, millions of residents in central Israel were awakened in the middle of the night by sirens following the launch of a missile from Yemen. The interception failed, and its warhead exploded on a school in the Ramat Ef’al neighborhood of Ramat Gan. An hour later, the Israeli Air Force bombed a series of strategic Houthi targets, including their stronghold in Sana’a for the first time. However, an indication of the difficulty in inflicting significant damage from such a great distance came later that afternoon, when a drone launched from Yemen was intercepted off the coast of Tel Aviv. In recent weeks, since the cease-fire with Hezbollah, which was battered in Lebanon and the subsequent collapse of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, the Houthis have essentially become one of Iran's last remaining operational proxies. In fact, they’ve even intensified their attacks against Israel. Wednesday’s operation marked the third IDF strike against the Houthis, two and a half months after the previous one. As before, Israel claimed significant strategic damage was inflicted, but the Houthi attacks persist. The IDF said that the new strikes aimed to disable Houthi-controlled ports, targeting eight tugboats. However, sources at the central port in Hodeidah countered that they still have additional vessels capable of towing ships. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi vowed in a televised speech on Thursday that the group's actions would continue as part of what it calls the 'Gaza support campaign.' 'They keep escalating, and we don't care about their aggression,' said al-Houthi, who leads a terrorist organization seemingly indifferent to the suffering of his people. His terror group, which withstood years of Saudi bombings that resulted in mass civilian casualties, remains defiant. Al-Houthi declared that the strikes wouldn't affect the 'escalation under phase five of support for Gaza.' Al-Houthi also claimed that his group launched 1,147 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles or drones, many of which targeted commercial ships, significantly disrupting a crucial trade route for the global economy in the Red Sea throughout the war. Attacks on ships have also effectively shuttered Eilat's port, with a dramatic reduction in the number of vessels arriving and some workers being furloughed. According to the IDF, the Houthis have fired over 200 missiles and 170 drones at Israel since October 7, 2023, most of which were intercepted or failed to penetrate Israeli territory. Ynet's security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai assessed that the operation is unlikely to deter the Houthis or impair their ability and intent to continue launching missiles and UAVs at Israel. Worse, he noted, they’ll continue targeting global commercial and military shipping in the Red Sea, causing significant economic disruption to energy transport – a campaign they've been waging for over a year. His prediction was reinforced Thursday afternoon when the IDF announced it had intercepted a drone off the coast of Tel Aviv without triggering alarms, in accordance with policy. It’s believed the UAV was launched from Yemen. Ben-Yishai explained that the Houthis, a Shiite jihadist-ethnic group, are determined to demonstrate that, unlike Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranians, they remain steadfast, fighting to support Gaza, which they perceive as under attack by Israel. Alongside Shiite militias in Iraq, the Houthis likely anticipate that a cease-fire in Gaza is imminent as part of an emerging hostage deal. He added that the difficulty in targeting them also stems from a lack of intelligence capabilities, with Israel having limited resources to allocate for intelligence gathering at Yemen's distance. The U.S. over the past also hoped year to deter the Houthis due to the severe disruptions in the Red Sea trade route. Still, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has avoided targeting their strategic assets as Israel has, which has previously frustrated Jerusalem. While the Americans and British conducted numerous strikes, these were relatively limited and aimed at intercepting missiles and drones about to be launched. Washington remains concerned about significant escalation that could ignite a regional war. Even the U.S. strike in Sana’a on Monday was effectively aimed at empty Houthi headquarters. Will the Yemeni people turn on the terror group? Still, the Israeli Air Force’s strikes were extensive in scope despite the significant challenges with a source in Sana’a reporting that they caused panic in the city. For the first time, power plants in the Yemeni capital were hit and thousands of families were reportedly left without electricity. 'People woke up in shock. The capital of Yemen woke up in shock. I went to my neighbors, whose buildings depend on government electricity and they had no power,' the source said. He noted that while more expensive private generators were more commonly used in the past, access to government-supplied electricity had recently expanded, with about 50% of residents relying on it. 'We're afraid of what’s to come because it’s the first time power stations have been targeted,' the source added. 'We’ve gotten used to the fact that hills and military sites are always attacked, whether empty or containing soldiers and equipment but this time it was directed at civilian-essential facilities.' 'This could turn the public against the Sana’a regime, which has plunged the people into chaos and war with Israel. Many fear a repeat of the scenarios in Syria and Lebanon,' he continued, referencing the fall of Assad's regime and the fighting against Hezbollah. 'However,' the source stressed, 'some people don't care about the incidents – they say this is an ideological and religious war with Israel and that it’s an honor.' Many Houthi supporters in the capital gather every Friday for massive rallies as part of their 'Gaza support campaign.' In an interview with Reuters, a resident and Houthi supporter said he wasn’t afraid. 'We've been fighting their tails for more than 10 years,' he said, referring to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 'So now, when we're fighting face-to-face with the Zionists and Americans? We're not scared at all. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Threats against Houthi leaders Over 60 bombs were used in the operation according to the military, hitting 'Houthi military targets along the western coastline and deep within Yemen.' The first wave of strikes began along Yemen's coastline at 3:15 a.m., followed by a second volley at 4:30 a.m. near Sana’a. The operation involved 14 fighter jets targeting ports at Ras Issa, Hodeidah and Salif, as well as fuel and oil tanks and a power station in Sana’a. Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened to target Houthi leaders themselves, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu adding: 'This morning, the Air Force attacked strategic targets of the Houthis in the port of Hodeidah and deep into Yemen. We did this in response to repeated Houthi attacks against civilian targets in Israel. Last night they attacked a school in Ramat Gan.' 'After Hamas, Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last arm of Iran's axis of evil. They are finding out, and will find out, the hard way that whoever harms Israel – will pay a very heavy price,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syqn1fgryg	2024-12-19T14:02:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/SJ4SqlfrJg/SJ4SqlfrJg_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

Indictment details how Mohammed Saadi delivered information to Hezbollah and its affiliates asking to join them in their cause and fight for them Israel's Northern District Prosecutor's Office filed an indictment on Thursday against Mohammed Saadi, 19, from Nazareth, for providing information to Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah during the war. The charges accuse Saadi of contact with a foreign agent. The investigation revealed that Saadi, who was arrested by the Shin Bet and the police last month, had approached the terrorist organization several times in recent years and even asked to join its ranks in the fighting. Saadi also contacted the Lebanese Hezbollah-affiliated channel Al-Manar during the war, offering to send the station photos and videos. The investigation also found that Saadi provided these organizations with information regarding rocket impact sites, aircraft movements and the locations of IDF forces. 'The investigation of this case once again highlights the fact that elements of the Shiite axis, led by Iran, actively promote terrorism in Israel, including through recruiting Israeli residents to serve their espionage needs,' the Israel Police and Shin Bet said in a joint statement. 'The Shin Bet and police view any connection with terrorist organizations with great severity and warn the public of the potential for such ties to escalate into espionage operations that endanger Israel's security,' the two groups said in a statement. 'Security agencies will continue to operate within the scope of their legal authority, taking all necessary measures to thwart such threats and ensure severe consequences for all involved.'

Wrath of Allah': US indicts man who planned attack on Israeli Co...	FBI agent says he had conversations with Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan from Virginia on social media and the Islamic State supporter shared his plan to join terror organization and carry out targeted attacks against Jews The FBI arrested Virginia resident Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan on suspicion of planning an attack against the Israeli Consulate General in New York. According to the charges listed in the indictment, Hassan was exposed after providing a covert agent with detailed instructions on building and planting a bomb. The 14-page indictment which has been under seal outlines a network of well-planned actions, including detailed instructions for constructing explosive devices, purchasing weapons and tips for fleeing the U.S. after the attack. The investigation began in May when Fairfax County Police in Virginia received an anonymous tip about an X account promoting terrorism and supporting the Islamic State terror group (ISIS). The account, managed by Hassan, included posts praising terrorists and advocating violence against Jews and Americans. One post described Osama bin Laden as an 'idol,' declaring that 'the struggle against Islam's enemies will continue forever.' The FBI recruited an undercover informant who approached Hassan via X. Posing as someone sharing his extremist beliefs, the informant engaged Hassan in months of conversations during which Hassan revealed his intentions and actions. In November, Hassan sent the informant the address of the Israeli Consulate General in New York, suggesting it as a target for an attack, calling it a 'symbol of world Jewry.' Hassan also provided a text for a 'martyrdom video' he planned to record before the attack, which included threats to Western countries and a declaration of the 'Wrath of Allah.' He instructed the informant to say: 'Your governments have been complicit in and utterly responsible for the deaths of millions of men, women and children across al-Sham, Iraq and our beloved Al Quds. Now the time has come for revenge.' Court documents revealed that Hassan instructed the informant on how to build a Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP) explosive device, one of the most potent and commonly used by terrorist organizations. He also shared links for purchasing assault rifles and ammunition, recommending a Zastava rifle. During their exchanges, Hassan proposed various scenarios for the attack on the consulate and other locations, such as a mass shooting or detonating an explosive in a crowded area. He stressed the importance of live-streaming the event on social media as part of a 'global terror campaign.' Hassan also planned for the aftermath, advising the informant on how to escape the U.S. post-attack. He suggested fleeing to ISIS-controlled areas in Africa or other regions without extradition agreements with the U.S., stating: 'If you plan it right, you can evade authorities and find safe refuge.' The indictment against Hassan also included a history of social media posts praising al-Qaida leaders like bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri and celebrating attacks on Jewish targets worldwide. Hassan reportedly used multiple accounts to evade platform moderation. The U.S. Department of Justice announced that Hassan will face charges including disseminating information on constructing explosives, aiding terrorism and planning an attack against foreign diplomats. The district attorney's office handling the case said in a statement: 'This is one of the most severe cases of attempted attacks on a Jewish target on U.S. soil.' If convicted on all counts, Hassan faces a minimum of several decades in federal prison, with the possibility of life imprisonment without parole or even the death penalty, depending on the severity of the charges and the case’s terrorist context.

Investigative program '60 Minutes' set to release special episode including exclusive interview on pager operation attributed to Israel American outlet CBS announced on Thursday that a special episode of the investigative program '60 Minutes' will air in the United States on Sunday, revealing behind-the-scenes secrets of the pager operation that launched Israel's intensified campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon. While Israel has yet to officially claim responsibility for the operation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referred to it in the past. According to the network, recently retired Mossad agents were interviewed for the program, speaking under condition of anonymity about how the covert operation was carried out and the decade-long preparations leading up to it. Instagram posts showed the agents and interviewer Lesley Stahl, who was reportedly holding one of the beepers allegedly prepared by Mossad. The investigation is scheduled to air Sunday at 7:30 p.m. local time (2:30 a.m. Israel time, early Monday morning). Axios quoted one agent as saying they tested the devices 'multiple times in order to make sure there is minimum damage. If we push the button the only one that will get injured is the terrorist himself. Even if his wife or his daughter will be just next to him, he's the only one that going to be harmed.' The pager operation was launched on September 17, following concerns that its execution was at risk of being uncovered. On the first day, Hezbollah operatives' pagers exploded in Lebanon and Syria. The following day, September 18, their walkie-talkies also exploded.

Biden expected to visit Pope Francis in final international trip ...	The White House is expected to announce soon that President Joe Biden will visit the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis next month for what would likely be the final international trip of his presidency, according to three people familiar with the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House deliberations. Asked about the potential Vatican visit, White House officials declined to comment. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni also declined to confirm or deny any visit, noting that Vatican policy is only to announce papal audiences with visiting heads of state a few days before they occur. Biden, a practicing Roman Catholic, last met privately with Pope Francis earlier this year while in Italy for the Group of Seven leaders meeting. He also met with Pope Francisat the Vatican in 2021, when they had a wide-ranging conversation about climate change, poverty and the coronavirus pandemic. Their warm conversation also touched on the loss of the president's adult son Beau, who died of cancer in 2015, and included jokes about aging well. Biden's support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage has put him at odds with many U.S. bishops, some of whom have suggested he should be denied Communion.

The United States doubled the number of forces in Syria to fight the Islamic State group before the overthrow of President Bashar Assad's government, the Pentagon said Thursday. The U.S. has previously said 900 troops were in Syria, but Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, announced that 2,000 were there and had been for a while. He told reporters that the increase in forces was temporary and they are there to augment the U.S. operations against the Islamic State group. The Pentagon has been asked repeatedly in recent days and weeks about the U.S. presence in Syria and never disclosed the dramatic increase.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1j00gmhkx	2024-12-19T11:15:53-08:00

In a joint IDF and Shin Bet activity earlier Thursday, one of the heads of the Tulkarm terrorist network, Tarek Doush, was eliminated in a strike by an IDF aircraft. Over the past year he recruited numerous terrorists, armed and funded by Iran and by Lebanese terror operatives with relations to the Maqdah family, to plan and execute terrorist attacks against Israelis. The terrorist network led by Tarek Doush carried out multiple shooting attacks against IDF soldiers, as well as shooting attacks against checkpoints and communities near the West Bank security fence in the area of Tulkarm. Additionally, the terrorist network planned to execute terrorist attacks in Israeli territory.

UN votes to seek World Court opinion on Israeli law banning UNRWA...	Norway-led resolution seeks International Court of Justice's opinion on Israeli legislation against the Palestinian aid agency and seeks to cement Israel's legal binding as a member state; Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon condemns move The UN General Assembly on Thursday approved a resolution against Israel initiated by Norway in support of UNRWA, with 137 countries voting in favor and 12 against. The assembly approved the motion requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding Israeli legislation affecting UNRWA. The move came in response to Israel's decision to ban the operation of the UN Palestinian refugee agency in the country from late January and obstacles faced by other UN agencies in their aid work in Gaza over the past year. The ICJ, known as the World Court, is the United Nations' highest court and its advisory opinions carry legal and political weight although they are not binding. The Hague-based court has no enforcement powers if its opinions are ignored. The resolution adopted on Thursday also expressed 'grave concern about the dire humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory' and 'calls upon Israel to uphold and comply with its obligations not to impede the Palestinian people from exercising its right to self-determination.' The new Israeli law does not directly ban UNRWA's operations in the West Bank and Gaza. However, it will severely impact UNRWA's ability to work. Top UN officials and the Security Council describe UNRWA as the backbone of Gaza's aid response. In a letter to the 15-member Security Council on Wednesday, Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said that 'replacing UNRWA with relief schemes that will adequately provide essential assistance to Palestinian civilians is not at all impossible.' 'Israel is willing and ready to work with international partners (and already does work tirelessly) so as to allow and facilitate the continued passage of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza, and to ensure the unhindered provision of these necessary basic services, in a way that does not undermine Israel's security,' Danon wrote. The UN has long complained of aid obstacles in Gaza since the war between Palestinian terror group Hamas and Israel began on October 7, 2023. Danon spoke before the vote, saying: 'We’re repeating the same scenario where the priority is to attack Israel and undermine its right to defend its citizens. This time, the Palestinians are deploying a new tool in their diplomatic circus – the International Court of Justice.' 'While they exploit your indifference and the court’s submission to their terror-supporting agendas, 100 innocent civilians are still held hostage in Gaza by Hamas and the Iranian regime is racing toward nuclear weapons,' he added. 'While you dwell on the past, Israel is focused on the future – one not dominated by the forces of Iranian evil,' Danon said. 'Help us turn the Middle East into a place of peace and stability, not hatred and terror.'

Syrian city Hama celebrates liberation after decades of fear	After 61 years under Baath Party rule –54 of them under the Assad family – the people of Hama rejoice in newfound freedom while honoring lives lost to oppression Since her childhood, Hala, 57, dreamed of the day the Syrian regime would fall so she could dance in Assi Square, in the heart of her hometown, Hama, in central Syria. That dream has finally become a reality, though Hala now lives as a refugee in Germany. She recounted the moment she heard that the oppressive regime had been overthrown. 'It was historic when Syrian state TV announced the regime’s fall and Bashar Assad’s escape. I wished I could have been in Hama, where Assad’s father killed my father and brother in 1981, and from where Assad the son displaced us in 2012,' she said. Hama, a city with a long history of resistance, first rose against Hafez Assad’s rule in 1980. The retaliation was swift and brutal. Assad dispatched military forces, led by his brother Rifaat Assad, to crush the uprising. The result was catastrophic: widespread destruction, mass killings, mass arrests and the forced displacement of thousands of residents. Hala vividly recalled the horrors of the massacre. She shared how men over the age of 12 were rounded up and executed. Her grandmother’s quick thinking saved her younger brother, hiding him in her arms beneath her mourning clothes. After Assad’s fall was announced, Hala joined her children in the streets of Berlin, waving the Syrian revolutionary flag she had long hoped would replace the regime’s symbols of tyranny. Hama’s long struggle Since the 1982 massacre, Hama endured systemic oppression, limited access to basic services and discriminatory policies, much like Idlib to the north. The city’s population suffered under collective punishment, with families of dissidents denied government jobs, access to health care, and even basic food subsidies. Residents lived in fear of arbitrary arrests, often disappearing into Assad regime prisons notorious for torture. When the Syrian revolution erupted in 2011, nearly one million Hama residents staged massive protests. Then-U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford even visited the city to demonstrate solidarity with the protesters. The move angered Damascus, with the Assad regime accusing foreign powers of inciting rebellion. Ford’s visit, however, was seen as a significant moral boost to protestors, who took great risks in continuing their demonstrations. The regime responded with a heavy hand, enforcing strict security measures and cracking down violently on dissent. This repression continued until the city’s liberation earlier this month. As the war progressed, Hama remained under tight regime control, with military checkpoints dotting every major road and curfews imposed to suppress dissent. Activists described the city as a 'prison under open skies.' Celebrations in Hama following the regime’s collapse were marked by a mix of joy and sorrow. Local residents described the liberation as bittersweet, honoring the memory of countless lives lost during the decades of struggle. The 1982 Hama Massacre, a dark chapter in Syria's history The February 1982 Hama massacre, lasting 27 days, stands as one of the darkest chapters in Syria’s history, Amnesty International noted in a recent report. Rights groups estimate that over 40,000 civilians were killed during the assault. Widespread atrocities, including rape, theft and destruction, were documented. Airstrikes on the city center were followed by indiscriminate violence on the ground, with military forces given unchecked powers. The massacre was part of a larger campaign by Hafez Assad to crush dissent from the Muslim Brotherhood, which had gained significant support in Hama. Entire neighborhoods were leveled, with artillery and tanks used against civilian areas. Survivors recount the eerie silence that followed the bombardments, with bodies left to decompose in the streets. The regime’s grip on Hama tightened in the massacre’s aftermath. Survivors were forced to remain silent, their collective trauma passed down to younger generations. Activists describe how the 1982 massacre became a symbol of the regime’s willingness to use extreme violence to maintain power. Now, a new era With the collapse of Assad’s regime, Hama residents joined massive nationwide protests, raising revolutionary flags and chanting slogans for a better future. 'People here feared the regime more than others due to past traumas, but today, the kingdom of fear has collapsed forever.' said Sawsan, a young protester in Hama. Her optimism was shared by many. Residents celebrated the end of 54 years of fear under the Assad family and 61 years since the Baath Party came to power through a military coup known as the March 8 Revolution, marking the start of one-party rule. They look forward to building a new Syria founded on justice, equality, and opportunity. > After an 11-day battle, opposition forces declared victory, forcing Bashar Assad to seek asylum in Moscow. Protests across Syria called for Assad to face justice for war crimes, with demands for trials in Syria or international courts. International observers have pointed out that the road ahead remains fraught with challenges. Decades of war have devastated Syria’s infrastructure, leaving cities like Hama without functioning hospitals, schools or sanitation systems. Moreover, divisions among opposition factions could hinder efforts to rebuild a unified state. Still, many see Hama’s liberation as a critical milestone in Syria’s long journey toward freedom and accountability. Hama’s liberation stands as a turning point in Syria’s modern history, offering a symbol of resilience and hope for the future.

Very good, everything exploded': Watch footage of fighter jets s...	Videos released by the IDF show fighter pilots carrying out precise strikes on military targets in Yemen using more than 60 bombs; Houthis deny claims port operations crippled The IDF released on Thursday footage of Israeli Air Force fighter jets attacks against strategic Houthi targets in Yemen. Dozens of aircraft flew approximately 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) overnight, striking the capital of Sana’a for the first time. Over 60 bombs were used in the operation according to the military, hitting 'Houthi military targets along the western coastline and deep within Yemen.' The targets included fuel and oil tanks, two power stations and eight tugboats, whose incapacitation, according to the statement, 'severely impacts Houthi military operations.' The IDF released footage of the attack featuring the communications of fighter pilots. In one exchange, a pilot is heard saying, 'That was a good hit. Alpha, very good.' Later, another pilot reports, 'Alpha, second bomb. Everything there exploded.' The strike in Yemen took place an hour after a ballistic missile launched from Yemen triggered sirens across central Israel and overnight was partially intercepted by the Arrow air defense system. The warhead, however, was not intercepted and exploded on a school in the Ramat Ef’al neighborhood of Ramat Gan, causing extensive damage. The operation had been planned by the Air Force for several weeks, independent of Wednesday’s missile launch. Unlike the two previous strikes in Yemen – the last of which occurred more than two and a half months ago – targets in Sana’a, a Houthi stronghold, were also targeted. Power outages were reported in some areas with at least nine people killed according to some reports. The strike’s main goal was to disable the Houthis' port operations – numbering three in total. The military said this represented 'a severe economic blow.' Estimates now say all operations at Houthi-controlled ports have been paralyzed. The Houthis, however, dispute this. According to Reuters, sources at Hodeidah port reported that, while one tugboat was destroyed, other vessels at the port still allow for the movement of larger ships. The first wave of strikes began along Yemen's coastline at 3:15 a.m., followed by a second volley at 4:30 a.m. near Sana’a. The operation involved 14 fighter jets targeting ports at Ras Issa, Hodeidah and Salif, as well as fuel and oil tanks and a power station in Sana’a. Ynet security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai assessed that the operation is unlikely to deter the Houthis or impair their ability and intent to continue launching missiles and UAVs at Israel. Worse, he noted, they’ll continue targeting global commercial and military shipping in the Red Sea, causing significant economic disruption to energy transport – a campaign they've been waging for over a year. His prediction was reinforced Thursday afternoon when the IDF announced it had intercepted a drone off the coast of Tel Aviv without triggering alarms, in accordance with policy. It’s believed the UAV was launched from Yemen. The Houthis have vowed to continue attacking Israel as part of what they call their campaign in support of Gaza following the strike. The terror group’s spokesperson Yahya Saree said their attacks will persist 'unless the aggression against Gaza stops and the siege is lifted.' 'Israeli aggression will not deter Yemen or Yemenis from fulfilling their religious and moral duty to respond to the massacres in Gaza,' He added.

Suspected terror attack in Jerusalem: Elderly woman stabbed in he...	The 74-year-old woman called her daughter, and was taken to Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, where she is reported to be in stable condition; Shin Bet is involved in the investigation, and suspicion has grown that this was a nationalist attack A 74-year-old woman was stabbed Thursday morning in her home in Jerusalem by a suspect who apparently broke in. She was evacuated from the scene in moderate to serious condition. Hours later, Ynet learned that the General Security Service has been involved in investigating the case, and by evening suspicions grew that it was a nationalist attack.

Putin says Israel main winner in Syria, denies loss in country	Russian president denies claims his intervention in Syria since 2015 has been in vain and says he's concerned about new Israeli position in area; Says will meet with Assad in the future Russian President Vladimir Putin denied on Thursday that Russia's nine-year intervention in Syria had been a failure, but expressed concern about Israel's military operations there since the toppling of his ally Bashar Assad. Putin, addressing multiple questions on Syria at a marathon annual news conference, said Moscow had made proposals to the new rulers in Damascus to maintain Russia's air and naval bases in the country. In his first public comments on the subject, he said he had not yet met Assad since the former president fled to Moscow earlier this month, but that he planned to do so. Putin played down the damage to Moscow from the fall of Assad, saying its military intervention in Syria since 2015 had helped prevent the country from becoming a 'terrorist enclave.' He said Israel was the 'main beneficiary' of the current situation. Soon after Assad's fall, Israel moved troops into the buffer zone on the Syrian side of the dividing line with the Golan Heights and conducted hundreds of air strikes to destroy Syrian army weapons and equipment. 'Russia condemns the seizure of any Syrian territories. This is obvious,' Putin said, saying Israel had penetrated to a depth of 25 km (16 miles) and got as far as fortifications that were built for Syria by the former Soviet Union. Putin said Russia hoped that Israel would at some point leave Syrian territory, but 'I have the impression that not only are they not going to leave, but they are going to reinforce there.' He said Turkey was also intervening in pursuit of its own security interests with regard to Kurdish fighters in Syria whom Ankara regards as terrorists. 'We all understand this. There will be many problems. But we are on the side of international law and for the sovereignty of all countries, while respecting their territorial integrity, meaning Syria,' Putin said. He said most people in Syria with whom Russia had been in contact about the future of its two main military bases in Syria were supportive of them staying, but that talks were ongoing. Russia had proposed using its Hmeimim air base to deliver humanitarian aid, and had also evacuated 4,000 Iranian fighters from Syria via that route, he said. In response to a question on the subject from a U.S. journalist, Putin said he would ask Assad about the fate of U.S. reporter Austin Tice, who is missing in Syria, and was ready to ask Syria's new rulers about Tice's whereabouts too. Russia's future with Trump Putin added that he was ready to compromise over Ukraine in possible talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on ending the war and had no conditions for starting talks with the Ukrainian authorities. Trump, a self-styled master of brokering agreements and author of the 1987 book 'Trump: The Art of the Deal,' has vowed to swiftly end the conflict, but has not yet given any details on how he might achieve that. Putin, fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with the Russian people, told a reporter for a U.S. news channel that he was ready to meet Trump, whom he said he had not spoken to for years. Asked what he might be able to offer Trump, Putin dismissed an assertion that Russia was in a weak position, saying that Russia had gotten much stronger since he ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022. 'We have always said that we are ready for negotiations and compromises,' Putin said, after also saying that Russian forces, advancing across the entire front, were moving toward achieving their primary goals in Ukraine. 'Soon, those Ukrainians who want to fight will run out, in my opinion, soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises.' It was reported last month that Putin was open to discussing a Ukraine cease-fire deal with Trump, but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insisted Kyiv abandon its ambitions to join NATO. Putin said on Thursday that Russia had no conditions to start talks with Ukraine and was ready to negotiate with anyone, including President Volodymyr Zelensky. But he said any deal could only be signed with Ukraine's legitimate authorities, which for now the Kremlin considered to be only the Ukrainian parliament. Zelensky, whose term has technically expired but who has delayed an election because of the war, would need to be re-elected for Moscow to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, said Putin. Putin dismissed the idea of agreeing a temporary truce with Kyiv, saying only a long-lasting peace deal with Ukraine would suffice.

UN chief says Israeli air strikes in Syria must stop	Israeli airstrikes on Syria are violations of the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity and 'must stop,' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday. Since Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted earlier this month, Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes aimed at destroying strategic weapons and military infrastructure. 'Syria's sovereignty, territorial unity, and integrity must be fully restored, and all acts of aggression must come to an immediate end,' Guterres told reporters. Israeli troops also moved into a demilitari\ed zone between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights - created after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war - that is patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers. Israeli officials have described the move as a limited and temporary measure to ensure the security of Israel's borders but have given no indication of when the troops might be withdrawn. 'Let me be clear: There should be no military forces in the area of separation other than U.N. peacekeepers â€' period. Israel and Syria must uphold the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, which remains fully in force,' Guterres said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqidnzbkx	2024-12-19T06:11:48-08:00

The Houthis 'will learn the hard way', Netanyahu warns	Prime minister refers to Israeli attack on Houthi targets deep inside Yemen overnight in a Hebrew video statement; 'When Israel takes action against the Houthis, it is acting on behalf of the entire international community'; Following statement, Israeli Air Force intercepts drone from Yemen off coast of Tel Aviv Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made his first public statement on Thursday afternoon about Israel's overnight airstrikes on Houthi targets deep inside Yemen, in an operation dubbed Operation White City. The Houthis 'are finding out, and will find out, the hard way that whoever harms Israel will pay a very heavy price,' he said in a Hebrew-language video statement. 'This morning, the Air Force attacked strategic targets of the Houthis in the port of Hodeidah and deep into Yemen. We did this in response to repeated Houthi attacks against civilian targets in Israel. Last night they attacked a school in Ramat Gan,' Netanyahu said in the statement. 'They are not attacking just us – they are attacking the entire world. They are attacking the international shipping and commercial lanes.

Air raid sirens jolted central Israel overnight, stretching from the Shfela region to the Sharon area, as the Arrow missile defense system intercepted a ballistic missile launched from Yemen. Following the interception of the Houthi missile, Israeli fighter jets targeted military sites belonging to Yemen’s Houthi forces along the western coast and inland regions of Yemen, the IDF announced early Thursday, marking its first operation in Yemen since September. On Thursday afternoon, the IDF intercepted an unmanned drone off the coast of Tel Aviv over the Mediterranean Sea. No alerts were activated before its interception. The IDF determined that the drone had been launched from Yemen. It is the ninth missile or drone attack by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels against Israel this month, including the overnight attack and two on Monday. The IDF said the overnight strikes on Yemen aimed to degrade Houthi military capabilities and prevent the use of targeted facilities for military operations, including the smuggling of Iranian weapons. The Houthis, aligned with Iran, have repeatedly launched UAVs and surface-to-surface missiles at Israel, most of which were successfully intercepted, according to the military. Yemeni media reported that two major power stations near the capital of Sanaa, Haziz to the south and Dhahban to the north, were struck, leaving much of the surrounding area without electricity. In addition, the Houthi-affiliated Al-Masirah channel reported strikes on oil facilities in Ras Issa and the port of Hodeidah, where multiple locations were targeted.

Dozens of fighter jets and additional aircraft participated in the mission, with aerial refueling enabling the extended reach of the operation. Following the reports of Israel's retaliatory strikes, senior Houthi official Hezam al-Asad posted a threat in Hebrew on X, reading, 'Tel Aviv will not be safe as long as the siege and attacks on our people in Gaza continue.' In a subsequent tweet, he added, 'We will not abandon Gaza, even if we die.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjqu00szs1g	2024-12-19T05:52:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/rJedgYbbSJx/rJedgYbbSJx_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Drone threat from Gaza neutralized by Israeli Air Force near bord...	Two drones launched from Gaza breached Israeli airspace, triggering sirens in the Gaza border region; One drone was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force, while the other crashed near Kibbutz Urim; Incident underscores ongoing tensions along Gaza border The Israeli Air Force intercepted an unmanned aerial vehicle launched from the Gaza Strip over the border region in Israel on Thursday. This marks more than 14 months since the war began. No fatalities or injuries have been reported. At 11:45 a.m., alarms were triggered in Kibbutz Magen and Moshav Ein HaBesor, located within the Eshkol Regional Council in the Gaza border region. Shortly after, the IDF announced it was investigating the incident, and footage of the event began circulating. Incident resolved, residents informed Approximately 40 minutes after the alarms sounded, the Home Front Command issued a statement declaring 'the incident has ended.' Similarly, the Eshkol Regional Council informed residents they could safely exit their protected areas. 'The drone has left the Gaza border region, and the threat has been neutralized,' the council reassured residents. However, it later emerged that the situation was more complex than initially reported. The drone identified in the Gaza border region had seemingly 'disappeared,' leaving the military uncertain about its location, intended target or entry point. Further updates from the Eshkol Regional Council later revealed that two UAVs had infiltrated the area, prompting the alarms. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Police subsequently closed Route 241 to traffic between Ma’on Junction and Urim to address one of the UAVs, which had crashed in the area. 'One UAV exited the airspace of the council, while the second UAV crashed in the area between Ma’on and Urim and is currently being handled by the police,' authorities confirmed. The incident underscores the ongoing tensions along the Gaza border region, as security forces remain vigilant against aerial threats. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjsdf9zhje	2024-12-19T05:01:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/H1AoFO11Hkg/H1AoFO11Hkg_0_514_597_337_0_small.jpg

Katz gives IDF deadline for Oct. 7 probe	Defense minister instructs military chief to hand over all finding of inquiries already completed; in statement defense minister says they must be made public while government and coalition refuse national commission of inquiry Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi on Thursday to complete the military's investigation into the failings of the Oct. 7 massacre by the end of January and to deliver to him all those investigations that were already done and completed, so that they would be made public. 'It is the duty of the IDF to complete its investigation quickly and present the findings to the Israeli families and the public at large, so that lessons could be learned, and determinations made,' Katz said in a statement. The defense minister also said that no new appointments to top command positions must be made until the investigation results have been delivered to him. 'The defense minister must study the findings and understand their repercussions on possible candidates for promotion,' his office said. The deadline imposed by Katz comes as the government refuses to establish a national commission of inquiry into its failings and the failings of the security services ahead of the Hamas massacre and as members of the coalition have been outspoken about their refusal to allow such a commissioned to be paneled. Halevi criticized Katz after he learned from media reports that two of his appointments for generals have been suspended. 'The appointments of officers is not a privilege,' Halevi said. It is a necessity and a duty,' he wrote in a letter to the senior IDF command. The chief of staff was the first to assume responsibility for the IDF's failures and implied he would leave his position when the investigations into the massacre are completed. Members of the coalition have insisted on laying blame for the events leading to the massacre on the IDF and Shin Bet and have claimed that a national commission of inquiry, assembled by a Supreme Court Justice, would be bias against the government and therefore untrustworthy. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the decision by Katz to impose a deadline on the military chief was a 'positive and refreshing change,' compared to his predecessor's position.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syqmm5wbjg	2024-12-19T03:43:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/11/HkWgEeTyGJx/HkWgEeTyGJx_181_95_1100_619_0_small.jpg

French man gets 20 year sentence for enlisting men to rape wife	All 51 defendants guilty on Thursday in a drugging-and-rape case that horrified the world and transformed the victim who says she hopes the enormous interest in her case will help other women who have suffered sexual abuse A French court found all 51 defendants guilty on Thursday in a drugging-and-rape case that horrified the world and transformed the victim, Gisele Pelicot, into a stirring symbol of courage and resilience. Pelicot's ex-husband of 50 years, Dominique Pelicot, had pleaded guilty to drugging her repeatedly for almost a decade to rape her and to offer up her unconscious body for sex to dozens of strangers he had met online, while videoing the abuse. A panel of five judges sentenced him to the maximum 20 years in jail, as requested by prosecutors. The court imposed generally shorter terms than the four-to-18 years demanded by the prosecution for the other defendants, almost all of whom were accused of raping the comatose Gisele Pelicot. In all, the court found 47 of the defendants guilty of rape, two guilty of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault. A cheer went up outside the court in the southern French city of Avignon among the victim's supporters when news of the first guilty verdicts filtered out. Many of the accused had denied the charges, saying they thought it was a consensual sex game orchestrated by the couple and arguing that it was not rape if the husband approved. Dominique Pelicot, 72, denied misleading the men, saying they knew exactly what they were doing. 'I am a rapist like the others in this room,' he said during testimony. Gisele, who is also 72, waived her right to anonymity during the trial and demanded that horrifying videos of the serial abuse, which were recorded by her former husband, should be seen in court, saying she hoped this would help other women speak up. The trial has triggered protest rallies around France in support of Gisele, and spurred soul searching, including a debate on whether to update France's rape law, which at present makes no mention that sex should involve consent. Gisele stared down her abusers with steely determination in the packed courtroom day after day, scoffing at any claim that she might have been a willing participant. 'I've decided not to be ashamed, I've done nothing wrong,' she testified in October. 'They are the ones who must be ashamed,' she said. Horrifying Secrets The Pelicots' children, David, Caroline and Florian, arrived in court to hear the verdict alongside their mother. The siblings have spoken out forcibly against their father, rejecting his pleas for forgiveness. The defendants come from all walks of life - lorry drivers, soldiers, firefighters, security guards, farm workers, a supermarket worker, a journalist and the unemployed. The youngest suspect was just 22 when he entered Pelicot's bedroom, while the oldest was in his early 70s. Many had children and were in relationships. Most lived within a 50-km (31-mile) radius of the Pelicots' picturesque village of Mazan, which nestles in vineyards below Mont Ventoux. The case only came to light in 2020, when Dominique was caught trying to take photographs up the skirts of women in a supermarket. Police then discovered more than 20,000 photos and videos on his computer drives revealing the horrifying secrets that he had hidden from his now ex-wife for a decade. Police believe 72 men had gone to the house to rape and abuse Gisele, but they were not able to identify them all. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Pelicot acknowledged that he had put powerful tranquilizers into his wife's food and coffee that put her to sleep for hours. Gisele said she was worried she was developing Alzheimer's or had a brain tumour because of the memory gaps. She says she hopes the enormous interest in her case will help other women who have suffered sexual abuse, and brushes off praise for her own bravery in letting the world see her pain. 'It's not courage. It's determination to change things,' she told the court in October. 'This is not just my battle, but that of all rape victims.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjezuk11r1x	2024-12-19T03:02:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/B1Xb0DbH1e/B1Xb0DbH1e_0_68_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
The rise of the 'woke right:' A new threat to Israel and the West...	Epoch Times Associate Producer Karys Rhea explores the growing influence of the 'woke right' What happens when a rising conservative faction challenges 'America First'? In the latest episode of the ILTV News Podcast, Epoch Times Associate Producer Karys Rhea explores the growing influence of the 'woke right.' This controversial movement, characterized by anti-Zionist rhetoric and a fixation on revisionist history, is shaking the foundations of conservative values, Rhea said. With figures like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens at the forefront, the ideological battle raises critical questions: Is Israel’s role in American politics at risk? And can Donald Trump’s movement withstand this internal divide? 'These people say they are part of the America First movement. They’re very clear that they consider themselves patriots,' Rhea explained. 'These are people who are usually proud Christians, people who are anti-censorship, pro-faith, pro-family, anti-globalism, anti-Marxism, and anti-elitism. But people have observed that it seems like both their beliefs and their actions say otherwise.' Rhea highlighted, for example, that much like the woke left—which sees racism where it isn’t and ignores it where it is—the woke right does the same when it comes to Christian persecution. She said they overlook the routine slaughter of Christians occurring in Africa and the Middle East, where churches are being defaced and desecrated. 'They focus on who they think are the ultimate oppressors of Christians: Jews, right?' Additionally, Rhea referenced an analogy from author Bari Weiss: the woke left knocks down statues of America’s sacred history, while the woke right destroys their legacies. 'There is nothing wrong with talking about Martin Luther King or Winston Churchill and maybe discussing some of their flaws,' Rhea said. 'But that is not what these people are doing. They are coming with a wrecking ball, and they are trying to turn upside down the entire notion of history that we have to paint it as something different. 'And that is why I say fundamentally that these people hate America, and they hate the West, because they are trying to destroy it in order to create this new America that they want to see,' she said. Will this have an impact on the Trump administration, which Israel expects to be one of the most pro-Israel governments in a potential second term? So far, Trump has not appointed anyone who shares the woke right’s point of view, Rhea said. However, she added that she knows from insiders 'there is intense pressure on him to do so.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkgnfyzbye	2024-12-19T02:58:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/01/H1aGXdfZye/H1aGXdfZye_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Shrapnel from missile intercept near Knesset, school hit in balli...	IDF probes incidents; says school likely hit from part of the Houthi missile when it is intercepted; Knesset guards on Thursday found shrapnel from the intercept of a Houthi ballistic missile fired overnight. No sirens were activated in Jerusalem and the Knesset said no damage was caused by the shrapnel that was removed by police sappers. The IDF was investigating the incident. A school in Ramat Gan, Tel Aviv's neighbor to the east, suffered major damage and would be torn down. 'We heard the explosion at night, I’m in shock,' said Nir, whose children attend the school. 'This is the school I attended; my kids study here, and now they’ll need to move to a different school,' he said. The school’s main building collapsed, causing damage to nearby cars and homes. Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama announced that first- to fourth-grade students will study at a nearby school, while fifth- to eighth-grade students will switch to online learning. 'Destruction is extensive, and IDF is still investigating, but engineers have determined the school must be demolished. There’s a silver lining—the students will get a new school. Houthis can fire missiles, but we will remain resilient and united. Ramat Gan has robust protective measures, and we deeply appreciate the air defense system, but there’s no such thing as 100% safety,' said the mayor. Education Minister Yoav Kisch visited the school and stated, 'The impact was caused by the warhead after it was likely intercepted. I’m glad the Air Force struck the Houthis hard yesterday. The message that Israel’s strong arm will reach all fronts working against us must resonate across the Middle East. 'In terms of handling the incident, the children are already at an alternative school for the day. No one was hurt, and I estimate routine will return in two weeks. A new building is ready for occupancy, and we’ll move the children there. Psychological support and assistance are being provided, even though, thank God, none of the staff or children were harmed. Israel is strong, and we’ll overcome any challenge, and our enemies will feel the full force of our response.' 'This appears to be a missile strike. We are in the final stages of investigation, but the inquiry is not yet complete,' Col. Yehonatan Raz, a commander in Home Front Command told Ynet. 'We also inspected other buildings in the neighborhood to ensure there were no injuries or damage. We are still at war. In recent weeks, the volume of fire has decreased significantly, but we remain prepared to respond. All educational facilities in Ramat Gan have access to shelters or reinforced safe rooms. Even during the day, it’s likely this would have been a survivable event due to adherence to Home Front Command guidelines. The shelter at the school remained intact and undamaged.'

Hamas wants 7-day truce before hostage release; Israel demands so...	Sources tell Lebanon outlet that the terror group cannot compile a comprehensive list of living hostages without at least a week-without fighting; but expressed optimism, stating, 'An agreement could be reached very soon' Hamas officials told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar newspaper in Lebanon that negotiations in Doha are progressing well, with most issues resolved. However, two critical sticking points remain, according to the report published Thursday. The first dispute involves Israel’s demand for a comprehensive list of all hostages—both alive and deceased—held by Hamas and other Palestinian factions. Hamas officials reportedly insist that verifying such a list is impossible without at least a week-long ceasefire. Despite the impasse, sources suggest an agreement may be within reach 'very soon.' The second disagreement centers on Israel’s insistence that soldiers, including those injured, be prioritized in the initial phase of the humanitarian release deal. Hamas has reportedly rejected this, claiming it contradicts prior understandings of the release framework for Israeli hostages. Ofir Angrest, whose brother, IDF soldier Matan Angrest, is among those held captive in Gaza, said that 'toppling Hamas is not an option. We demand that soldiers be included in the deal.' Despite these differences, Palestinian factions reportedly believe that Israel’s seriousness in pursuing an agreement could resolve the remaining issues. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Sky News Arabia quoted a member of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s team as saying there has been 'additional progress in recent days' toward a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas reportedly informed mediators that it cannot provide an exact number of hostages it holds, which has delayed the release of further details. The deal is expected to proceed in stages. The U.S. official noted that both Israel and Hamas appear more determined than ever to end the war. Israeli officials are awaiting a formal list of living hostages from Hamas, emphasizing that their top priority is maximizing the number of living captives returned. Hamas has offered to include the bodies of deceased hostages to address any shortfall in living captives released during the first phase. For now, the negotiations continue, with both sides under pressure to strike a deal amid ongoing international mediation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjvrauwhjx	2024-12-19T00:39:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/SkfKvzyr1x/SkfKvzyr1x_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Syria tired of war, poses no threat, rebel leader says	Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Al-Golani says sanctions imposed on Syria under deposed leader Bashar Assad should be lifted and that his HTS group was a victim of the regime; assures West he does not seek to turn Syria into Afghanistan Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Al-Golani said Syria is exhausted by war and the rebels pose no threat to the West or any of Syria's neighbors. Al-Sharaa, who led the rebel force that took down the regime of Bashar Assad in a lightning offensive earlier this month said in an interview to the BBC that sanctions against Syria should be lifted. 'Now, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime. The victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,' he said. He also said that his group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) should be taken of the list of terror organizations claiming it did not target civilians or civilian areas and were themselves the victims of Assad's cruelty. The HTS was known as and arm of the Islamist al Qaida terror group in Syria. After announcing it was breaking with the group, al-Sharaa attempted to convince Syrians and the world that he has turned away from the Jihadist ways of al Qaida, ISIS and the Taliban, and was seeking a moderate regime that would respect all minorities in the areas under its control. The new Syrian leader denied that he would turn Syria into a version of Afghanistan although he did concede that he was seeking a Muslim religious rule. 'We've had universities in Idlib for more than eight years,' Sharaa said, referring to Syria's north-western province that has been held by rebels since 2011.'I think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%,' he said refuting concerns that he would keep education from girls.

IDF veteran, service dog expelled from bus, arrested and humiliat...	Kobi Levi recognized with PTSD prevented from boarding with his dog; after driver humiliates him and calls police, officers arrest the veteran and continue the humiliation; Police issues apology and suspends arresting officers An IDF veteran suffering from PTSD was prevented from using a public bus with his service dog and arrested by the police. 'It was a humiliating and terrible experience,' said 36-year-old Kobi Levi, after the traumatic event. The bus driver refused to allow him to board the bus with his service dog, despite Levi presenting the required certification. The confrontation with the driver culminated in Levi’s arrest, involving the use of force, threats with a taser, and being held in a detention cell for five hours—during which his dog was denied water. 'They tried to take my dog to a kennel in Tel Aviv and laughed at me,' Levi recounted. The bus driver confronted him in front of all the passengers, declaring that he would not continue driving until Levi got off the bus. When he refused to comply, the driver called the police. The officers also disregarded the certification Levi presented. Instead of instructing the driver to allow the service dog on board, they handcuffed Levi using force and took him to the police station. 'I was returning from a visit to a bereaved family. On the way back, I waited for the bus with Morpheus, my dog. When the bus arrived, the driver refused to let me board,' Levi told Ynet. 'The driver said he would not allow me on, stopped the bus, and declared he wouldn’t continue driving until I got off. I begged him to look at the certification and told him I was a combat veteran, but he didn’t care. He cursed at me and called the police.' Levi said five officers showed up after the driver alerted the police. 'I told them I was a combat veteran and showed them the certification for my dog, but it didn’t matter,' he said. 'After a few minutes, they told me I was being detained. One officer tried to put handcuffs on me. I told them they couldn’t handcuff me because of my mental health condition. They used force, injured my hands, and took me in a patrol car to the Ramat Gan police station.' At the station, officers threatened to use a taser on Levi and his service dog if he didn’t enter the detention cell. 'They injured my hands. Magen David Adom paramedics were at the station and treated me. After that, the officer in charge told me to go into the cell. I told him they couldn’t do that. He replied, ‘If you don’t go in, I’ll taser you and your dog.’ I went in handcuffed, and a few minutes later, they tried to take Morpheus to a kennel in Tel Aviv. They tried to get him to leave with them, but he wouldn’t go.' Levi claims he sat in the detention cell for five hours, barefoot and handcuffed. 'I sat in the cell for five hours without shoes, and they wouldn’t let me give Morpheus a bowl of water. After five hours, they released me without even conducting an investigation. The officer who arrested me and hit me cursed at the officer who sent me home.' 'Right now, I feel awful,' Levi added tearfully. 'I sat in a detention cell for five hours. They tried to take Morpheus out of the cell, but he wouldn’t leave. They humiliated me. It was a truly degrading experience on the bus in front of everyone. I felt completely broken; it was an awful feeling of humiliation. Five hours in a detention cell—for what? And the fact that this happened the day before the National Day of Recognition for IDF Wounded Veterans makes it even sadder and more shocking.' 'I’m very scared, crying a lot, and my hands hurt terribly,' Levi shared. 'They laughed at me from one of the police cameras, so I could hear it the entire time,' he added painfully. 'I heard one of the officers say four times, ‘I turned him into tahini,’ and it’s humiliating. I can’t calm down at all.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We regret the distress caused and clarify that the conduct of the officers is under investigation, and the necessary lessons will be learned,' the police said in a statement. 'The Tel Aviv District Commander views the incident in Bnei Brak, in which a citizen was arrested on a bus by police officers in a manner that contradicts the values of the Israel Police, with great severity. As a result, he has ordered an immediate inquiry into the event and has suspended the officers involved from operational duties until the investigation is concluded.' The Electra Afikim bus company also issued an apology: 'We deeply apologize to the passenger. The driver has been suspended pending the completion of a full investigation into the incident, and a disciplinary hearing will be held based on the final findings.

Separated for decades, Assad’s fall spurs hope for families split...	Sisters try to connect with oldest family daughter married to a Syrian 27 years ago says the collapse of the regime in Damascus makes contact easier The four sisters gathered by the side of the road, craning their necks to peer far beyond the razor wire-reinforced fence snaking across the mountain. One took off her jacket and waved it slowly above her head. In the distance, a tiny white speck waved frantically from the hillside. 'We can see you!' Soha Safadi exclaimed excitedly on her cellphone. She paused briefly to wipe away tears that had begun to flow. 'Can you see us too?' The tiny speck on the hill was Soha’s sister, Sawsan. Separated by war and occupation, they hadn’t seen each other in person for 22 years. The six Safadi sisters belong to the Druze community, one of the Middle East’s most insular religious minorities. Its population is spread across Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau that Israel seized from Syria in 1967 and annexed in 1981. Five of the six Safadi sisters and their parents live in Majdal Shams, a Druze town next to the buffer zone created between the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights and Syria. But the sixth, 49-year-old Sawsan, married a man from Jaramana, a town on the outskirts of the Syrian capital, Damascus, 27 years ago and has lived in Syria ever since. They have land in the buffer zone, where they grow olives and apples and also maintain a small house. With very few visits allowed to relatives over the years, a nearby hill was dubbed 'Shouting Hill,' where families would gather on either side of the fence and use loudspeakers to speak to each other. The practice declined as the internet made video calls widely accessible, while the Syrian war that began in 2011 made it difficult for those on the Syrian side to reach the buffer zone. But since the Dec. 8 fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime, families like the Safadis, are starting to revive the practice. They cling to hope, however faint, that regime change will herald a loosening of restrictions between the Israeli-controlled area and Syria that have kept them from their loved ones for so long. 'It was something a bit different. You see her in person. It feels like you could be there in two minutes by car,' Soha Safadi, 51, said Wednesday after seeing the speck that was her sister on the hill. 'This is much better, much better.' Since Assad’s fall, the sisters have been coming to the fence every day to see Sawsan. They make arrangements by phone for a specific time, and then make a video call while also trying to catch a glimpse of each other across the hill. 'She was very tiny, but I could see her,' Soha Safadi said. 'There were a lot of mixed feelings — sadness, joy and hope. And God willing, God willing, soon, soon, we will see her' in person. After Assad fell, the Israeli military pushed through the buffer zone and into Syria proper. It has captured Mount Hermon, Syria’s tallest mountain, known as Jabal al Sheikh in Arabic, on the slopes of which lies Majdal Shams. The buffer zone is now a hive of military and construction activity, and Sawsan can’t come close to the fence. While it is far too early to say whether years of hostile relations between the two countries will improve, the changes in Syria have sparked hope for divided families that maybe, just maybe, they might be able to meet again. 'This thing gave us a hope … that we can see each other. That all the people in the same situation can meet their families,' said another sister, 53-year-old Amira Safadi. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Yet seeing Sawsan across the hill, just a short walk away, is also incredibly painful for the sisters. They wept as they waved, and cried even more when their sister put their nephew, 24-year-old Karam, on the phone. They have only met him once, during a family reunion in Jordan. He was 2 years old. 'It hurts, it hurts, it hurts in the heart,' Amira Safadi said. 'It’s so close and far at the same time. It is like she is here and we cannot reach her, we cannot hug her.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1eit7bhjl	2024-12-18T21:16:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/S1grb1NZSJl/S1grb1NZSJl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Israel disabled Houthi ports, goes after rebels economy	Military says strikes on the Iran backed proxy is after weeks of planning and not an immediate response to the overnight ballistic missile fired by the Houthis on Israel The Israeli strike on the Houthi rebels in Yemen early on Thursday, disabled three sea ports, Yemen media affiliated with the rebels said. The purpose of the Israeli attacks was to deal a significant financial blow to the Yemeni rebel forces. The strikes were weeks in the planning and were carried out by dozens of fighter jets who also bombed the tug boats that bring ships into the ports. The military said the timing of the attack on the Houthis was decided according to operational considerations and was not in direct response to the ballistic missile fired at Israel overnight. In the Yemen capital of Sanaa, which came under Israeli attack for the first time, the planes targeted fuel storages and a power station. At least nine people were killed at the Ras Issa oil facility and others were hurt in seven strikes on the ports, local media claimed and according to reports in the Saudi Arabian press, in all, there were 16 strikes in the Israeli attacks that included the port city of Hodeida and the capital Sanaa. A senior official for the Houthis said that the strikes by Israel and the U.S. forces on civilian instillations including power stations and ports, reveal the hypocrisy of the West and said attacks in support of Gaza would continue and escalate in response to the escalations of the Israeli strikes.

IDF confirms strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen	The IDF confirmed Thursday morning that Israeli fighter jets targeted military sites belonging to Yemen’s Houthi forces along the western coast and inland regions. The operation was carried out under the direction of the Intelligence Directorate and Israeli Navy, following Defense Minister Israel Katz’s approval of strike plans. The IDF said the strikes aimed to degrade Houthi military capabilities and prevent the use of targeted facilities for military operations, including the smuggling of Iranian weapons. The Houthis, aligned with Iran, have repeatedly launched UAVs and surface-to-surface missiles at Israel, most of which were successfully intercepted, according to the military. Over the past year, the Houthis have operated under Iranian guidance and financial support, often collaborating with Iraqi militias to attack Israel, disrupt regional stability, and threaten global freedom of navigation, the statement added.

Did Assad trade military secrets with Israel? Turkish claims make...	Hurriyet report, echoed by Daily Mail, claims Syria's ousted leader shared locations of weapons stockpiles and missile launchers with Israel in exchange for guarantees to ensure safety of his escape route Syrian President Bashar Assad, ousted by rebel forces on December 8, reportedly shared classified military information with Israel before fleeing the country, Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Wednesday. The report, later echoed by global outlets including Britain’s Daily Mail, claims Assad handed over documents detailing the locations of weapons stockpiles, missile launchers and military hangars. The Hurriyet report claims that Assad received guarantees from Israel to ensure the safety of his escape route in exchange for the intelligence. 'Judging by the precision of Israel’s strikes on Syrian military assets following Assad’s fall, it seems Israel received highly accurate information,' the report noted. Turkish commentator Abdulkadir Selvi provided additional details, claiming Assad fled Damascus for Moscow on the morning of December 8. Selvi reported that as opposition forces closed in on Damascus on December 7, a summit took place in Doha involving Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.

I prefer not to say more.' According to Selvi, Assad’s escape was coordinated from Russia, which arranged his evacuation from the Russian-operated Khmeimim Air Base to Moscow. Selvi also claimed Assad had initially sought refuge in Iran, which refused him, and negotiations with the United Arab Emirates failed, leaving Russia as his only option. Selvi said a trusted source revealed that Assad provided Israel with detailed maps of Syrian military assets to guarantee Israel would not target his escape route. 'Looking at the precision strikes conducted by Israel following Assad’s departure, it bolsters the credibility of this account,' Selvi wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryg00ypxs1g	2024-12-18T12:45:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/11/BkES00b6mp/BkES00b6mp_0_0_1600_1156_0_small.jpg

Russia has relocated advanced air defense systems and additional military equipment from its bases in Syria to Libya, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing U.S. and Libyan officials. The move is seen as an effort by the Kremlin to maintain a military foothold in the Middle East following the collapse of Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime. The transferred equipment reportedly includes radars for S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, as well as fighter jets, weapons and military personnel.

As part of hostage deal, Hamas demands release of Israel’s most n...	As hostage negotiations gain momentum, reports suggest terror group will demand exile of convicted mass murderers from Israeli prisons to third countries; here are the high-profile prisoners likely to be on the list As negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a potential hostage-prisoner exchange gain momentum, the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds reported Wednesday that discussions are focusing on which Palestinian prisoners will be released in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza. According to the report, high-profile prisoners serving life sentences may be deported to Turkey or Iran under the terms of the deal. A few months into the war, Hamas made it clear that the next hostage-prisoner exchange deal must include three renowned Palestinian prisoners, only one of whom is affiliated with the terror organization. Hamas’ insistence on adding two prominent non-Hamas figures to the list reflects its strategic thinking about the post-war period and its relations with Fatah and other Palestinian factions. Among the names Hamas is expected to present are prominent figures in Palestinian society who could reshape the Palestinian Authority, foremost being senior Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti. In a recent West Bank poll, Barghouti was the leading candidate to succeed Mahmoud Abbas as chairman of the Palestinian Authority. Barghouti is serving five consecutive life sentences and an additional 40 years for his involvement in attacks that killed five Israelis and injured many others during the Second Intifada. Formerly the secretary-general of Fatah in the West Bank, he was arrested on April 15, 2002. Like other Palestinians serving long sentences for terror offenses, Barghouti remains highly popular among Palestinians. Unlike most prisoners, however, his status as a political figure makes him even more revered. The second name Hamas insists on including in the deal is Ahmed Saadat, secretary-general of the Marxist-Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the mastermind behind the 2001 assassination of Israeli minister Rehavam 'Gandhi' Ze’evi. Israel refused to release Saadat as part of the 2011 prisoner exchange deal that saw the release of captive IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. Like Marwan Barghouti, Saadat is considered a significant and popular figure in Palestinian society. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: After Ze’evi’s assassination, Saadat fled to the Muqata’a compound in Ramallah. Then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat refused to hand him over, prompting an Israeli siege on the compound. Following negotiations involving the United States and the United Kingdom, the sides reached the 'Ramallah Agreement,' under which Saadat was imprisoned in Jericho under the supervision of British and American guards. After Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections, Saadat was captured by Israeli forces and sentenced to 30 years in prison in December 2008. The third high-profile prisoner is Abdullah Barghouti, a senior Hamas operative and former commander of the group’s military wing in the West Bank. Barghouti is currently serving an unprecedented 67 life sentences in Israel for his involvement in multiple deadly attacks. Hamas was unable to secure his release in the Shalit deal, but the organization is now adamant that Barghouti must be freed in the next exchange, along with the other two senior prisoners. Throughout the war, additional names have emerged that Hamas is expected to demand in exchange for hostages. Among them is Hassan Salameh, a close associate of the slain Hamas bombmaker Yahya Ayyash and a senior figure in Hamas’ military wing. Salameh has been serving 46 life sentences in Israel since 1997 after being convicted of orchestrating attacks that killed approximately 100 Israelis. He was born and raised in Gaza’s Khan Younis refugee camp, a stronghold of senior Hamas operatives. Another figure on the list is Abbas al-Sayyid, the chief planner of the 2002 Park Hotel bombing in Netanya. He is serving 35 life sentences for his role in the attack, which killed 30 Israeli civilians and injured more than 160 others. Hamas is also expected to push for the release of Ibrahim Hamed, formerly the second-most important figure in the group’s West Bank operations after Saleh al-Arouri, who was assassinated in Lebanon earlier this year. Hamed, a commander of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades during the Second Intifada, was responsible for planning and organizing dozens of attacks against Israelis, including high-profile suicide bombings. He was arrested by Israel in 2006 and is serving multiple life sentences for terrorism and murder. Meanwhile, reports in Egypt indicate 'intense Egyptian-Qatari efforts' to negotiate a cease-fire in Gaza. However, Hamas has yet to give its approval for any deal, and no agreement has been finalized. Despite this, progress has been made, and Israeli officials note a willingness on both sides to move forward. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bykadherkx	2024-12-18T12:23:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/SkXy59gSke/SkXy59gSke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Court presses prosecutors over holes in Netanyahu corruption case	Judges challenge prosecutors to clarify key claims Netanyahu traded regulatory benefits for favorable media coverage; with gaps in evidence regarding Netanyahu's direct involvement, case could be significantly weakened A dramatic turn unfolded Wednesday in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial, as judges challenged prosecutors on key elements of the charges in the 'Bezeq-Walla Affair,' popularly known as Case 4000. The case alleges that Netanyahu, during his time as prime minister, granted regulatory benefits to telecom giant Bezeq in exchange for favorable media coverage on the Walla news site, both owned by businessman Shaul Elovitch. During the hearing, Netanyahu reiterated his claim that he was unaware of any specific requests for media coverage made by his associates. However, the judges pressed prosecutors to clarify allegations of Netanyahu’s involvement or knowledge, with Presiding Judge Rivka Friedman-Feldman questioning inconsistencies in the indictment. Prosecutors argued that Netanyahu was generally aware of a pattern of systematic requests, even if he was not involved in every specific instance, but judges demanded evidence to support this claim. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Judge Oded Shaham, considered more lenient toward the prosecution, expressed concern about the lack of explicit references to Netanyahu's awareness in parts of the indictment. Prosecutor Yehudit Tirosh requested time to review materials and potentially revise their approach. The indictment includes a detailed appendix listing 315 instances of alleged media requests as the basis for the bribery and breach of trust charges. However, if prosecutors fail to establish Netanyahu’s direct knowledge or involvement, as many as 80 to 140 instances could be removed from consideration, potentially undermining up to 50% of the case. Adding complexity, Netanyahu's defense lawyer, Amit Hadad, announced that Sara Netanyahu, the prime minister's wife, would not testify as a defense witness. Her absence could impact both Case 4000 and another case involving allegations of accepting expensive gifts (Case 1000). Sara Netanyahu’s testimony could have bolstered the prosecution’s claims regarding her communications with Elovitch’s associates, but her testimony was also critical for the defense’s argument that gifts received from businessman Arnon Milchan’s wife, Amanda, were part of a reciprocal relationship. Next week, the trial will continue with further discussions on Netanyahu’s alleged awareness of media requests and preparations for defense witnesses. A canceled hearing has been rescheduled in Jerusalem without Netanyahu’s attendance, focusing on procedural issues. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1xp3ogbye	2024-12-18T11:21:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/Sy00ZToEgHJg/Sy00ZToEgHJg_0_22_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Fed lowers rates but sees slower pace of further cuts, firmer inf...	The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday and signaled it will slow the pace at which borrowing costs fall any further, given a relatively stable unemployment rate and little recent improvement in inflation. 'Economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace' with an unemployment rate that 'remains low' and inflation that 'remains somewhat elevated,' the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in its latest policy statement. 'In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range ... the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,' it said in new language that sets up a likely pause to rate cuts beginning at the Jan. 28-29 meeting. U.S. central bankers now project they will make just two quarter-percentage-point rate reductions by the end of 2025. That is half a percentage point less in policy easing next year than officials anticipated as of September, with Fed projections of inflation for the first year of the new Trump administration jumping from 2.1% in their prior projections to 2.5% in the current ones - well above the central bank's 2% target. Slower progress on inflation, which is not seen returning to the 2% target until 2027, translates into a slower pace of rate cuts and a slightly higher ending point of 3.1%, also hit in 2027, versus the prior 'terminal' rate of 2.9% seen as of September. Fed officials also boosted their estimate of the long-run neutral rate of interest to 3%. The reduction in the benchmark policy rate to the 4.25%-4.50% range was opposed by Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, who preferred to leave the policy rate unchanged.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkicdjlh1e	2024-12-18T10:52:34-08:00

Speaking to troops in Rafah, Halevi says military intensifying operations to dismantle Hamas and secure return of remaining 100 hostages, emphasizes need for stronger security frameworks to support displaced residents returning to communities near Gaza IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said Wednesday that the military is intensifying operations against Hamas to secure the return of 100 hostages taken during the October 7 attack. Halevi made the remarks during a visit to the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where he conducted a situational assessment alongside senior commanders, including Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman and Gaza Division Commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. 'We are dismantling Hamas and targeting its infrastructure and forces so that there will never be another October 7,' Halevi said.

Meanwhile, the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds reported Wednesday that negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, are now in their final stages. According to sources quoted in the newspaper, at this stage, discussions are underway regarding the identity of the Palestinian prisoners who will be released as part of the deal. The report claims that 'heavyweight' terrorists serving life sentences will probably be deported to Turkey, and also to Iran—a country whose name has not been mentioned so far as a possible destination for exile. The rest, according to the report, will be released to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk3tsqlske	2024-12-18T10:06:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/Hy2e3FlBJl/Hy2e3FlBJl_0_0_1378_909_0_small.jpg

US Supreme Court to consider TikTok bid to halt ban	The U.S. Supreme Court decided on Wednesday to hear a bid by TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance to block a law intended to force the sale of the short-video app by Jan. 19 or face a ban on national security grounds. The justices did not immediately act on an emergency request by TikTok and ByteDance, as well as some of its users who post content on the social media platform, for an injunction to halt the looming ban, opting instead to hear arguments on the matter on Jan. 10. The challengers are appealing a lower court's ruling that upheld the law. TikTok is used by about 170 million Americans. Congress passed the measure in April. The Justice Department had said that as a Chinese company, TikTok poses 'a national-security threat of immense depth and scale' because of its access to vast amounts of data on American users, from locations to private messages, and its ability to secretly manipulate content that Americans view on the app. TikTok has said it poses no imminent threat to U.S. security. TikTok and ByteDance asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 16 to pause the law, which they said violates free speech protections under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The companies said that being shuttered for even one month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its U.S. users and undermine its ability to attract advertisers and recruit content creators and employee talent.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1iam5xbye	2024-12-18T09:22:53-08:00	
UN to vote on Norwegian proposal targeting Israel over UNRWA ban	Resolution, which could eventually lead to sanctions, expected to pass with automatic majority despite Israeli diplomatic efforts to block it; Israel expected to respond to move The UN General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a Norwegian-backed initiative seeking an International Court of Justice (ICJ) advisory opinion on Israel’s legislation banning the operations of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). The law, passed after allegations that some UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7 attacks, has drawn accusations from Norway of violating the UN Charter and international humanitarian law. Additionally, Norway accuses Israel of obstructing the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and preventing other nations from providing assistance in what it describes as 'occupied territories.' If approved, the ICJ will examine Israel’s obligations as an occupying power and UN member, including ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid and respecting the immunity of UN bodies like UNRWA. Oslo’s proposal asserts that Israel has no legal authority to interfere with their operations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Norwegian officials hope the ICC will recommend sanctions against Israel if it continues to obstruct UNRWA and other UN agencies. The measure is likely to pass, given the UN's frequent majority against Israel, though Israeli diplomats are lobbying to minimize support. The vote underscores rising tensions between Israel and Norway, which previously recognized Palestine as a state, prompting Israel to expel Norwegian diplomats handling Palestinian affairs. The move comes as Israel grapples with the fallout from International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryh5xfxbyl	2024-12-18T08:38:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/19/r111f2QPk6/r111f2QPk6_0_121_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Declassified files show when US knew Israel was close to having a...	Newly published documents reveal US officials suspected Israel developed a nuclear reactor during the 1960s, prompting David Ben-Gurion to adamantly fire back against the suspicions Newly revealed classified U.S. documents uncovered when the United States first realized Israel was developing nuclear weapons — and when they assessed Israel was '6-8 weeks' away from completing a nuclear bomb. The documents are published against the backdrop of Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and IAEA Chair Rafael Grossi's recent remarks that the 'nuclear deal with Iran is no longer relevant and that Iran is enriching uranium to a military-grade and is rapidly nearing the position of a nuclear state.' One of the declassified documents is a December 1960 report by the U.S. Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee (JAEIC). According to researcher William Burr and Prof. Avner Cohen, this was the first American report to definitively state that the Dimona reactor would include a plutonium production facility tied to weapon development. Subsequent American reports treated the issue as unresolved until the late 1960s, by which time Israel had reached the brink of military nuclear capability. This culminated in a 'bilateral secret deal between President Richard Nixon and Prime Minister Golda Meir,' whereby Israel would hold 'undeclared nuclear weapons status.' Another declassified intelligence document revealed that, in February 1967, several Israeli sources informed the U.S. Embassy that Israel 'either has or is about to complete ' the Dimona plutonium extraction plant and that 'the Dimona reactor has been operated at full capacity.' The U.S. concluded that Israel was '6-8 weeks' away from a bomb at that time. The document also mentioned, for the first time, the possibility that 'Israel was systematically deceiving the United States about Dimona.' This was later hinted at in an Israeli series on the atom which featured conversations with Benjamin Blumberg, founder of the Lekem intelligence agency and dubbed 'the driving force behind the Dimona reactor,' who died six years ago. In December 1960, the same month the U.S. first assessed that Israel was advancing toward nuclear capability, other documents surfaced about the construction of the Dimona reactor, initially described as located 'in or near Be’er Sheva.' Then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion first addressed the issue in a Knesset speech, saying that Israel built the reactor for 'research for peaceful purposes.' Ben-Gurion was incensed by statements from U.S. officials in the press claiming Israel had not informed Washington about Dimona. He summoned U.S. Ambassador Ogden Reid to his residence in Sde Boker. According to a document detailing that meeting, Ben-Gurion sought to answer the question of whether Israel had any plans to develop nuclear weapons, emphatically saying, 'Absolutely not,' adding that Israel had no such intentions. The document further recounts how Ben-Gurion praised 'the greatness of America,' calling it a 'refuge for tens of millions of people of Europe,' and perhaps 'the most prosperous nation of all.' He added: 'Your people conduct a bitter war to abolish African slavery; that you saved Europe twice from the Germans.' However, Ben-Gurion then launched a pointed critique: 'We are equals of America in terms of moral respect. We didn't deserve it and we will not accept such treatment.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The ambassador noted how Ben-Gurion straightened in his chair and declared: 'We are not a satellite of America... and will never be a satellite.' While 20 documents on Dimona and Israel’s nuclear program have been declassified, many others remain sealed. For example, a 1976 American document concerning Dimona was entirely redacted by the CIA and remains classified nearly 50 years later. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1emiblbyx	2024-12-18T04:55:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/B1uQEberJg/B1uQEberJg_271_321_781_440_0_small.jpg
Return of NASA astronauts from space station further delayed unti...	NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore's return to Earth will be further delayed until at least late March, the agency said, taking what should have been an eight-day stay on the International Space Station to more than nine months. The duo had traveled to the ISS in June for the test mission, but their return was extended by eight months to February, after the Boeing Starliner capsule they arrived on was deemed unfit to return them to Earth. NASA said Williams and Wilmore, along with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, would return to Earth after the four-member Crew-10 mission, now expected to take off in late March, reaches the space station. The agency did not specify a date for the return of the astronauts. Hague and Gorbunov boarded the ISS in September, over three months after Williams and Wilmore.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byacxigsjg	2024-12-18T04:54:10-08:00	
Exile of released terrorists is cease-fire demand as deal gets cl...	Hamas may be flexible on release of terrorists, with reports that Tehran is a possible destinations to which they will be exiled; Senior Hamas officials have examined whether Marwan Barghouti will agree to exile to Turkey, and are insisting on guarantees from the mediators that Israel will comply with terms Negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by the US, Egypt and Qatar, are now in their final stages, the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds reported Wednesday. According to sources quoted in the newspaper, at this stage a discussion is underway regarding the identity of the Palestinian prisoners who will be released as part of the deal. The report claims that the 'heavyweight' terrorists serving life sentences will probably be deported to Turkey, and also to Iran - a country whose name has not been mentioned so far as a possible destination for exile. The rest,according to the report, will be released to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Another report, on the Saudi Al-Hadath channel, claimed that these are 'crucial hours' following a significant breakthrough achieved on some issues, particularly after Hamas gave up its demand for a complete end to the war in the first phase of the cease-fire, and agreed to the deportation of senior prisoners to Turkey or Qatar. Iran was not mentioned in this report. On Tuesday, Ynet reported that Hamas may be flexible on the issue of releasing terrorists with blood on their hands and is considering the possibility of them being exiled to a third country such as Turkey, Qatar or another Muslim country. The terrorists in prison are apparently reluctant to return to the Gaza Strip - since it is a land of ruins, and exile may buy them a new life. Meanwhile, sources close to a senior Hamas official claimed that Marwan Barghouti, who is considered the most senior of the Palestinian prisoners, and Ahmed Saadat - the Secretary-General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who planned the assassination of government minister Rehavam Ze'evi in ​​2001 - would agree to deportation abroad as part of a deal. According to the sources, senior figures in the terrorist organization contacted the wives of Barghouti and Saadat and consulted with them about whether to agree to their deportation to Turkey. The women did not express any objection to this, it was reported, and suggested that the prisoners should also be asked about whether this was acceptable to them. 'We are nearing the end of the talks and reaching an agreement,' according to the sources. Despite the optimism expressed by certain sources, a Hamas source told the Saudi Asharq News that 'Israel has so far refused to agree to the release of senior Palestinian prisoners and leaders. Israel insists on deporting all prisoners with lengthy sentences out of the Palestinian territories.' The source added that Hamas is demanding various guarantees for the deal. 'Israel wants an agreement without a signature, similar to previous wars, and is content with a Qatari and Egyptian declaration. We want a written agreement, and are asking the mediators for guarantees that Israel will be committed to implementing all of its stages,' he said. A report in the Saudi Al-Hadath newspaper also claims that Hamas is demanding 'international guarantees for Israel's commitment to the three stages of the agreement,' and that it also opposes checkpoints for refugees who will return to northern Gaza during the cease-fire. The talks are currently being conducted with great intensity since the collapse of the previous round in August, with several key concessions by Hamas in the background - including the agreement not to bring an end to the war in the first phase, as well as a willingness for an Israeli military presence, albeit a more limited one, on the Philadelphia and Netzarim corridors at the end of this phase. An Israeli negotiating delegation arrived in Qatar on Monday, where a delegation of Hamas members is also located, and CIA chief Bill Burns was also expected to arrive in Doha on Wednesday. On Tuesday night, a senior American official told Ynet that there will be a deal. 'It's just a matter of time,' he claimed. However, an Israeli official estimated that 'things are not yet ripe' and that there are still 'significant gaps.' The outline in question is reportedly based on the same outline that President Joe Biden revealed in May, which includes three stages, and, if implemented in full, should effectively bring about an end to the war. The first phase is set to last six weeks and will reportedly include the partial release of 'humanitarian' hostages such as women, the elderly and the sick - and now also the bodies of dead hostages - in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a partial withdrawal of the IDF and the introduction of greater humanitarian aid into the Strip and perhaps the possibility of refugees returning to northern Gaza. Earlier, Asharq Al-Awsat, a Saudi newspaper published in London, reported that negotiations between Israel and Hamas were now entering a 'crucial phase.' Sources in Cairo told the newspaper of an approach to signing the agreement once the final details, especially those related to the names of the living hostages and Palestinian prisoners, are finalized. According to the report, there is a possibility that the deal will be completed soon. The newspaper repeated the details of the emerging deal that have already been reported: The agreement includes a cease-fire in the first phase, an IDF withdrawal from city centers, while partially remaining in the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors - on the condition that 'women and children' are allowed to return to the northern Gaza Strip. In a later and gradual phase, the report states: 'the return of the men will be carried out according to an agreed mechanism.' In the first phase, which will last between 45 and 60 days, Hamas will release about 30 live and dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, dozens of whom have been sentenced to life imprisonment. The agreement also includes the transfer of the Rafah crossing to the Palestinian Authority, but not immediately and within the framework of arrangements supervised by Egypt. Al-Arabiya quoted sources as saying that Hamas had agreed to release the 'sick, elderly and female soldiers' who are being held captive in the first phase. At the same time, a Hamas source told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the terrorist organization's leadership had held several meetings with Qatari and Turkish officials in recent hours. 'A leading delegation from the movement is scheduled to visit Cairo on Sunday,' he said. 'We prefer not to talk about the details of the proposals on the table.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skc8ysls1x	2024-12-18T04:40:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/01/BJYydQqXyl/BJYydQqXyl_0_166_2048_1152_0_small.jpg

Italian woman rescued from cave after 3-day ordeal	Emergency services in Italy have rescued a cave explorer after she was injured and trapped underground for more than three days following a fall, bringing relief to Italians who have been following her fate. Ottavia Piana was carried out of the cave on a stretcher just before 3 a.m. on Wednesday and airlifted to a hospital in the northern city of Bergamo following a 75-hour rescue operation. Piana, 32, suffered injuries to her back and ribs and also has suspected fractures to facial bones and a knee after she fell around eight meters in the Abisso Bueno Fonteno cave network on Saturday. Rescuers said she was conscious but tired and clearly in pain when brought up to the surface after being trapped some 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) from the cave entrance. Piana, who is an experienced cave explorer, suffered a similar ordeal in July 2023 when she was trapped in the same cave network for around 40 hours after another accident.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwpjsxbyx	2024-12-18T03:30:38-08:00

Iran's currency plunges to historic low and Tehran turns off the ...	Since Trump's election victory, the Islamic Republic's currency has lost more than 10% of its value; At the same time, Iran's energy crisis is also worsening, despite its vast oil and gas reserves: the electricity grid is shaky due to sanctions, and now that a cold wave has arrived, there is not enough for everyone The value of the Iranian currency, the rial, fell to its lowest level ever on Wednesday, after losing more than 10% of its value since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election in November. The drop in the currency's value comes at a time when the Islamic Republic is facing major strategic setbacks in the form of the crushing of Hezbollah's power in Lebanon and the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, and at the same time as Trump is making vague statements that he does not rule out an attack on its nuclear facilities. According to reports coming from Tehran, the Iranian currency is trading at 777,000 rials to the dollar today, compared to 703,000 rials to the dollar the day Trump won. For comparison, before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the currency was worth 70 rials to the dollar, and in 2015, the year Iran signed the nuclear deal with the world powers, under which most sanctions were lifted and in exchange for Iran curtailing its nuclear program, the value was 32,000 rials to the dollar. On July 30 the day the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, was sworn in , the rate was 584,000 rials to the dollar. Pezeshkian was elected president partly on the strength of his promise to forge a new nuclear agreement with the powers that would ease sanctions, but in the meantime Iran's status and economy are only deteriorating, without such an agreement being reached, and without it appearing that the parties are getting closer to it. The reports of the further drop in the currency's value come against the backdrop of the regime's announcement that schools, universities and government offices in Tehran and more than half of the country's provinces will remain closed on Wednesday due to the energy crisis it is suffering from, following a devastating combination of an intense cold wave, heavy snow and air pollution. On Wednesday, Tehran's electric company announced that it was forced to turn off the streetlights that normally illuminate the capital's highways at night, due to the strain on the electricity grid. 'This policy will continue until a balance is reached between supply and demand,' said company official Alireza Rezaei. Tehran has been dealing with power outages on its highways for two months, and on Saturday local traffic police warned of the danger of an 'exponential increase in the number of road accidents.' Although Iran has vast gas and oil reserves, years of underinvestment in its infrastructure and international sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear program and its support for terrorist organizations have left its energy sector unprepared for the surge in demand during peak seasons, forcing it to resort to planned power outages and face shortages of ready-to-use gas. It also faced a similar crisis during the heat of the summer. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In recent weeks, the Islamic Republic has already been forced to impose restrictions on the use of electricity due to a shortage of gas and fuel for its power plants, and the cold wave that has hit the country in recent days has only increased demand, especially for gas, and left it in real distress. According to Iranian state television, temperatures in 25 of Iran's 31 provinces dropped below freezing overnight. Because of this, schools and public institutions in Tehran were closed for the fourth consecutive day, as were more than half of the country, in an attempt to save energy. Shopping malls in the capital Tehran were ordered to close their doors two hours earlier than usual to join the energy-saving effort. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syx514es1e	2024-12-18T02:59:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/18/H1e007Pmeryg/H1e007Pmeryg_0_278_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

The head of the U.N. migration agency said she was reassured by commitments she heard from Syria's new caretaker government in meetings in Damascus, as the country seeks to rebuild after more than a half-century of rule under the Assad family. Amy Pope, director-general of the International Organization for Migration, said Wednesday that Syria's new leaders 'recognize the job they have ahead of them is enormous and that they need the support of the international community.' IOM estimates about 100,000 people 'many looking to return to their former homes' have entered Syria from neighboring countries since Dec. 8, the day former President Bashar Assad fled the country as opposition fighters swarmed into the capital. 'There's no question to me that at this moment in time, they are looking for ways to make this work, to be more inclusive, to build partnerships across the international community, to build partnerships with other governments,' Pope said of the caretaker government. 'It's just going to be a question of whether they can deliver.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjtnbmgh1e	2024-12-18T01:19:49-08:00	
People love fake news,' says brother of Israeli spy Eli Cohen	Avraham Cohen, brother of Israeli spy active in Syria before he was caught, slams rumors saying agent's body was recovered from Syria and returned to Israel after security officials deny reports; 'We’ve been given hope' One day after incorrect rumors spread about the recovery of Israeli spy Eli Cohen's remains from Syria, his brother, Avraham Cohen, told Ynet on Wednesday: 'People love fake news. Everyone wants to be famous for knowing something, so they make things up and publish them irresponsibly. I looked into the claims circulating among the public and received confirmation that there’s no truth to them.' Numerous rumors suggested Cohen's remains had been returned from Syria, but security officials clarified the claims were false. Saudi TV network Al-Arabiya reported that the Mossad was allegedly working on locating Cohen’s remains and had connections with some rebel groups. The rumors coincided with a Russian report of an unusual Israeli operation deep in Syria, alleging that an Israeli helicopter landed near a military site in the Damascus area on Monday evening. Avraham shared that the family received inquiries from people asking if his brother's grave had indeed been located. 'People asked on WhatsApp and other platforms if we’d received any updates. It was nonsense. We didn’t hear anything from the Mossad or anyone else. People spread rumors just because they feel like it,' he said. Regarding efforts to locate his brother's grave, Avraham added, 'Hafez Assad once said they built an entire neighborhood over the area where Eli was buried. I don’t believe they’ll demolish the houses and find Eli’s grave.' 'I want to tell the government that if there’s truth to the matter, they should approach us – even if it’s a lie,' he stressed. 'Spreading fake news to the public is irresponsible and hurts the family for no reason. It creates false hope and disappointment and there’s no need for that. We’ve suffered enough and irresponsible individuals shouldn’t spread baseless rumors. Of course, we’d be thrilled if this were true.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Avraham noted that he discussed the matter with his niece Sophie, Eli’s daughter. 'She agrees that unsubstantiated reports shouldn’t be spread. It’s certainly the heartfelt wish of many in Israel for Eli’s remains to be recovered and returned home. I don’t know if an active search is going on but we’ve been given hope. I sincerely hope it’ll come true this time.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jrqmgsyl	2024-12-18T01:10:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/SybiMloEJx/SybiMloEJx_153_23_575_324_0_small.jpg

The IDF Combat Engineering Corps’ 601st Battalion's troops and commanders say they still have work to do in Gaza and will leave only once peace can be fully restored; 'Finding the hostages is our top priority' Fighting in the northern Gaza Strip has renewed since the IDF resumed its operations in the area. Now, the IDF Combat Engineering Corps’ 601st Battalion is acting against underground terror tunnels and working to separate the northern part of the Strip from Gaza City proper to clear out remaining Hamas terrorists in the area. 'We've made significant progress in the two months we've been here,' said Lt. Col. Yisgav Israeli, commander of the 601st Battalion. 'If you walk from here (the starting point of the refugee camp) to the sea, you'll be safe.' 'Our goal is to be the last soldiers in this area. To enter the area for the last time, no matter how long it takes,' he added. 'We’ll be the last battalion here if it were up to us and we’re here to finish the job.' Another commander we met on the ground showed us a drone image of the densely packed Jabaliya refugee camp. He zoomed in on a central building about a kilometer away from us. Near the building, dozens of black dots are seen moving back and forth. 'Look,' he pointed, 'these are terrorists in buildings we still haven't destroyed. At first, our objective was to push forward quickly, but now our focus is advancing to the heart of the camp and addressing the remaining threats. This isn't simple combat. Everything is dense and there are many narrow corridors. We're fully aware of the risks.' The scale of destruction in the Gaza Strip is staggering. We didn’t see a single intact structure from the moment we passed the Zikim checkpoint to about 10 kilometers inside the strip. The Combat Engineering Corps is working without pause. At one point, we met soldiers from the March 2024 draft. Barely 19 years old, they enlisted only eight months ago. Having just graduated high school and completed their training, they're now serving in Gaza and taking part in demolishing buildings. Despite the constant danger, their spirits remain high. When do you expect to leave here? 'I don’t know when we’re leaving,' Lt. Col. Israeli answered. 'We’re not planning on leaving anytime soon. This is our main mission and we’re doing it around the clock. We still have weeks, maybe months, ahead of us.' At the end of our time with him, Lt. Col. Israeli wanted to share a message. He led us to the building he uses as his headquarters. Pulling back the curtain at the entrance, he stepped into a room and sat on the couch. 'I wish things worked like this outside,' he said, with a hint of frustration.

But when you step outside, you just want to throw your phone away and shut yourself in a room to avoid seeing what’s happening. I found it really hard to handle.' Is there any chance of finding the hostages? 'Finding the hostages is our top priority. We're here daily and every day they aren’t with us twists the knife a little deeper. We'll stay here and do whatever it takes to bring them home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rythpbxbjl	2024-12-18T00:43:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/yk14190917/yk14190917_144_81_1078_607_0_small.jpg

UK's Starmer confirms plan to boost defense spending to 2.5% of G...	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer reiterated on Wednesday his Labor government's plan to increase defense spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), after NATO called on members to boost spending to meet threats from Russia. In an interview with LBC radio, Starmer was asked whether Britain would be willing to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP, but the leader repeated his government's position that it would plot a route to spending 2.5%. 'The commitment we've made is to set out a path to 2.5%,' he said. Starmer has said his government will set out that path next year. Last week, NATO head Mark Rutte warned the U.S.-led alliance that it was not ready for the threats it would face from Russia in the coming years and called for a shift to a wartime mindset, with much higher defense spending beyond the 2% target. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has called on NATO members to boost defense spending to 3% of economic output. The alliance estimates 23 of its 32 members will meet its target of dedicating 2% of GDP to defence this year.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkxrkgebye	2024-12-18T00:04:10-08:00

Shooting in all directions': How Qatar is grabbing a foothold in...	Doha is actively working to secure its place and interests in the region by coordinating with Turkey while masquerading as default mediator; How will this affect Israel? Following the collapse of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria last week, Qatar's foreign ministry issued an official statement, saying that Doha 'is closely monitoring developments in Syria and calls for preserving the nation's institutions and unity.' Numerous discussions have since taken place between Qatari officials and various regional leaders from across the political spectrum. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari, said that the country is closely following regional developments, particularly the war in Gaza and the situations in Syria and Lebanon. 'The Syrian people are facing an opportunity to realize their aspirations and establish a homeland for all. The people's choices must be supported. We call on all parties in Syria to work together to preserve the nation's unity,' he said. He also condemned 'Israeli incursions into the demilitarized zone with Syria and their control over it,' stressing that Qatar's role is defined by Syria and that it maintains contact with all parties involved. On Monday, Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani about enhancing cooperation between their countries across various fields and discussing regional developments. Last week, Qatar's foreign ministry announced that its embassy in Syria would reopen soon, following necessary preparations, and it confirmed on Sunday that embassy operations would resume on Wednesday. Moreover, Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi held talks with Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed Al Thani last Thursday. According to Iranian reports, the discussions focused primarily on the situation in Syria. That same day, a joint Turkish-Qatari delegation, including Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatar's State Security Chief Khalfan Al-Kaabi, visited Damascus. The delegation met with rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani) and Syria's interim prime minister Mohammed al-Bashir. Qatar is already planning its next steps in the region. Following the Assad regime's fall, it immediately sent humanitarian aid to Syria via Turkey. A week ago, Qatar's foreign ministry reported that the emirate had delivered aid intended for Syria to the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Qatar presents itself as a supportive mediator while pursuing other interests behind the scenes 'The Qataris know how to leverage the humanitarian issue as a powerful tool for their interests,' explained Dr. Ariel Admoni, a researcher in Bar-Ilan University's Middle East department specializing in Qatar. 'In this case, they collaborated with the Turks because they want boots on the ground — people who are familiar with the situation firsthand.' According to Admoni, the Qataris are aware of their limitations. 'A contact in the Damascus embassy is nice but Turkey understands the area — whether it's dealing with clashes involving the Kurds or rising forces. Turkey is on Syria's border; it lives as part of its reality and is already poised to intervene in Syria. The Qataris prefer that Turkey's involvement happens in coordination with them.' 'If we think about Qatari behavior from the early days of Syria's civil war, Qatar didn’t solely back Islamists – it also supported the coalition and secular elements,' Admoni added. 'As in many conflicts, Qatar funds various groups to ensure a foothold on the ground. 'The Turks and Qataris already share close military and economic ties dating back to the Arab nations' boycott of Qatar between 2017 and 2021. Qatar’s collaboration with Turkey provides it with proximity to the situation and the ability to monitor developments closely.' Amid the uncertainty surrounding Syria's future, Qatar, experienced in 'ensuring future investments,' is hedging its bets and 'shooting in all directions.' 'They’re ensuring that any actor – whether aligned with Iran or an Islamist – will need Qatar,' Admoni noted. 'At the Doha Forum held about a week ago, Qatar held intensive discussions with UN representatives and American officials, repeatedly raising the Syrian issue. 'This is a calculated attempt to position themselves not only as a representative of Iran but also of the West in the region. Qatar's decision to be among the first to reopen an embassy in Syria is no coincidence — it ensures that no matter the direction the regime takes, its interests, including economic ones, will be safeguarded.' Admoni stressed that Qatar doesn’t want to appear overly opportunistic at this stage but is ensuring all regional actors recognize it as the 'default mediator.' Rebel leader al-Sharaa’s current self-branding conveniently aligns with Qatar's narrative, which promotes the idea that Islam doesn't necessarily equate to terrorism. 'Using media and statements from its prime minister and foreign minister, Qatar champions the notion that they oppose terrorism but argue against rejecting Islam altogether,' Admoni explained. 'If al-Sharaa presents himself this way, Qatar won’t object. They’re fully embracing this narrative.' Regarding Qatar-Iran relations, Admoni said that the weakening of the Shiite-Iranian axis won’t prompt Qatar to abandon its ties. 'Qatar knows better than to dismiss regional actors, even when they’re on the decline. Over the past decade, when Hamas was ostensibly more present in Gaza, Qatar continued — and continues — to engage with the Palestinian Authority,' he said. Admoni believes Qatar will maintain relations with various players, ensuring that Syrians may need them for Iran’s sake — or vice versa — or even for the West. Qatar’s modus operandi is familiar to Israel from its activities in Gaza, which is why it raises concerns. Qatar presents itself as a supportive mediator while pursuing other interests behind the scenes. This strategy has worked in different arenas so far and its recent actions suggest it’s determined to cement its influence in the Syrian arena. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Ultimately, when Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson explained the delegation’s visit to Turkey, he said that its purpose was to coordinate humanitarian aid,' Admoni added. 'But when the delegation includes Qatar’s state security chief, it’s clear you don’t send your intelligence head to coordinate humanitarian aid issues. Qatar has plenty of humanitarian agencies capable of handling such tasks.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybayjlhye	2024-12-17T22:39:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/03/31/9156247/9156247_249_136_849_478_0_small.jpg

Houthis see ‘little to lose’ as missile threat persists and Israe...	Israel intercepted a Houthi missile launched from Yemen toward Tel Aviv, prompting discussions of a military response; Iran-backed group continues attacks amid Israel's multi-front war, posing a growing but manageable threat A ballistic missile launched toward central Israel by the Yemen-based Houthis could lead to an Israeli military response in an effort by the Jewish state to deter further attacks. The attack on Monday was intercepted by the Israeli air defense system, causing no damage or injuries while sending tens of thousands of people to protected areas, but poses a dilemma for Israel on what its options are while facing the threat. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed rebel group that operates in Yemen, joined the war on Israel, which was initiated by the Gaza-based Hamas terrorist organization in October of last year. Since the beginning of the war, the Houthis have fired over a dozen ballistic missiles and a larger number of drones. Israel has largely been successful at thwarting the attacks, except for one civilian death in the past summer from a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv. In July and September, Israel launched widescale attacks against Houthi targets in Yemen, focusing on the Hodeida port, which is considered a lifeline for the terrorist group. The July offensive was the first time Israel directly hit Yemen. The attack achieved temporary quiet, with a lull in attacks from Yemen. However, in the past two months, the Houthis seem to have rekindled their efforts against Israel despite other fronts in the war against Israel becoming less active. 'The Houthis may be making calculations figuring that they can sustain an Israeli retribution once every few months while continuing to attack Israel,' according to Dr. Nachum Shiloh, a research fellow from the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. 'Unlike Gaza and Lebanon, where the Israeli Air Force can conduct hundreds of sorties a day, this is not the case in Yemen, which is approximately 2,000 kilometers away.' 'In their cost-benefit analysis, they want to implement their anti-Israeli, anti-American ideology while taking into account that Israel’s ability to hit them is limited,' Shiloh said, adding that Yemen’s impoverished population and under-developed economy make for very few valuable military targets to Israel. 'The price currently being exacted by Israel still allows the Houthis to continue attacking,' he explained. 'Our only option is to continue supporting and defending our oppressed brothers in Gaza until the aggression stops and the siege is lifted,' Hezam al-Asad, a member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, posted on his X social media account on Tuesday. According to Sharona Shir Zablodovsky, an expert on public policy and national security at the Dvorah Forum, the Houthis are banking on their distance from Israel. 'The geographical distance is an advantage because it allows them to be prepared for an attack,' she said. 'But also, with Yemen’s failing economy, the Houthis have little to lose.' Israeli media reported that defense officials have decided to attack Houthi targets again. While the damage from Houthi attacks has not been large-scale, the cost of thwarting ballistic missiles and unarmed vehicles (UAVs) is estimated at millions of dollars per interceptor, something Israel would like to avoid. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, Israeli air defense systems have been challenged by the UAV threat. The small vessels are often successful in evading sophisticated radar systems and have preoccupied state-of-the-art fighter jets engaged in often lengthy aerial pursuits. 'The threat from Yemen is more of a nuisance than a strategic one,' said Shiloh. 'Israel has no problem intercepting the number of missiles currently fired from the Houthi, and while the drones have exposed a weak spot in Israel’s air defense, it is still something that is dealt with.' There is no precise estimate of the number of missiles the Houthis possess. Still, several research institutions and think tanks believe they have a relatively wide array of missiles of varying ranges capable of carrying different types of warheads, including unconventional weapons. The delay in Israel’s response to the Houthi threat is not only rooted in the relatively low price in terms of human life and the disruption to daily life but also in Israel’s entanglement in a multi-front war that has lasted over a year. Currently, Israel is engaged in an active battle in the Gaza Strip against Hamas and maintaining a fragile cease-fire with the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon. There are hopes that a cease-fire with Hamas is imminent, and with a possible Israeli strike against Iran in the works, Israel may have chosen to contain the Houthi attacks until now. Israel is also waiting for US President Donald Trump to enter the White House in a month, something that will most certainly impact its ability to act in the Middle East and also may have motivated it towards containment. 'I am sure the Houthis are not first on Israel’s list of priorities,' said Shiloh. The Houthis have also staged frequent attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden against international vessels, something the US and other Western powers have so far failed to halt. This has caused major disruptions in international trade. On Monday, the US military announced it had conducted an airstrike against a critical Houthi command and control center as part of that effort. 'The Houthi’s ability to harm international trade could lead to action by the US and other actors,' said Zablodovsky. 'This could be beneficial to Israel. Such action, however, could also instigate Iran if its leadership feels like it is losing its grip.' For years, the Houthis have been a menace to the region, attacking targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Throughout the current conflict, the Houthis have said their attacks, both against Israeli and other targets, are an expression of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Such was the Hezbollah’s rationale when it also joined the attack. The Houthis are largely funded and backed by Iran. Hezbollah and Hamas, both Iranian proxies of varying extent, have both been significantly hit by Israel. Israel’s attacks on the Houthis have so far failed to neutralize the threat, leaving the group to pose a nuisance to the Jewish state still. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Neither Iran nor its proxies should be underestimated or eulogized, even though they have been badly hit by Israel,' said Zablodovsky. 'They still have abilities, as the Houthis proved earlier this week, and the Iranian regime will not give up so easily on its agenda.' The Iranian leadership has frequently vowed to seek the destruction of Israel. With Hezbollah and Hamas significantly weakened, the Houthis may see their mission against Israel as an even more pressing one. While Israel reportedly prepares for a significant strike against the Houthis in Yemen, their motivation to continue to target Israel will remain. 'Such extreme ideological groups that define themselves as part of the resistance to Israel do not raise a white flag in surrender,' said Shiloh. -This article is written by Keren Setton and reprinted with permission from The Media Line >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bky11ijesjl	2024-12-17T21:29:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/14/S1xqfXzcr0/S1xqfXzcr0_0_166_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Concern in the US, Israel over Elon Musk's handling of sensitive ...	Three parallel investigations have been opened in the US regarding the billionaire, and the US Air Force has refused to grant him a high-level security clearance, the New York Times reports; Other countries, including in Europe, have expressed concern Elon Musk and SpaceX face at least three federal reviews over whether they have complied with federal reporting rules aimed at protecting national security, the New York Times reported. Musk, among other things, did not provide details about meetings he held with foreign leaders. Several US allies, including Israel, have also expressed concerns that Musk might share sensitive information with others, according to the report. According to the report, SpaceX employees had become concerned about Musk's ability to handle classified information, including due to posts he made on the X platform covering everything from gaming to diplomatic meetings. These concerns, it was reported, were exacerbated by Musk's very high security clearance at SpaceX, which exposes him to classified information such as advanced U.S. military technologies. Musk, according to the rules, must report information regarding his personal life and his foreign flights, as part of a process known as 'ongoing review.' This allows the administration to assess whether he can continue to be exposed to sensitive information. Musk has met with, among others, the Iranian ambassador to the UN. This is not the first time the security practices of the SpaceX founder have been questioned by the Pentagon. A 2018 incident in which Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla, smoked marijuana on a live Web show with U.S. comedian Joe Rogan also sparked a security clearance review by the Pentagon. Such reviews ordinarily occur once instances of a potential infraction come to light, Pentagon officials have said. The New York Times said the new reviews were initiated by the Air Force, the Defense Department's Inspector General and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security. It cited eight people with knowledge of the rocket company and internal documents. 'Elon Musk and his rocket company, SpaceX, have repeatedly failed to comply with federal reporting protocols aimed at protecting state secrets, including by not providing some details of his meetings with foreign leaders,' the newspaper report said. The Air Force and undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security referred queries to the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General. That office, in turn, said that as a matter of policy, it could 'neither confirm nor deny the existence of an ongoing investigation.' It added: 'This is to protect the confidentiality of those involved and to protect the integrity of the investigative process.' SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell declined to comment on the security clearance issues or the probes when asked by a Reuters reporter as she left an event in Washington. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The New York Times said the Air Force recently cited potential security risks in denying high-level security access for Musk, and that allies including Israel have flagged concerns that the billionaire CEO might share sensitive data. Last month, two Democratic U.S. senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Jack Reed, wrote in a letter that reports that Musk has held multiple calls with Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, should be investigated by the Pentagon and law-enforcement agencies on national security grounds. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall responded last week to Shaheen that he shared those concerns but could not comment on the status of a person's security clearance. Musk is the owner of Tesla. After the U.S. presidential election, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would appoint him as the person to lead a process to streamline his future administration and make major cuts to prevent waste of taxpayer money. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkasaayb1l	2024-12-17T20:50:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/24/Sk12p70uR/Sk12p70uR_0_80_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Security Council has issued its first statement on Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad's government, calling for a Syrian-led political process leading to elections and urging all nations to respect the country;s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. The council said Syrians should 'peacefully, independently and democratically determine their own futures' based on key principles in a 2015 council resolution that sets out a roadmap to peace calling for a new constitution and U.N.-monitored elections. It said the process should be facilitated by the United Nations and backed efforts being taken by U.N. envoy Geir Pedersen. The Security Council reiterated support for the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNDOF monitoring the Israel-Syria border following the 1973 Mideast war. It stressed the obligation of all parties to the 1974 Disengagement Agreement that established a demilitarized buffer zone between the countries to abide by its terms and reduce tensions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bykgpa1hyl	2024-12-17T20:01:49-08:00	
Hebron: How do 1,100 Jews survive surrounded by 200,000 Arabs?	Yishai Fleisher explains why Hebron is one of the most dangerous cities in Israel The residents of Hebron face a daily battle for their safety and security, according to Yishai Fleisher, director of international affairs for the Jewish community of Hebron. Speaking to ILTV News on Sunday, Fleisher highlighted the challenges of living in the ancient city, home to one of Judaism’s holiest sites: the Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs. For centuries, Hebron was largely inaccessible to Jews. It is also the site of the 1929 Hebron massacre, where nearly 70 Jews were killed by local Muslims. In 1967, Israel regained control of Hebron during the Six-Day War. Today, around 1,100 Jews live in the city, surrounded by approximately 200,000 Arabs in an area governed by the Palestinian Authority, many of whom support Hamas, Fleisher said. 'Some people call it even a Hamas city,' he noted. The security concerns extend beyond the residents. Fleisher emphasized that visitors to the holy site also require protection. 'On the one hand, we're a security town. On the other hand, we're a touristic town,' Fleisher said. 'So, in many ways, we mirror what Israel is, which is a country that has a security element but wants to bring in people and connect with a lot of people.' Hebron also faces what Fleisher described as a 'narrative war.' 'We face a lot of besmirchment of the history of the Jewish community of Hebron, an effort to erase our history, an effort to blacken our name,' he said. 'But we fight through that with the amazing message of the history of the Jewish community of Hebron and the connections of the forefathers and mothers and the heritage of the Jewish people in this place.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s18wir1hyx	2024-12-17T20:00:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/22/HkWctMAGJg/HkWctMAGJg_0_139_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Time to strike back at the Houthis?	British military expert Andrew Fox says the time does feel right to start taking 'more assertive' action towards the Houthi Israel and its allies may soon take 'slightly more assertive action toward the Houthis,' according to British military expert Andrew Fox. Earlier this week, the Houthis launched missiles at central Israel, a bold move considering the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, which has largely held. Fox explained that for the past 14 months, Israel has been 'reactive' and has lacked 'a particularly clear strategy as to how to find a political or military solution to the problem.' However, he suggested that recent developments—such as attacks on allied ships, direct strikes on Israel, and Iran's weakening position—could make this an opportune moment for action. 'I think a completely independent Israeli strike is extremely unlikely,' Fox said. 'Israel will need American facilitation of things like refueling and recovery of potential downed aircraft, should such an eventuality occur. But I think it's very clear that with the collapse of the remainder of Iran's Shiites crescent proxy strategy, the time does feel right to start taking slightly more assertive action towards the Houthis.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjyjfa1b1e	2024-12-17T19:43:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/15/yk13718211/yk13718211_0_0_658_371_0_small.jpg
Still 'significant' gaps in cease-fire negotiations as CIA chief ...	Senior U.S. official asserts 'there will be a deal'; With Israeli delegation in Doha, Jerusalem keeping a cool head; First phase expected to include 7-week cease-fire while second phase 'won't be easy' As progress appears to be continuing in talks for a cease-fire and hostage deal with Hamas - and in light of Defense Minister Israel Katz's statement that such an agreement is 'closer than ever,' a senior U.S. official told Ynet Tuesday evening that there will be a deal. 'It's just a matter of time,' he claims. However, an Israeli official estimated that 'things are not yet ripe.' This does not mean that a deal will not be implemented, but he noted that 'there are significant gaps.' At the same time, the Reuters news agency reported that CIA Director Bill Burns will arrive in Qatar. An Israeli delegation left for Doha, the capital of Qatar, Monday night, and the source said that 'it is likely that, in order to close a deal, the senior officials will have to come to Cairo, with Hamas representatives in another room. In the meantime, there is a lot of inaccurate information reaching the media.' According to information obtained by Ynet, the first phase of the deal will include a seven-week cease-fire, during which women, children and elderly hostages will be released and negotiations will take place on the second phase - in which all the men, the soldiers, and the bodies of the killed hostages will be returned. In the second phase, it appears, Israel will be forced to release a very large number of terrorists. 'It will not be easy to digest,' they explained in Israel. Degel Hatorah Party chairman Moshe Gafni, a member of Knesset, met Wednesday with families of hostages, amid criticism from some of them about the intention to advance a partial deal first. 'I don't know what I'm doing in this coalition,' he told relatives of the hostages. 'The government is going for a phased deal. I want a comprehensive deal with all the hostages.' A source familiar with the details said that behind the scenes, as Haaretz first reported, talks are underway led by the Americans to bring a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries back to the table. Ron Dermer, the Minister of Strategic Affairs who is close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been working for a long time on a wording that would be acceptable to Saudi Arabia in the context of a vague commitment to a future Palestinian state. Now, Israel understands, this is needed not only for an agreement to normalize relations, but also for Saudi Arabia to agree to finance the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip the day after the war. Bothoutgoing President Joe Biden's people and the staff of President-elect Donald Trump are involved in those negotiations with Saudi Arabia. The one pushing for this is Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is interested in bringing about a hostage deal during Biden's term - which will end in about a month with Trump's inauguration on January 20. 'Talks in Doha are almost at a final stage' Palestinian sources claim that the talks on the hostage deal taking place in Doha have reached an 'advanced, almost final stage,' the Saudi-owned Al-Sharq channel reported. The report also revealed the deal that is apparently in the works. The first phase - humanitarian - will include bringing aid to the Gaza Strip and releasing all civilian Israeli hostages, and female soldiers, whether they are alive or their bodies are being held in Gaza. The first phase will reportedly last at least six weeks, and the Israeli civilian hostages will be released in exchange for the release of hundreds of terrorists from Israeli prisons. The aid to Gaza will come immediately after the start of the cease-fire - and will also be accompanied by an Israeli withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor. The forces will remain on the eastern side of the Rafah crossing - and will partially and gradually withdraw from the Netzarim corridor. The Washington Post reported earlier Tuesday that Hamas insists on the return of the displaced to the north of the Gaza Strip, and the Saudi report also claims that they will be allowed to return to Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip, with an IDF supervision mechanism that will ensure that Hamas terrorists and factions of other terrorist organizations do not take over the area. The Palestinian authorities, the report noted, did not reveal further details regarding that mechanism, and it is still unclear how it will operate. In the second phase of the agreement, the remaining Israeli hostages, including soldiers and officers, also will be released in exchange for the release of terrorists - the number of whom has not yet been finally agreed upon. Among other things, dozens of terrorists who have been sentenced to long prison terms are also expected to be released. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The sources noted that this list does not currently include prisoners considered terror 'leaders', such as Marwan Barghouti. Israel, it is claimed, insists on deporting these terrorists. At this stage, Israel will also complete its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, with forces being allowed to remain in the eastern and northern border areas. After that, the end of the war will be declared and the blockade on the Gaza Strip will be lifted, including the opening of the crossings. And who will manage those crossings? According to the sources, the Palestinian Authority, in coordination with Egypt and the European Union, will be responsible for supervising the Rafah crossing. The crossing will be activated gradually with the entry of aid and the transfer of the wounded and sick from Gaza. There has also been discussion about the 'day after' the war .The identity of the administrator of the Gaza Strip will be agreed upon at the end of the war, according to the report. The one who will decide on this will be a committee with 'independent powers,' which will operate in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority. This, however, requires a presidential decree from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1kq2wyryg	2024-12-17T13:19:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/09/Bke40uLz86/Bke40uLz86_0_194_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
IDF establishes a reserve division for troops aged 38-58 to bolst...	The David Brigades was created to prevent enemy infiltrations like the one on October 7; It consists of five reserve brigades, and is set to strengthen border defenses and respond rapidly to threats, with operational readiness targeted for 2025; 'Struggling to meet recruitment targets' The IDF announced the establishment of five new reserve brigades on Tuesday, known as the 'David Brigades,' to enhance defensive capabilities along Israel’s borders in response to evolving operational needs and lessons learned from the ongoing war and the October 7 terror attack. The brigades – Negev ('Negba'), Shephelah ('Yonatan'), Valleys ('Yizraeli'), Jerusalem ('Ari'), and Galilee-Golan – will be tasked with providing a rapid defensive response to sudden events. Recruitment will be based on soldiers’ residential areas, enabling a more immediate and effective initial response. The units will primarily consist of reserve soldiers aged 38-58, most of whom are volunteers with extensive experience gained during both their military service and civilian lives. IDF Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi emphasized the need to expand the military’s capabilities. 'In this war, we have learned that the IDF needs to be larger and broader to face difficult situations and prolonged wars,' Halevi said. 'Over these months, we are establishing new brigades of reservists comprised mostly of individuals who are already over the exemption age and have shown a willingness, recognizing the urgency of the moment, to step up and say we are returning to serve, returning to the reserves. Although we are not at the official age for reserve duty, we come with the right spirit and an understanding of the necessity.' Halevi highlighted the importance of easing the current strain on Israel’s reserve forces, who have faced an unprecedented operational load. 'When they carry out operational duties, we will be able to alleviate the burden on the reserves, which has been so heavy over the past year and three months. I must salute the reservists who have handled this burden with exceptional quality and great honor,' he added. Maj. Gen. (res.) Moti Baruch, the founder of the new brigades, underscored the need to adapt to the changing security environment. 'We all understand that the security reality has changed, and we must adapt accordingly. These are people who are ready to volunteer and play a central role in strengthening security, and we view this as a significant operational advantage,' Baruch said. The division will include approximately 15,000 infantry reservists, equipped with personal weapons, marksmen, grenade launchers, snipers and drone teams for reconnaissance and attack missions. The units will not operate armored vehicles but are designed for swift, flexible deployments. Over the past nine months since the ambitious plan was launched, the IDF has managed to recruit around 3,000 soldiers, including 100 company commanders out of the 130 required. 'We are struggling to meet recruitment targets,' the IDF admitted. 'We are currently in contact with another 6,000 individuals who are in the process of enlisting, but there is a strong willingness among many people, even those in their 40s and 50s, to serve. Many recruits will be veterans of combat engineering and similar units.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Reservists in the new division will be on high alert and able to mobilize rapidly from their homes during emergencies. As a result, they will keep their personal weapons and uniforms at home, despite the associated risks of theft or safety incidents. The IDF also plans for one of the division’s battalions to be composed of Bedouin soldiers, featuring four combat companies from the Galilee and one company from the Negev. To join the new division, soldiers must complete a thorough bureaucratic process, including providing a clean criminal record, documentation verifying their mental and physical health and other approvals. The initiative reflects the IDF’s shift toward bolstering defense capabilities and readiness amid changing security threats, relying on experienced reservists and volunteers committed to safeguarding the nation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b14ezrkr1l	2024-12-17T12:23:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/S1XPIgJSJl/S1XPIgJSJl_0_20_1600_900_0_small.jpg
Iris president: 'Israel violated sovereignty of 3 countries'	srael Violated the Sovereignty of 3 Countries'; Saar: 'Anti-Semitic Lie Show' Irish President Michael Higgins said Tuesday that calling the Irish antisemites is 'gross slander,' during a ceremony to accept the credentials of the Ambassador of the State of Palestine Jilan Abdaljamid.

Man accused of killing UnitedHealth executive indicted for murder	Luigi Mangione, the man accused of shooting dead UnitedHealth Group executive Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street this month, was indicted for murder on Tuesday, prosecutors said. 'This type of premeditated, targeted gun violence cannot and will not be tolerated,' Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement announcing the indictment. Ivy League-educated Mangione was charged with murder on Dec. 9 for the killing of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel before a company conference, following a five-day manhunt. Mangione suffered from chronic back pain that affected his daily life, according to friends and social media posts, though it is unclear whether his personal health played a role in the shooting. Mangione was charged with murder in the first and second degrees as well as counts related to criminal possession of a weapon, prosecutors said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk4rwdybkx	2024-12-17T11:41:35-08:00

For 1st time since start of war, hostage's family member will bri...	Michael, the brother of hostage Or Levy, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023, is scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the opening of the Security Council's discussion of the Middle East; Unprecedented invitation came after efforts by Amb. Danny Danon and the United States For the first time since the beginning of the war in Gaza, the family of an Israeli hostage will participate in an official discussion of the United Nations Security Council. Wednesday's meeting, on the subject of the situation in the Middle East, will be attended by Michael Levy, the brother of Or Levy, who was abducted from the Nova music festival during the October 7 massacre. His invitation to the discussion was made possible after many efforts by Israel and UN Ambassador Danny Danon, and thanks to an invitation by the American delegation. Or was kidnapped 438 days ago; on the same day, his wife Einav was murdered, and their son Almog, only 3 years old, is being raised by family members until his father returns. Michael Levy will brief the Security Council at the beginning of the session, which is chaired by the new president of the UN Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. This is an unprecedented event, since families of the hostages as of yet have not been granted permission to speak before the Security Council in an official council debate. 'After a long struggle and thanks to the willingness of the U.S. delegation, we were able for the first time to bring the family of hostage Or Levy to brief the Security Council ambassadors in an official council debate,' Danon said. 'We will continue to fight until all the hostages emerge from the darkness of Hamas' tunnels into the light. We will not wait for a miracle and we will not leave the fate of the hostages in the hands of the UN.' Michael Levy said he was invited to speak because the U.S. currently holds the council's rotating presidency. 'I was contacted by one of the assistants to the U.S. ambassador in New York; She said they had seen my interviews. This is the first time the U.S. has been president of the Security Council since the start of the war, and until now no family member has spoken in this forum. The other countries would not have invited us,' he said.

I'm talking about the personal aspect, not politics. There's an opportunity now to make things happen, and their silence screams. This is their commitment as diplomats and especially as human beings. If they accept this situation, they are saying that some people's lives are more important than others' lives.' 'Tomorrow is my birthday,' he added, 'and this will be the second time I haven't celebrated a birthday. My life has stopped. I will talk about Or, about his son, Almog, and what it is like to be the family of a kidnapped person.' 'I mostly know nothing, and it's terrible. I only know what every citizen knows. Now there is some kind of peak, I assume something is happening, you don't have to be a great genius for that. What, how and who is on the list - that's a good question. Or is a humanitarian case, but I assume he won't be in the first stage. It doesn't sound like Israel insisted enough on this, but I would be very happy to be wrong. I hope we will know in the coming days. I am not in favor of a partial deal, and it has nothing to do with my brother. Even if he is released first, it's time to get everyone out because if they keep waiting - there will be no one to get out,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkuowijryg	2024-12-17T11:32:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/HJPGtmyHyg/HJPGtmyHyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Prime minister visits site taken over by IDF with heads of the defense establishment; 'We are here at a crossroads to decide on Israel's preparedness in this important place' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during his visit to the Syrian side of Mount Hermon on Tuesday that Israel and Israeli troops will remain at the site 'until another arrangement is found that guarantees Israel’s security.' Netanyahu made the statement alongside the heads of the defense establishment. 'The events in Syria are happening at a dizzying pace, and their consequences could determine fates,' he said. Netanyahu held a briefing Tuesday on the site over the Syrian border, together with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Northern Command Commander Gen. Ori Gordin, and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. According to a statement from his office: 'The Prime Minister reviewed the IDF deployment in the area and set guidelines for the future.' 'I am here on the summit of Mt. Hermon with the Defense Minister, the IDF Chief-of-Staff, the Head of Northern Command, the Director of the ISA and senior commanders. We are holding this assessment in order to decide on the deployment of the IDF in this important place until another arrangement is found that ensures Israel's security,' he says. 'This is nostalgic for me; I was here 53 years ago with my soldiers on a Sayeret Matkal patrol,' he says. 'The place hasn’t changed, it’s the same place, but its importance to Israel’s security has only been reinforced in recent years, and especially in recent weeks with the dramatic events taking place here below us in Syria. We will determine the best arrangement that will ensure our security.' Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), addressed Israel for the first time over the weekend and said that Syria will continue to adhere to the disengagement agreement signed in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War. He called on the international community to ensure that Israel remained committed to the agreement. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a conversation he held on Monday with a small group of journalists, al-Sharaa sharply criticized Israel's 'military advances' into Syrian territory beyond the Golan Heights and into the buffer zone declared by the UN under the agreement, which is considered disputed according to international consensus. Israel has described its advances into Syrian territory as defensive measures aimed at preventing armed groups from seizing positions near the border and ensuring the security of communities in the Golan Heights. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhx7hybkx	2024-12-17T10:00:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/HkeWj74kBkg/HkeWj74kBkg_0_0_1280_852_0_small.jpg

Palestinian sources familiar with the negotiations told the Saudi newspaper As-Sharq al-Awsat, that 'talks regarding the cease-fire agreement and prisoner exchange in the Gaza Strip have reached an advanced and almost final stage. According to the sources, the two sides agreed to implement the agreement in three stages, starting with a 'humanitarian' stage that will last six weeks, and include 'the introduction of aid to the Gaza Strip and the release of Israeli hostages, including female soldiers.' In the second stage, they said, all remaining hostages, both living and dead, will be returned. In the third stage, there will be a comprehensive and permanent cease-fire, and a complete withdrawal of the IDF from the Gaza Strip, including from the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors, and other positions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syusmsyhkx	2024-12-17T09:34:18-08:00	
Waiting for loved ones in Syria’s Sednaya Prison: Many missing, m...	Since the fall of the Assad regime, the search for detainees in Syria’s notorious prisons has brought both heartbreak and revelations, as families mourn the missing and uncover brutal executions Following Bashar Assad’s fall from power in Syria, thousands of detained Syrians have been released from prison. Yet tens of thousands of imprisoned individuals are still missing, with many presumed dead. When search operations began in Sednaya military prison, Naima, a mother from Idlib, was hopeful that her son would be found alive there, but by the time the search came to an end, there was no sign of her son, who had been imprisoned for years. Similarly, Mahmoud was unable to locate his father, who was taken to the prisonin 2011. 'Thirteen years of patience and hope to see him again, 13 years imagining the moment of reunion,' he said. 'How did they kill you? The revolution has triumphed, father, but they killed you.' Syrian opposition factions have released around 3,000 former detainees from Sednaya Prison alone over the past week. Social media platforms are flooded with images and videos of released Syrians who were detained in the regime’s prisons for being associated with the Syrian revolution. Rumors quickly spread about large numbers of detainees on their way to freedom, but only a small portion of the anticipated detainees were found. From 2011 until the end of Assad’s rule, Syrian authorities used detention as a tool to suppress and silence opposition. Numerous accusations have surfaced about massacres committed inside Syrian prisons, which were substantiated by a leaked group of photos known as the Caesar Files – tens of thousands of photos taken between 2011 and 2013 showing detainees killed in Syrian prisons. The release of those files, named for the pseudonymous leaker, led the U.S. to pass the bipartisan Caesar Act in December 2019, which imposed sanctions on Assad for his crimes against Syrian civilians. Syrians believe that the deposed regime detained hundreds of thousands of people. According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, the Assad regime detained approximately 137,000 individuals since 2011, including more than 96,000 forcibly disappeared people. Naima says that her son disappeared under mysterious circumstances while working in Damascus in 2011. Later, they learned that he had been detained by the Syrian regime. She had hoped to find him after the regime’s fall, but that did not happen. 'It seems he is dead. His son will never see him now, nor will his wife,' she said, pointing to his photograph in obvious pain. 'My son did nothing wrong. His only crime was being from Idlib.' Another man named Ehab was momentarily jubilant upon hearing about the release of his cousin, who had been detained since 2012. His joy turned to despair when it was revealed that the release involved someone else with the same name. When opposition forces entered Sednaya Prison, they discovered bodies of detainees bearing signs of brutal torture. Among them was Mazen al-Hamada, a Syrian activist who was first imprisoned and tortured between 2011 and 2013. After being released and fleeing to Europe, al-Hamada returned to Syria in 2020 and was imprisoned once again. Photos suggest he was tortured to death. Gruesome deaths at Sednaya Prison are nothing new. According to a 2017 Amnesty International report, over 13,000 people were extrajudicially executed at the prison between 2011 and 2015. Dr. Ahmed al-Shaher, a Syrian physician, told The Media Line that the bodies discovered in Sednaya appeared to have died recently, with signs of torture evident. These signs suggest that the regime carried out routine torture and execution campaigns. As the detainee search efforts came to an end, Syrians held mourning ceremonies for their loved ones across the country. The director of the Syrian Network for Human Rights announced that those not found can officially be considered deceased. American citizen Travis Timmerman, who had been detained in a Syrian prison, was discovered by chance in the search efforts. Detainees with Jordanian, Lebanese, Iraqi and Turkish citizenship also were freed. Other than those, no foreign nationals were found. That’s difficult news for the family of Austin Tice, an American journalist who’s been detained in Syria since 2012. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Previous information provided to The Media Line suggests that Tice is still alive, but his whereabouts remain unknown. The Syrian Political Affairs Administration announced last week that search operations were ongoing to determine his location. In addition to these discoveries, new claims have emerged regarding previously hidden mass graves. Mouaz Moustafa, head of the US-based Syrian Emergency Task Force, stated on Monday that a mass grave near Damascus may hold the remains of at least 100,000 people. He described the site in Al Qutayfah, about 25 miles north of the capital, as one of five mass graves he has documented. Although the claim could not be independently verified, Moustafa said victims likely include Syrians as well as American, British, and other foreign nationals, adding further weight to longstanding allegations of extrajudicial killings committed during Assad’s rule. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byrubeksyl	2024-12-17T08:59:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/ryigltBVyl/ryigltBVyl_0_159_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Pope reveals he was target of suicide bomb attempt during 2021 Ir...	Pope Francis says police informed him that at least two known suicide bombers were targeting one of his planned events; 'A woman packed with explosives was heading to Mosul to blow herself up during the papal visit' Pope Francis has revealed he was the target of an attempted suicide bombing during his visit to Iraq three years ago, the first by a Catholic pontiff to the country and probably the riskiest foreign trip of his 11-year papacy. In an excerpt published on Tuesday from a forthcoming autobiography, Francis said he was informed by police after landing in Baghdad in March 2021 that at least two known suicide bombers were targeting one of his planned events. 'A woman packed with explosives, a young kamikaze, was heading to Mosul to blow herself up during the papal visit,' wrote the pontiff, according to an excerpt from the book published in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. 'And a van had also set off at full speed with the same intent.' Francis' visit to Mosul was a key moment during his Iraq trip. Iraq's second-largest city had been under the control of Islamic State from 2014 to 2017. The pope visited the ruins of four destroyed churches there and launched an appeal for peace. During the trip, the Vatican provided few details about the security preparations for the pope. Many of the events during his visit, which took place as the COVID-19 pandemic was first easing, were open only to a limited number of people. Iraq is known to have deployed thousands of additional security personnel to protect Francis. The Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for further details about the pope's new comments. Francis' new autobiography, titled 'Hope,' is due to be published on January 14, 2025. The pope also published a memoir in March. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the excerpt published on Tuesday, Francis said the Vatican had been informed about the assassination attempt by British intelligence. The pope said he asked a security official the next day what had happened to the would-be bombers. 'The commander replied laconically: 'They are no more',' wrote Francis. 'The Iraqi police had intercepted them and blown them up.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk57h7jrke	2024-12-17T08:03:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/ByecHz1rkg/ByecHz1rkg_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
US targets North Korean money laundering network with sanctions	The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two people and one entity based in the United Arab Emirates, accusing them of being involved in a network that launders millions of dollars generated by IT workers and cybercrimes to support the North Korean government. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that the two people hit with sanctions worked through a UAE-based front company to facilitate money laundering and cryptocurrency conversion services that funneled the illicit proceeds back to Pyongyang. Tuesday's action comes as Washington seeks to cut off funding for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, the Treasury said.

NATO takes over coordination of military aid to Kyiv from U.S., s...	NATO has taken over the coordination of Western military aid to Ukraine from the United States, as planned, a source said on Tuesday, in a move widely seen as aiming to safeguard the support mechanism against NATO sceptic Donald Trump. The step, coming after a delay of several months, gives NATO a more direct role in the war against Russia's invasion while stopping well short of committing its own forces. Diplomats, however, acknowledge that the handover to NATO may have a limited effect given that the U.S. under Trump could still deal a major setback to Ukraine by slashing its support as it is the alliance's dominant power and provides the majority of arms to Kyiv. Trump, who will take office in January, has said wants to end the war in Ukraine swiftly but not how he aims to do so. He has long criticized the scale of U.S. financial and military aid to Ukraine.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bygawqysyl	2024-12-17T07:08:24-08:00

Swiss parliament votes to ban Hezbollah	Switzerland's parliament on Tuesday voted to outlaw Hezbollah, in a rare move by the neutral country that has traditionally followed a policy of promoting international dialogue and mediation. Proponents of the ban, which was passed by the lower house after receiving upper house approval last week, said Hezbollah was a threat to international security and that Switzerland needed to prohibit it to take a stand against terrorism. The Swiss government opposed the ban. 'If Switzerland now moves to ban such organizations with special laws, we must ask ourselves where and how the boundaries are drawn,' Justice Minister Beat Jans said during the parliamentary debate. The ban against the Lebanese armed terror group passed the lower house with 126 votes in favor, 20 against and 41 abstentions. Last week, the Swiss parliament outlawed Hamas for the Palestinian terrorist group's Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjnxw7yhjg	2024-12-17T07:05:24-08:00

Report: Kidnap deal may be signed in coming days; Prime minister'...	Sources told Reuters that Netanyahu is on his way to Cairo, but his office denies it, says he visited the Syrian border today with the heads of the security establishment; US believes 'getting closer to a Gaza agreement; Hamas: A deal can be reached if Israel stops setting conditions Reuters reported Tuesday afternoon that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose testimony in the corruption trial against him was canceled for the day under 'exceptional circumstances,' is now making his way to Cairo, the capital of Egypt. However, a short time later, the prime minister's spokesman denied the report, saying: 'Contrary to the wave of rumors, Netanyahu is not in Cairo.' He also clarified that 'there is no news regarding the late Eli Cohen,' which stated that the remains of the famous spy for Israel had been located in Syria. In addition an Egyptian official also denied that Netanyahu was in Cairo. The sources who spoke to Reuters earlier claimed that Netanyahu arrived in the Egyptian capital amid the feverish negotiations for a hostage return and cease-fire deal which, they said, could be signed 'in the coming days.' The Government Press Office late Tuesday afternoon released an official statement reporting that Netanyahu held a briefing Tuesday on the Hermon Range on the Syrian border, together with Defense Minister Israel Katz, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Northern Command Commander Gen. Ori Gordin, and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. According to the statement: 'The Prime Minister reviewed the IDF deployment in the area and set guidelines for the future.' Following the Reuters report, an official statement also was issued by the terrorist organization Hamas, which stated that the discussions underway regarding a possible deal are 'serious and positive,' under the auspices of mediators Egypt and Qatar. 'A cease-fire agreement can be reached if the occupation (Israel) stops setting new conditions,' the Hamas statement said. At the same time, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in an interview with Fox News that 'we believe - and the Israelis have said this - that we're getting closer, and no doubt about it, we believe that, but we also are cautious in our optimism. He added that: 'We've been in this position before where we weren't able to get it over the finish line.' Kirby did not respond when asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was traveling to Cairo for talks. Israel's ambition is to reach an agreement this month, probably during Hanukkah, with an eye for completing the agreement at least before President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. Behind the scenes, Israel is working to increase the number of hostages to be released in a phased humanitarian release. In the past, the number of kidnapped women, children and adults has been small, and approximately the same, but Israel wants to increase the number to dozens. Negotiations on this are in full swing, and in return the mediators have given Israel lists of prisoners that Hamas is demanding be released. The reports and rumors that led to the denial by Netanyahu's spokesman In recent hours, rumors and reports have been circulating , and only after the report in Reuters, which is considered one of the world's leading and most reliable news agencies, did Netanyahu's spokesman choose to publish a denial that he was in Cairo. The Prime Minister's Office was out of contact for long hours, which contributed to fueling the rumors - which ranged from a secret visit by Netanyahu to Cairo to a Wing of Zion flight to Crete and then to Larnaca, which was actually a 'routine training flight,' but Netanyahu's office chose to officially ignore all of these. In parallel with these numerous reports, and Israel's denial that Netanyahu is in Cairo, there were also reports that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would also arrive in Cairo on Wednesday afternoon to participate in a summit of Arab states. Among other things, according to the office of the PA president, the Egyptians plan to discuss with him the issue of ending the war in Gaza and controlling the Rafah crossing. Hours earlier, Egypt reported that 'there are feverish Egyptian-Qatari attempts' with all sides to reach a cease-fire in Gaza. Talks for a deal have entered their final stages in recent days, and earlier Tuesday a Hamas source also told The Washington Post that the terrorist organization had given up its demand for a complete end to the war and a complete withdrawal of the IDF from the Gaza Strip. However, the source noted that, alongside other key concessions in the negotiations, the organization 'still insists that Palestinians be allowed to return to the northern Gaza Strip.' Either way, Hamas has not yet given a green light to the deal - and it currently has no agreement to reach one. Jerusalem has made it clear that it is not final or closed, but there is progress and Israel sees a desire to move forward. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the Washington Post, while its public statements remain defiant, Hamas has quietly begun to soften its tough demands in negotiations — revealing 'a new willingness to compromise after months of deadlocked talks.' According to the report, on Friday the terror organization gave Israel, through Egyptian mediators, the names of live hostages as a goodwill gesture intended to pave the way for a cease-fire. However, the families of the kidnapped have now received an official notification that 'the reports of receiving lists are incorrect. We recommend that you stay updated on the announcements of the IDF Spokesperson and official sources. If there is information related to your loved one, official sources will work to update you as soon as possible.' The team in Doha - and Katz's statement On Monday Defense Minister Israel Katz said that the deal is 'closer than ever ,' and that the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors - which were previously one of the main obstacles in the negotiations - 'will not be a problem.' According to reports, Israel's main focus in the negotiations now is to try to increase the number of hostages who will be released in the deal, which will not be comprehensive despite the families' protests against a 'partial deal.' An Israeli technical team, consisting of Mossad, Shin Bet and Military Intelligence personnel, has been in Doha since Monday night to prepare the infrastructure so that, if the talks mature into a deal, everything will be ready on the ground, and the time for its implementation will be shortened. On Monday, a senior political source claimed that the main dispute was and remains over the number of hostages to be released and said that as of Monday evening, Hamas is willing to release 'a few hostages' - and Israel is demanding double that. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byg04mjrjl	2024-12-17T06:45:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/BJPNZehlye/BJPNZehlye_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

Security forces arrest Jerusalem man for spying for Iran	Shin Bet and police say they arrested a 23-year-old man who carried out intelligence missions for Iranian operatives and planned to carry out bombing attack Ardler (Israel) Amoyal, a 23-year-old from Jerusalem, was arrested last month on suspicion of collaborating with Iranian intelligence agents and carrying out security-related missions in Israel under their direction in exchange for monetary compensation, security forces reported on Tuesday. An investigation by the Shin Bet and Israel Police revealed that Amoyal had been in contact with Iranian intelligence operatives via social media since October. The investigation found that he initially communicated online with a profile named 'Ariana,' and after an initial acquaintance, was connected to an operative called 'John,' who handled him. The investigation further revealed that despite understanding that 'John' was an Iranian operative early on, Amoyal agreed to carry out intelligence-gathering missions under his guidance. These included photographing locations and spray-painting graffiti. Amoyal took pictures of signs reading 'Making Peace' in various areas of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, spray-painted the name 'Sinwar' in Tel Aviv and photographed streets and houses in Netanya and Jerusalem, sending all this material to his handler. Amoyal also purchased a GoPro camera and memory card to document his missions, created a video of a car being set on fire, searched social media for a handgun, silencer and materials to manufacture an explosive device and watched videos on bomb-making. According to the Shin Bet and police statement, his activities were intended to advance violent operations, including planning an attack in Israel. Amoyal was also instructed to recruit other agents, including individuals with criminal backgrounds. The investigation also revealed that Amoyal proposed to burn a police vehicle and disrupt power to the Jerusalem light rail to his Iranian handler. To this end, he filmed various points near the light rail system, attempting to locate the power supply and sent the footage to his handler. Amoyal received payment for his activities from his Iranian handler via cryptocurrency transactions. He is expected to be indicted at the Jerusalem District Court in the coming days and was remanded to custody until Friday. 'This investigation once again exposes the efforts of Iranian intelligence to recruit Israeli citizens for espionage and terrorist activities in Israel, as well as the willingness of some Israeli citizens to carry out these missions under Iranian direction, fully aware of the operatives' identities, all for financial gain,' A Shin Bet official said. 'The Israel Police and the Shin Bet continue to focus their efforts on thwarting any action that could harm the state's security and its citizens,' the Israel Police said in a statement. 'Spying for an enemy state during wartime or otherwise is a serious and dangerous act that constitutes betrayal.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Shin Bet and police reiterated in a joint statement, 'Israel's security agencies, including the Shin Bet and the police, warn Israeli citizens and residents against engaging with foreign operatives or carrying out tasks on their behalf.

The public is urged to report any suspicious contact from unidentified sources, especially those made via social media or job-seeking websites, to the Shin Bet or the Israel Police.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by0068kybkl	2024-12-17T03:57:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/21/rkvv8onTC/rkvv8onTC_0_48_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Two soldiers fall in building collapse near Gaza's Philadelphi Co...	Major (Res.) Maksim Rozenwald, a 35-year-old officer from Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, a decorated IDF commander and family man, brings the war’s toll to 818 fallen soldiers, as military operations intensify in Gaza IDF Major (Res.) Moshiko (Maksim) Rozenwald, a 35-year-old from Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, was killed in Rafah when a building collapsed. Another soldier was also killed in the same incident in the area of the Philadelphi Corridor. IDF said that the family of the other soldier has been notified, but his name has not yet been cleared for publication and will be released later. Major Rozenwald served as a company commander in the 7107th Engineering Battalion, which operates under the Nahal Brigade. He was promoted to the rank of major in April 2023 during a division excellence ceremony held in honor of Israel's 75th Independence Day. He will be laid to rest at 3:30 p.m. in the military section of the Modi'in cemetery. Haim Bibas, the mayor of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, shared his condolences: 'He was a graduate of the city's Ironi Alef high school, a fighter, a commander, and a family man who recently moved with his wife and young son to the city of Yavne. On behalf of myself and the residents of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, I send my heartfelt condolences to the Rozenwald family, to his parents Elizabeth and Aryeh, and to his siblings Alex and Tali, who are residents of the city.' On his Facebook account, Rozenwald frequently shared posts about the war and the hostages. In his last post, on November 12, he shared a screenshot of a conversation with a soldier from his reserve battalion. The soldier wrote: 'I received 1,000 shekels ($280) in cash from a kind citizen at a gas station on Route 6 for the benefit of the company.' Rozenwald wrote about it: 'Today is a battle day—where all the ends will be silent, and only the beautiful people of Israel will remain! Don’t despair—Am Yisrael Chai!' About a year ago, Rozenwald was interviewed by Israel's public broadcaster Kan after returning home for a brief break. He said, among other things: 'It’s a joy to come home, to my wife and my dog. My wife is also pregnant, and first of all, she is the real hero. She coped and gave me the peace of mind to focus and deal with everything we faced. Of course, I missed my parents, my friends, and my siblings.' He added at the time: 'We’ve spent many Shabbats in various locations in the Gaza Strip, but we understand the importance of what we’re doing. Our battalion is fighting in the northern part of the Strip. We go into houses, and it’s simply unbelievable. In every house, there are weapons and explosives—mortar shells next to a baby’s bed or explosives under the bed. There are also unfortunate people in the Strip, I’m certain of that, but ultimately, when it’s everywhere, there’s simply no choice. It’s painful to hear accusations against the fighters.' 'I share the grief of bereaved families and hope that all the hostages will return home as soon as possible, down to the very last one,' he said. 'We’ve been through tough times as a country and as a people, and I think we’ve been forcibly reminded that we have no other homeland. Let’s preserve the unifying discourse.' Maccabi Haifa Football Club paid tribute to the officer: 'Maksim has been a season ticket holder in the northern lower stand since the 2014/15 season. He managed to attend the away game against Maccabi Petah Tikva on November 30, and this year, he became a father to a son named Orel—whom he registered on Maccabi Haifa’s website when he was just three months old. We will attend the funeral, embrace the family, and honor his memory.' 818 fallen soldiers in the war This is the first announcement of the deaths of IDF soldiers in the Gaza Strip battlefield since the report of the deaths of Staff Sergeant Ido Zano, Sergeant Omri Cohen, and Staff Sergeant Barak Daniel Halperin, who were killed in an anti-tank missile attack in Jabaliya in northern Gaza on December 9. The last fatality in Rafah before this incident was Captain Avraham Ben Pinchas, who was killed in an anti-tank attack on December 7. Since the outbreak of the war on October 7 last year, 818 soldiers have been killed, including 386 who have died since the ground maneuver in the Gaza Strip began approximately three weeks later. Additionally, 5,490 soldiers have been injured since the beginning of the war: 801 of them were seriously injured, 1,369 sustained moderate injuries, and 3,320 were lightly injured. Of these, 10 soldiers remain hospitalized in serious condition, 202 in moderate condition, and nine in light condition.

2015 nuclear deal no longer relevant, Iran close to bomb, IAEA ch...	Rafael Grossi tells Italian ANSA news agency that Iran is moving quickly to obtaining a nuclear device, is enriching uranium to near military grade; says a new deal must be reached taking current Iranian reality into consideration International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi said the nuclear deal with Iran was no longer relevant and that Iran was enriching uranium to a military grade and was rapidly nearing the position of a nuclear state. Grossi spoke during a visit to the Italian Foreign Ministry on Monday. 'The philosophy of the original Iran deal can be used as a basis but the deal itself, is no longer needed,' Grossi said in an interview with the ANSA news agency. He said Iran currently has many more capabilities and is enriching Uranium to a level of 60% and to nearly 90%, which is military grade. He said Iran was significantly developing its nuclear capabilities. The new regime under President Masoud Pezeshkian was creating an opportunity for new negotiations but they would have to be on a different basis than the talks that led to the original JCPOA signed in 2015. The IAEA must play a central role he said and there must be serious cooperation between the UN agency and the world powers. > 'We must reexamine the agreement and find a new technical version of political principles. This is a complex process in which European nations, the United States, China and Russia would have to sit down with the IAEA and come up with a system that is more compatible with the new Iranian reality,' Grossi said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry0onyksje	2024-12-17T03:33:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/10/rkE1LDrk1e/rkE1LDrk1e_0_0_1039_630_0_small.jpg

Turkey amasses force on Syrian border for 'immanent' assault on K...	American officials say Ankara is set to launch offensive against US-backed Kurdish territories in country in a bid to shape Syria's future; Trump calls Erdogan a 'smart guy' Senior U.S. officials told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that Turkey and allied militias are amassing forces along the Syrian border, raising concerns that Ankara was planning a large-scale invasion of the country’s Kurdish-held territory backed by the United States. The forces include militias and Turkish commanders in civilian clothing, along with significant artillery units concentrated near Kobani, a key Kurdish city in Syria close to the Turkish border. According to the officials — one of whom noted that an 'immanent' Turkish assault could take place — within hours or days, the troop buildup began after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in early December. The current buildup resembles Turkey's preparations for its 2019 incursion into northeastern Syria. ' We are focused on it and pressing for restraint,' one U.S. official said. In a press conference held on Monday, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump addressed the turmoil in Syria, saying that the rebels who overthrew Assad's regime were 'controlled' by Turkey. Trump, who had previously declared that the U.S. should avoid involvement in Syria, signaled his intent to maintain minimal engagement in the newly established rebel-led country. He also praised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who reportedly supported the rebels’ surprise offensive and is now working to strengthen Turkey’s influence in the new Damascus regime. 'Nobody knows who the other side is, but I do!,' Trump said, likely referring to the widespread uncertainty about the true nature of the jihadist Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham rebels, whose leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), is currently attempting to present a more moderate image to the West.

Israel supporter projected to be next German chancellor	Following the dramatic 'no confidence' vote that left Olaf Scholz battered, Germany to hold snap elections in February; CDU head Friedrich Merz, once ousted from politics by Angela Merkel may well become the new chancellor Years after clashing with Angela Merkel and being politically sidelined by her during her tenure as leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, now 69, is positioning himself for a dramatic political resurgence. As leader of Germany’s center-right party, Merz is poised to lead the CDU back to power, three years after its electoral defeat following Merkel’s retirement. The no-confidence vote on Monday against Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic government, set the stage for snap elections on February 23, with the conservatives under Merz enjoying a commanding lead in the polls. Merz represents a stark departure from Merkel’s leadership style and persona. Unlike Merkel, who hails from East Germany, Merz comes from the western part of the country, where he still resides. He is married to his childhood sweetheart Charlotte, a judge, and is a father of three and a grandfather. A devout Catholic, Merz does not shy away from showcasing his wealth, frequently traveling aboard one of his two private jets—an image in sharp contrast to Merkel’s understated lifestyle. The history between Merkel and Merz is anything but amicable. Once regarded as Merkel’s most formidable political rival within the CDU, Merz was elected to parliament in 1994 and gained prominence as an expert in economics and law. However, Merkel, who reportedly referred to him as an 'enemy,' successfully ousted him from the party leadership in 2002, clearing her own path to becoming chancellor three years later. Marginalized within the party, Merz eventually withdrew from politics in 2009 and built a fortune as an investment banker. His political comeback coincided with Merkel’s retirement in 2021, and he reclaimed the CDU leadership in 2022. Despite his political resurgence, Merz remains a polarizing figure. He has never been a charismatic leader who inspires mass appeal, and he describes himself as 'socially conservative and economically liberal.' His current political momentum owes less to his own abilities and more to widespread dissatisfaction with what many perceive as the Scholz government’s mismanagement. As Merz and his party prepare for the upcoming elections, they will emphasize qualities that resonate with German voters: discipline, precision, hard work, and a sense of purpose. However, his opponents are expected to highlight his controversial outbursts, past remarks about immigrants, and his tax policies—traits and positions that have led some to draw comparisons between Merz and Donald Trump, whose populist style is deeply unpopular in Germany. A member of the CDU’s conservative wing, Merz has previously championed the idea of a 'leading culture,' advocating for Muslim immigrants to adopt German traditions and values. In addition to grappling with Germany’s immigration challenges and an emerging economic crisis—affecting even corporate giants like Volkswagen—Merz will face scrutiny over his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump's election win could force Germany and other European nations to ramp up economic support for NATO. Merz has pledged to increase Germany’s support for Ukraine, but such a commitment would require Germany to borrow funds, forcing him to abandon the CDU’s traditional fiscal conservatism and its focus on reducing budget deficits. Merz is a staunch supporter of the European Union and its collaborative framework. However, to counter the growing appeal of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)—which currently polls at 18%, making it the second-largest party after the CDU’s 32%—Merz has steered the CDU away from Merkel’s 'open-door' refugee policy. In doing so, he has adopted or echoed aspects of the AfD’s platform on immigration, including stricter border controls and more rigorous vetting procedures. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Despite calls from some within his party to consider a coalition with the AfD, Merz has categorically ruled out such an alliance. He has drawn a sharp distinction between the two parties, stating, 'The difference between us is the difference between nationalists who love their country and hate everyone else, and patriots who love their country but respect others.' Where does he stand on Israel? Since October 7, Merz, like nearly all CDU members, has expressed unwavering support for Israel and its right to self-defense. He has pledged to take a tougher stance against violent and antisemitic demonstrations in Berlin, promising stricter enforcement and harsher penalties for antisemitic incidents. Marking the one-year anniversary of the October 7 massacre last month, Merz delivered a scathing speech in parliament, criticizing the Scholz government for what he called its hypocrisy. He accused the government of paying lip service to Germany’s solidarity with Israel while failing to supply weapons and spare parts without imposing conditions to ensure they are not used for alleged war crimes. Merz has previously stated that 'Germany’s relationship with Israel is unique—without any ifs or buts.' While he supports a two-state solution, he insists it must be contingent on Palestinian recognition of Israel’s right to exist. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hjz9inr4yg	2024-12-17T01:48:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/rkGuCMRNkx/rkGuCMRNkx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IDF troops operate in Damascus military site, report	Military chopper reported to land in the Syrian capital on Monday bringing troops who operate in a military facility for 20 minutes before leaving; Israel strikes suburbs of the capital at the same time An Israeli helicopter landed Monday overnight near one of the military sites in the Damascus area, sources told the Russian news agency Sputnik on Tuesday. 'Soldiers entered the site and left after about 20 minutes, heading toward southern Syria,' the report claimed. Reports of Israeli strikes in the Sitt Zaynab area on the outskirts of Damascus arrived shortly after. Hezbollah-affiliated outlet Al-Mayadeen reported on Tuesday on additional IDF advances in the buffer zone area in Syria. According to the report, Israeli forces 'entered the front neighborhoods of the town of Hader.' Israeli officers have already met with local village leaders and elders in the area, following a video showing Druze residents in Hader requesting that Israel annex the area. Tribal sources in Syria told Lebanon's Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar that some view a temporary Israeli presence in Druze villages as a preferable alternative to a takeover by rebel group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham in those areas until minority protection mechanisms in the country are established.

Israel to maintain freedom to operate in Gaza, Katz says	Defense Minister says Israel will not allow Hamas to reorganize and rebuild and to pose a threat to communities; IDF prepares to cut of northern areas and prevent return of displaced civilians Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Monday that Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom to operate in the Strip, after defeating Hamas in the enclave. 'We will not allow any terrorists to organize and attack Israeli communities and citizens from Gaza,' Katz said. 'We will not allow the return to the reality of before the Oct. 7 massacre.' One of the central questions still undetermined for the day after the war remains whether the IDF would allow the tens of thousands of displaced Gazans to return to the area of Jebaliy which has been mostly destroyed in the fighting, or whether they would be prevented from returning, a millions of displaced Gazans who have moved south, have been. The military said that the northern third of the Strip would be cut off and remain mainly unpopulated, according to the decision of the government. Ynet has learned that the IDF's Southern Command intends to leave infrastructure established in recent months, in Gaza that would spread from the border with Israel all the way to the Mediterranean cost. The purpose if to prevent the return of civilians to areas that are close to the Israeli border communities. If that scenario plays out, it would mean that Israel had adopted the so called 'Generals' Plan' calling for the area or northern Gaza to remain unpopulated and under IDF security control to prevent the ability of Hamas to rehabilitate itself as a ruling force. According to the authors of the plan, Hamas can only enforce its rule if it can control the civilian population, primarily by the provision of humanitarian aid. If there is no alternative to Hamas as a governing body, it will once again survive. Israel has thus far refused to allow the Palestinian Authority to take over civilian governance of t he Strip, leaving the IDF military control the only option to ensure security along the border. The military estimates there are still some 100 Hamas terrorists in the Jabaliya and surrounding areas of northern Gaza. Israel also believes there will be a few civilians who will remain there, mostly under the protection of humanitarian zones. 'After we bomb and area, our troops enter to find a building that was unharmed with some 20 women and children inside,' an IDF commander said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvmbaaeyl	2024-12-17T00:41:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/ByHZVy0Qkx/ByHZVy0Qkx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Syrian rebel leader says will uphold 1974 cease-fire agreement wi...	Ahmad al-Sharaa addresses Israel for the 1st time, criticized IDF advance into Syrian territory but says agreement with Israel following the Yom Kippur war to hold Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), addressed Israel for the first time on Saturday and said that Syria will continue to adhere to the disengagement agreement signed in 1974 following the Yom Kippur War. He called on the international community to ensure that Israel remained committed to the agreement. In a conversation he held on Monday with a small group of journalists, al-Sharaa sharply criticized Israel's 'military advances' into Syrian territory beyond the Golan Heights and into the buffer zone declared by the UN under the agreement, which is considered disputed according to international consensus. Israel described its advances into Syrian territory as defensive measures aimed at preventing armed groups from seizing positions near the border and ensuring the security of communities in the Golan Heights. Al-Sharaa, who is seeking to rebrand himself from a terrorist to a political leader, responded to the claim, arguing that Israel no longer needs to maintain these positions as the threat from Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militias has been removed with the fall of Bashar Assad's regime. 'Syria's priority now should be building a state and creating public institutions that serve all Syrians,' he said and declared he would run for president if he gains sufficient support.

The Syrian regime is consolidating control, but Israel must act fast to prevent jihadi groups from acquiring advanced weapons, Kuperwasser said Israel needs to carefully monitor developments in Syria as the new regime consolidates power, according to Brig.-Gen. (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser. Speaking to ILTV News, Kuperwasser emphasized the importance of remembering the origins of many Syrian rebel leaders. 'No matter what the rebels and their leaders say now, many were members of ISIS and Al-Qaeda,' he said. He added that foreign forces backing these rebels include the Muslim Brotherhood, primarily through Turkey and Qatar. 'We have little trust in the Muslim Brotherhood,' Kuperwasser explained. 'Not only we, but all the relatively pragmatic and moderate elements in the Arab world have a similar attitude toward the Muslim Brotherhood.' Despite these concerns, Kuperwasser clarified that Israel is not under immediate threat. The Syrian regime is currently focused on consolidating control over the country and stabilizing its fractured government. 'They are not looking for confrontation with Israel at this point,' he said. 'But we know who they are. We know that many of them are jihadi organizations, and we don’t want to see them holding very advanced weaponry that Assad’s army used to have.' Kuperwasser stressed the need for swift action to prevent such groups from gaining access to these weapons. 'We have to take very fast the necessary activities to make sure that they don't have all these weapons in their possession.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r111l6ccn1e	2024-12-16T21:48:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/ryNfYE241g/ryNfYE241g_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Smotrich pushes ahead with plans for West Bank annexation	Far-right minister says is working to disrupt plans by the Palestinian Authority to create continuity of Palestinian population in an area that would cut Gush Etzion off from Jerusalem and bring about a Palestinian State Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was racing ahead with his plans to annex the West Bank and establish new settlements that would ensure a continuation of Jewish controlled territory. The civil administration has doubled its enforcement of violations by Palestinian of building permits, demolishing illegally built structures. According to figures obtained by Ynet, since January 2024, 642 cases of illegal building in Palestinian areas were prosecuted. In some cases, multiple structures were demolished. In 2023, the civil administration enforced 306 cases only. An official said that 1,000 illegally built structure of Palestinians were demolished this year. The accelerated efforts could be in order to create facts on the ground before U.S. president-elect Donald Trump takes office. In November, Smotrich, who also holds a ministerial position in the Defense Ministry, charged with the administration of the West Bank, emphasized the plan to create Jewish settlement continuity connecting Gush Etzion, in the southern part of the West Bank, to Jerusalem. 'Trump's victory also brings with it an important opportunity for the State of Israel. We were a step away from applying sovereignty to the settlements in Judea and Samaria, and now is the time to do it,' he said. > The head of the far-right Religious Zionism Party said his efforts were to prevent plans by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to cut Gush Etzion off from the capital and create a continuity of Palestinian residents.

Christian leader: October 7 war reveals who truly stands with Isr...	Those who love Israel are actually stepping up to the plate and making a difference,' said Steve Wearp, the founder of Blessed Buy Israel The October 7 massacre and subsequent multifront war between Israel and radical Islamist groups have exposed who truly stands with Israel and who does not, according to Christian evangelical leader Steve Wearp, founder of Blessed Buy Israel. 'This war is making people take a stand on one side or the other, and it seems to be very clarifying,' Wearp said. 'What do people really believe? Where is their heart at? 'Those who love Israel are actually stepping up to the plate and making a difference,' he continued. 'Many others are going to the radical left and calling for destruction. I think this is a matter of education and definitely a spiritual issue, where people’s hearts have been turned. They've been lied to and captured by a false philosophy that allows them to support Hamas. 'How can you support Hamas? How can you support what they’ve done? How can you support Hezbollah, or Assad, or the Iranian regime? How can you stand there silently by?' Wearp added that he reassures his Jewish friends: 'You will never, ever, ever be alone again.' Wearp founded Blessed Buy Israel to support life in the Biblical Heartland by selling products handcrafted by residents of Judea and Samaria. The idea for the company emerged in 2015 when the Obama administration supported the European Union’s decision to label Jewish-made products from the area. 'It was an attempt to support BDS,' Wearp recalled. 'My family and I sat down and decided we would not be like our forefathers. We were going to make a difference.' The family’s commitment deepened after the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which declared any Jewish presence in the West Bank illegal under international law. Wearp and his family went to Judea and Samaria, meeting small business owners and families to find ways to get their products to market and counter international pressure. Since then, Wearp says the residents of Judea and Samaria have become some of his closest friends. 'It totally changes your heart and your attitude,' Wearp said. 'These are the people we care the most about. These are the people we walk with continually, on a daily basis.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1yuuq0nyg	2024-12-16T21:20:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/BkzMuc0Eke/BkzMuc0Eke_0_25_199_113_0_small.jpg

Candace Owens named ‘Antisemite of the Year’ for 2024	Owens has claimed that Israel forces Muslims into segregated quarters and insinuated Hollywood is run by sinister Jewish gangs Disgraced conservative commentator Candace Owens has been named the 2024 'Antisemite of the Year,' an ignominious title awarded by StopAntisemitism, a leading non-partisan U.S.-based organization dedicated to combating antisemitism. In its announcement, StopAntisemitism stated: 'From defending Hitler’s actions in Germany and mocking Jewish fears over Kanye West’s antisemitic tweets, to claiming Israel forces Muslims into segregated quarters and insinuating Hollywood is run by sinister Jewish gangs, Owens has been rightfully crowned 2024's Antisemite of the Year.' Owens’ rhetoric escalated further following the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, as she amplified conspiracy theories targeting Jews and the Jewish state. This led to her ousting from The Daily Wire and a suspension from YouTube. Owens’ actions have since been widely condemned, including by evangelical leaders and even her own father-in-law. Joining Owens in the so-called 'Top Three' are environmental activist Greta Thunberg, who has drawn criticism for her pro-Hamas stances, and popular Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, accused of echoing Hamas propaganda.

Ice cold: Winter war preparations underway as IDF deploys in Syri...	IDF gearing up for extreme winter operations in Syria and Lebanon, equipping troops with advanced cold-weather gear, insulated shelters and upgraded logistics; lessons from past campaigns and foreign militaries aim to ensure readiness in harsh enemy terrain IDF is gearing up for Operation General Winter across all operational zones, with a strong emphasis on the challenges posed by snowfall in the northernmost regions—territories where IDF has not operated for 50 years. Drawing lessons from both its historical operations and the expertise of foreign militaries accustomed to winter warfare, IDF is adopting new strategies to sustain operational readiness in extreme conditions. Roughly a week after Israeli forces captured the Syrian Hermon and advanced 6–7.5 miles beyond the Golan Heights border, IDF’s Technology and Logistics Directorate (Atal) launched an urgent and large-scale procurement initiative. This operation provides thousands of specialized winter items and tools, informed by operational practices of European and American militaries experienced in combat in sub-zero environments. Through expedited coordination with the Ministry of Defense Procurement Directorate, Atal has already secured thousands of pairs of Canadian-made military-grade winter boots designed for operational use in snow and sub-zero temperatures. Snow is forecasted in the coming weeks for the Golan Heights, the Syrian end of Mt. Hermon, and multiple locations in southern Lebanon, where Israeli forces remain deployed—particularly along the eastern sector parallel to the Ramim Ridge. In the last few months, IDF has procured over 2,000 mobile living containers, including many specifically for northern deployment. These insulated units will house soldiers stationed beyond the border in both southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan Heights. In southern Lebanon, where forces are expected to remain for at least the next month (coinciding with the end of a 60-day ceasefire stabilization period), Golani infantry troops and reservists have already been equipped with portable structures, insulated shower and restroom units, heating systems, and cooking facilities to ensure access to hot meals. Preparing for the harsh winter in the Syrian Hermon A similar logistical infrastructure is being established in the Syrian Hermon, now held by Israel. Rising to an elevation of 9,186 feet, this mountainous region—covering hundreds of acres—was recently abandoned by Assad regime forces. IDF is now setting up its first operational outposts in the area. Troops stationed there, including paratroopers, commando brigades, and armored units operating on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, are being equipped with specialized gear typically reserved for the Alpine Unit. This includes three sets of thermal uniforms, insulated winter sandals, ski masks for facial protection, thick socks, and insulated overalls for static missions. Heated shelters are also being deployed to treat soldiers suffering from hypothermia quickly and effectively. Additionally, 'anti-freeze' systems are being installed to prevent essential equipment and batteries from freezing in the frigid temperatures. Sustaining operations in extreme conditions To address potential disruptions caused by snowstorms or supply route blockages, IDF is pre-positioning tons of dry and canned food at remote outposts. These stockpiles will sustain troops for over a week without the need for active logistical supply lines. 'We have established protocols for extreme scenarios, which we’ve encountered during past winters at Hermon outposts,' explains an IDF source. 'But this situation is different—this time, we’re operating in enemy territory under the looming threat of a severe winter. We’ve even studied our own history from the early 1970s, when IDF troops were stationed in these areas. The goal is to ensure that soldiers remain comfortable, safe, and supplied with hot food, even in the harshest conditions. We are already delivering cooked meals to the most remote outposts in Syria and Lebanon.' Atal is also exploring innovative solutions proven effective by militaries operating in freezing climates, such as snow-melting devices that convert snow into usable water. 'We’re not investing in expensive equipment for just a few weeks or a month. Every decision is being managed wisely, with long-term planning in mind,' Atal officials explain. 'Some of the procurement has been expedited through rapid tenders and international orders, while other supplies have been drawn from emergency reserves.' Upgraded infrastructure and living conditions In the Syrian Golan Heights, soldiers have already received generators and portable, insulated living quarters that can be dismantled within 24 hours if a withdrawal is ordered. Initially, troops had to operate out of the damp but relatively spacious fortified rooms of the 'Pita' outposts—bunkers left behind by the Syrian army. However, for safety, electrical, and comfort considerations, IDF decided not to use these rooms for prolonged stays. Soldiers found remnants of the Syrian army’s presence in these spaces, including rusted mess tins with rotted food. This approach contrasts with operations in Gaza, where forces often take over residential buildings for extended use during combat, adapting them with additional equipment like air conditioners or heaters. Comprehensive winter preparations across combat zones According to THE IDF, Atal, in coordination with regional commands, has completed extensive winter preparations across all operational zones in recent weeks. More than 1,900 mobile buildings and living containers—equipped with air conditioning, electrical panels, and connections to fixed or portable energy infrastructure—have been deployed. Each housing complex includes showers and heating systems to provide optimal conditions for soldiers.

'In response to increased operational activity by the 210th Division, as part of a dedicated operation led by Northern Command logistics personnel, temporary specialized structures are being constructed to accommodate soldiers in complex climatic conditions,' the military added. 'To ensure the operability of equipment, the sector has been reinforced with unique maintenance tools, including recovery trucks, armored recovery vehicles, and specialized field repair tools tailored to operational challenges. Medical support has also been enhanced, with the deployment of dedicated medical containers designed to address weather-related health challenges.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkor6eanyx	2024-12-16T13:45:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/Hy8pbw264Jx/Hy8pbw264Jx_158_47_1550_873_0_small.jpg
Israel weighs response to Yemen as escalating Houthi attacks test...	Houthis continue attacks even as other fronts have quieted, warning, 'What’s coming will be worse'; millions of Israelis forced into shelters once again, while officials in Jerusalem vow, 'We will not show restraint' Most threats are intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory, but unusual activity from Yemen has drawn attention. On Monday afternoon, air raid sirens blared across central Israel from the Shfela region to the Sharon area, sending millions of Israelis into shelters after a missile launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted the country. The Iran-backed Houthis continue to issue threats via social media, and Israeli officials warn of a significant response: 'There will be no restraint.' Approximately four hours after the sirens, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, stating they had fired a 'Palestine-2 hypersonic ballistic missile at a military target near Jaffa.' Despite two Israeli strikes on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, the rebels vowed to continue supporting 'our brothers in Gaza' and even increase their attacks. Following Monday’s missile launch, Hezam al-Asad, a member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council in Yemen, posted in Hebrew on X (formerly Twitter): ''The Israeli enemy will pay the price for its continued brutal aggression and siege on our people in Gaza, as well as its attacks and invasions in Syria.' He followed up with two additional tweets in Arabic, writing, 'We renew our jihadist stance in support of our people in Gaza, relying on God and confident in our victory. Let the Zionist enemy and its supporters know that what is coming will be worse as long as the attacks and siege on our brothers continue.' As Houthi threats persist, Israel is treading cautiously on whether to act again in Yemen, grappling with a significant dilemma over how to respond. Sources familiar with the situation told Ynet in recent days that 'targeting the Houthis is more challenging,' but added that the rebels' increasingly aggressive actions could prompt a far more substantial Israeli response. The Houthis have continued their attacks on Israel even after the cease-fire in Lebanon came into effect and have escalated their missile launches in the two-and-a-half weeks since. The first post-cease-fire missile launch occurred earlier this month, triggering sirens in the Shfela region. The Houthis claimed responsibility for firing a 'Palestine-2' missile at a 'vital target' near Jaffa, Tel Aviv’s historically Arab quarter. Since the beginning of December, the Houthis have claimed responsibility for several additional operations involving drones targeting Israel. On December 3, they announced involvement in three operations allegedly conducted in coordination with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of pro-Iranian militias active since the war began. According to the Houthis, these operations occurred within 48 hours and included two drone attacks on northern Israel and another on a 'vital target' near Eilat. The Houthis declared all operations 'successful.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On December 8, a ballistic missile launched by the Houthis was intercepted outside Israeli territory. On the same day, the Houthis claimed responsibility for an operation involving drones targeting a 'vital target' in southern Israel, also in coordination with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. That day, the Iraqi militia issued a statement condemning 'Israeli aggression against Syria' and 'the occupation of new villages in Quneitra and Mount Hermon.' Last Thursday, sirens sounded in southern Israel, likely due to drones launched from Yemen. An interceptor was deployed near Eilat, and a chase ensued for a drone suspected of entering the Gaza border region. However, the IDF said it was investigating whether the Gaza-area alerts were triggered by a false identification. Last Monday, a drone from Yemen exploded in a penthouse apartment in Yavne. While no injuries were reported, the blast caused significant damage to the 16th-floor balcony, with parts of the drone scattered near the building. The drone approached from the sea, crossed near Sderot and then turned northward. It was detected near Ashdod, prompting electronic warfare measures. Detection lasted only a few minutes, and although a fighter jet was scrambled, the drone disappeared from radar, preventing interception. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the 'attack on a sensitive target' in Yavne and the next day took credit for 'attacks on military targets' in Jaffa and Ashkelon. In a speech during a weekly pro-Gaza demonstration in Sana’a, Yemen, last Friday, Saree claimed responsibility for additional attacks, highlighting the group's escalating launches at Israel since the start of the month. The Houthis have vowed to continue their strikes 'as long as the siege on Gaza persists,' insisting that attacks on their territory, including international coalition strikes led by the U.S. and UK, will not deter them. While some launches fail to reach Israel, the drone threat remains challenging. The drones often fly low and slowly, making them harder to detect—similar to those used by Hezbollah during months of fighting. Moreover, the lack of Israeli retaliation risks normalizing such attacks. Although Iran’s influence has waned following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria, the Houthis remain operational. Sources told Ynet recently that Israel is considering a significant response against the Houthis. 'There will be no restraint—they will get what they deserve. They will pay a heavy price,' warned the officials. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2z00qrvkx	2024-12-16T13:41:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/06/14/S1xqfXzcr0/S1xqfXzcr0_0_91_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Syrian U.S.-backed Kurdish Syrian forces (SDF) said U.S-brokered mediation efforts failed to reach a permanent cease-fire with Syria's Turkey-backed rebels in the northern cities of Manbij and Kobani, according to head of the SDF's media center Farhad Shami on Monday. Shami blamed the collapse of the mediation on 'Turkey's approach in dealing with the mediation efforts and its evasion to accept key points.' The Turks are not happy about the cease-fire deal and Turkey prefers to keep maximum pressure on SDF, a Syrian opposition source told Reuters.

Palestinian security forces gain ground in Jenin refugee camp ami...	PA forces, aiming to regain control of terror hotbed after nearly a decade, secure key sites, including Jenin Brigade’s main operations center, with heavy gunfire wounding several terrorists Palestinian security forces intensified operations in the Jenin refugee camp on Monday, seeking to regain control of key areas. According to Palestinian reports, heavy exchanges of gunfire over the past several hours have left seven terrorists injured. Security officials announced the capture of several strategic points within the camp, including the main operations center of the Jenin Brigade and a facility known as the 'Al-Hura Club,' a frequent gathering spot for armed terrorists. 'In the past 24 hours, security forces have arrested 12 terror operatives, neutralized a car bomb and dismantled 12 explosive devices,' the statement said. Officials claim nearly half the camp is now under operational control. Palestinian security forces report significant progress in Operation Homeland Defense, led by the elite Unit 101, aimed at regaining control of the Jenin refugee camp, which in recent years has become a hub for terrorist activity by groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The Palestinian Authority said that its security forces will 'press forward decisively until the operation’s objectives are achieved.' Intelligence Chief Majed Faraj has reportedly been stationed at the Jenin headquarters for the past eight days, closely monitoring developments. Members of the Jenin Brigade, affiliated with PIJ, have been given an ultimatum to surrender their weapons or face arrest and prosecution for weapons trafficking and collaboration with foreign entities like Iran and Hamas. Security forces have already detained several terrorists attempting to flee the camp for other areas. In Tulkarm’s Nur Shams camp, efforts to incite resistance against the security forces failed to gain traction. Akram Rajoub, who served as governor of Jenin until last year, expressed support for the operation. 'This is a group of young men—only God knows who armed them and gave them money. They want to dictate to the security forces how to confront Israel and in what way,' he said. While acknowledging the patriotism of some, he noted, 'Perhaps there are those who didn’t join the chaos created by these outlaws, but this is the reality in the camp right now.' He added that the Fatah movement supports the government’s efforts, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining citizens’ safety and preventing lawlessness from descending into chaos. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Palestinian Interior Minister Ziad Hab al-Reeh and Jenin Governor Kamal Abu al-Rub visited several government and official institutions in Jenin on Monday. The minister emphasized the importance of these institutions in maintaining order and law and instructed them to continue providing services to citizens and adhere to regular working hours, despite the current circumstances. The minister said that, under directives from Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, 'the security apparatus continues to impose order and the rule of law, put an end to security chaos, confront outlaws and restore safety.' He also acknowledged the symbolic and historical role of refugee camps in the Palestinian national struggle, highlighting the government’s prioritization of restoring and rehabilitating Jenin camp. On Monday, Abbas issued a stern warning to those refusing to participate in the effort, threatening 'immediate dismissal.' The ongoing operation in Jenin was launched against a backdrop of escalating tensions between PIJ terrorists and Palestinian security forces. The clashes intensified after terrorists seized two security vehicles and paraded them through the streets of the camp last week. Footage from the operation shows Palestinian security forces armed with sniper rifles, equipped with tactical helmets and driving armored jeeps—all reportedly approved by Israel. The immediate trigger for the crackdown was images of terrorists from Jenin driving in a procession with a stolen security jeep, draped in Hamas and PIJ flags. Since Thursday, Palestinian security forces have reinforced their presence, taking control of hospitals in Jenin and sealing entrances and exits to the refugee camp in preparation for their operation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkkhrma4jl	2024-12-16T13:00:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/ryouLCT4yl/ryouLCT4yl_0_47_1460_822_0_small.jpg
Senior official: Hostage deal possible before Trump takes office	Official says 'Most details agreed upon' but primary dispute 'centers on number of hostages to be released in first stage'; Israeli delegation departs for Qatar to advance talks A senior Israeli official said on Monday negotiations for a hostage deal with Hamas are ongoing, with hopes of reaching an agreement before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president on January 20. 'The goal is to finalize a deal by the end of the month,' the official told Ynet. 'Most details have been agreed upon, but the primary dispute centers on the number of hostages to be released in the first stage.' The official explained that Hamas has proposed releasing a smaller group of hostages, while Israel is pushing for nearly double that number. 'Right now, the focus of negotiations is on the number of hostages and their identities,' the source added. Meanwhile, an Israeli delegation departed for Qatar on Monday evening to advance talks. Meanwhile, Trump said on Monday he had a 'very good talk' with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the war in Gaza and reiterated his threat that 'all hell is going to break out' if Hamas does not release its hostages by Jan. 20, the day Trump takes office. Trump described it as a 'recap call' during a press conference at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. 'As you know, I gave a warning that if these hostages aren't back home by that date, all hell is going to break out,' he said. Hamas-led terrorists killed 1,200 people and abducted more than 250, including Israeli-American dual nationals, during their Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, according to Israeli tallies. More than 100 hostages have been freed through negotiations or Israeli military rescue operations. Of the 100 still held in Gaza, roughly half are believed to be alive. U.S. President Joe Biden recently dispatched more senior aides to the region to try and secure a long-sought cease-fire deal. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar and Defense Minister Israel Katz held private meetings with Adam Boehler, Trump's point man on hostage affairs. The meetings were attended by Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for prisoners and missing persons. The American envoy requested complete discretion during the discussions with the ministers. Earlier, Katz said that negotiations for a hostage deal with Hamas were at their peak and described the talks as 'closer than ever' to reaching an agreement. Speaking to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Katz noted that Hamas had shown flexibility on key points, including the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors, which he said would not be obstacles to finalizing the deal. 'In my view, we are closer than ever to securing an additional hostage-release deal,' Katz said. He added that the process would occur in gradual phases and expressed confidence that the agreement would receive Cabinet approval. 'It is best to speak as little as possible about it in public,' Katz cautioned. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem District Court announced Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would not be required to testify in his criminal trial as scheduled on Tuesday. The court provided no public explanation for the decision, stating only, 'After hearing both sides and considering special circumstances, we have decided not to hold a court session tomorrow.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier Monday, a senior Hamas official told Saudi Arabia’s Asharq News that the group believed a deal involving 'the exchange of prisoners and a cease-fire' was within reach, provided Netanyahu did not 'disrupt the agreement.' The official claimed that Hamas and other Palestinian factions had demonstrated significant flexibility, agreeing to a phased end to the fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli forces according to a set timetable. 'The Gaza factions insist on a final end to the war, a full withdrawal of IDF forces from the Strip, the return of displaced Gazans to their homes and a respectful exchange of prisoners,' the official said. He emphasized that international mediators had advised keeping the details of the talks confidential to prevent Netanyahu from using them as a pretext to derail negotiations. A source close to the discussions indicated that both the U.S. administration and President-elect Donald Trump were pressuring for a swift resolution, with hopes of reaching an agreement by the end of the year. 'The factions are ready; the main issue is the Israeli position,' the source said. Mohammad Nazzal, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, confirmed ongoing negotiations but warned it was too early to predict the outcome. He framed Hamas’ efforts as an attempt to overcome obstacles and end the fighting in Gaza. Nazzal mocked President-elect Trump’s reported threats to intensify pressure if hostages were not released by January 20, the day of his inauguration. 'Is there anything worse than the hell Gaza has experienced for over a year?' Nazzal said. He accused Israel of failing to secure significant results in prior hostage rescues, adding, 'They recovered only a few bodies after they killed them.' He insisted that both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration must recognize the demands of the Palestinian people and the 'brave resistance.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkfadxaeke	2024-12-16T10:25:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/Hy11Oh3AOXJg/Hy11Oh3AOXJg_0_182_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Concerns for Jordan’s future: Why it’s not another Syria	Liberal regime with legitimacy, space for opposition, mostly homogeneous society and strong Western ties: Despite concerns for kingdom's future, it’s far more stable than Assad’s Syria; 'It’s hard to act against Jordan,' expert says; here’s why a rebellion is unlikely In recent days, voices expressing concern over Jordan's future have grown louder following the overthrow of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad by rebel forces. One fear is the potential rise of Islamist forces within Jordan, while another relates to Iran’s attempts to establish footholds in the Middle East, particularly after losing Syria. However, in practice, Jordan and Syria differ in many ways, which serve to stabilize the Hashemite Kingdom compared to its northern neighbor. Unlike Syria, Jordan did not witness extraordinary or violent demonstrations during the Arab Spring protests. During those events, only one person was killed in Jordan, in stark contrast to Syria, where Assad and his forces slaughtered approximately half a million people during the civil war that began in 2011. According to Prof. Ronen Yitzhak, head of the Middle Eastern Studies Division at the Western Galilee Academic College, who is also a researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Dayan Center specializing in Jordan, the events that unfolded in Syria are unlikely to occur in its eastern neighbor. Liberal, relatively The Jordanian regime is notably different from the Syrian regime. It is more liberal and enjoys legitimacy within the country. Secret prison cells, like those in Saydnaya Prison near Damascus, where prisoners — men, women and children — are held for years in inhumane conditions, are not a feature of the Hashemite Kingdom. According to Professor Ronen Yitzhak, 'The regime in Jordan is built on an inclusive policy toward the opposition.' He cites the parliamentary elections held in September, in which the Muslim Brotherhood won seats, as evidence of this inclusivity. 'Moreover, Jordan does not execute opposition activists. It is true that Jordan is not a democratic or fully liberal country, but compared to other Arab states, it is much more liberal. It is among the most liberal countries in the Arab world,' Yitzhak explained. One testament to Jordan’s liberalism is that it was the first Arab country to abolish the death penalty. While capital punishment was reinstated in 2014, largely in response to the rise of ISIS, the new law introduced significant restrictions, applying mainly to those convicted of terrorism. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In recent years, executions have ceased entirely in Jordan, in contrast to Iraq and Egypt. 'The opposition operates with greater ease in Jordan,' Yitzhak added. The Palestinians stand with the king While the prevailing assumption is that Jordan, home to an estimated two million Palestinians, is deeply divided, this is not the case. Jordanian society is relatively homogeneous and much stronger compared to Syria’s, which is composed of various ethnic groups and minorities. 'This makes it harder for fringe groups and rebels to operate within Jordan,' said Prof. Yitzhak. Although Islamist groups are active in Jordan, the Palestinian population in the country is largely loyal to the Hashemite monarchy and identifies as Jordanian. Those who participated in pro-Gaza and pro-Hamas demonstrations during the war — which filled the streets of Amman and featured anti-Israel slogans — were not necessarily Palestinians. Many were Jordanians, including members of the Bedouin Al-Huwaitat tribe. 'In previous episodes involving al-Qaeda and ISIS, there was Jordanian recruitment to these terror organizations. That’s not happening now,' Prof. Yitzhak explained. 'Many former members of ISIS and al-Qaeda were Jordanian Salafists, but this time, there’s no such trend. We don’t see Jordanians joining Syrian rebels. Aside from expressions of support — even King Abdullah has done that — there’s nothing unusual. It’s different from previous instances.' The CIA’s closest partner Another key advantage for Jordan is its close ties with the West. The United States views Jordan as a key ally, with President Joe Biden maintaining frequent contact with King Abdullah. 'It's hard to act against Jordan. The country has intelligence, operational, security and strategic connections with Western nations,' explained Prof. Yitzhak. 'Jordan’s intelligence services are considered among the best — if not the best — in the Arab world. Jordanian intelligence is reliable and is the CIA’s most trusted partner.' The Americans not only maintain close relations with Jordan but also have a physical presence on its soil, as does the United Kingdom. Britain, which controlled the territory until granting the Hashemite monarchy independence in 1921, established its ties with the royal family during World War I. These ties culminated in the Hashemite-led revolt against the Ottoman Empire in exchange for the promise of an independent state. The U.S. has unrestricted access to 12 major military bases in Jordan. According to Prof. Yitzhak, 'There is also a German presence in Jordan and even joint command structures that include representatives from various countries.' Despite growing concerns about regional stability, Prof. Yitzhak believes these robust international ties and military partnerships will ensure that the Jordanian regime remains secure. 'Despise Iran more than Israel' Iran has long been trying to infiltrate Jordan and extend its influence. According to past reports, Iranian operatives have smuggled weapons through Jordan into the West Bank. However, Prof. Yitzhak says Iran has struggled to breach Jordan's defenses. 'Iranian propaganda has difficulty reaching the Jordanian public,' Yitzhak explained. 'The Jordanian intelligence services and regime are adept at identifying those involved in such activities and monitoring Shia elements, making it challenging for Iran to operate in the country.' A survey by the Princeton-based Arab Barometer research network revealed that while Jordanian public opinion harbors strong resentment toward Israel, it dislikes Iran even more. 'The Jordanians view Iran as a destabilizing force in the region, one that negatively impacts their own country,' Yitzhak noted. 'The aversion to Iran is even greater because of sectarian factors. Jordanians dislike Shiites and refuse to give them a foothold,' he added. 'Unlike other countries in the region where regimes allow Iran some influence, Jordan does not permit this, making it even harder for Iran to establish operations there.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjftmjceyg	2024-12-16T08:53:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/SJrl5p6Vke/SJrl5p6Vke_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

In first statement after ouster, Bashar Assad says 'not flee'	Ousted Syrian dictator says 'did not abandon Syria' but was forced to evacuate Russian air base in Latakia, where he was monitoring the fighting Syria's ousted president, Bashar Assad, issued his first official statement on Monday since fleeing his country early last week, following the arrival of rebel forces in Damascus and the collapse of his regime. In the statement, Assad insisted he had not fled at all, claiming he traveled to a Russian air base in the coastal province of Latakia to 'monitor the fighting from there.' He said he only left for Russia because the Khmeimim Air Base had come under attack by drones and Moscow ordered an evacuation. Assad’s message, dated December 16, was published in both English and Arabic on his office's official Telegram channel. 'As terrorism spread across Syria and ultimately reached Damascus on the evening of Saturday 7 December 2024, questions arose about the president's fate and whereabouts. This occurred amidst a flood of misinformation and narratives far removed from the truth, aimed at recasting international terrorism as a liberation revolution for Syria,' the statement reads. > 'As terrorist forces infiltrated Damascus, I moved to Latakia in coordination with our Russian allies to oversee combat operations,' Assad said. 'Upon arrival at the Khmeimim air base that morning, it became clear that our forces had completely withdrawn from all battle lines and that the last army positions had fallen,' the statement continued. 'As the field situation in the area continued to deteriorate, the Russian military base itself came under intensified attack by drone strikes. With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base's command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia. This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all state institutions,' Assad said. 'At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual or party. The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught.' He added that he had 'never sought positions for personal gain' and viewed himself as 'a custodian of a national project, supported by the faith of the Syrian people.' Assad also declared: 'Just as I never abandoned the resistance in Palestine and Lebanon and did not betray the allies who stood by me, there is no chance that such a man would abandon his people or betray the army and his country.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skj2vote1x	2024-12-16T06:56:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/r1skJ11mEkg/r1skJ11mEkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Emergency medical service report no injuries or damage; operations at Ben Gurion Airport temporarily halted; senior Israeli official warns of significant retaliatory strike on Houthis Air raid sirens blared across central Israel Monday afternoon, stretching from the Shfela region to the Sharon area, as the Israeli Air Force intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. The alarms were triggered due to concerns over falling interceptor debris. Following the alerts, operations at Ben Gurion Airport were temporarily halted, including all takeoffs and landings. Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency medical service, reported no injuries or damage as of yet. The missile launch coincided with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's testimony at the Tel Aviv District Court, which continued uninterrupted as the courtroom is located in a protected space. Netanyahu's scheduled court appearance on Tuesday has been canceled, citing 'security matters.' This incident marks the latest in a series of escalating threats from Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels.

The official acknowledged the challenges of striking Yemen, citing the logistical and operational complexities involved. In recent weeks, Houthi drones have also targeted southern Israel. Last Thursday, air raid sirens were triggered near Eilat and Ashdod due to suspected drone incursions. An interceptor was launched near Eilat, while in Ashdod, the military pursued what was initially thought to be a drone entering from Gaza’s perimeter. The IDF later said the alarms may have been caused by a false detection. Earlier this month, a drone launched from Yemen caused extensive damage when it exploded on a penthouse balcony in a 16th-floor apartment building in Yavne. The unmanned aerial vehicle approached from the Mediterranean, entered Israeli airspace near Sderot, and traveled northward toward Ashdod. Despite being detected and targeted with electronic warfare measures, the drone evaded interception and ultimately exploded, causing significant property damage but no injuries. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjhcrhtnyx	2024-12-16T05:23:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/SJK0d2pEye/SJK0d2pEye_0_82_640_361_0_small.jpg
More recruits enlisting in combat units, IDF figures show	Military highlights high motivation among recruits, with turnout surpassing projections and reinforcing readiness of various units; IDF emphasizes that this cycle's success enhances its preparedness for upcoming challenges The IDF announced Monday the November-December enlistment figures for combat roles, revealing a recruitment rate that exceeded expectations. According to the IDF, this recruitment cycle included the launch of a new combat engineering battalion, resulting in a 120% increase in overall enlistment compared to the same period in 2023. Notably, there was a 28% rise in the number of women joining combat roles, attributed in part to pilot programs such as a gender-specific unit in field intelligence and a new infantry mobility training track for female combat soldiers. 'This recruitment cycle reflects the growing willingness of young people to step up and play an active, meaningful role in the challenges facing the IDF as combat soldiers in various units,' the IDF Spokesperson's Unit said. 'The high recruitment rates relative to our planning strengthen our units and enhance the IDF’s preparedness for the missions ahead.' As debates over legislation to exempt ultra-Orthodox men from military service loom, the IDF also reported the first round of recruits joining the new Hashmonayim Brigade, part of its framework for ultra-Orthodox enlistees. However, frustration remains over the low turnout, with only 200 ultra-Orthodox men enlisting so far from the thousands who received draft notices. > Recruitment for combat-support roles is still ongoing and will continue in the coming weeks, the IDF added. These roles, critical for operational success, provide essential support to soldiers in the field.

Speaking to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Katz said the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors would not be obstacles in order to agree to a deal, and that Hamas has shown flexibility on these matters.

After Assad, Syria (again) changes flag, this time it has 3 stars	The new Syria is not only getting used to streets without statues of Hafez Assad and portraits of his son Bashar, but also to the 'flag of independence,' a 96-year-old flag brought back into fashion by the rebels which actually was the first official flag of Syria The flag of the Syrian opposition, which in the days following the fall of Bashar Assad's regime has effectively become the new flag of Syria, is now being flown above a host of institutions in the capital, Damascus, and other cities. It has a long history, dating back at least to 1932, if not before. The new-old Syrian flag, called the 'Independence Flag,' consists of three horizontal stripes in green, white and black, with three red stars embossed on the white stripe. During the rebels' surprise attack and until they took control of Damascus, it was difficult to find a video of the opposition members that did not feature this flag; They made sure to carry it everywhere they went and have their pictures taken with it, a symbol of their victory. Throughout its existence, from the Great Arab Revolt of 1916 through the years of the French Mandate to the civil war that broke out in 2011, the Syrian flag has been replaced many times, and the three-star flag that has now returned to use is deeply rooted in this history. In fact, it was the first official flag of Syria. In the distant past, the official flag of Syria was the flag of the Ottoman Empire, and it remained so until the last Ottoman soldier fled Damascus in 1918. In 1916, during the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, the rebels adopted a flag with three horizontal stripes in black, green and white, from top to bottom, and a red triangle on the left, with its base on the left and its tip pointing to the right. In 1918, after the Ottomans left, the flag was raised in Damascus. In March 1920, the Syrian National Congress declared Syria's independence and crowned Prince Faisal bin Al-Hussein bin Ali as king. A white star was added to the flag in the middle of the red triangle, but this did not last long. The Allies refused to recognize Syria's independence and announced the imposition of a mandate over Syria and Lebanon, with Syria becoming a protectorate under the French Mandate. During the French Mandate, the French changed the Syrian flag twice. Both flags included a small French flag in the upper left. The Syrians have rejected the flags of the French Mandate over the years. In 1925, the 'Great Syrian Revolt' began in Syria and the Syrians sought a flag that would emphasize their sovereignty. The 'Flag of Independence,' the current flag of Syria, first appeared in 1928 in the draft constitution of the First Syrian Republic, when Syria was still under the rule of the Mandate. It was first flown in the city of Aleppo in 1932 and later in Damascus. Each of the colors of the flag had a different meaning at that time: green represented the first caliphate after the death of the Prophet Muhammad; white represented the Umayyad dynasty; and black represented the Abbasid Caliphate. The three stars represented Aleppo, Damascus and Deir ez-Zor, strategic and important cities in Syria. In 1936, after the annexation of Latakia and the Druze Mountains (Jabal al-Druze, in the Sweida region) to Syria, the meaning of the three stars changed. The first star symbolized Aleppo, Damascus and Deir ez-Zor, the second the Druze Mountains, and the third Latakia. After Syria officially declared its independence from the French Mandate in 1946, the Mandate flag was lowered and the flag of the First Syrian Republic, the 'flag of independence,' was officially raised. It remained in force until 1958. From 1958 to 1961, Syria was part of a state united with Egypt called the 'United Arab Republic,' and its flag was replaced with a flag with three stripes - red, white and black from top to bottom - with two green stars on the white stripe, one of which symbolized Syria and the other Egypt. Later, it was the flag of the Baath regime, after several changes. After the collapse of the 'United Arab Republic,' the 'flag of independence' officially returned to Syria, but for only three years, from 1961 to 1963. When the Baath Party came to power in Syria, it re-adopted the flag of the 'United Arab Republic,' and it was its official flag from 1963 to 1972, but with a small addition: When the Baath Party came to power in Iraq, there was an attempt by the Baath governments there and in Syria to unite with Egypt, and a third green star was added to the previous unity flag, so that the three stars represented the three countries. However, the Baath government in Iraq fell, and with it the plans for unification also collapsed.

In 1971, during the reign of Hafez Assad, Syria joined the 'Union of Arab Republics' with Egypt and Libya, and a new flag was adopted: The three stars from the last flag were replaced by an image of a hawk with the inscription 'Union of Arab Republics' underneath. The union fell apart, and in 1980, Hafez Assad changed the flag again. He returned the flag that had been used in 1958-1961, during the 'United Arab Republic' of Syria and Egypt, with the original two stars. This flag remained the official flag of Syria until just a week ago. The 'flag of independence' with the three green stars was used again in 2011 when the civil war broke out, and it was the rebels who brought it back into fashion. It became the official opposition flag, and last week it became the new flag of all of Syria. Yesterday, Syrians were already seen flying it on poles in schools and sticking it to planes at the airport. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rki11gfpeke	2024-12-16T03:46:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/SksYZEVE1g/SksYZEVE1g_0_244_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Ireland rejects Israeli claims of bias; Jewish leader: 'dialogue ...	Foreign Minister Micheal Martin says Dublin's decision to join the ICJ case accusing Israel of genocide is motivated by respect for international law; Israeli ambassador says decision to close embassy does not mean diplomatic ties are severed Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said on Monday that Ireland’s intervention at the ICJ and its previous recognition of the 'state of Palestine' is motivated by 'respect for international humanitarian law' and added that supporting the ICJ and the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, should not be viewed as a hostile act. Martin spoke in Brussels a day after Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar announced the closure of the Israeli embassy in Dublin. Sa'ar on Sunday cited Ireland's hostility to Israel as the reason for his decision. 'Ireland’s actions and rhetoric are rooted in delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, accompanied by blatant double standards,' Sa'ar said. 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its treatment of Israel. We will redirect our resources toward strengthening ties with nations that respect Israel.' 'We’ve consistently called for an immediate cease-fire, release of all hostages, and a massive surge of humanitarian aid,' the Irish minister said, adding that there must be 'full accountability for the destruction of much of Gaza by the IDF in the war as well as accountability for Hamas militants who had controlled the Palestinian enclave, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.' Martin also called on Israel to 'open up' Gaza to the international community and the media, so that they could 'bear witness' to what is happening. Chairman of the Irish Jewish Representative Council Maurice Cohen expressed his concern over the deterioration of Israeli-Irish diplomatic relations and said that the closure of the embassy 'has caused distress' for Israelis in Ireland. 'The closure of the embassy represents not only a symbolic blow but also a practical disadvantage,' Cohen said. 'Consular services provided by the embassy are vital for those maintaining connections with family, culture, and heritage in Israel,' he added. He said that losing this resource would leave many feeling unsupported and aggrieved, according to Cohen. 'Closing the embassy risks alienating a significant segment of Irish society and sends a message that dialogue is being replaced by disengagement,' he added Cohen said that Ireland's decision to join the case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, is a overly simplistic interpretation of a complex and tragic dispute 'unfairly isolating Israel, and undermining the integrity of the term 'genocide'.' He said that the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland reaffirmed its commitment to peace and the protection of innocent lives 'on all sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' while also supporting Israel's right to defend itself from 'terrorism and existential threats.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Cohen called on both the Irish and Israeli governments to seek pathways to rebuild trust and to ensure avenues for diplomatic engagement remain open. In an interview with Ynet, Israeli ambassador to Ireland, Dana Erlich, said that diplomatic ties between the two countries have not been severed by the Foreign Minister's decision, but after some consideration the ministry in Jerusalem decided to allocate resources elsewhere amid the blatant anti-Israel policies of the current government in Dublin. She said that there is support for Israel among the Irish people but that is not expressed or heard enough. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s100zxy64ke	2024-12-16T03:09:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/r1xXeqTNJx/r1xXeqTNJx_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Biden ties fall of Assad to US support for Israel	The US administration is using the toppling of the Syrian dictator to defend the Biden White House's Mideast policies, according to a Washington Post analysis Senior officials in the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden claimed that the president's unwavering support for Israel helped weaken Hezbollah and Iran and led to the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. An analysis piece published in the Washington Post on Sunday said the administration was using the collapse of the Syrian regime to defend its Middle East policies, including its support of Israel in the war in Gaza, that was widely criticized. Biden said that Assad's main backers, Iran, Hezbollah and Russia, had been significantly weakened. Without those patrons, the regime in Damascus fell at an unusual speed. 'For the first time ever, neither Russia nor Iran nor Hezbollah could defend this abhorrent regime in Syria. And this is a direct result of the blows that Ukraine and Israel have delivered upon their own self-defense, with unflagging support of the United States,' the president said. A senior official in his administration added that, in view of the general picture, it his hard to argue that the American approach was wrong.

Some 3 million Israelis live in poverty, 40% of them children, re...	Latet's annual poverty report paints a grim picture of economic hardship in Israel during the ongoing war, as 678,000 families face significant deprivation, with nearly 50% of children in supported households experiencing declining mental health and educational setbacks; Additionally, more than half of elderly beneficiaries are forced to forgo essential medications and are grappling with heightened loneliness and anxiety Latet, an Israeli nonprofit aid organization, published its annual poverty report on Monday, shedding light on the complex economic reality in Israel during 2024 against the backdrop of ongoing war and conflict. According to the organization's multidimensional poverty index, which defines poverty as significant deprivation in relation to basic living needs and conditions, 678,200 families (22.3%) and 2,756,000 individuals (28.7%) in Israel are living in poverty. This includes 1,240,000 children, accounting for 39.6%. While the poverty rates are similar to last year’s figures, the forecast is alarming. 'The relative stability in poverty rates this year stems partly from government support for evacuees and businesses, activities by civil society and philanthropy, continued national insurance payments, and the gradual nature of descent into poverty,' the report explains. 'This process typically begins with exhausting savings, moves to taking out loans, and only later becomes evident in official poverty statistics. Unfortunately, future projections indicate a worsening situation, particularly in light of the government’s new economic measures.' The rising cost of living The report reveals that in 2024, the minimum monthly cost of living in Israel is 5,355 shekels per person and 13,617 shekels for a household of two adults and two children. These figures represent increases of 6.5% and 6.9% respectively compared to last year. Annually, this amounts to an additional expense of approximately 4,000 shekels per person and 10,500 shekels per household. For middle-class households, normative living costs are estimated at 8,665 shekels per person and 22,181 shekels per household. 'The minimum cost of living, reflecting the basic expenses required for survival, has nearly doubled the growth in the Consumer Price Index, which stands at 3.6%,' Latet notes. Most of the rise is attributed to higher prices for food, housing, utilities, and related costs. As a result, there is a growing population in Israel that, while not classified as poor by the National Insurance Institute, effectively lives in poverty. Households with a per-person income above the national poverty line of 4,105 shekels but below the minimum cost of living of 5,355 shekels are unable to maintain basic living standards and therefore experience varying degrees of deprivation. The report also examines the challenges faced by those supported by Latet. 'The cost of living in Israel, already high before the war, has significantly worsened,' it states. 'The conflict has driven up prices, particularly for food and consumer goods.' The average monthly expenditure for supported households is 10,367 shekels – 1.7 times their average net monthly income of 6,092 shekels. Debt is widespread among these households, with 78.8% reporting outstanding loans compared to 26.9% of the general population. The financial situation of 65% of Latet beneficiaries and 32.1% of the general public has deteriorated over the past year. Among the supported population, 69.5% are unable to repair severe home defects due to financial constraints, 84.8% face energy shortages, and 33.7% endure severe energy insecurity. Alarmingly, the electricity was disconnected for 22.1% in the past year due to nonpayment. Children and the elderly are most affected The report highlights the war's toll on children and teenagers. Academic performance has significantly declined for 44.6% of children in supported households, compared to 14.1% in the general population. Moreover, 46.7% of beneficiaries report severe mental health impacts on their children, three times higher than the general public (14.5%). About 22.8% say at least one child dropped out of school, and 18.9% had to transfer their children to boarding schools due to financial hardship. Additionally, 85.4% had to forgo private tutoring for at least one child. The elderly population also faces unique challenges exacerbated by the conflict. Among Latet’s elderly beneficiaries, 81.7% live in poverty, and 52.6% are classified as living in extreme poverty. Over one-third (34.8%) endure severe food insecurity, and 60.4% have forgone essential medications or medical treatments because they could not afford them. Research conducted for the report underscores the daily struggles of supported families, especially regarding food insecurity. 'Many supported households live in constant fear of running out of food and being unable to buy more or provide balanced meals for their children,' Latet states. About 80% of beneficiaries report instances where food ran out, and they lacked funds to purchase more. Additionally, 62.4% reduced or skipped meals due to financial constraints, compared to 16% in the general population. Among parents, 50.5% had to forgo or reduce recommended infant formula for their babies, compared to 12% of the general population. > Latet's founder and president, Gilles Darmon, and its CEO, Eran Weintraub, express grave concerns about the future. 'The planned economic measures – including raising VAT, increasing social security and health insurance payments, and rising electricity, water and property tax costs – are expected to deepen the hardships faced by vulnerable populations,' they warn. 'The combination of inflation, high interest rates, an anti-social government budget, and the ongoing costs of recovery from the war, will likely push thousands more low-middle-class families into severe deprivation.' They conclude with a call to action. 'In addition to military and security challenges, Israel faces another battle – the fight against poverty. The country stands at a moral crossroads. Solidarity and mutual responsibility will determine whether we emerge from this crisis stronger or weaker. It’s time for the government to take responsibility, act decisively to reduce poverty and inequality, and implement a comprehensive socio-economic policy that addresses the needs of all segments of society.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skalv8tvjl	2024-12-16T01:13:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/06/07/rkvzG6aT83/rkvzG6aT83_0_136_2560_1440_0_small.jpg

Serbia used Israeli firm’s tech to enable spy campaign, Amnesty s...	Report says spyware by Israeli surveillance company Cellebrite DI Ltd was used to unlock phones of activists and journalists during interviews with Serbian police and security authorities; Company says 'violation of our end user license agreement' Serbian officials installed homegrown spyware on the phones of dozens of journalists and activists, Amnesty International said in a report on Monday. The report cites digital forensic evidence and testimony from activists who said they were hacked in recent months. According to the report, software provided by Israeli surveillance company Cellebrite DI Ltd (CLBT.O) was used to unlock phones prior to infection. The Serbian spyware, dubbed 'NoviSpy' by Amnesty, then took covert screenshots of mobile devices, copied contacts, and uploaded them to a government-controlled server, the report said. 'In multiple cases, activists and a journalist reported signs of suspicious activity on their mobile phones directly following interviews with Serbian police and security authorities,' Amnesty said. Serbia’s interior ministry, foreign ministry and intelligence agency BIA did not respond to requests for comment made on Dec. 12. Cellebrite products are widely used by law enforcement, including the FBI, to unlock smartphones and scour them for evidence. Cellebrite Chief Marketing Officer David Gee said it was investigating the Amnesty allegations. 'Should those accusations be accurate, that could potentially be in violation of our end user license agreement,' Gee told Reuters. If that were the case, Gee said, Cellebrite could suspend the use of its technology by Serbian authorities. Putting surveillance software on devices 'is absolutely not what we do,' Gee said. He added that Cellebrite had begun contacting Serbian officials but declined to provide further details. One of the activists featured by Amnesty in the report said they had noticed the contacts on their phone had been exported immediately after a meeting with the BIA. The activist told Reuters they showed their phone to digital forensic experts, who discovered the NoviSpy spyware had exported their contacts and sent private photos from their device to a BIA-controlled server. According to Amnesty, Serbia received phone-cracking devices from Cellebrite as part of a broader package of assistance designed to help Serbia meet the requirements for integration into the European Union. That package, which was funded by the Norwegian government and administered by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), was provided to the Serbian interior ministry from 2017 to 2021 in order to help Serbia fight organized crime, the report said. > The Norwegian government temporarily ceased delivery of Cellebrite devices to Serbia in 2018, Amnesty said. The Norwegian Embassy in Belgrade also raised concerns about the program, the report added, but UNOPS eventually delivered the devices in June 2019. 'The claims made in the report are alarming and, if correct, unacceptable,' Norway's deputy foreign minister, Maria Varteressian, told Reuters. 'We will meet Serbian authorities as well as UNOPS later this month to get further information on the matter.' 'We expect UNOPS to investigate the allegations,' she added. UNOPS said in a statement it welcomed Amnesty's report and said the agency had in the years since 2017 'further enhanced mechanisms to assess and mitigate potential adverse effects.' The agency did not elaborate on those measures. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk0avlpe1l	2024-12-15T23:05:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/r1Gd8IT4yx/r1Gd8IT4yx_0_49_1921_1081_0_small.jpg
The IDF’s groundbreaking Refaim combat unit has its 1st female op...	Major A, the first female Operations Officer in an elite IDF unit, is breaking barriers in the Refaim (Ghost) Unit under the 162nd Division; From Gaza tunnels to cutting-edge combat innovation, her leadership exemplifies dedication, resilience and a commitment to redefining possibilities for female soldiers The IDF’s 162nd Division has been conducting prolonged operations in Jabaliya for over two months, recently expanding into Beit Lahia. Among the ruins of northern Gaza, Major A has emerged as a key figure. Serving as the first female Operations Officer (Katzin Agam) in an elite IDF unit, she is part of the multi-dimensional elite Refaim unit, a groundbreaking combat force. In her previous role, Major A was the deputy commander of a combat platoon in Yahalom (which means Diamond), the elite unit of the Combat Engineering Corps. Reflecting on her decision to continue her military service, she explained: 'I had a dilemma this summer about whether to leave the IDF after completing my time in Yahalom. But with the fighting here ongoing, I couldn’t bring myself to leave Gaza. I felt I had more to give. I applied for the position of Operations Officer in the Refaim unit and was accepted after two crazy years in Yahalom, the second of which was spent in maneuvering operations in Gaza.' A native of a community near Jerusalem and now living in Tel Aviv, Major A is no stranger to breaking barriers. She began her service as a combat soldier and officer in the Gaza Division’s reconnaissance unit, and later, as a commander of an observation company, she worked closely with Colonel Tal Ashur, the former commander of the Southern Brigade, who now leads the Refaim unit. Refaim: Innovation and combat excellence The Refaim unit, established four years ago, serves as the experimental and developmental arm of the IDF’s ground forces. Its mission is to test and implement innovative combat techniques and technologies, which are then shared with other brigades and units. The unit’s soldiers undergo specialized commando training, preparing them for cutting-edge operations. On October 7, the unit’s commander, Colonel Roi Levi, was killed in action while fighting in Kibbutz Re’im. Despite its relatively small size, Refaim has made significant advances over the past year, particularly in the use of drones for detecting and eliminating threats. These advancements, along with classified technologies developed during combat, have placed the unit at the forefront of operational innovation. Major A has played a central role in managing these efforts, coordinating the unit’s operations in areas such as the Nitzarim corridor and now in Jabaliya under the 162nd Division. A career built on breaking barriers Before the war, Major A held a staff position in the IDF’s central Tel Aviv headquarters as the head of the operational section in the Cyber Defense Division. There, she worked on bridging operational combat and the cyber spectrum, a field that continues to evolve both in the Refaim unit and across all branches of Israeli armed forces. 'I never imagined I’d become a deputy battalion commander in Yahalom, let alone lead a combat platoon and enter tunnels in Gaza,' she said. 'I commanded forces tasked with destroying tunnel infrastructure, and my presence as a female officer was unique. I was often the first commanding figure in Yahalom, but the unit commander trusted me and gave me the opportunity to lead soldiers, from northern Gaza to Rafah.' While her time in Yahalom marked the peak of her career, Major A felt compelled to continue. 'Something in my gut told me not to leave. I couldn’t see myself anywhere else with all the experience I had gained. When the door to Refaim opened, I seized it with both hands. In my time here, I’ve been responsible for managing and executing the unit’s operations against Hamas, overseeing battle management, resources, and weaponry for the soldiers. Essentially, I’ve become the commander’s right hand on the battlefield.' Leadership during crisis Major A was at the helm of the unit’s operations center during a tragic incident two weeks ago, when four Refaim soldiers were killed by an explosive device in Jabaliya. 'I quickly mobilized the system to isolate the area, evacuate the casualties, safely integrate reinforcements, and secure the zone,' she recounted. 'It was a deeply painful event, though not the first time I’ve lost close friends in this war. In this incident, Lieutenant Joni, the team commander who had previously been my operations officer, was killed. Before that, two of my close friends, Ariel Ben Moshe and David Shkuri, were also killed in combat. The event two weeks ago hit me hard, but in these situations, you have to stay focused and save the emotions for later. The team here is incredibly strong and continues to excel in exposing and eliminating the enemy.' In her next role, Major A is expected to compete for a position as a battalion commander, which would make her a lieutenant colonel. Despite the progress made, she acknowledges that female combat officers remain a minority in the IDF. While there are female Operations Officers in maneuvering battalions, female battalion commanders who have operated in Gaza, and combat medics in elite units, she believes there is still more work to be done.

'The war has raised awareness about the role of female combat soldiers, and it’s heartwarming to see more women in combat roles, even in Gaza. We’re still a minority among combat officers, though I don’t feel like I’m doing anything extraordinary. The unit here has welcomed me with open arms. There will always be a few people who raise an eyebrow, but I know the burden of proof is on me – not because I’m a woman, but because I’m a soldier. I hope this conversation disappears one day.' Still, Major A advises caution in opening all combat roles to women immediately. 'The military has made significant progress on this issue. There are far more opportunities for female combat soldiers today than when I enlisted 11 years ago,' she said. 'We need to preserve and develop what exists, increasing equality and opportunities without lowering standards or compromising quality. More and more units are opening up to women, and this should be based on the essence of the role, not just the name of the unit.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ryxjktn4jx	2024-12-15T22:50:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/13/yk14150635/yk14150635_0_13_464_262_0_small.jpg

Serbia used Israeli firm's tech to enable spy campaign, Amnesty s...	Serbian officials installed homegrown spyware on the phones of dozens of journalists and activists, Amnesty International said in a report released on Monday, citing digital forensic evidence and testimony from activists who said they were hacked in recent months. In two cases, software provided by Israeli surveillance company Cellebrite DI Ltd was used to unlock phones prior to infection, the report said. The Serbian spyware, dubbed 'NoviSpy' by Amnesty, then took covert screenshots of mobile devices, copied contacts, and uploaded them to a government-controlled server, the report said. Serbia's interior ministry, foreign ministry and intelligence agency BIA did not respond to requests for comment made on Dec. 12. Cellebrite products are widely used by law enforcement, including the FBI, to unlock smartphones and scour them for evidence. Cellebrite Chief Marketing Officer David Gee said it was investigating the Amnesty allegations. 'Should those accusations be accurate, that could potentially be in violation of our end user license agreement,'Gee told Reuters. If that were the case, Gee said, Cellebrite could suspend the use of its technology by Serbian authorities.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjhvrs6n1l	2024-12-15T21:57:07-08:00

Israeli analyst: Diplomatic ties with Syria unlikely	Jonathan Conricus: Syrian rebels 'are just one notch away from full jihadi extremism in the forms of ISIS and Al Qaeda' An Israeli analyst with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies has expressed skepticism about the likelihood of Israel and the incoming Syrian government establishing normalized ties. Speaking to ILTV News, Jonathan Conricus, a former IDF spokesperson, said the Syrian rebels 'are just one notch away from full jihadi extremism in the forms of ISIS and Al Qaeda,' making warm ties unlikely—at least in the short term. He added, 'Maybe in the future, after one or two elections, when the Syrian people understand that the only thing that can happen with regards to normalization with Israel is prosperity and peace and stability and options for the future for them, for the future of their children.' 'Then, maybe they will see things in a different way and reach out towards Israel,' Conricus continued.

Middle East expert: ‘Any strike on Iran will be blessed’	Dr. Mordechai Kedar: There was never any diplomatic way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon A Middle East expert has stated that if Israel or the United States decides to attack Iran, the move will be 'blessed' because 'it will bring more peace and stability to the world.' Speaking to ILTV News, Dr. Mordechai Kedar said that President-Elect Donald Trump’s suggestion of a preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear sites is likely the only way to prevent the rogue regime from obtaining a nuclear bomb. He emphasized that diplomacy is not—and never was—an option. 'There was never any diplomatic way to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon,' Kedar told ILTV. 'They were marching forward with their nuclear program, in spite of all the negotiations, and, in fact, in spite of all the agreements. And unfortunately, the world, especially the western world, who doesn't understand anything in the Middle East, fell in this pit time and again.'

Israeli anchor praises Erin Molan: 'A role model for journalists ...	Sivan Raviv: 'Your courage and unwavering commitment to presenting the realities of this region are truly inspiring' ILTV News anchor Sivan Raviv has praised former Sky News Australia anchor Erin Molan, who was dismissed from the outlet following widespread criticism of her outspoken support for Israel over the past year and since October 7. 'Erin, your bravery in reporting the truth about Israel has not gone unnoticed,' Raviv said Sunday during the ILTV Daily News report. 'As a fellow anchor and journalist here in Israel, I want to tell you that your courage and unwavering commitment to presenting the realities of this region are truly inspiring in a world where reporting on Israel often invites disproportionate criticism.' She continued, 'You stood tall and spoke with integrity. You are a role model for journalists everywhere who strive to tell the truth, no matter the personal or professional cost. We deeply appreciate your voice and your work, and I wish you nothing but success and strength in the next chapter of your career.' Molan, who is neither Jewish nor Israeli, is known for her bold and unapologetic style as she stood firm in defending Israel's right to self-defense amid the ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. Her coverage highlighted the complex realities of the conflict, including the role of terrorism and its impact on Israeli civilians—topics she argued were often overlooked in international reporting. Despite her efforts to provide a perspective often marginalized in global media, Molan faced significant backlash from some viewers and activists who accused her of bias and insensitivity toward Palestinians. Critics targeted her social media posts and on-air comments, which condemned Hamas while calling for more nuanced reporting on the region. Supporters, however, praised her for speaking the truth and challenging what they saw as double standards in media narratives about Israel. Sky News stated that Molan’s dismissal was a business decision, though many speculate the move was influenced by the controversy surrounding her stance on Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk11so76ekl	2024-12-15T19:27:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/13/SkXmwvFVyl/SkXmwvFVyl_1_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Al Jazeera's 'cameraman' killed? IDF: he was PIJ commander	The Qatari-based network claims Ahmed al-Louh was a member of their news team, but the military says he had been a platoon commander for the Islamic terror faction The Qatari Al Jazeera network said on Sunday that the IDF killed Ahmed al-Louh who worked as a cameraman in Gaza at the Nuseirat refugee camp. 'Al Jazeera Media Network condemns in the strongest terms the killing of its cameraman, Ahmad Baker Al-Louh, 39, by the Israeli occupation forces,' the channel said. 'He was brutally killed in an air strike that targeted a Civil Defense post in the market area of Al-Nuseirat Camp, central Gaza Strip,' it added. The IDF confirmed in a statement that Louh had been killed in a strike on Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists operating in a command and control center embedded in the offices of the 'Civil Defense' organization in Nuseirat. 'Among the terrorists eliminated in the strike was the Islamic Jihad terrorist Ahmed Bakr al-Louh, who previously served as a Platoon commander in the Islamic Jihad's Central Camps Brigade,' the IDF said in a statement. 'The terrorists used the command and control center to plan and carry out an imminent terror attack against IDF troops.' > The IDF said that steps were taken before the strike to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians, 'including the use of precise munitions, precise aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence. 'The terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip systematically violate international law, exploiting civilian infrastructure and the Gazan population as human shields for terrorist activity. The IDF will continue to operate against terrorist organizations in defense of the citizens of Israel,' the military said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkrzba341e	2024-12-15T13:20:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/16/r1fUm0hV1g/r1fUm0hV1g_246_150_706_397_0_small.jpg
Palestinian Authority's elite unit leads Jenin anti-terror operat...	The PA’s 101st Unit is a 2,000 strong forced trained by Americans and Canadians conducting a sweeping crackdown; Abbas assigned the force to assert control amid firefights with terrorists Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Sunday that anyone in his security forces who refuses to take part in the counter-terror operation the PA was conducting in Jenin would be fired. The West Bank city of Jenin has become a nerve center for terrorist activity, where armed groups operate with impunity. But now, the Palestinian Authority’s elite 101st Unit is rewriting the rules of engagement. With its sights set on restoring order and intends to dismantle the terror networks, reclaim refugee camps, and reassert authority. Comprising of 2,000 highly trained troops, the 101st Unit is a force to be reckoned with. Its members—young, academically accomplished, and physically fit—are rigorously trained by American and Canadian specialists. 'This is an elite unit that trains abroad, in various countries,' a senior Palestinian Authority official explained to Ynet. 'It’s a source of Palestinian pride, defined by strength, courage, and respect for the population.' Working in close coordination with Palestinian intelligence services, the unit is tasked with identifying 'lawbreakers,' a term that encompasses everything from drug dealers and arms traffickers to terrorists targeting both Palestinians and Israelis. Jenin’s refugee camp, long seen as a lawless enclave and a hub for terrorist activity, now finds itself in the crosshairs of the Unit’s precision operations. Leadership in the shadows The 101st Unit operates under the command of Major General Nidal Abu Dukhan, a towering figure in Palestinian security circles. Renowned for his academic and military training across multiple countries, Abu Dukhan has earned the respect of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and even served as Yasser Arafat’s bodyguard. His leadership is as strategic as it is symbolic, embodying the authority’s determination to restore order in its restive territories. Despite initial fears of widespread unrest, the Palestinian Authority has reported minimal public resistance to the unit’s activities within the camps. 'We thought the population would protect the lawbreakers among them, but that didn’t happen,' a senior official admitted. 'This shows that the residents are tired of illegal activities and want order to return to the camps.' Symbolizing change Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa recently visited Jenin to commend the ongoing operation. 'The Jenin camp and other camps are symbols of our pride,' he declared. 'This is a commitment from the president and all of us. While these camps are national symbols, residents must be able to live in peace.' He further emphasized, 'We are working to restore security everywhere, which will bring positive outcomes for everyone—security and development for our people as we work toward an independent state.' Last night, the unit maintained control over the camps despite attempts to disrupt its operations in several locations across the West Bank. No significant disturbances were reported, further solidifying the operation's success. The name '101st Unit' carries historical weight. It mirrors the legendary Israeli commando unit founded by Ariel Sharon in 1953, known for its daring reprisal operations against infiltrators from Jordan and Gaza. Among its storied actions were raids on the Al-Bureij refugee camp in Gaza and operations like 'Silk Gloves,' where Meir Har-Zion led ground assaults deep into enemy territory. The symbolic adoption of this name by the Palestinian Authority is both bold and ironic, as it signals a new era of assertiveness. The Assad effect: A war on terrorist strongholds The 101st Unit’s campaign, known as 'Homeland Defense,' has unfolded against a backdrop of shifting regional dynamics. Israeli intelligence has noted a marked increase in Palestinian Authority activity against militant groups in the northern West Bank, particularly in Jenin. The operation, now in its seventh day, includes encircling the Jenin refugee camp and conducting raids in areas like Tulkarm. 'This is equivalent to a major military campaign on our scale—something we haven’t seen in years,' a senior Israeli security source told Ynet. 'The humiliating trigger was the theft of Palestinian Authority vehicles by armed militants.' The operation has deployed snipers, sharpshooters, and armored vehicles, leveraging strong intelligence to guide its actions. Despite early heavy firefights and the use of a car bomb by militants, the unit’s efforts have yet to uncover all hidden explosive devices. After setting up a command center in the Jibrayat neighborhood overlooking the camp, the unit launched its ground assault at 5:00 AM, engaging in intense exchanges of fire. So far, one senior militant commander has been killed, and injuries have been reported on both sides. Significant arrests of wanted men remain elusive, but the operation is expected to continue for several days. A wake-up call from Syria The Palestinian Authority’s determination to act has been fueled, in part, by the collapse of the Syrian regime. 'They saw how a handful of armed groups with pickup trucks, AK-47s, and machine guns quickly and easily seized control of the government,' an Israeli military source observed. 'What’s to stop militant groups from doing the same in Ramallah?' The Israeli defense establishment has urged Palestinian forces to adopt a more proactive approach, following the success of last year’s 'Nablus Model.' There, terrorist groups were suppressed through a combination of Israeli military action and the subsequent reassertion of Palestinian Authority control over the city’s Kasbah and refugee camps. The battle for Jenin highlights the cyclical nature of counterterrorism. 'You kill ten militants in a place like the Jenin refugee camp, and ten new young recruits replace them immediately,' one security source remarked. Members of the 101st Unit have reportedly faced children as young as eight throwing explosives at them during the past week.

But in their campaign to reclaim Jenin and other militant strongholds, they are forging a new narrative—one of resilience, strategy, and the uncompromising pursuit of order in one of the most turbulent regions of the West Bank. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rynmhihvjl	2024-12-15T12:44:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/B1t000NNh4kg/B1t000NNh4kg_122_61_647_364_0_small.jpg

How Israeli Irish relations failed	The decision to close the Israeli embassy in Dublin comes after over a year of policies taken by the Irish government including recognizing a Palestinian State, divesting from Israeli companies and ignoring Hamas crimes The decision of Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to close the Israeli embassy in Ireland came after Dublin joined the South African petition against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague accusing Israel of committing genocide. 'The actions and antisemitic rhetoric used by Ireland against Israel are rooted in the delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, along with double standards. Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel,' Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said in the statement. 'The Israeli decision was deeply regrettable,' Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said. 'I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-International law,' Harris said in a post on X. Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said the two countries would maintain diplomatic relations and there were no plans to close Ireland's embassy in Israel. Israel had previously considered the option of closing-down its embassy and said it took the step, in response to the Irish government's extreme anti-Israeli position. Soon after the war in Gaza began, there were voiced in Ireland calling for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador Dana Erlich, who received threat just three weeks after the Hamas massacre. Erlich who was assigned to one of the most hostile European capitals, appeared frequently in the Irish media, criticizing the parliament. That led to personal threats against her and she was slammed on social media with calls to 'kick out the terrorist ambassador,' accompanied by her photos covered in blood. She recently even found herself in confrontation with Irish President Michael Higgins who had accused Israel of violating international law and the Geneva Convention and claimed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had declared his intentions to break international law in advance. Erlich responded by accusing him of misinformation regarding the war. She said the president's comment were inciting. One month later, the former prime minister Leo Varadkar praised the release of then nine-year-old Emily Hand from Hamas captivity after she was abducted during the Oct. 7 massacre but neglected to mention who her abductors were. 'This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family. An innocent child who was lost and has now been found and returned, Varadkar wrote in a post on X. Last May Ireland joined Norway and Spain in recognizing a Palestinian state. Harris then said he expected more countries to follow suit. Even before that decision was made, in April Ireland' Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) announced it was selling its holdings in six Israeli companies because they had activity in the 'occupied Palestinian territories.' The sale of assets totaling some three million euros from major Israeli banks and a supermarket chain was based on a UN data base of companies working in Israeli settlements on the West Bank. At the same time Ireland has had a sharp increase in antisemitic incidents including in the education system. The British Jewish Chronical reported that school books included sentences like 'murderous Jews' and 'Israel is an aggressor' and as a result, Jewish children were traumatized and made to change schools. The Education Ministry in Dublin rejected the criticism and said that Irish children receive fair and balanced educational material from good Irish teachers in a variety of subjects including Judaism and the history of the Jewish people.

The students who fight for Israel on Italian campuses	Andrea Nizoli and Pietro Balzano talk with Ynet about their efforts to cooperate with Israeli universities and hostilities against Jewish and Israeli students by pro-Palestinians on campus As pro-Palestinian protests, violent incidents against Jews and Israelis and antisemitism across the world intensified hate for Israel after October 7, some pro-Israeli actors moved to try and defend the country in the international arena. Now, two Italian students who took a stand for Israel and its public diplomacy on their campus spoke to Ynet about their efforts. Andrea Nizoli and Pietro Balzano, thank you for joining us. Andrea, a university student in international relations and law and the leader of Forza Italia that were the first to demonstrate against pro-Palestinians on campus. As a non-Jewish student, what was the motivation behind your activity? 'Support for the Israeli people and we were also grateful for all the democracy exportation you're doing. We can see the result of your action in Syria now. And, at the start of that period, we started demonstrating for the freedom of Israeli people and also, the freedom to go to university and be free to study.' Did you witness incitement against the Jewish students on your campus this year? 'Yes, for sure. There was a lot of discrimination against Jewish people. And today we have some Jewish people that told us they were not allowed to go to the university, to be free to study without the protestors going against them. There were also Jewish people with us and they joined us after that we publicized our manifest.' Pietro, what made you join the fights against the rising antisemitism on campus and the lies that were spread this year since the beginning of the war? 'We've seen since the beginning of the war, those violent protests that started in our campuses and, not only in Milan, but also, Naples, Rome, Turin and so on because they want to use fear and violence against common students and in particular against students who also come from Israel to our universities and Jewish people in general. 'So I think it's also important to remember that they call themselves a 'Students Intifada.' That's how far they've come. And what we are trying to fight is exactly what we are seeing in those images. They are blocking our universities. They are causing damage to our universities for tens of thousands of euros — in some cases, hundreds of thousands of euros, which, of course, they aren't going to pay and that's what we are fighting against'. Do you have specific examples from your campus? You also participated in a debate relating to the war. 'Yes. I tried to participate in a so-called 'debate', but I instantly acknowledged that debates in our university, especially when Israel is concerned, are no longer possible because there's too much extremism and it's not possible to even talk about the agreements with the Israeli universities right now because they're trying to stop them all and we're also fighting against this.' 'And in this regard, I want to say that I'm extremely happy to announce that we will be coming to Israel because I think it's extremely important to show the truth they forget or try to hide. We have to show the truth and bring it back to Italy, that's extremely important for us.' Andrea, as Pietro has mentioned you're planning to come to Israel in January. What is the purpose of your visit? 'We are going to visit Reichman University to announce our support of the university. After October 7, a lot of universities in Italy, like in Milano and Torino, know a lot of universities around all of Italy from the north to the south and decided to not continue to have a relationship with Israeli universities and this for us is something that is unacceptable. 'This is because as a student we really believe in the international community, especially the one in Israel because you have some knowledge in some subjects that are fundamental nowadays. We're also going to Jerusalem to see the real Israel.' Pietro, you raised funds to finance the visit. What kind of responses do you get from your fellow students on campus? 'The students, are afraid because those students who support Palestine and not only are using violence and fear, and so the students who actually support Israel, and there are a lot, are scared to speak about about it because they're using violence against their own colleagues and I think it's no wonder why Hezbollah officials have described them as actors in which they should invest.

We are trying to protect our universities and our fellow students from this violence that these people are trying to bring into our university.' 'I think it's it will be very important to come to Israel again because we have to show what the actual Intifada really did to Israel and we have to show these people that they are sitting comfortably in Milan talking about a state they don't know, and yet they try to make decisions for all of us regarding our universities. That's unacceptable.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rj0e5sh4yg	2024-12-15T09:58:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/SywXpBnEyx/SywXpBnEyx_137_0_450_253_0_small.jpg
Britain has had 'diplomatic contact' with Syria's HTS group	Britain has had diplomatic contact with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that swept Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power last week, British foreign minister David Lammy said on Sunday. 'HTS remains a proscribed organization, but we can have diplomatic contact and so we do have diplomatic contact as you would expect,' Lammy told broadcasters. 'Using all the channels that we have available, and those are diplomatic and, of course, intelligence-led channels, we seek to deal with HTS where we have to.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s13amin4ke	2024-12-15T09:41:53-08:00	
Between a niqab and a bikini: Riyadh aims to become world's fashi...	Saudi Arabia's relationship with the fashion world is seeing major shifts in the last year, culminating in a glamourous fashion week that draws congratulations but also condemnations In October 2023, right after Paris Fashion Week ended, Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh hosted its first-ever fashion week, organized by the Saudi Fashion Commission. Held at the King Abdullah Financial District, the event showcased 30 local designers and brands. Since then, the event has been held twice a year, drawing prominent figures from the Arab world and local celebrities including Georgina Rodríguez, Cristiano Ronaldo’s partner (Ronaldo plays for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia). Rodriguez attended shows by designers Fatima Alabdulqader and Khawla Alaiban. 'The event highlights our top creative talents and allows our brands to show the world what Saudi fashion has to offer,' Saudi Fashion Commission Director Burak Cakmak said. Riyadh Fashion Week marked a turning point in Saudi Arabia's approach to fashion and its openness to the Western world — a trend that's grown over the past year. In May, for example, Saudi Arabia held its first-ever swimwear fashion show — a bold step for the conservative Muslim nation. Recently, as part of the Riyadh Season festival, Lebanese designer Elie Saab’s fashion show featured singers like Jennifer Lopez and Céline Dion. Simultaneously, the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition launched at Saudi Arabia’s National Museum (closing April 2), showcasing 75 years of Dior’s creations. The exhibits emphasize local influences, such as the Al-Ula region, reflected in designs inspired by desert light and golden sands, blending Western haute couture with local traditions and nature. One of Saudi Arabia's strategies to bolster its fashion industry was establishing the Saudi Fashion Commission in 2020, headed by Burak Cakmak, a former dean of fashion at Parsons School of Design in New York. 'We have been building a fashion industry here in Saudi completely from scratch,' Cakmak explained in a 2023 interview with Forbes. 'The biggest challenge has been obtaining market data information. It’s important that the commission, as well as designers and businesses across the value chain, can make informed data-led decisions,' he said. 'The Saudi fashion scene is truly like no other, you just need to attend a Saudi event such as the Saudi Cup to witness its originality and love of luxury and extravagance, blended with Saudi heritage and the contemporary,' he added. Cakmak is optimistic about the sector’s growth in the Muslim country, envisioning a future that preserves Middle Eastern traditions while developing a new design language. One of his initiatives is the Saudi 100 Brands program, a professional development effort helping emerging fashion talents — 85% of whom are women — reach their potential through specialized courses and brand development support. 'What distinguishes Saudi designers from others is our vision, which is born from our past and our heritage,' said Nour Al Dhahri, a designer from the Saudi 100 Brands program specializing in embroidered evening gowns and a regular at Riyadh Fashion Week. Saudi Arabia's current focus on expanding its presence in fashion, including shows, exhibitions and Western appeal, follows two and a half decades of stability in its luxury market, fueled by its oil wealth. In the early 2000s, luxury brands began entering the Saudi market — a trend that intensified in the 2010s with the expansion of major fashion groups like Chalhoub, representing brands like Fendi, Versace and Tom Ford. This period also saw the launch of fashion magazines targeting the local audience, such as Vogue Arabia and Marie Claire Arabia, based in the UAE. These developments strengthened the local economy. Whereas 70% of Gulf and Saudi customers’ luxury purchases previously occurred abroad in fashion hubs like Milan and Paris, there’s now a growing trend of buying luxury brands in local malls. As of 2023, Saudi Arabia's fashion industry is valued at approximately $30 billion, projected to reach $42 billion by 2028, with a significant 48% growth in retail fashion sales expected by 2025. The industry contributes 2.5% to the country’s GDP and has created 320,000 jobs. Women comprise 52% of the workforce, underscoring Saudi Arabia's emphasis on diversity and gender equality. The market also invests in expanding local brands and designers, such as Hindamme by Mohammed Khoja, which combines Saudi heritage with modern design; haute couture designer Yousef Akbar; and Arwa Al Banawi, known for blending classic and contemporary styles. 'Swimsuit models? This was unheard of in Saudi Arabia' 'This is a revolutionary yet quiet period in Saudi Arabia, driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,' explained Prof. Uzi Rabi, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies. 'The openness in fashion takes the country a step further as it touches on women’s rights. Swimsuit models? This was unheard of in Saudi Arabia.' 'But it’s part of Saudi Vision 2030 that the kingdom aims to promote. In the last five years, we’ve seen women driving alone, holding photo IDs and participating in short film competitions — developments that all point to one message: Saudi Arabia wants the world at its doorstep,' he added. Vision 2030, launched by bin Salman in 2016, is a comprehensive strategic plan to diversify the kingdom’s economy and reduce reliance on oil revenue. The plan includes extensive economic, social and cultural reforms, particularly in tourism. 'Bin Salman questioned what Saudi Arabia would look like in 2030 and began 'Saudizing' the workforce with a focus on women’s empowerment — by Saudi standards,' Rabi noted. 'They’re not discarding the hijab, but they’re advancing things women could only dream of 15–20 years ago. It’s a delicate dance between progress and tradition, all seemingly sanctioned by religious approval. Sometimes, however, that approval comes after the fact.' How does modernization coexist with Islamic sharia law? 'When contemporary Saudi society seeks progress, it consults its past to shape an acceptable future,' Rabi explained. 'This involves adopting new elements that might initially be seen as heretical by radicals but eventually gain religious endorsement. Essentially, they’re bending religious law to facilitate modernization.' Are they subordinating Islamic law to modernization efforts? 'Absolutely,' Rabi said. 'Bin Salman not only uses Islam as a tool for modernization but also leverages it to drive progress. This is part of his controversial persona. Despite his ruthlessness and authoritarian rule, he’s immensely popular among Saudi youth. He’s opening Saudi Arabia to the world, fostering interactions, and gaining recognition. 'This is a sophisticated strategy — not a whim — to make Saudi Arabia more welcoming to tourists and businesspeople. With [Donald] Trump’s election and Jared Kushner’s deep involvement in the Saudi economy, we can expect even bigger developments.' The end of modesty laws is still far off Fashion in Saudi Arabia isn’t just about clothing or women wearing Dolce & Gabbana beneath their black niqabs — it reflects broader social and political shifts. According to Rabi, bin Salman's initiatives aren’t just PR moves aimed at Western liberal audiences; they directly impact citizens’ lives, evident in social media, Saudi theater, freedom of expression, inheritance laws and education reforms — though superficially. By 2034, Saudi Arabia is also set to host the FIFA World Cup, positioning itself as a nation blending innovation with tradition and tourism with business. Modernization’s challenges arise both domestically and internationally. A prime example is the May swimwear show during the Red Sea Fashion Week at the luxury St. Regis Hotel on the Saudi island of Ummahat. Contrary to expectations, models wore one-piece swimsuits and bikinis, marking a historic moment. Fashion designer Yasmina Qanzal, who showcased swimwear at the event, told AFP, 'It's true that this country is very conservative but we tried to show elegant swimsuits which represent the Arab world,' Despite this progress, Saudi women still don’t dress this way, even at the beach. The show sparked a divide: some celebrated it as a recognition of women’s rights and a move toward the kingdom’s aspirations, while others saw it as provocative and offensive to Islamic law, particularly in a devout country that hosts millions of pilgrims annually. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saudi human rights activist Lina al-Hathloul argued that the May swimwear show was aimed at improving the kingdom’s international image but didn’t necessarily reflect genuine change in civil rights, personal freedoms or attitudes toward women. '3 weeks after Saudi authorities sentenced Manahel to 11 years in prison for her choice of clothing, some of the #WWE’s top female talent were pictured posing in revealing swimsuits on the kingdom’s Red Sea coast. MBS’s Saudi Arabia in a nutshell,' she wrote on her X account. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sksqve341e	2024-12-15T09:24:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/rkejIadBE1e/rkejIadBE1e_511_97_2105_1185_0_small.jpg
Lebanon army deploys to the south of the country, searches for He...	Troops scanning areas near the Litani and Saluki rivers as implementation of the cease-fire deal progresses at a slow pace; U.S.-led international monitoring commission also begins work although it is still in early stages The Lebanese army began deploying to the south of the country, nearly three weeks after the cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah came into effect. IDF troops were still operating in the areas close to the border and planned to remain there until their scheduled withdrawal four weeks away. The Lebanese military that entered the region and according to the IDF, were launching their own operations to find Hezbollah weapons including rockets and launchers near the Litani and Saluki rivers. The U.S.-led international commission assembled to monitor the situation on the ground has also began its work, but it is in the early stages. 'UNIFIL is also still here and we are exercising our right to attack against any violation of the cease-fire,' the military said. The IDF did not operate in most of Hezbollah's villages in South Lebanon, despite eliminating much of its leadership and destroying more than two-thirds of its fire power and its anti-aircraft systems. Hezbollah's ability to rearm has also been disrupted after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria.

Israeli actions in Syria were intended to 'thwart the potential threats from Syria and to prevent the takeover of terrorist elements near our border,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1mhbq2v1x	2024-12-15T08:29:06-08:00

Cabinet convenes to discussions West Bank, hostage deal	Jerusalem is concerned terror activity would spread into Israeli territory following a step up of operations by Palestinian security forces in the West Bank over the past week The Security Cabinet is set to convey on Sunday at the IDF Central Command to discuss the recent surge in terror incidents in the West Bank, and the potential hostage deal to release 100 hostages who have been held in Gaza by Hamas for 436 days. According to reports, the deal is expected to proceed in stages, beginning under the Biden administration and continuing under a potential future Trump administration. The initial phase would be humanitarian, involving the release of hostages in exchange for a seven-week ceasefire. A senior source noted that the talks currently focus on a humanitarian exchange of an unspecified number of hostages, including women, children, and elderly individuals, with both sides reserving the option to resume hostilities afterward. Over the past week, Palestinian security forces have intensified operations against terror groups in refugee camps across the West Bank. On Saturday, exchanges of gunfire erupted in Tulkarm between armed groups and Palestinian forces. Meanwhile, both Tulkarm and Jenin saw protests supporting terror organizations, accompanied by tire burnings and demonstrations against the Palestinian Authority's security actions. Israeli officials fear the growing unrest could destabilize the Palestinian Authority. The security establishment is closely monitoring the impact of these security measures on the ground. However, cabinet member Bezalel Smotrich has taken steps to counter efforts to maintain PA stability. Smotrich has repeatedly imposed sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials, withheld clearance funds, and threatened to cease financial and legal protections for Israeli banks facilitating transactions with Palestinian institutions. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although his latest move was blocked under U.S. pressure, Smotrich continues to advance settlement expansion policies. Notably, this month, he enforced building violations in Area B, a first in the Etzion Bloc's designated reserve under the Oslo Accords. Meanwhile, Adam Boehler, a former adviser to then-President Donald Trump on prisoner and hostage issues, is expected to visit Israel this week. While sources described the visit as private, Ynet has learned that Boehler will hold consultations on a potential hostage deal in Gaza. The Defense Ministry has also received a request to coordinate a meeting with him, possibly as early as Monday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyvp4unvkx	2024-12-15T07:48:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/BklASqSqGJe/BklASqSqGJe_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Turkey quick to establish facts on the ground in Syria, offers mi...	Ankara reopens Damascus embassy 15 years after it closed during civil war atrocities; Turkish defense minister says no signs of ISIS resurgence, wants U.S. troops out and their Kurdish coalition partners eliminated Turkish Defense Miniter Yasar Guler said on Sunday that his country stands ready to provide military training to the new Syria security forces, if asked – in what could be considered another sign of Ankara's ambition to become the new Damascus patron, under the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkey which borders Syria from the north has for the past 13 years of the Syrian civil war, backed the rebels fighting the Assad regime. But, in the past two years when it appeared that the Syrian leadership had the upper hand in the war, Turkey attempted to improve its relations with Damascus. Last month it seemed Turkey was behind the rebel offensive that ultimately brought the regime down. The possibility that the Jihadists of Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) would now repay the Turkish leader is cause for concern not only to the Kurds in northern Syria, Turkey's long-time enemies, but also Israel - which Erdogan has grown more belligerent toward since the Oct. 7 massacre. Signs that Turkey was quick to establish facts on the ground were apparent last week. On Thursday, The Turkish intelligence chief was the first foreign senior official to visit Damascus since the rebels took control of the country where he met with rebel leaders. On Saturday, Turkey reopened its embassy in Syria, nearly 15 years after it was closed in response to Assad's massacre of his opponents. 'In their first statement, the new administration that toppled Assad announced that it would respect all government institutions, the United Nations and other international organizations,' Guler told reporters in Ankara in comments authorized for publication on Sunday. 'We think that we need to see what the new administration will do and to give them a chance.' ' When asked whether Turkey was considering military cooperation with the new Syrian government, Guler said Ankara already had military cooperation and training agreements with many countries. '(Turkey) is ready to provide the necessary support if the new administration requests it,' he added. Turkey has a few hundred troops in northern Syria and had carried out four military operations there since 2016, against 'threats to Turkish security,' as Guler called it. He said his government may reevaluate Turkish military presence in Syria with the new leadership 'when conditions are ripe.' In his briefing to reporters the defense minister said Turkey's primary goal was and is to abolish the Kurdish YPG, which it claims is part of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization in Turkey and the U.S. YPG is one of the leading forces in the 'Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that now controls some of Syria's biggest oil fields. It is also a senior partner in the U.S. led coalition against ISIS, so its future would be a point of contention between Ankara and Washington. Guler said the PKK and the YPG in Syria would be eliminated, sooner or later and its members whom he claimed came from outside Syria would have to leave and those who are Syrians would be made to lay down their arms. The defense minister also claimed that despite warnings from the U.S., Turkey had not identified any resurgence of ISIS. Turkey has in the past told the U.S. that Ankara could deploy three commando brigades in Syria to fight Islamic State, and to run al-Hol, the detention camp for IS families, Guler said, adding that Washington had rejected both offers. 'Instead, they cooperated with the PKK/YPG terrorist organization under the banner of fighting DAESH. But you can't fight one terrorist organization with another terrorist organization.' Asked about the future involvement in Syria of Russia, a longstanding ally of Assad which last weekend granted him asylum, Guler said he saw no sign of a complete Russian withdrawal.

'I don't think the Russians are going to leave (Syria). They'll do everything they can to stay,' he said. On Sunday, a week after the fall of the Assad regime, most schools reopened. Foreign journalists who were at a Damascus boys high school said the students appeared happy and cheered when the principle raised the Free Syria flag In one classroom, a student pasted the new flag on a wall. 'I am optimistic and very happy,' said student Salah al-Din Diab. 'I used to walk in the street scared that I would get drafted to military service.

Coalition leaders debate controversial judicial reform and attorn...	Lawmakers deliberate dismissal of Baharav-Miara and revival of judicial reforms, facing resistance from Haredi leaders; FM Sa’ar urges caution, while Justice Minister Levin slams Supreme Court for rejecting compromise efforts Coalition leaders met Sunday to discuss a contentious bill to overhaul the judicial appointments committee and a proposal to dismiss Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, a polarizing figure among government officials. The push to revive the divisive legislation is spearheaded by Justice Minister Yariv Levin as part of long-standing tensions between the government and the Supreme Court, with critics from both sides accusing each other of eroding Israel's democracy. The meeting, which ended without decisions, saw hardline National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir raising the issue of Baharav-Miara's dismissal. Ultra-Orthodox parties, however, made clear they would not support any initiatives, including judicial reforms, until a draft exemption law for yeshiva students is passed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is barred from direct involvement in judicial matters due to a conflict of interest stemming from his ongoing corruption trial, emphasized coalition stability, saying, 'We must pass the budget and project stability, even if disagreements remain.' Ben-Gvir argued for initiating the process to dismiss Baharav-Miara, claiming she obstructs government operations. Levin outlined the formal steps required, including presenting the issue to the Cabinet, involving a special review committee, and returning the matter to the Cabinet for a final decision. Coalition leaders expressed no overt opposition to the proposal, though progress remains uncertain. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Baharav-Miara has faced criticism for opposing government decisions and refusing to defend controversial policies in court. Critics accuse her of aligning with judicial overreach, while supporters see her as a vital check on executive power. Levin also addressed his escalating confrontation with the Supreme Court, which recently blocked his refusal to convene the judicial appointments committee. 'They rejected every compromise we proposed,' Levin said, describing the court’s orders as 'outrageous.' Coalition whip MK Ofir Katz added, 'The judges threw every compromise out the window—it seems they want to crush us.' Some coalition leaders, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Shas Party head Aryeh Deri, expressed reservations about reintroducing the 2023 judicial reform proposal, warning it could deepen public tensions. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, while supporting measured reforms, cautioned against further polarization and urged responsibility given Israel’s significant security and diplomatic challenges. The push to dismiss Baharav-Miara requires complex steps, including reconstituting the Grunis Committee, gathering complaints from ministers about her performance and holding hearings. These actions, if pursued, would likely face scrutiny from the Supreme Court, adding another layer of tension. Senior coalition figures suggested Levin would proceed with Baharav-Miara’s dismissal only if there is a majority consensus among coalition leaders. Levin has hesitated to act unilaterally, fearing accusations of implementing a 'judicial overhaul on steroids.' Instead, Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi has been circulating a public petition to gauge support for the move. Meanwhile, Religious Zionist Party Minister Orit Strock, a member of the judicial appointments committee, proposed direct negotiations between Levin and Supreme Court Deputy Chief Justice Yitzhak Amit to resolve the standoff. In a letter to committee members, Strock emphasized the importance of returning to consensus-based decision-making, noting that under previous agreements, the committee had appointed 162 judges in less than a year. 'Recent Supreme Court rulings have derailed the committee from its cooperative path to one of confrontation,' she wrote. 'We can return to fair compromises on appointments, including for the president and deputy president of the Supreme Court, new justices and other key positions.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjm4asnn1e	2024-12-15T04:33:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/04/S1OBF87Ah/S1OBF87Ah_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israel closes embassy in Ireland, citing hostility; opens new emb...	Sa’ar announces unprecedented move, citing Dublin's 'extreme anti-Israel policies'; 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its treatment of Israel,' he says as Israel pivots toward friendly countries In an unprecedented move, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar announced on Sunday the closure of Israel’s embassy in Dublin, citing Ireland’s 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' The decision follows escalating tensions, including Ireland’s recent decision to join South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing the state of genocide. 'Ireland’s actions and rhetoric are rooted in delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, accompanied by blatant double standards,' Sa’ar said. 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its treatment of Israel. We will redirect our resources toward strengthening ties with nations that respect Israel.' Tensions between Israel and Ireland have been simmering for years. In May 2024, Ireland unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state, prompting Israel to recall its ambassador to Dublin, Dana Erlich, for consultations. Calls for Erlich’s expulsion in Ireland intensified after Hamas’ October 7 massacre, and last week, Dublin formally joined the ICJ case against Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Erlich, a highly regarded diplomat, has continued to manage Israel-Ireland relations from abroad, first from London and later from the ambassador’s residence in Madrid. According to Foreign Ministry sources, this arrangement was necessary after the Finance Ministry refused to fund returned ambassadors’ salaries. Despite the challenging circumstances, Erlich has been praised for her steadfast defense of Israel in one of Europe’s most hostile environments. The diplomatic rift deepened further in October when Irish UNIFIL troops in Lebanon refused Israel’s demand to relocate five kilometers northward. Ireland’s President Michael Higgins strongly criticized the Israeli request, calling it 'outrageous,' escalating a war of words between Dublin and Jerusalem. While announcing the Dublin embassy closure, Sa’ar revealed plans to open a new embassy in Moldova. 'The relationship between Israel and Moldova is friendly, and both nations seek to deepen ties. Moldova already has an embassy in Israel, and it is time for Israel to reciprocate,' Sa’ar said. He emphasized that Israel’s diplomatic network would be adjusted to prioritize nations willing to strengthen ties with the Jewish state. The move reflects a broader policy shift in Israel’s foreign strategy, focusing resources on countries with a more cooperative stance toward Jerusalem while reducing engagement with adversarial nations. Ireland’s relationship with Israel has long been fraught. In September, President Higgins accused Israel’s Dublin embassy of leaking his congratulatory message to Iran’s president, a claim dismissed by Israeli officials who pointed out that Iran’s embassy had publicly posted the message on social media. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkflmlh4yx	2024-12-15T04:12:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/29/ryVuP3ozp/ryVuP3ozp_77_76_1045_589_0_small.jpg

Nova festival massacre survivors welcome firsborn	Maia and Oshri Bouganim escaped Hamas attack and married just days later; after a little over a year, they are celebrating the birth of their first son; ‘The baby we've been blessed with is nothing less than a great miracle’ A little over a year after surviving the Nova music festival massacre, Maia and Oshri Bouganim welcomed their first child, Ariel, into the world. 'Holding Ariel in my arms is nothing short of a miracle for me. I never imagined we'd reach this joyful moment from where we were a year ago,' said Maia Bouganim, 27, from Afula, who works at a local law firm. 'Just a year ago, we were fighting for our lives, surviving the worst massacre in Israel's history. Today we've had the privilege of holding a brit milah (circumcision) ceremony for our firstborn,' added Oshri Bouganim, 28. Maia and Oshri met in Afula six years ago. The day before October 7, they excitedly arrived at the Nova music festival, scheduled just five days before their wedding date. 'The event turned into the greatest tragedy in the history of our country,' Oshri recounted. 'We fled the festival site at 7 a.m. and ran for over six hours until we found shelter in Moshav Patish. We didn’t separate for a moment when we fled because we felt we couldn't split up. I believe this was a testament to the strong bond we share,' he added. Despite the disaster, the couple kept their original wedding date, marrying in a small ceremony with their family at a synagogue in Afula only five days after the tragic attack.

1.6 million views on YouTube: Iranian singer arrested after perfo...	Parastoo Ahmadi, 27, defies Iran’s ban on women singing solo before men in viral live performance, sparking global headlines; security forces raid her home, arresting her and two band members for challenging Iran’s modesty laws Iranian authorities arrested singer Parastoo Ahmadi over the weekend after she made international headlines for performing in an online YouTube concert with her hair uncovered—violating the Islamic Republic’s modesty laws, which require women to cover their heads. The 27-year-old singer’s bare-headed performance, intentionally staged to defy the regime’s laws, has garnered over 1.6 million views on YouTube. Milad Panahipour, Ahmadi’s lawyer, confirmed that she was arrested on Saturday in Sari, the capital of Mazandaran province in northern Iran. Her arrest followed the Iranian prosecution’s decision to launch an investigation against her on Thursday. 'Unfortunately, we do not know the charges brought against Ms. Ahmadi, who arrested her, or where she is being held, but we will pursue the matter through legal channels,' Panahipour said. Opposition news site Iran International reported Sunday that Ahmadi was released that morning, but no official confirmation has been made. The uproar surrounding Ahmadi began on Wednesday when she livestreamed a YouTube performance wearing a long black dress with her arms and neck exposed, and no hijab. She was accompanied by four male musicians. In a post sharing the concert link the day before, Ahmadi wrote: 'I am Parastoo, a girl who wants to sing for the people she loves. This is a privilege I cannot ignore—to sing for the country I love so much.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following the performance, security forces raided Ahmadi’s home, and she was summoned to the prosecutor’s office for questioning. Iranian authorities announced plans to put her on trial. Two members of her band, Soheil Faghih Nasiri and Ehsan Beiraghdar, were also arrested on Saturday in Tehran. Ahmadi's appearance on YouTube: Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, restrictions on female performers have been a point of contention in Iran. Initially, women were completely banned from singing, though the restrictions were later loosened to allow performances in certain conditions. Currently, women may only sing as part of a choir in mixed-gender audiences or perform solo in front of all-female audiences. Performing without a hijab in front of unrelated men is strictly prohibited under Iran’s Sharia-based laws. Ahmadi’s arrest comes two years after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who died in custody after being arrested by Tehran’s morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Amini’s death sparked nationwide protests against the regime’s dress code and broader restrictions, with the slogan 'Women, Life, Freedom' becoming a rallying cry. Ahmadi previously performed a song titled From the Blood of the Youth of Your Country in support of the movement. Although Iranian authorities initially eased the enforcement of hijab laws following the protests, the past few months have seen a renewed crackdown. Ahmadi’s defiance has drawn praise on social media, with many users hailing her as a symbol of resistance. Political activist Hossein Ronaghi posted on X (formerly Twitter): 'Our message is clear—we will stand up to any form of hostility against women and oppression of the people. Parastoo Ahmadi and the musicians are the voice of the nation and must be freed.' In contrast, a regime-affiliated Iranian newspaper labeled the performance as a 'cultural provocation and an incitement of public opinion.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syjwd7n4je	2024-12-15T03:11:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/rJeUp8fh4Jl/rJeUp8fh4Jl_1_0_781_440_0_small.jpg

Their loved ones are free, but the fight for hostages continues	Even after their loved ones returned to Israel, many relatives of hostages remain steadfast in their efforts to secure release of those left behind; ‘It’s not over for anyone’ The late Yagev Buchshtab, brother of Nofar Buchshtab, was kidnapped on October 7 from his home in Kibbutz Nirim with his wife, Rimon. Rimon returned in the hostage deal, while Yagev survived in captivity for many months until he was murdered. 'I think that something about how it ended for us brings with it, beyond pain, loss and bereavement, also a sense of missing out,' says Nofar. 'We could have brought him home and we failed as a family and as a country. So I continue the fight because I don't want to see more families in my situation, more hostages ending their lives like Yagev and others.' Nofar Buchshtab, 30, is one of many family members of hostages who continue the struggle, even though their loved ones have returned home or were murdered in captivity. 'We went into this struggle with 251 families, and this is how we will end it,' she says. 'When Yagev was alive we thought about what would happen if others returned before him. I knew I would want them to continue the struggle with me, and I had no doubt that I would too.' 'Fighting for values' Some 251 Israelis were kidnapped on October 7. One hundred are still in captivity and 151 returned in deals and military rescues, some alive and some deceased. And yet, even the family members whose loved ones returned to Israel for burial are not taking their feet off the gas. 'I fought shoulder to shoulder with the families of the hostages,' explains Chen Avigdori, 54, who was able to hug his wife and daughter after they were returned in the deal. 'I can't look them in the eye and say, 'Mine was released, thank you very much.' I call everyone in the families of the hostages my brothers and sister.' 'Obviously, I have a kind of feeling of guilt, but I also know that the way my story ends gives hope. Beyond that, in my opinion, this is the most important public struggle in the history of the country. We are fighting for the values ​​that we were raised on,' he adds. 'There was no hesitation in continuing to fight,' says Inbar Goldstein, 36, who fought for 51 days for her sister-in-law Chen Almog Goldstein and her niece and nephews, Gal, Tal and Agam. Inbar's brother, Nadav, was murdered with his oldest daughter, Yam. Even today, Inbar continues to fight for the other hostages who are still in captivity. 'It's not over for anyone. There's something unfair about it. What, will I leave them alone? My family is most important to me, but politically it's no more important than anyone else. In the end, we're all one family,' she says. But there are a few that are especially important to her. 'I only got to know the Angerst family, the family of Matan, who is in captivity, after my own family returned. Before that, I wasn't focused on getting to know people around me. There was some mistake in the information that they received and they contacted me to find out something and it went deep into my heart. There's something noble, quiet, determined and sharp about them. They are people with kind eyes and I simply love them. It's a shared destiny that a stranger wouldn't understand,' she explains. There is no jealousy, there is a smile Nofar Buchshtab is among a group of young advocates from hostage families, including Mor Korngold, the brother of Tal Shoham. Like Nofar until recently, Korngold is a younger sibling now fighting tirelessly for the release of his older brother. 'I would very much like to be in Mor's place,' says Nofar sadly, 'but mostly I want their story to be better. I imagine the moment when Tal returns and I don't feel jealous, I smile. Sometimes I say to myself, wait, maybe I don't belong anymore? Maybe I have nothing to do with this action, or this meeting, but the voices from the families are the opposite: 'We need you to continue with us, you have a place with us.' It's scary to be left alone.' 'There's a lot of talk in the war about survivor's guilt,' says Inbar Goldstein. 'When we were just starting out, and they were still in Gaza, a lot of people felt survivor's guilt. Then my family came back, and I discovered what survivor's guilt is, the guilt of those who returned, of returning alive. That's also one of the reasons why no one leaves this struggle even after their story is over.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The reports of a possible deal are also affecting them. 'We are once again in the yes/no hostage release deal talk that is driving the mind crazy,' Goldstein continues, 'and it is clear to us that here too the struggle will not end. Earlier this week I met Yifat, the mother of the late Inbar Heyman. I promised her that no one is giving up on Inbar, that I will not give up. Giving up on them is giving up on us, and I am not willing to give up. Even families like mine, whose story is 'closed', who could have said a year ago: 'Thank you very much, goodbye'; we are not going anywhere.' 'The struggle now and before is no different, the goal is the same goal,' concludes Chen Avigdori. 'The messages are the same messages, and I may no longer be anxious for my loved ones, but I am anxious for Liri and Tal Shoham and Omer Wenkert and Omer Shem Tov as I am anxious for my child. This is the struggle and I will continue to be a part of it until the last captive.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bk9xez2vkg	2024-12-15T02:41:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/B1y3HBi4Jx/B1y3HBi4Jx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Facing soldier shortages, worn-out bulldozers and delayed US delivery of D9s, military employs civilians for high-risk missions: leveling buildings in Gaza, building embankments in Syria and clearing thickets in Lebanon; Here's how the system works 'Combat engineering, combat engineering and more combat engineering of all kinds. If we could double the Combat Engineering Corps, not just Yahalom, we’d have done it by now,' a senior IDF officer told Ynet, highlighting the growing demand for engineering capabilities amid prolonged fighting across multiple arenas. To address these challenges, the IDF plans to establish an additional regular combat engineering battalion in the coming months, adding to the existing three. However, this move is only a partial solution. Ynet has learned that, in recent months, the IDF has increasingly relied on civilian contractors for operational missions in combat zones, under the command of IDF officers. Initially limited in scope, this practice has grown significantly. Civilian contractors, using large orange bulldozers, have been deployed to level hundreds of buildings in the Netzarim Corridor in northern Gaza, drill for Hamas tunnels in areas like the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza and clear space for safer IDF operations. The Philadelphi Corridor itself has been expanded to a width of 3-4 kilometers, providing a buffer for IDF forces. This trend has extended beyond Gaza. In Lebanon, contractors have crossed the border to clear vast thickets where Hezbollah has hidden military infrastructure, including observation posts, underground firing ranges and bunkers. Since the collapse of the Assad regime, contractors in bright yellow vests have also been active along the Syrian border, working on five major sites. Their tasks include blasting basalt cliffs, digging deep trenches and building embankments to secure the border with a disintegrating Syria teeming with armed militias While the IDF has historically employed civilian contractors for border fortifications during peacetime, their current use in active combat zones and beyond Israeli territory marks a significant shift, reflecting the demands of ongoing multi-front operations. The urgent needs of the IDF 'Hundreds of IDF bulldozers and tractors were worn out during the operation in the Gaza Strip, including D9 bulldozers, so the need arose to lease or mobilize equipment from civilians. Later, we realized that we would also need operators and contractors due to the enormous number of engineering missions, and not just in the Gaza arena,' according to the IDF. 'The use of civilian contractors creates flexibility: The heavy mechanical equipment companies in the engineering battalions operate in the most advanced and dangerous missions on the attack lines, for example now in Jabaliya or alongside tanks on the most advanced lines of the operation in the Syrian Golan, and behind them, in 'safer' missions, the contractors are deployed after we take operational control of the area. Hundreds of our engineering soldiers were injured and killed throughout the long fighting, this is not an infinite resource. That is why we turned to civilian contractors through regular procedures carried out by the Defense Ministry.' 'We are briefed by the officers before each work day and are warned about how to behave in the event of an operational incident. It is clear that this is dangerous work' Compounding the IDF's shortage of engineering personnel is the delay of a shipment of 132 D9 bulldozers ordered from the U.S. months ago. The delivery has been stalled due to a silent embargo by the U.S. State Department, as reported by Ynet and its sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth last month. 'Workday' in the Gaza Strip This is how the method works: The IDF defines a specific, time-bound task, for example, the demolition of 20 buildings in a Gaza neighborhood in which the forces have finished fighting; a request is issued for a civilian contractor who shows up with his workers and large equipment to operate in daylight, under the protection of soldiers and the supervision of IDF engineering units. In the evening, the civilian workers leave the area, and return the next day to continue the work. 'We are looking for operators of excavators and bulldozers and we don't stop on Saturdays, and it's usually for two months, five days a week, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sometimes we also destroy terrorist infrastructure for the army that they take out, such as lathes, factories, etc.,' one of the labor managers described to Ynet, noting several types of payment. 'A private individual who has an excavator and brings it with him receives the highest payment, it's the best money; an operator under a company is paid hourly, also respectably, well above minimum wage; and someone who served in the IDF and wants to do so as a reservist enjoys all the grants and benefits for reserve personnel.' 'It's obviously a dangerous job' Some civilian engineering missions in Gaza have reached the front lines, with battalion commanders deploying teams to demolish buildings used to fire on IDF forces. In several recent cases, contractors were spotted working without protective gear such as helmets, overalls or uniforms. One of them described that 'even if they ask us to protect ourselves, it is not comfortable to drill or dig under the sun for hours with a helmet on. We are briefed by the officers before each workday and are warned about how to behave in the event of an operational incident. It is clear that this is dangerous work.'

His family continues to fight for his recognition as an IDF casualty. Their struggle gained renewed attention after the IDF recently recognized historian Ze’ev 'Jabo' Erlich as a casualty, despite his status as a civilian accompanying Golani Brigade forces in Lebanon, where he was killed in a clash with Hezbollah terrorists. Addressing the growing use of civilian contractors in combat zones, the IDF said: 'The contractors understand the risks and sign off on them. We provide them with protection, but this isn’t construction work in Netanya. They only operate during the day, as they aren’t trained to work with IDF commandos at night. They give us breathing space and bring engineering expertise, like drilling, that is nearly nonexistent in the IDF.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1x00vw3vjx	2024-12-15T00:19:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/HJxFKAln4kg/HJxFKAln4kg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Significant progress in hostage talks; majority in government su...	Senior official says agreement will not include release of all hostages, leaving room for both sides to return to fighting; while majority of Cabinet backs deal, concerns linger Hamas could still derail it There is 'significant progress' in talks on a hostage deal that would bring many of them home from Gaza, the main points of which are currently being kept under the radar in order to prevent political interference that would thwart it, a senior Israeli official told Ynet Saturday night. 'The head of the Mossad and the head of the Shin Bet reported to the cabinet that Hamas is showing a willingness to reach a deal that has not existed before,' the senior Israeli official explained, 'and the assessment is that an agreement can be reached within a few weeks.' This runs contrary to Arab reports of major difficulties in the negotiations. The senior official claimed that what caused the change in the terrorist organization's position was 'the blows they suffered' and the fact that Donald Trump will enter the White House in about a month. In the past, such events - and identical interpretations attached to them by political and security elements in Israel - have come to nothing. The deal is reportedly expected to be implemented in phases, starting with the Biden administration and continuing into the Trump administration. The first phase will be humanitarian and will include the release of hostages in exchange for a seven-week cease-fire. The official explained that the parties currently are talking about a humanitarian deal for 'an unknown number of kidnapped women, children and adults, in which each side reserves the option to return to fighting.' On Saturday, several of the families of hostages being held in Gaza protested this, claiming that such a 'partial deal' would mean a death sentence for those who would be left behind. Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, even claimed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lied to her in their conversation last week, and that after speaking with members of the negotiation team, she realized that 'he has no intention of returning Matan, but only a few hostages.' Such a deal could pave the way for both a deal that would end the war and a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. However, at this stage, it is not yet clear whether Hamas will agree to a limited deal without ending the war, and there are several conflicting reports about it. On the one hand, there are reports of Hamas' flexibility and readiness for a limited IDF presence in Gaza, and on the other hand, there are reports that Israel has agreed to a temporary withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor, but these have not been confirmed. In Israel, they estimated last week that a deal could be reached within two weeks. According to the senior official: 'If Netanyahu brings a reasonable deal, he will have a majority in the government and the cabinet, even if (Public Security Minister Itamar) Ben-Gvir and (Finance Minister Bezalel) Smotrich oppose it and it is doubtful that they will support it. The right has many achievements, and this will make it possible to pass a deal. The problem is that this is Hamas, and we were at a similar point in the past, and in the end they torpedoed it then. That's why it's not over until it's over.' Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's adviser on hostages and missing persons, Adam Boehler, 45, is expected to visit Israel this week. A source familiar with the details of the visit said that it was a private visit by Boehler, who is Jewish, to Israel, but Ynet learned that he will also hold meetings and consultations regarding the hostage deal in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, the Defense Minister's office has received a request to coordinate a meeting with Boehler, which will likely take place as early as Monday. Opportunities in Lebanon and Syria The Israeli official also referred to Israel's take over of the buffer zone on the Syrian border, explaining that Israel 'will remain in the areas it has captured until the rebels stabilize the country.' He said that 'it does not appear that the rebels have any interest in entering into a conflict with Israel, but in the coming weeks and months we will see how they stabilize Syria. This is something big that holds a positive opportunity.' On Saturday, rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, addressed Israel for the first time, saying that they were not seeking conflict - and also claimed that Israel no longer had a reason to interfere in what was happening in Syria. Shortly afterward, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said that the IDF had no intention of intervening in Syria except to protect the border from extremist rebels. In the meantime, Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem admitted that his organization had 'lost its supply route from Syria,' and at the same time called on the rebels 'to see Israel as an enemy and not to normalize relations with it.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In this context, the Israeli official also referred to Lebanon, saying that 'the cease-fire is holding, and Hezbollah is left without a supply of weapons. Here too, there is an opportunity for Lebanon to regain control of the country.' Qassem also noted in his speech that one of Hezbollah's goals is to 'strengthen the Lebanese army,' but this is a smokescreen: in reality, the West sees the local army as an alternative to the military power of the terrorist organization, which has grown in recent years to enormous proportions that terrorized the towns and cities of the north for most of the months of the war. Now, the intention is to work to push Hezbollah further away from the Litani River, as far as possible from the border with Israel, so that the only armed forces in the border area will be the Lebanese security forces. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk4evehvjl	2024-12-14T22:42:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/rJVm90OQyx/rJVm90OQyx_0_107_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF officers hold first talks with Syrian leaders in Golan	As Syrian Golan Druze call for annexation to Israel, IDF officers meet openly with Syrian village elders, assuring them their daily lives would continue undisturbed; officer says asked village leader to collect weapons taken from abandoned Syrian outposts In recent days, Israeli military officers have held their first meetings with leaders of Syrian villages captured in the Golan Heights following the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime last week. The officers met openly with village elders in their homes to reassure them that no harm would come to residents and that their daily lives would continue undisturbed. Capt. Omer, a company commander from the 77th Battalion of the 7th Armored Brigade, reached the deepest point of the IDF’s advance in Syria so far, the village of Umm Batnah, located approximately 12 kilometers (8 miles) from the border. 'I asked the village elder to collect weapons from residents after they had taken rifles from abandoned Syrian military outposts,' the officer said. According to the IDF, the residents have complied, and no unusual incidents have been reported. The IDF is currently operating in seven villages in the Syrian Golan, some beyond Quneitra. Over the weekend, troops reportedly reached abandoned Assad regime military outposts near the town of Khan Arnabah. The IDF intends to remain in the area until the territory can be handed over to an 'established and defined state entity' to prevent terrorist groups from seizing control. In videos circulated online over the weekend, Druze residents in the village of Hader, near the Israeli border in southern Syria, were heard calling on Israel to annex them. 'What is our fate?' one speaker asked, prompting the crowd to respond, 'Israel.' The speaker continued, 'On behalf of everyone in Hader, if we must choose, we choose the lesser evil. We want to be annexed to the Israeli Golan to preserve our dignity. This applies to all villages in the area because the fate of Hader is the fate of the entire region. We ask to join our people in the Golan and live in freedom and dignity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ahmad al-Sharaa, the Syrian rebel leader formerly known by his call sign Abu Mohammed al-Golani, addressed Israel for the first time on Saturday, rejecting the country's involvement in Syria. Speaking in a televised statement in the wake of Israel’s series of strikes on Syrian territory and its occupation of the buffer zone near the Golan Heights, Sharaa said, 'Syria needs laws and state institutions. We have a plan to address all the crises, and we are gathering information. We are not entering into conflict with Israel.' Sharaa claimed Israel has no justification for involvement in Syria following the departure of Iranian forces. 'What happened is a victory over the Iranian plan, which threatened the entire region,' he said. Sharaa also suggested his faction could have targeted Russian bases in Syria but opted instead to 'build good relations.' Despite his criticism of the Iranian regime, Sharaa emphasized, 'We have entered our cities—not Tehran. We have no issue with the Iranian people.' Shortly later, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi dismissed Sharaa’s claims that Israel has no justification for its involvement in Syria, saying that the IDF's actions along the border are solely to ensure Israel's security. Halevi, speaking during a situational assessment on the Golan Heights with senior military officials, said, 'We are not interfering in what is happening inside Syria, nor do we intend to govern it. However, we are unequivocally involved in ensuring the security of Israeli citizens living in communities behind us in the Golan Heights. This is something we are handling with professionalism, determination and precision. 'Syria was once an enemy state; its army has collapsed, and there is a real threat that terrorist elements will try to establish themselves near our border. We have acted decisively to prevent extremist groups from settling right next to us.' Halevi also praised the IDF’s preparations along the border, which stretch from Mount Hermon to the Israel-Syria-Jordan tri-border area. 'The readiness here is solid and effective,' he said, urging commanders to continue adapting to emerging threats. 'Make the necessary changes—you have all the IDF resources and an excellent force at your disposal.' Meanwhile, Syria’s interim government called on the UN Security Council to take action to compel Israel to immediately stop its attacks on Syrian territory and withdraw from areas it has penetrated in the north 'in violation of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1tynx24yl	2024-12-14T22:13:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/15/yk14186610/yk14186610_0_111_817_460_0_small.jpg

Iran is at the 'most precarious moment in its modern history'	Islamic Republic has gone from being able to produce two new ballistic missiles a day to one a week, but may rush to produce nuclear weapons to fill the gap, senior Washington Post columnist reports; Looming confrontation between Israel and Iran is 'most urgent and dangerous' 'Iran appears to be at the most precarious moment in its modern history,' Washington Post senior columnist David Ignatius wrote late Saturday. In his latest column, in which he interviewed, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who is currently in the United States, Ignatius exposed the Israeli moves that damaged Tehran's strategic assets, which, along with the collapse of the Assad regime, has brought it to unprecedented weakness. According to Ignatius, Iran's 'proxy armies have been crushed in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. And it appears to be nearly naked to attack after a wave of pinpoint Israeli airstrikes on its air defense system in October.' Gallant told Ignatius that 'we showed that Iran is vulnerable,' and that the Israeli strikes on October 26 created 'a window to act against Iran' before it produces a nuclear weapon. Ignatius wrote that U.S. decisions on how to exploit Iran's weakness - whether in negotiations for a nuclear agreement or in decisive military action - will be made by the next president, Donald Trump. He, for his part, told Time magazine that 'anything can happen.' According to Ignatius, senior Biden administration officials are now seeing an opportunity for 'coercive diplomacy' on the nuclear issue, with a weakened Iran. He noted that while Israel 'played the decisive role in humbling Iran,' President Joe Biden has provided an important deterrent to it by deploying aircraft carriers, submarines and other U.S. military forces throughout the Middle East. The aim of the attack on October 26 was to leave Iran defenseless against a future attack on its territory; Some 120 fighter jets participated in the raid, Ignatius reported, citing an Israeli military source, striking air defense radars and antiaircraft batteries that protect Tehran, as well as important factories for producing fuel for Iranian ballistic missiles. Although the attack was carried out in retaliation for the Iranian attack on October 1 , the planning began many months before that, Ignatius wrote. Gallant told Ignatius that the mission, in simple terms, was to ensure that after the attacks 'Iran is weaker and Israel is stronger,' so that Tehran will not be able to respond with force to future attacks. According to Ignatius, Israeli sources believe that in the next two years Iran will not be able to add a significant number of ballistic missiles to its arsenal, which remains large, and in the meantime its air defense has also been significantly damaged. 'Israel appears to have created a corridor into Iran, providing a clear path for its aircraft to strike Tehran,' he wrote. 'This is a new level of operational freedom, allowing Israel to attack targets in Iran nearly as easily as it did in Gaza and Lebanon.' The former defense minister also referred to Israel's first attack on Iran, on April 15 , when the war cabinet chose to respond in a limited manner with a targeted strike on a Russian-made S-300 battery near Isfahan, in order to send a message that would deter Tehran. 'We hit them precisely, but it wasn't enough to deter them,' Gallant said. In the October attack, Israeli planes had already hit four such batteries around Tehran, even though their radars are supposed - in theory - to detect attacks from a distance of about 300 kilometers. Gallant emphasized that currently 'there is no strategic defense around Tehran.' Along with this, key components of Iran's ballistic missile production capabilities were also reportedly damaged. The fighter jets hit all the mixers that produce solid fuel for these missiles, and the acquisition of new facilities 'may take at least a year' - according to the Institute for the Study of War. Thus, the IDF strikes have halted, at least temporarily, the progress of Iran's ballistic missile program. An Israeli military source estimated to Ignatius that, before the October attack, Iran was able to produce enough solid fuel for two new ballistic missiles a day, and now its output is limited to one missile a week. This shortage, he said, will last for at least a year. But Ignatius notes that, paradoxically, Iran's vulnerability could drive it to acquire a nuclear arsenal to deter its adversaries. Iran has enough fuel for a bomb, but estimates suggest it is many months away from being able to build a warhead that could be mounted on a long-range ballistic missile. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Now, if 'coercive diplomacy' cannot prevent Iran from moving forward with its nuclear program, Israel and the United States may consider military action. Iran's nuclear facilities are buried deep in the ground, and estimates are that only the U.S. military has conventional weapons large enough to breach these bunkers. However, Gallant emphasized to Ignatius that although he hopes the U.S. and Israel will work together, 'Israel has the means to strike Iranian assets in a precise, forceful and sophisticated manner. If needed, we will not hesitate to act.' Ignatius concluded by calling the 'looming standoff between Israel and Iran' as Trump's 'most urgent and dangerous' challenge. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syy6ukhvye	2024-12-14T21:07:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/26/HkulpRKgJx/HkulpRKgJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Ukraine to set up mechanism to supply food to Syria, Zelensky say...	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he had instructed his government to set up supply mechanisms to deliver together with international organizations and partners food to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of President Bashar Assad. Ukraine has been one of the world's top grain and oilseeds exporters, and has been exporting wheat and corn to Middle Eastern countries, but not to Syria. Syria imported food from Russia during the Assad era, but Russian wheat supplies have been suspended amid the uncertainty and payment delays, Russian and Syrian sources said on Friday. 'We are ready to assist Syria in preventing a food crisis, particularly through the humanitarian program 'Grain from Ukraine,'' Zelensky wrote on X. 'I have instructed the government to establish food supply mechanisms in cooperation with international organizations and partners who can help.' Ukraine's exports were buffeted by Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, which severely reduced shipments via the Black Sea.

Sister demands release of Israeli-Russian researcher kidnapped in...	Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov has been held by a Shiite militia since March 2023; her US-based sister, leading the fight for her release, shares about her frustration with US tax dollars going to her sisters' kidnappers, the hierarchy vs. Gaza hostages, hopes for Trump and years without sleep The pain of Emma Tsurkov, 36, sharpens at one recurring moment each month: when she receives her paycheck as a research director for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in California. The numbers representing her income and deductions stir an unbearable thought—that her American taxes, deducted from her salary, might indirectly reach the kidnappers in Iraq who are holding her older sister, Elizabeth Tsurkov. 'Each time I see taxes deducted from my paycheck, or when we file our taxes in April, my blood boils,' she tells Ynet in an interview. 'I can’t help but feel that the taxes I pay here are sent to the Iraqi government, which then uses them to pay the salaries of terrorists—terrorists who killed American soldiers and are now holding a Princeton graduate student hostage. And they just get away with it.' Elizabeth, 38, a dual Israeli-Russian citizen, was kidnapped in March 2023 in Baghdad by the Shiite militia Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-linked group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and other Western countries. Despite this designation, the militia is part of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a coalition of militias funded and supported by the Iraqi government. Tsurkov, a researcher and Middle East expert, entered Iraq on her own initiative using her Russian passport to conduct academic research as part of her doctoral studies at Princeton University. In November, her captors released a video of her, but no official information about her condition or whereabouts has surfaced since. Officials in contact with the family have confirmed that she is alive and being held in Iraq. However, the kidnappers have never issued any official demands for her release. 'People hear 'Kataib Hezbollah' and envision some insular terrorist group hiding somewhere in the mountains, but that’s not the case at all. They’re actually part of the Iraqi Security Forces. Many members of Kataib Hezbollah are Iraqi government employees. They’re on the payroll, getting money and arms from the Iraqi government. The Iraqi government, in turn, gets hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance every year from the U.S. government. So the taxes I pay living in California—which I pay plenty—are used to pay the salaries of the people holding my sister. And it’s just maddening. We’re suckers. We hand over this money and demand no accountability, which is absurd to me, and it just really frustrates me to no end.' 'I don’t need any fancy meetings—I just need my sister' Last April, this frustration drove Emma to sneak into an event in Washington where Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani was speaking. Facing the cameras, she confronted him: 'You should be ashamed of yourself... your government is funding these terrorists!' Even now, she has no regrets. 'It was a very genuine display of frustration—just pure, unfiltered frustration—knowing that my sister is stuck in some hole in Iraq, being held by terrorists funded with American money and the taxes we all pay. And the fact that the Iraqi prime minister gets to just waltz around D.C., enjoy the tulips, eat macarons, and be treated with a red carpet as if nothing is wrong, as if he’s just a legitimate leader and not the coalition partner of a bunch of terrorist militias—which is exactly what he is, make no mistake about it. 'The Iraqi Prime Minister kept making this lip service, saying, 'Oh yeah, we’re very concerned about the fate of the Princeton student, and we’re determined to do everything we can to find out what happened to her,' which is nonsense. They’ve done nothing. Literally nothing. If the Iraqi prime minister wanted to, she could be home now. And the way I know this is because, in the past, when the same terror organization kidnapped an Iraqi person who was working for an American employer, the Iraqi prime minister picked up the phone, called Kataib Hezbollah, and told them to let him go. Within two weeks, he was home—no ransom or anything. 'The militia holding my sister has a political wing, similar to Hamas, with both a military and a political branch. The political wing of Kataib Hezbollah is part of the Iraqi parliament and actually part of the prime minister’s governing coalition. It’s insane to me that he gets away with pretending he doesn’t know anything or can’t do anything. He’s either blind or incompetent, and neither should inspire us to send another single dollar over there without my sister’s freedom being secured.' Your anger is directed at Iraq and the U.S., but Elizabeth isn’t an American citizen—she’s Israeli and Russian. Why aren’t your demands directed at Jerusalem and Moscow? 'The U.S. government is the party with the strongest ties and ability to influence the kidnappers, and therefore the greatest power to secure my sister's release. This is both because of her ties to the U.S.—she was kidnapped while conducting research funded by Princeton University—and because she is a New Jersey resident. 'The Israeli government doesn’t have a relationship with their government. There are no diplomatic ties between the countries, and this isn’t generally a space where Israel has much influence. However, the U.S. government has the reach—and, I think, the moral obligation—because it is terrorists who are holding my sister hostage. 'Even if she were an American Jew and not Israeli, she’d still be in this situation. Terror groups target Jews—not just Israelis. To them, it doesn’t matter. They see every Jew as a target. I don’t know what’s in their heads, but based on the fact that they kill Jews who aren’t Israeli, I have no reason to believe it would’ve made much difference. So really, this is about America. This is aimed at America. The U.S. is the one that’s responsible and should be accountable. So as far as I'm concerned, anything that doesn't bring my sister home is a distraction.' Although President Joe Biden reportedly raised the issue during his meeting with Iraq’s prime minister at the White House, Tsurkov herself has never spoken with him or been invited to the White House. 'I met with Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf, and I will say that everyone has been kind, showed a lot of empathy, and expressed how sorry they are for what my family and I are going through,' she continues. 'But there just hasn’t been a willingness to actually hold the Iraqi government accountable. What I want to see—while I do appreciate the kindness and empathy—is my sister back at the end of the day.' Is it a trigger for you to sit at home and watch President Biden’s meetings with the families of the American hostages in Gaza? 'That’s not what I’m asking for. Let me put it this way—I don’t need any formalities or gestures. What I need is my sister. If no one wants to meet with me but they bring my sister back, that’s perfectly fine with me. I’m not focused on the process, only the result. However it happens, I don’t care. I just want my sister back. I don’t need any fancy meetings—I just need my sister.' The U.S. State Department responded: 'We are deeply concerned about this case and are closely monitoring it. We strongly condemn the kidnapping. We have urged, and continue to urge, Iraqi officials to locate Elizabeth and secure her release as soon as possible.'

She plans to travel to Capitol Hill early in the year, once key officials in the new administration take office, to 'speak to anyone willing to listen and help move things forward.' The incoming White House press secretary, Caroline Leavitt, said: 'The American people reelected President Trump because they trust him to restore stability and peace to the Middle East. When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary steps to achieve exactly that.' Mean people on the Internet Elizabeth and Emma Tsurkov were born in St. Petersburg to Jewish dissidents who had previously been imprisoned in Siberia. When they were four and two years old, respectively, the family immigrated to Israel and settled in Kfar Eldad in the West Bank, where their mother still lives. They have a younger brother and sister who also live in Israel, while their father resides in Brazil. After her military service, Elizabeth earned a bachelor’s degree in international relations and communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a master’s degree in Middle Eastern studies at Tel Aviv University and political science at the University of Chicago. She later began a Ph.D. at Princeton, which brought her to Iraq as part of her research. Her studies focused on the Middle East, particularly Syria, ISIS and the Syrian civil war. She conducted fieldwork in Syria, Jordan, Turkey and other countries in the region. Emma also pursued an academic career in the U.S. After studying law in Israel and clerking for Supreme Court Justice Hanan Melcer, she began a master’s degree at Stanford in 2014, where she continued to a Ph.D. She began working for the Anti-Defamation League in 2022. Recent hostage and prisoner exchange deals—such as those brokered between the U.S. and Russia, and between Israel and Hamas—evoke mixed emotions for the Tsurkov family. 'It’s bittersweet,' Emma explains. 'I’m elated for the families who get to see their loved ones come back. I envy them so, so much—just imagining the excitement on their faces standing on the tarmac makes my heart feel like it could explode. I’m thrilled for them, but it’s also deeply painful because I want so badly to see my sister again. 'But it also gives me hope, because it shows that even in the bitterest rivalries, agreements can happen. The deal with Hamas that brought Israelis and other nationals home gives me hope that these deals are possible. Let’s be clear: this is how hostages come home.' Can you understand the criticism that the circumstances of Elizabeth's abduction are different from those of the hostages in Gaza, and that there may be levels of importance or priority in such a case? 'It’s not my job to tell anyone which hostage is more important. It’s not for me to judge. I’m just saying that my sister is in a very unique position. She’s currently the only hostage being held in a country that is an ally of the United States. It defies reason to me that a government that is such a strong U.S. ally, and gets so much support from the U.S. government, can still allow a graduate student from a U.S. institution to be held hostage there.' Israelis live in a zero-sum game Still, criticism coming from Israel has made it impossible for Emma and her family to ignore this 'hierarchy.' After October 7, she felt a bond of shared suffering with the families of the hostages in Gaza—'like suddenly there were 251 families who joined the terrible version of hell that I was already living in.' But it didn’t take long for the Tsurkov family to sense they weren’t seen as part of the collective—and perhaps even unwelcome in the struggle. This escalated into repeated harassment, threatening messages and phone calls. 'I don’t want to judge how anyone deals with this horrible torment,' Tsurkov says. 'This is truly an unthinkable tragedy for anyone to go through. For some people, everything about this is painful. It’s brutal—the idea that some hostages might come at the expense of others. I personally don’t feel that way, but I also can’t judge people who do. It’s just such a heartache. 'Whenever someone is about to say something mean to a relative of a hostage, they should pause and consider what has brought them to this point. I’m generally not someone who’s particularly sensitive to what the Internet says but this is just torture to see people speculate. One of the most painful things about having a loved one in captivity is the uncertainty and the desperation for any shred of information. And yet, there are a lot of mean people on the Internet who take advantage of it and just torment hostage families. I don’t even know why they do it, but it’s deeply disheartening.' Does this affect your fight? 'You’re not focusing on the criticism—you’re focusing on the reasons to bring her back. I don’t see any good coming out of any type of divide and conquer between hostage families. It doesn’t benefit anyone—the only ones who benefit are the terrorists, and I’m not giving them that satisfaction. The only reason I even finished my PhD is because I was supposed to finish it not long before she was kidnapped. I felt like they were already taking her PhD away, and I wasn’t going to give them the satisfaction of taking mine as well. That’s pretty much the only reason. To me, the fact that terrorists would benefit from this infighting among hostage families is more reason not to take part in this.' And how have the responses been toward you in the U.S.? 'The reactions I get from Israelis are different from responses I get from non-Israelis. I also get a lot of warm messages and words of support and kindness from both Israelis and especially the Jewish community in the U.S. It has been truly remarkable to see how many kind Jewish souls around the U.S. who never heard about my sister but were willing to help simply because they're also Jewish.' How do you explain this difference? 'The comments I get from Israelis have to do more with how undeserving my sister is of any empathy or compassion. Israelis are constantly in a sense of a zero-sum game. Everything is a struggle or a competition for something. 'The kindness extended to me by American Jews feels like it comes from this sense of Judaism as something that unites us, this shared feeling of destiny. It’s this idea of standing with someone who shares a sense of fear of persecution. And my sister is in the unenviable position of being a Jewish woman held captive by radical, extremist terrorist groups. I think that resonates strongly with American Jews, and I’m deeply, deeply grateful for that.' Mom cried live on air One of the most important messages she received from the Jewish community was not to neglect her personal life. 'Although it feels like all I want to do is stop doing anything else and throw myself into this, it's really important for me to still have some sense of self outside of my sister being a hostage,' she says. 'These things take time, and it's going to be a long journey, and to make it to the end of it, I need to be able to exist in parallel.' Elizabeth has already missed her sister’s Ph.D. graduation ceremony at Stanford University. That moment, like every significant milestone in the life of Emma’s two-year-old son, Daniel, is carefully documented and saved in a digital 'time capsule,' in the hope that one day Elizabeth will be able to see what she missed. In the videos Emma records, Daniel refers to her as 'the aunt in Iraq.' He doesn’t know any other reality. Where are your parents and siblings in this fight? 'We prefer to keep them out of this. When it all began, someone made my mom cry live on television, and we decided this isn’t for them. I’ve become the face of the fight, and that’s how we’ve been managing.' She adds, 'There’s a two-year age gap between Elizabeth and me, but we always said she was the eldest by mistake. Growing up, I was basically the eldest in behavior—the one who took responsibility—and somehow, that’s happening again now. 'I still have this habit—when something interesting happens, I reach for my phone to text her about it because we would always think the same thing. We would often text each other the exact same message at the same time, or call each other to say the exact same thing. I know that if she gets to see the news, she thinks the same things as I do. I just hope I get to see her soon, because we have a lot of inside jokes that we need to catch up on.' And how are you coping in the meantime? 'I can’t even explain what a nightmare this is. I haven’t slept properly a single night since March 2023. I think about her all the time. I wish I could tie her to the bed so something like this could never happen again.' Do you feel any anger toward her? 'There is nothing in the world a person could do to deserve such a punishment. Whatever mistake she may have made, she doesn’t deserve what happened to her. In any case, that belongs to the category of things I can think about later. Right now, anything that doesn’t bring her back home is irrelevant and unimportant. And if she doesn’t come back, then what does it matter? This isn’t about inner strength or anything like that—it’s just that there’s no other choice. Nothing good awaits me at the bottom of that pit of ‘what ifs.’ There’s no point in going there.' Some relatives of hostages admit that sometimes they wish for the nightmare to simply end, even if it means knowing their loved ones are no longer alive. Do you relate to that feeling? 'At the end of all this, if she doesn’t survive, then of course I... I would prefer she didn’t suffer. But if she comes home alive, it will have been worth everything. I can’t know what she’s going through there. I’ve imagined it all—everything from the darkest scenarios to the most optimistic ones. I don’t think I have the moral right to judge whether this effort is worth it or not. That’s a question only she can answer, if and when I bring her back.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkduorin1x	2024-12-14T15:01:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/30/ry11YEBL00mJe/ry11YEBL00mJe_208_398_784_442_0_small.jpg
Senior official: Significant progress in hostage talks; majority ...	A senior Israeli official told Ynet on Saturday that there has been 'significant progress' in talks for a hostage deal, with its main details currently kept under the radar to avoid political interference that could derail it. 'The heads of Mossad and Shin Bet reported to the Cabinet that Hamas has shown a willingness to reach a deal that wasn’t there before, and the assessment is that an agreement could be reached within a few weeks,' according to the official. The official attributed the shift in Hamas’ stance to 'the blows they’ve suffered' and the impending inauguration of Donald Trump as U.S. president next month. 'If Netanyahu presents a reasonable deal, he will have a majority in the government and Cabinet, even if [Itamar] Ben-Gvir and [Bezalel] Smotrich oppose it,' the official added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byjga00iejl	2024-12-14T12:50:19-08:00	
Israel’s new fear: From Shiite to Sunni jihad	Commentary: Assad’s regime collapse marks a rare moment, but Syria’s new leadership may eventually demand the return of the Golan Heights; in his final hours in power, Assad raged, attempted bribery and accused his generals of corruption before fleeing The Middle East often brings prolonged and grinding tragedy for all of us. Yet there are very few historic moments—those that change everything. One such moment was October 7. Another occurred this week when Damascus fell. The Iranian axis no longer exists. Until just a few weeks ago, the regime in Tehran could send a truck from southern Iran, travel north through mullah-friendly Iraq, cross into Syria’s eastern border—where it would be welcomed by a regime that served them—and proceed via Damascus all the way to Hezbollah on the Mediterranean coast in Beirut. With Syria's collapse and the severe blows to Hezbollah, that is no longer possible. Decades of investment and hundreds of billions of petro-dollars by the Iranians have gone down the drain. Iran’s proxy strategy—the network of operatives it built against Israel—once seemed effective and intimidating. But it turns out that slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s 'spiderweb' metaphor wasn’t about Israel, but rather Iran’s network. Iran’s proxies were supposed to protect it, but in the end, it was dragged into defending them—and failed. This week, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was filled with accusations. His bitterness will bring satisfaction to anyone seeking peace in the region. That said, there are no illusions about Damascus. Even there, we will be on our own. 'The rebels have won,' an Israeli security official told his American counterpart, who immediately corrected him: 'Don’t say rebels, they’re jihadists. Terrorists.' The Israeli official didn’t need the reminder; he was overseeing an IDF operation to eliminate Syrian army capabilities. The prevailing view in Israel’s security establishment is that Shiite jihadism has been replaced by Sunni jihadism. For now, the new regime will persuade the world it isn’t al-Qaida and will attempt to take control of the entire state and restore order. But in a year or two, it will begin framing the return of the Golan Heights as a sacred Islamic mission. Even before addressing the dire predictions—realistic as they may be—it must be said outright: Syria has been freed. From the depths of the Syrian desert to Idlib province, from the torture chambers of Saydnaya prison to the markets of Aleppo, from the streets of Beirut to the borders of Iraq, and across the entire Middle East, this is a revolutionary reality. The Assad dynasty was not only, or even primarily, a link in the so-called 'axis of resistance'; it was a symbol of a stagnant, dictatorial regime akin only to North Korea—a place frozen in time. For Syrians themselves, the fall of Damascus was less significant than the liberation of Saydnaya prison—the site where tens of thousands were executed and countless others vanished. Videos emerging from the prison this week revealed the sheer magnitude of the horror: the gallows, the bodies dissolved in acid, the prisoners forgotten in underground cells, the execution lists. Some prisoners had been there for decades, knowing nothing of the outside world. Stories even surfaced of children born inside the prison. Saydnaya was the ultimate symbol of the regime's boundless brutality. This week, families from across the country flocked to the prison, searching for loved ones who had disappeared. In nearly every case, they found nothing. The regime had erased its opponents—and any trace of their existence. The Syrian butterfly effect There is a lesson here. No building on any Western university campus was seized in solidarity with the Syrian people. No fiery protests were held at prestigious campuses while hundreds of thousands were being slaughtered. Unlike the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this war lacked a simplistic, false narrative of 'white oppressors' and 'indigenous victims.' As a result, Syrian blood was deemed expendable. The war was treated as an unfortunate but immutable reality—and then forgotten. The Syrian refugees I’ve spoken to in Europe were filled with boundless disappointment at the West, which they felt had abandoned them. And it must be said: they were undoubtedly abandoned. The key moment came in 2012, when U.S. President Barack Obama issued a 'red line' warning to the Assad regime, demanding it refrain from using chemical weapons against its own people. Assad ignored the warning and massacred scores with nerve gas. The U.S. and Britain prepared a response—limited airstrikes. The rebels believed such action could topple Assad’s faltering regime. But then came a turning point of weakness. The American public, scarred by Iraq, was so averse to further Middle Eastern conflicts that it opposed even airstrikes. In other words, Syrians were left to choke. Obama’s resolve collapsed in record time. His administration briefed that he reversed course after a contemplative 'walk' with his chief of staff across the White House lawn. A romantic and vivid image: a stroll on Washington’s tranquil grass while Syrians suffocated. The consequences were catastrophic. Obama accepted a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin, a cunning initiative from Moscow’s czar. Syria’s chemical weapons would be removed, and in return, the West would refrain from striking. But several things happened: Russia entered Syria with overwhelming force while the U.S. barely reacted. The disarmament process dragged on, and it became clear not all chemical weapons had been removed. Moreover, the relevant conventions didn’t classify chlorine as a chemical weapon, allowing Assad to use it freely in the years that followed. Like a nuclear reactor meltdown, Syria became increasingly toxic. ISIS took control of 40% of the country and declared an Islamic Caliphate. This hardly disturbed the West until the group began beheading foreigners and Christians. We live in a world where the image of a single beheading carries more weight than the deaths of thousands who were simply shot. Meanwhile, the refugee crisis in Europe erupted after Assad, encouraged by the Russians, began pushing his own people out of Syria. Syrians crossed the sea from Turkey to Greece, some perishing along the way, and hundreds of thousands arrived in Europe. Refugees are rarely welcomed, and Germany reached an agreement with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to stem the flow of Syrians into the continent. But it was too late; the Syrian civil war—a conflict few paid attention to, in a remote country with no vast oil reserves—had already played a decisive role in Brexit. Brexit (along with the refugee crisis and its images) then contributed to Donald Trump’s rise in 2016. Would all this have happened without the Syrian war? Perhaps. But it played a crucial role. The butterfly effect of Syrian suffering unleashed hurricanes—not one, but many. The tragedy lies in the persistence of this situation: the slow, grinding history of suffering. Assad’s regime was weak from the start of the war but managed to maneuver its way forward. Hezbollah saved him, followed by the Revolutionary Guards and Iran, and then the Russians. The Americans eventually entered Syria, primarily to fight ISIS. Yet the prevailing perception was that Assad couldn’t be toppled, with Russia and Iran backing him. As reported earlier this week by Ynet’s sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth, Israeli Military Intelligence (Aman) had assessed that the Syrian army was gradually recovering. This assessment, though grounded in material terms—acquisition of weaponry, training and improved command and control—proved to be a mistake. As history has shown, regimes don’t collapse solely due to material factors. In his final hours before fleeing to Moscow, the sanctuary for deposed dictators, Assad still didn’t grasp his reality. Western intelligence sources observed astonishing scenes in real time: the dictator raged uncontrollably. He accused his generals of corruption and blamed the army for its failures. He tried every trick in the book—offering last-minute proposals to the West and Gulf states, issuing threats and attempting bribes. He was even convinced that he had another division at his disposal, only to discover it had vanished. None of it worked. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Therefore, it is essential not to dismiss the pure joy of Syrians at the fall of their oppressive regime or underestimate their desire to build a new state. Assad’s supporters in the West mourned the dictator’s downfall this week, labeling his successors as 'Woke Al-Qaida.' Many of these figures, like George Galloway and Max Blumenthal, are among the most vocal anti-Israel voices. It was a delight to witness their profound frustration and the disarray of anonymous social media accounts, likely managed from Russia, as they scrambled for explanations. The Russians, who poured a fortune into Syria, were quick to search for scapegoats this week—blaming Assad himself, and, when desperate, even pointing fingers at Israel’s 'imperialism.' Assad is now a guest-prisoner in Russia, where Moscow is already considering the next dictator. Assad should know that the empire won’t abandon him, even if the masses demand his hanging. The blow to Moscow is severe and could deepen if Russia is forced to vacate its naval base on the Mediterranean coast in Tartus. In this sense, what happened in Syria stands out amid global trends of recent years: consider where, in recent memory, Iran and Russia have retreated, or where people have freed themselves from an iron grip. Who's next on the chopping block? Official and unofficial Israel celebrated the fall of Assad’s regime this week and the dramatic shift—largely credited to the actions of the IDF and the defense establishment—since October 7. These celebrations are entirely understandable. It’s no coincidence that U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is visiting the country. Beyond urgent matters, there’s a legacy at stake. In its final moments, the Biden administration is attempting to claim credit for the dismantling of the so-called 'axis of resistance.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the success entirely to himself, and not even the opening of his trial dampened his euphoric mood. Mistakes, as usual, were quick to follow. Perhaps there was significant strategic value in seizing the Syrian Golan Heights and taking control of the buffer zone. But it’s doubtful Israel gained anything from the boastful declarations and high-profile visits by the prime minister and defense minister to the Golan Heights. Golani’s announcement of a free-market economy and a ban on acts of revenge was interpreted in the West as a serious gesture toward the future. Simultaneously, his men executed one of Assad’s relatives by hanging him from a crane, filming the act and posting it on Telegram Israel said it all this week: it threatened Syria, bragged about bombings there, expressed interest in 'relations' as Netanyahu put it and issued further warnings about Iranian involvement. For the first two days, the world remained silent about Israel’s incursion into Syria, but at some point, the noise from public declarations became deafening. I can only commend the military press corps for securing a tour across the Syrian border. They did their job diligently. But what exactly is the point of presenting a temporary occupation—as described in the Cabinet meeting—as some sort of achievement, especially when it was accomplished without a fight? The Israeli establishment, jubilant, was swept into an internal competition over credit. The result: within a short time, the Middle East—and even European nations—woke up and began demanding an Israeli withdrawal. Israel injected itself into the narrative and, in doing so, became the story. Following Defense Minister Israel Katz's statement—where he threatened that anyone following Assad’s path 'will end like Assad'—military historian Prof. Danny Orbach wrote on his Facebook page: 'There is a new regime in Syria. Its leaders barely talk about us. Even if they are deeply hostile to Israel, they are even more hostile to Iran. This creates an opportunity to build bridges for cooperation, even after Assad’s arsenal is destroyed. Why, for heaven’s sake, send them every possible signal that ‘Israel is your enemy’?' Silent amidst this was Abu Mohammed al-Golani, Syria’s new ruler. A shrewd and ruthless leader, he seems to have learned lessons from the fall of ISIS—his sworn enemy—and the crushing of al-Qaida, his former roots. Despite Israel’s devastating strikes on Syria’s military infrastructure and its entry into the Syrian Golan, Golani refrained from issuing threats against Israel or the West. His announcement of a free-market economy and a ban on acts of revenge was interpreted in the West as a serious gesture toward the future. The West, however, takes such declarations far too seriously. Simultaneously with these signals of goodwill, Golani’s men executed one of Assad’s relatives by hanging him from a crane, filming the act and posting it on Telegram. Across Damascus, arrests and purges have begun. Assad's father’s grave was torched. This isn’t the end. Western intelligence is closely monitoring developments in Lebanon, where Sunni and Christian elements are likely to seize the opportunity to move against Hezbollah. It is not unthinkable that Israel is waiting for this scenario to unfold. The final neutralization of Hezbollah can only occur through a united Lebanese effort to strip it of its weapons. If this doesn’t happen now, in the wake of Assad’s flight, it is doubtful the Lebanese will ever be able to free themselves from Hezbollah’s grip. Another critical issue for Israel and the United States is the Kurds. Western intelligence agencies are still trying to discern the nature of the relationship between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), its leader Golani and Turkish President Erdoğan. There is no doubt about their cooperation in intelligence sharing, weapons transfers and long-term strategic goals. The question, however, is whether Turkey merely influences the new Syrian regime or exercises full control over it. A clue came shortly after the takeover of Damascus: Erdoğan reportedly asked HTS to address the Kurdish issue. Despite HTS’s ongoing conflict with another pro-Turkish opposition force, the Syrian National Army (SNA), Golani quickly complied. The Kurds are historic allies of Israel, serving as a counterweight to countless groups in Syria and Iraq that seek Israel’s destruction. The United States has stepped in to halt the assault on the Kurds, a move likely influenced by Israel, which has reportedly leveraged its sway in Washington—under both Biden and Trump—to protect Kurdish autonomy. The concern was a swift dismantling of Kurdish self-rule and a dramatic rise in Turkey’s power in the region. This has left the U.S. in a peculiar position: two NATO allies, the U.S. and Turkey, are pursuing completely opposing goals in Syria. Turkey is waging a determined campaign to dismantle the Kurdish administration, while the U.S.—at least the current administration—is committed to defending it. About 1,000 American troops are stationed alongside Kurdish forces, and as long as they remain, Erdoğan and pro-Turkish forces are unlikely to push for a decisive victory. However, on January 20, Trump will be inaugurated as president of the United States. A battle is now unfolding in Washington: pro-Israel advocates are working to preserve Kurdish interests, while Turkey’s supporters—less visible but not insignificant in D.C.—are lobbying for the opposite. The 'new Syria' is bound to bring many more upheavals. Damascus has fallen, but it remains unclear what will rise in its place. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rksoavonje	2024-12-14T12:43:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/12/By11rIruE1e/By11rIruE1e_0_23_2362_1330_0_small.jpg
Israeli leaders demand probe into ex-prosecutor calling for milit...	Former state prosecutor Moshe Lador urges voluntary pilots to refuse service if Israel 'becomes a dictatorship' as government reintroduces some parts of plan to reform judiciary, sparking condemnation from across political spectrum Israeli leaders across the political spectrum have condemned former state prosecutor Moshe Lador for remarks perceived as endorsing military disobedience, with several calling for legal action. Lador had said that 'pilots whose service is voluntary must tell the state that if it becomes a dictatorship, they will not enter the cockpit.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the comments as 'a red line that endangers democracy and undermines our future,' and called on Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara to act against 'this dangerous phenomenon.' Defense Minister Israel Katz echoed the prime minister, saying, 'Disobedience of any kind cannot be accepted under any circumstances.' Justice Minister Yariv Levin formally requested an investigation, asserting that 'calls for disobedience, whether in peacetime or wartime, constitute a clear and severe violation of the law.' Levin warned that failure to take decisive legal action could embolden further incidents of incitement. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir criticized Lador’s comments as 'a stab in the back to the nation and IDF soldiers,' adding that 'we saw on October 7 the heavy price of disobedience in human lives.' He accused the attorney general of granting 'automatic backing to any action against the government.' President Isaac Herzog also condemned the remarks, saying, 'In a democracy, everyone has the full right to express opinions and protest, but disobedience is off-limits. Anyone who says otherwise harms Israel’s security.' Herzog warned against returning to the 'divisive and dangerous rhetoric of pre-October 7.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi issued a rare public statement, calling for an end to any talk of disobedience or refusal to serve. 'The Israel Defense Forces must remain outside of political disputes, especially at a time when security challenges are so pressing,' the military said in a statement on his behalf. Opposition leader Yair Lapid also weighed in, condemning Lador’s statement and emphasizing, 'I oppose all forms of disobedience and evasion of service in the IDF.' Lador’s comments come against the backdrop of a contentious political debate over the government’s renewed push for judicial reform. The proposed legislation, championed by Prime Minister Netanyahu's right-wing coalition, seeks to limit the authority of the Supreme Court, reduce judicial oversight of government decisions and grant the coalition greater influence over judicial appointments. Supporters of the reforms argue they are necessary to restore the balance of power between the judiciary and the legislature, which they claim has been eroded over time. Critics, however, view the reforms as a threat to Israeli democracy, warning that they could undermine judicial independence and erode checks and balances in the political system. The revival of the reform drive has reignited mass protests across Israel, with opponents expressing fears that the changes would consolidate power in the hands of the ruling coalition. These tensions have spilled over into the military, where voluntary reservists, including elite pilots, have issued warnings of potential refusal to serve if the reforms are enacted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1zrpvivyg	2024-12-14T11:30:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/01/HylLI4tp002/HylLI4tp002_0_63_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The letters are dated Dec. 9, days after rebels ousted Assad and ended his family’s more than 50-year authoritarian rule of Syria.

Trump envoy on hostages to visit Israel for consultations on Gaza...	Adam Boehler to meet with Katz and discuss potential hostage deal; Netanyahu calls Hamas videos 'cruel psychological warfare' Adam Boehler, an advisor to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on hostages and missing persons, is set to visit Israel in the coming days, Ynet learned on Saturday. While sources familiar with the visit describe it as private, ynet has learned that Boehler, 45, will hold meetings and consultations regarding a potential hostage deal involving captives held by Hamas in Gaza. The Defense Ministry has reportedly received a request to arrange a meeting with Boehler, likely to take place on Monday. Both Israeli and U.S. officials have kept the visit under wraps. Trump, who has already warned Hamas to release hostages before his inauguration on January 20 or face severe consequences, has adopted an aggressive stance on the issue. 'There will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East,' he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Boehler, a Jewish-American known for his hardline approach toward Hamas, echoed this sentiment last week, saying, 'Anyone holding hostages should think carefully about what could happen to them.' Boehler served as Trump’s envoy during the Abraham Accords negotiations and was recently appointed 'Special Presidential Envoy for American Hostage Affairs' following Trump’s reelection. In a statement announcing Boehler’s appointment, Trump said, 'Adam knows that NO ONE is tougher than the United States of America... Adam will work tirelessly to bring our Great American Citizens HOME.' In the past, Boehler has called for stronger U.S. action in retrieving hostages. In an op-ed for The Hill, he advocated for military operations, including commando raids, to rescue American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. 'The Biden administration has reverted to a philosophy of hostage rescues that sees a military operation as a last resort,' Boehler wrote. 'This approach cedes the upper hand to hostage takers, who feel emboldened to capture Americans with little fear of paying for it with their lives.' He added, 'American servicemembers are more than equipped to pull off a rescue. In the wake of the failed mission to rescue Americans held hostage by Iran in 1980, U.S. Special Operations teams were rebuilt to achieve what President Jimmy Carter’s aborted raid could not. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Today, U.S. special operators have a strong track record of successfully infiltrating hostile environments to rescue hostages. Those averse to an American military presence inside Gaza must remember that a single, surgical raid is not the same thing as a protracted U.S. military presence.' The emerging deal Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday, 'Hamas' barrage of propaganda videos is cruel and malicious psychological warfare. I am in constant contact with the families of the hostages, who are enduring a terrible and prolonged nightmare. I have said and will repeat: anyone who harms our hostages will bear full responsibility. We will continue working tirelessly to bring all the hostages home—both the living and the deceased.' According to reports, the emerging deal is expected to unfold in stages, beginning under the Biden administration and continuing into the Trump administration. The first stage would be humanitarian, involving the release of hostages in exchange for a seven-week cease-fire. Such an agreement could also pave the way for a broader deal, potentially ending the war and facilitating normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. An Israeli official likened the negotiations to a pregnancy, saying, 'The assumption is that the 'pregnancy' will continue after a humanitarian release. The key is to get both sides committed.' Earlier Saturday, Arab media reported difficulties in the negotiations due to Hamas’ demands to release high-profile prisoners. However, Israeli sources, maintaining strict confidentiality in recent weeks to avoid jeopardizing the talks, dismissed these claims as 'untrue.' These developments come amidst a week of cautious optimism regarding a possible deal. On Thursday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and President Joe Biden’s special envoy, Brett McGurk, met with Netanyahu and senior Israeli officials to discuss the hostage negotiations. Mossad chief David Barnea and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar also attended the meeting. On Wednesday, Barnea met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani in Doha, following a secret meeting held two weeks earlier in Vienna. Qatar currently serves as the central mediator for the deal, and the outgoing U.S. administration is cooperating fully with the incoming administration in a shared effort to finalize an agreement before Trump’s inauguration. However, it remains unclear whether Hamas will agree to a limited deal without ending the war entirely. Conflicting reports have emerged: some suggest Hamas is showing flexibility, including a willingness to accept a limited IDF presence in Gaza, while others claim Israel has agreed to a temporary withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor which borders Egypt, though these reports remain unconfirmed. For now, Israeli officials estimate that a deal could be reached within two weeks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjy7eijvje	2024-12-14T10:16:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/Skeqq5BiNkl/Skeqq5BiNkl_0_208_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Traitors': Clashes between terror groups and Palestinian securit...	PA forces intensify terror crackdown in West Bank's Jenin and Tulkarm camps; senior PA official tells Ynet operations to continue, Israeli interference will hinder efforts; terrorists warn: 'The struggle will continue' The Palestinian Preventive Security forces launched a large-scale counterterror crackdown in the West Bank’s Jenin, Tulkarm and Nablus refugee camps last Sunday, marking the most extensive action against Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives in years. The operation, escalating Saturday, included a foiled car bomb attack targeting Palestinian security personnel in Jenin and clashes in multiple locations. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, visiting Jenin on Saturday, praised the security efforts, saying that 'Jenin and other camps are symbols of national pride. The residents must live in peace.' Mustafa emphasized the importance of restoring stability, calling it 'essential for achieving development and paving the way to establishing an independent state.' The operation, dubbed 'Homeland Protection,' expanded overnight to Jericho’s Aqabat Jaber refugee camp, where no significant incidents were reported. Jericho Governor Hussein Hamayel addressed the security forces, saying, '90% of our people want to see you on the streets, protecting them. Those who don’t are traitors.' In Jenin, Palestinian security forces reportedly encountered 20 gunmen accused of smuggling weapons and receiving foreign funds. Security officials vowed to intensify the crackdown, cut off financial support for 'outlaws' and pursue legal action. 'There will be no retreat,' said Anwar Rajab, a spokesperson for the security forces. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The operation sparked fierce criticism from terrorist groups. A commander of the Jenin Brigades accused the Palestinian Authority (PA) of attempting to end the 'national jihad' and vowed continued resistance. 'We will die with honor,' he said in a video, adding that the fight against Israel would persist with or without the PA. For the first time, heavy exchanges of fire were documented Saturday in Tulkarm’s refugee camp. Terrorist groups there issued a statement warning Palestinian security personnel: 'This is our final message to the security forces: No traitor is born a traitor, but it is easy to become one. You will die for your betrayal, and the idea of resistance will remain alive and clear. The [Palestinian] Authority must reverse its unpatriotic decisions, which only serve the occupation. You will not break our resolve or disarm us. The struggle will continue, and our weapons are ready on all fronts. The blood of our martyrs is on your hands.' The IDF confirmed witnessing clashes between Palestinian security forces and terrorists in Tulkarm, noting that terrorists had thrown explosives and fired at the PA headquarters in Jenin. However, according to the IDF, Palestinian forces have so far refrained from entering the refugee camps directly, responding instead from a distance. In Gaza, Fatah spokesperson Mundar Hayek warned of parallels to the 2007 Hamas takeover in the enclave. 'Our people must unite behind the security forces to block anyone attempting to distort our national compass,' he said. A senior Palestinian security official told Ynet that the forces aim to conclude their operation swiftly and without external interference, saying, 'Foreign intervention, including by Israel, would complicate our efforts.' He estimated that around 20 armed terrorists in Jenin are involved in arms trafficking and financing operations. The PA has expressed strong support for the operation, with officials calling it essential to remove the influence of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which they claim undermine life in the camps and disrupt social cohesion. Israel, meanwhile, has conducted frequent targeted operations in West Bank refugee camps, particularly since October 7, resulting in the deaths of 812 Palestinians and the arrests of approximately 10,000 others. In the wake of the operation: Abbas’ support base revives The fall of the Bashar Assad regime has also resonated on the Palestinian street, where there was widespread celebration over the ousting of the Syrian dictator. However, this development is not expected to impact the rule of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, 89, who has already designated a temporary successor for the day after his departure. In the Palestinian territories, no movements or organizations have actively sought to overthrow Abbas’ leadership, partly due to the PA’s already dire economic situation. The strain on cooperation with Israel—apart from security coordination—has further destabilized the PA in multiple areas. Until recently, Abbas was not widely popular among Palestinians. However, amid the ongoing war in Gaza, many are now beginning to see his policies as a safeguard against a devastating and destructive war. In 2015, responding to a question about why he doesn’t ignite the West Bank in resistance against Israel, Abbas said, 'Hamas’ involvement in the 2014 campaign resulted in devastating outcomes for Gaza, and I am not willing to destroy my people just to say that I raised the flag of resistance.' His popularity declined further after that remark, but the narrative has shifted. Abbas is now regaining support among Palestinians, including in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwlivsvje	2024-12-14T08:32:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/S1h00i11iVJx/S1h00i11iVJx_0_3_711_401_0_small.jpg

The agreement, Qassem said, was not about dismantling Hezbollah but about halting attacks and implementing UN Resolution 1701, focused exclusively on the area south of the Litani River. He noted, 'We tolerated hundreds of Israeli violations to facilitate the agreement’s implementation.' Qassem emphasized that 'resistance on the ground remains critical, regardless of its limitations.

Report: Gaza casualty numbers inflated to accuse Israel of target...	The Telegraph cites research alleging Hamas inflates Gaza casualties, misclassifying adults as children, men as women and combatants as civilians; IDF releases footage of Hamas guards abusing prisoners, exposing further human rights violations A report by the Henry Jackson Society (HJS), a UK-based conservative think tank, alleges that casualty figures from Gaza during the ongoing war have been inflated to portray Israel as deliberately targeting civilians, The Telegraph reported Saturday. According to the HJS, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry has failed to differentiate between combatants and civilians in its reported death toll, which it claims also includes deaths from natural causes, illnesses and even fatalities predating the war. The report highlights statistical anomalies, such as adult casualties misreported as children, and men listed as women, which it says were later corrected by Gaza authorities. The think tank argues that these discrepancies create a narrative suggesting civilian populations—particularly women and children—bear the brunt of the war, influencing global sentiment and media coverage. For instance, the report claims some victims killed by failed Hamas rocket launches or internal clashes over humanitarian aid distribution were falsely attributed to Israeli strikes. One example cited is Ahmed Shdad Halmy Brika, a 17-year-old reportedly shot dead by Hamas gunmen while attempting to retrieve food from a humanitarian aid delivery in December 2023. The Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry has reported nearly 45,000 deaths since the war began on October 7, 2023, following the terrorist group's unprecedented attack on Israel. By contrast, estimates from Israeli and U.S. military intelligence place the number of Hamas operatives killed at approximately 17,000. The HJS report also accuses international media outlets, including the BBC, The New York Times and CNN, of uncritically adopting casualty figures provided by Hamas without independent verification. It further criticizes the United Nations for failing to distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties in its reports, claiming this omission skews public perception and policy decisions. 'The omission creates a skewed narrative portraying all casualties as civilian, shaping public opinion and international policy based on incomplete or manipulated data... with Israel accused of ‘genocide’, ‘ethnic cleansing’ and ‘crimes against humanity,’' the report says. The report also highlights alleged efforts to manipulate data to inflate the number of child casualties, citing patterns where victims’ ages were misrepresented compared to records from the Palestinian population registry. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Responding to The Telegraph’s report, Palestinian Ambassador to the UK Husam Zomlot dismissed the allegations, calling them an attempt to justify Israeli actions in Gaza. Zomlot emphasized that the casualty figures reported by Gaza’s Health Ministry have been verified by numerous international organizations and UN agencies, including the World Health Organization. 'Numerous international organizations and UN agencies—including the WHO—have not only confirmed these numbers, they’ve made the point that they are severely underestimated,' he said. 'Because we don’t how many people are still buried under the rubble or have been killed indirectly as a result of Israel’s targeting of the health sector undermining all healthcare provision, the imposed famine and the wholesale destruction of infrastructure that has left 1.9 million people homeless.' Torture in Hamas prisons exposed Meanwhile, the IDF released new footage on Saturday showing Hamas guards abusing Palestinian prisoners in Gaza’s Al-Kateeba prison prior to the outbreak of the war. According to IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, the footage, filmed in 2023 by prison security cameras in Gaza City’s Rimal neighborhood, was uncovered by Israeli forces and the Shin Bet security agency. 'The videos reveal severe abuse by Hamas prison guards, including brutal beatings and the holding of detainees under inhumane conditions that violate basic human rights,' Adraee said. Adraee identified two Hamas operatives shown in the footage assaulting a prisoner and throwing him down a flight of stairs: Mohammed Mohammed Shaaban Shubaki and Mahmoud Saber Mahmoud Abd al-Aal. Both men reportedly operate within Hamas’ internal security apparatus, which oversees detentions and imprisonment in Gaza. 'Hamas tries to distance itself from the Assad regime and its prison atrocities, but these videos, along with previously exposed torture investigations, leave no doubt—Hamas is no less brutal,' Adraee said. Last month, the IDF released 46 minutes of similar footage depicting interrogations and torture by Hamas operatives. Al-Kateeba prison, where the latest videos were filmed, has previously drawn condemnation from human rights organizations, accusing Hamas of extrajudicial executions, including of women, in the prison compound. 'The prison guards exposed in these brutal acts can no longer hide or deny their crimes against Gazans,' Adraee said. 'The harrowing footage serves as a stark reminder of the relentless abuse, tyranny and human rights violations inflicted on the people of Gaza by the Hamas regime.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjrp14j4kl	2024-12-14T07:36:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/25/B1aUshUP6/B1aUshUP6_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Speaking in a televised statement in the wake of Israel’s series of strikes on Syrian territory and its occupation of the buffer zone near the Golan Heights, Golani, whose real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa, said, 'Syria needs laws and state institutions.

Efforts underway to bring Eli Cohen remains home, report	Israel reaches out to officials in Syria and the region for information on the whereabouts of the Israeli spy's grave and to facilitate the transfer of his bones for burial in Israel, Hezbollah-affiliated media says Israel has reached out to officials in Syria and the region to locate the grave of Israeli spy Eli Cohen who was executed in Damascus in 1965, and bring his remains to Israel, the Lebanese Hezbollah affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper reported on Saturday, citing diplomatic sources. According to the report, Israel attempted to contact additional officials in search of the bodies of IDF soldiers who were missing in action since the first Lebanon war in 1982. Israeli officials have been trying to obtain a collection of ancient Torah scrolls and other religious artifacts. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria has rekindled hopes that Cohen's remains could be found after years of quiet negotiations with Russian mediation, have not yielded results. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2021 that a search was underway for Cohen's remains, with Russian help. A clip showing Cohen in Damascus was released in 2021, as part of a Russian RT documentary on Syria. The film, shot in the 1960s shows Cohen walking briskly on a street in the Syrian capital.

Hazem Alghabra, a former senior advisor in the U.S. Department of State, told ILTV News last week that, following the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, the Iranian people might soon be ready to rise against their own government. 'If anybody has a reason to rise against their government, it is the Iranian people,' Alghabra said, adding that no one would 'try to force' the people into an uprising, but 'it will happen.' Alghabra made these remarks on Insider, ILTV News’s weekly news analysis program, during a discussion with British-Israeli author and analyst Jonathan Spyer. Spyer expressed concern that the Iranian regime may accelerate its nuclear weapons program as a way to regain strength following recent setbacks, including the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and much of the terror organization’s key leadership, as well as a retaliatory strike against Iran that left its airspace exposed. 'In the last days, there are indications of the Iranians accelerating their existing nuclear program,' Spyer said. 'That doesn't mean they've made the decision to break out for weapon force,' he added, but noted the logic that, if the proxy strategy was less effective now, then a nuclear weapon could be another way to prove strength. 'I certainly hope that our intelligence services – American and Israeli – are watching carefully for that,' Spyer said. 'And if a decision is made to break out [a nuclear weapon], that we will have enough time to take the necessary action, which would lead, of course, to military action in order to frustrate that ambition. Under no circumstances should that regime be allowed to reach nuclear capacity.' Spyer said he does not believe Iran will take any immediate direct action against Israel or other nations to prove its strength following the collapse of the Syrian regime. However, he warned that despite its recent blows, Iran remains a regional threat with active proxies in Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon. Meanwhile, Israel has been conducting repeated strikes across Syria, including in As-Suwayda, Damascus, Al-Qalamoun, Masyaf, Latakia, and Tartus. These operations have targeted and destroyed chemical and ballistic weapons depots, radar stations, warehouses, and scientific research centers. Israel stated that these strikes are aimed at preventing sensitive weapons from reaching groups it considers threats and protecting its borders. Alghabra explained that many of Israel’s strikes were planned well before the fall of the Assad regime. 'This is not a direct reaction to the takeover of Damascus and the collapse of the Syrian regime,' he said. 'The collapse may have expedited the operation, but this has been planned due to Syria’s involvement in October 7 and, technically, October 8.' However, he acknowledged that 'the timing is interesting and dangerous' and urged Israel to engage more actively with Syrian rebels to signal its desire for peace. 'The Syrian people want stability and modernity,' Alghabra said. 'Syria needs to join the 21st century. And here lies the opportunity for working with the Syrian people.' He emphasized that both the Syrian government and its people will need international technical support and aid. According to Alghabra, the U.S., Israel, and other nations could provide this aid in exchange for meeting specific expectations that could lead to normalization. 'There shouldn't be any problem for Israel to commence that kind of humanitarian effort, and I would certainly want to see that,' Spyer said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1xayejeje	2024-12-14T02:52:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/13/By0X4gq41x/By0X4gq41x_1_10_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Report by UN agency claims Tehra agrees to tougher monitoring at Fordow after greatly accelerated uranium enrichment to close to military grade; 'We have not created and will not create any obstacles' Iranian officials says Iran will not impede U.N. nuclear watchdog's access and inspection of its sites, the head of the country's Atomic Energy Organization said on Saturday. According to a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier this week, Iran has agreed to tougher monitoring by the agency at its Fordow site after it greatly accelerated uranium enrichment to close to weapons grade there. Last week, the IAEA reported that Iran had multiplied the pace of its enrichment to up to 60% purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, at Fordow.

Iranians outraged over catastrophic and costly failure in Syria p...	unusual and bold criticism expressed openly in television studios, press outlets, social media and more rattles leaders fearing reemergence of protests but commentator says the expressions of anger cannot be silenced Iranians including members of the cleric, former officials and even some at the Iranian Revolutionary Gard Corps (IRGC) have been expressing their anger at the nearly 30 billion dollars spent and now lost in Syria, according to a report in the New York Times. The anger now directed at the Ayatollah regime has been expressed openly in television studios, newspapers and public events, even by conservatives who have been supporters of the government in Tehran. The regime has responded forcefully and has gone after some of its critics but that has not stopped the discussion over the extraordinary failure of the Iranian strategy. Iran had backed Syria for the past four decades and has used it as a base for the spread of its Islamic revolution in the Middle East and as a main component of the 'axis of resistance.' 'Iran controlled military bases, missile factories, tunnels and warehouses that served the supply chain for its network of militants. From Syria, Iran funneled weapons, cash and logistical support to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and militants in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Iraq,' the New York Time wrote in its report. During the Syria civil war, Iranian troops fought to protect the regime of Bashar Assad and had payed in Iranian blood. With the fall of the Assad regime, the pro-Iranian militias and the Iranian forces, were made to withdraw. 'In 11 days, we've lost everything we've fought for, in the past 13 years,' a member of the IRGC said. One former Iranian lawmaker said in a social media post that Assad's fall can be viewed as a positive thing because Iran would no longer waist money to prop up, this 'spider's web,' alluding to the analogy once used by another Iranian ally who has been removed from the scene, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah who used the term when describing Israeli society and perceived strength. Why were you spending billions of dollars of oil revenues that belong to the Iranian people on Assad? Opponents of the regime in Tehran have long criticized the vast investments of funds in Syria and in the region but they have been ignored. Now the anger is being shared by families of Iranians who have died in Syria's war who ask if their loved ones had fallen in vain. Alireza Mokarami who runs a news site and had served in Syria in the past, referred to what he called the 'catastrophic failure' of Iran in Syria. 'Why were you spending billions of dollars of oil revenues that belong to the Iranian people on Assad until the very end if he wasn’t even listening to you?' he asked in a post. 'At least on the topic of Syria, stop lying and be honest with the people.' Hassan Shemshadi, a prominent Iranian commentator and a supporter of the regime told the Times that the public debate is being held in all levels of society, not only in media outlets. 'People are asking: Why did we spend so much money there? What did we achieve? What is our justification now that it’s all gone?' Ebrahim Motaghi, a professor of international relations at Tehran University said in a television broadcast that Iran had lost its position as a regional power and was now no different than any ordinary country. A similar opinion was published on the front page of the Ham Mihan newspaper, affiliated by the reform movement in Iran, in an article by cleric Mohammad Shariati Dehghan who said the fall of Assad exposed Iranian’s strategy as misguided and 'built on weak foundations,' and demanded a new approach that would favor alliances with countries over arming and financing militant groups, so that Iranian money and resources could be spent on the needs of Iranians. Iranian commentator told the Times that the public outrage would not be stopped and that there was no way to diminish the blow that Iran had sustained. The New York Times noted that the debate in Iran was unusual and bold in light of the widespread oppression by the regime that now fears a reemergence of the protest movement. Supreme leader Ali Khamenei said the criticism was a crime that only spreads fear. The regime announced investigations of prominent officials but one commentator told the Times that the public outrage would not be stopped and that there was no way to diminish the blow that Iran had sustained. In official statements the Iranian government has said it respects the rights of Syrians to determine their future and that a dialogue with the rebels has already begun. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi even claimed that the rebels have agreed to Iran's request to protect sacred Shiite sites in Syria and Iranian diplomatic missions after the Iranian embassy in Damascus was trashed when the rebels entered the city. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: But Khamenei called the rebels 'aggressors' in his speech on Wednesday and accused Israel and the U.S. of being behind their assault. He also alluded to the Turkish involvement in the fall of Assad and claimed that the 'resistance' would only strengthen and spread. According to some officials in Tehran, including from the IRGC, the Iranian regime would now agree to any form of diplomatic presence in Syria, no matter how small. Two officials said Iran hoped to avoid the embarrassment of being ousted completely by the new Syrian leadership. 'Iran wants to move toward a direction that would eventually normalize its relations with Syria, but it’s going to be very difficult,' Rahman Ghahremanpour, a political analyst based in Tehran, said in a telephone interview. 'The first priority right now is to make sure Syria does not turn into a base against Iran and a launchpad to attack its interests in Iraq or Lebanon.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkbxpacnjl	2024-12-14T00:29:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/r1VLBIVEJg/r1VLBIVEJg_0_165_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Could a mutual defense treaty have prevented the October 7 massac...	Michael Makovsky says it would have been a signal of an American commitment to come to Israel's defense If the United States and Israel had signed a mutual defense treaty (MDT) before October 7, the Hamas massacre might have been prevented or at least minimized, according to Michael Makovsky, president and CEO of JINSA (Jewish Institute for the National Security of America). 'I think it would have been a signal, at least to actors in the region, particularly the Iranians, of an American commitment to come to Israel's defense,' Makovsky said. Discussions about an MDT between Israel and the United States have been ongoing for nearly a decade. JINSA was among the organizations that proposed a framework for how such a treaty could work. The concept was reportedly discussed by U.S. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last September, prior to the outbreak of war. Currently, the United States has MDTs with 52 countries worldwide, but none with any Middle Eastern nation. 'We believe that it would help bring stability in the region, because no country usually that has a mutual defense treaty with the United States is generally embroiled in a conflict,' Makovsky told ILTV News. He emphasized that such a treaty could deter regional adversaries, like Iran, and elevate the U.S.-Israel security partnership to an entirely new level. Makovsky also argued that threats by the U.S. to delay or withhold weapons, as seen in recent months, would be unlikely under an MDT. He added that an MDT 'would have facilitated a more steady flow' of weapons from the United States to Israel during the war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1is535ejx	2024-12-13T23:02:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/14/BkUFsncVyl/BkUFsncVyl_0_33_512_289_0_small.jpg

'We're seeing now the US taking a more proactive role, which, again, is another good sign.' However, Truzman warned that Hezbollah is likely to regroup and rebuild its strength.

CENTCOM chief discusses Syria, other regional issues in Israel vi...	Leaders discussed a range of regional security issues, to include the ongoing situation in Syria, and preparedness against other strategic and regional threats, CENTCOM says in a statement CENTCOM commander General Michael Kurilla visited Israel from Wednesday to Friday, meeting with Israeli defense officials and discussing the situation in Syria, among other regional topics, the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement. He met IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi, and Defense Minister Israel Katz, CENTCOM said. Washington has urged Israel to be in close consultation with the U.S. over events unfolding in Syria, where days earlier Syrian rebels led by rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani brought an end to more than 50 years of rule by the Assad family, as ousted President Bashar al-Assad fled the country. The world has been watching to see if Syria's new rulers can stabilize the country in which more than a decade of civil war killed hundreds of thousands and sparked a refugee crisis. Following the collapse of Assad's regime, the Israeli military said its jets conducted hundreds of strikes in Syria and destroyed the bulk of its strategic weapons stockpiles. Katz has ordered Israeli troops to prepare to stay over the winter on Mount Hermon, a strategic location overlooking Damascus, adding to signs that Israel is planning a prolonged military presence in Syria. 'The leaders discussed a range of regional security issues, to include the ongoing situation in Syria, and preparedness against other strategic and regional threats,' the CENTCOM statement said. CENTCOM said Kurilla also visited Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon in recent days. While Israel welcomed the removal of Assad, an ally of arch rival Iran, it is suspicious of the rebel groups that toppled him, many of which have origins linked to Islamist groups.

President-elect Donald Trump wants to turn the lights out on dayl...	Trump says daylight saving time is inconvenient, and very costly, and the Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate it In a post on his social media site Friday, President-elect Donald Trump said his party would try to end the practice when he returns to office. 'The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate daylight saving time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't! daylight saving time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation,' he wrote. Setting clocks forward one hour in the spring and back an hour in the fall is intended to maximize daylight during summer months, but has long been subject to scrutiny. Daylight saving time was first adopted as a wartime measure in 1942. Lawmakers have occasionally proposed getting rid of the time change altogether. The most prominent recent attempt, a now-stalled bipartisan bill named the Sunshine Protection Act, had proposed making daylight saving time permanent. The measure was sponsored by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whom Trump has tapped to helm the State Department. 'Changing the clock twice a year is outdated and unnecessary,' Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said as the Senate voted in favor of the measure.

Syria reports Israeli airstrikes on radar stations, warehouses, and a research center, with a missile fragment found in Damascus The Syrian state-affiliated news outlet 'Voice of Damascus,' linked to rebel groups controlling parts of Syria after the fall of President Assad's regime, reported Friday a series of Israeli strikes in the rural areas of As-Suwayda, Damascus, Al-Qalamoun, Masyaf, Latakia, and Tartus. The report claims that the targets included radar stations, warehouses, and scientific research centers. The Syrian capital also saw strikes on warehouses belonging to the Republican Guard and the Fourth Division near Mount Qasioun. Simultaneously, the 'Sabrin News' agency, associated with pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, reported that fragments from an Israeli missile had landed in the Rukn al-Din area of Damascus. The Israeli military initiated this extensive bombing campaign after the fall of Assad’s regime, fearing that strategic and even chemical weapons might fall into the hands of extremist jihadist groups. In the latest operation that lasted 72 hours, Israel claimed to have destroyed 109 anti-aircraft missile batteries, 34 radar sites, and 390 missile, rocket, and UAV storage and launch sites. Approximately 70% of Syria's air defense system and 80% of its missile and rocket systems were reportedly wiped out, along with dozens of fighter jets and helicopters. The Israeli Navy also destroyed the Syrian fleet. Ynet's military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai explained that one of the most significant targets for Israel was Syria’s advanced and extensive air defense system, which had been continuously upgraded since Russia’s intervention in 2015. The Russians not only improved Syria's defense capabilities but also supplied long-range S-300 missile systems. This air defense network had largely been intact during Syria’s civil war, allowing Israel to operate its aircraft on the fringes of Syria's airspace or over the Mediterranean Sea without much risk.

Eastern border residents on edge as security threats escalate	As security threats intensify along Israel's eastern border, residents and local leaders are pushing for stronger defenses; and despite promises from the government, delayed funding and insufficient military presence leave communities vulnerable to terrorism and smuggling Warnings from residents along Israel’s eastern border about potential terrorist activity are becoming a grim reality. The first attack occurred in late October when terrorists infiltrated Neot HaKikar in the Tamar Regional Council, injuring two IDF soldiers before being neutralized by the 998th Battalion. A month later, a Jordanian vehicle breached the border fence near Kibbutz Samar in the Eilot region. These incidents are part of a broader trend of cross-border weapons smuggling. Despite government promises to fortify the border with a stronger barrier, funding for these initiatives has been delayed. Meanwhile, residents face mounting threats, fearing even worse to come. Recently, former National Security Advisor Giora Eiland issued a stark warning in an assessment prepared for the Zalul environmental organization. He cautioned about increased terrorist activity emanating from Jordan, highlighting Iran's interest in establishing a military infrastructure there to target Israel. Eiland emphasized two primary threats: short-range drone attacks and mortar fire, noting that while Israel is effective at countering large drones, smaller ones pose a significant challenge. Farmers under pressure Farmers in the Arava have already documented drones hovering above their fields. Uri Meshli, a resident of Yotvata and head of its agricultural operations, described the vulnerability of the region. 'Our fields stretch 6 kilometers along the border, with only a makeshift barrier. It’s easy for anyone to cross if they want to,' he said. Meshli noted that there is little military presence in the area, forcing local communities to fund their emergency response teams and equipment. 'We’ve seen five drones flying over our fields at an altitude of 30 meters. We’re the buffer between the border and the Nof Adom school. The Jordanian forces seem serious—they’ve upgraded their patrols and vehicles. But we’re not sleeping well at night,' he added. Ronen Shoshani, a farmer and emergency response leader in Neot HaKikar, said the tension has altered his work habits. 'My farm is right on the border. I don’t go there at 5 a.m. anymore because I’m worried. I’m more alert and avoid being in the fields after dark,' he said. Elad Tavlan, a resident of Hatzeva in central Arava, pointed out that residents have had to take security into their own hands. 'There are hardly any soldiers here for routine security. Local residents could help fill the gap, whether through reserve duty or expanded emergency teams,' he suggested. He also noted increased Jordanian efforts to secure the border. 'We see small outposts turning into full military positions. Right across from my kitchen window is a new two-story Jordanian outpost built this past year. It’s comforting to see their presence since no one else is protecting us,' he said. Security plans delayed In October, Ynet revealed the IDF’s plan to close the border with Jordan, a project championed by Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Amir Baram. The plan included deploying advanced surveillance systems, and rapid-response units, and upgrading the physical barrier. However, it has been postponed indefinitely, despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge to allocate funds in the 2025 budget. During a September visit to the border, Netanyahu acknowledged the challenges. 'This is a border of peace, and we work with Jordan to keep it that way. But the threats are growing. Smugglers are trying to bring in weapons and terrorists. We will strengthen the barrier to stop this,' he said. Despite calls from local leaders, including Eilot Regional Council head Hanan Ginat, for immediate action, the government has yet to allocate the necessary resources. 'We must enhance both security and residents’ sense of safety,' Ginat said. In response to the growing threats, council leaders have formed a forum, led by Jordan Valley Regional Council head David Elhayani, to advocate for improved security measures. IDF responds to concerns In a statement, the IDF addressed the issues raised: 'The IDF adapts its defense plans according to evolving threats. Since the start of the war, the border has been reinforced with overt and covert surveillance systems that detect suspicious movements along its entire length. 'IDF forces are deployed along the border for defense and observation missions, based on existing force levels, and are prepared for any scenario.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'In recent months, construction of a fortified fence has begun near Arava communities. The IDF maintains regular communication with local security officials and counterpart organizations.' Residents remain vigilant For now, residents along the eastern border rely on their own resources and Jordanian patrols to maintain safety. However, the fragile peace remains under constant threat from both criminal smuggling and potential terrorist attacks. With delayed government action, the call for stronger border security grows louder, even as the region remains on edge. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjnbnzcvkl	2024-12-13T12:18:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/13/By6Xny5N1l/By6Xny5N1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US flies freed American Travis Timmerman out of Syria, official s...	US official says Timmerman was handed over to US troops at the Tanf garrison, located near the Syria-Iraq-Jordan border intersection, and flown out from there American citizen Travis Timmerman has been flown out of Syria, where he was imprisoned before being released by rebels this week, U.S. officials said on Friday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Timmerman had been transferred to Jordan and was currently with State Department officials. A second official said that Timmerman had been handed to U.S. troops at Tanf garrison, which is near the intersection of the borders of Syria, Iraq and Jordan, and was flown out from there. Timmerman went missing in June, according to his parents. He was freed from prison earlier in the week after Syrian rebel groups ousted the country's longtime President Bashar al-Assad. The White House on Thursday said that the United States had no prior indication that the American was in Syria. Assad fled to Russia after a 13-year civil war and more than five decades of his family's autocratic rule, during which Syria ran one of the most oppressive police states in the Middle East. Following his ouster, Syrians flocked to the infamous prisons where the Assad regime is estimated to have held tens of thousands of detainees.

Possible hostage deal? Khaled Mashal's brother released from US p...	After 16 years in prison, Mufid Abdel Qader, the half-brother of the senior Hamas leader, was released to a rehabilitation facility, possibly for a potential hostage deal Mufid Abdel-Qader, the half-brother of senior Hamas leader Khaled Mashal, has been released from U.S. prison after serving 16 years of a 20-year sentence. His release, initially to a rehabilitation facility for a year, comes as the U.S. and Israel say the chances of a hostage deal are increasing. Khaled Mashal, the former head of Hamas' political bureau, is one of the only surviving senior figures in the terror organization. However, it is currently unclear whether his half-brother's release is related to a comprehensive deal regarding a hostage deal that is taking shape. Mufid and others were convicted in 2008 of working for the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, the largest Muslim charity in the U.S. and in effect used to fund Hamas. Abdel-Qader claimed that he was a money-lender for the organization and served as the lead singer of a Palestinian band that performed to raise funds. He said he never imagined that he would be put behind bars because he wanted to help get people out of prison, out of poverty and out of hunger, he said at the hearing. The judge intervened and said he was not convicted for freedom of expression, but convicted of aiding Hamas. The five senior members of the organization were ultimately convicted of 108 charges, including aiding a terrorist organization, money laundering, and tax crimes after the U.S. attorney's office failed to convince a jury a year earlier that the organization had transferred more than $12 million to Hamas. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development activists were not convicted of direct involvement in the violence, but in addition to providing financial assistance to Hamas, they were convicted of funding the Palestinian organization's schools and welfare programs.

Under the Taliban’s auspices: ISIS and al-Qaeda gain strength aft...	Taliban, ISIS-K and al-Qaeda grow and branch out in Asia, Africa and the West under the guise of the terror greenhouse in Afghanistan, raising the concerns of its neighbors Both al-Qaeda and ISIS-K are growing After becoming established in Afghanistan, the strength of ISIS-K was gradually eroded because of limited support from local inhabitants, targeted assassinations by the United States, and their ongoing war with the Afghan army and the Taliban. Still, it would seem that the organization has to a large degree regrouped writes Eran Lahav. A U.N. report issued in June 2023 warned that since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, various terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda and ISIS-K have continued to grow and to improve their fighting capabilities. The report also showed that ISIS-K has exploited the Taliban’s ability to entrench its control of remote regions in Afghanistan. Thus in so doing, ISIS-K has managed to gain strength, prevent desertions, and ramp up attacks on senior Taliban officials. Al-Qaeda is now closely working with the Taliban There are indeed signs that the organization is coming back to life in Afghanistan. According to a June 2023 report by the U.N. Sanctions Committee, al-Qaeda has established new training facilities in the country’s Kunar and Nuristan Provinces. The Salafist organization is indeed now closer than ever before to the Taliban and the organization’s operatives are serving as members of the Taliban regime. After regaining control of the nation in August 2021, the Taliban has incorporated many groups listed as terrorist organizations, which fought with it against the U.S.-supported Afghani republic. Its relationship with al-Qaeda also did not end, and Bin Laden’s vision of a global caliphate based in Afghanistan has become the guiding principle of the war that has restored the Taliban to power. In fact, the Taliban provides al-Qaeda commanders and operatives with all they need, from weapons and living quarters, through passports and other documents, to access to the vast drug smuggling network constructed over decades in order to establish the heroin empire under the Taliban’s auspices. Terrorists from Yemen, Libya, and Somalia as well as Palestinians train in renewed training camps run by al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, which receives full backing from the renewed Taliban regime. It would seem that Afghanistan, which once sheltered Osama Bin Laden and the planners of the 9/11 attacks, is once again becoming a hotspot for global jihadist groups with worldwide ambitions. This phenomenon is a definite warning sign in Afghanistan. The European Islamist terrorist threat is acute Europe is increasingly worried given the Euro Cup being played in Germany and the Olympic Games in Paris. German Interior Minister Nany Faeser said that the Islamic State of Khorasan Province is presently the biggest Islamist threat to Germany and that the danger posed by Islamist terrorism is still acute. As a rule, ISIS-K is the most active and consistent branch of the Salafist organization on European soil. In the past year, ISIS-K has planned 21 attacks in nine European countries, compared to eight in the previous year. German security forces have indeed managed to foil some ISIS-K attack plots over the past 18 months. These intelligence successes, some of which took place in Austria, include the prevention of attacks targeting Christian sites at Christmas. In Vienna, three terrorists allegedly planning to attack St. Stephen’s Cathedral were arrested, while in Germany, four Tajiki terrorists planning to massacre the congregation attending services in the famous Cologne Cathedral on New Year’s Eve were successfully apprehended. ISIS-K claimed responsibility for Moscow attack The recent terrorist attack on a Moscow concert venue in March 2024, one of the deadliest in Russia in decades which saw 173 concertgoers killed, again refocused global attention on the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) which immediately claimed credit. What is less known is that on the same day the organization also carried out a suicide bombing in Kandahar, Afghanistan, which led to the deaths of 21 people. While ISIS and al-Qaeda are competing with one another throughout the world not just in Afghanistan, they are also gaining strength and recruiting operatives and supporters throughout the West As the U.S. redirects intelligence, terrorist groups exploit Afghanistan One of the reasons for ISIS-K’s resurgence of strength and the reawakening of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan is the fact that the United States redirected its intelligence resources in the Middle East and Southern Asia to focus on China and Russia. U.S. intelligence sources feel that unlike the growing strength of ISIS-K, al-Qaeda in Afghanistan has been waning without a senior leader since the assassination of Ayman al-Zawahiri in July 2022. While the United States is betting on other centers to deal with al-Qaeda, ISIS-K continues to attack many targets in Afghanistan. World leaders express their concern over mounting terrorism in Afghanistan Leaders of neighboring and regional nations, such as Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Central Asian states, have already expressed concern about the threat posed to them by the Taliban’s transnational ambitions in this regard as this hothouse of terrorism in Afghanistan is obviously gaining strength. Nonetheless, the West is yet again making the mistake of thinking that it can negotiate or otherwise interact with a radical organization such as the Taliban. Whilst it is true that the Taliban also fought ISIS, both organizations have the same goal: the establishment of a global Islamic caliphate. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Whoever thinks that if ISIS-K is defeated then ISIS and all its extensions will become a thing of the past, is not only mistaken but also misleading others. ISIS is gaining strength not only in Afghanistan but also primarily in Africa. While ISIS and al-Qaeda are competing with one another throughout the world not just in Afghanistan, they are also gaining strength and recruiting operatives and supporters throughout the West. The West must therefore realize that a new Afghanistan is liable to be created in Africa or in Asia at any time where it can attack Western targets at the time of its choosing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycyzutvje	2024-12-13T01:31:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/08/15/r18mACd2n/r18mACd2n_0_133_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Corruption and dependence on Iran and Hezbollah: How Assad's army...	Assad's allies helped him rule Syria, but as soon as they left, the army experienced massive desertions and the civil war was decided Farhan al-Khuli, 23, was drafted into the Syrian army, received meager pay, and was unmotivated to serve. His military post in Idlib was supposed to consist of nine soldiers but there were only three because the remaining six bribed their way out of service. One of the two soldiers who served with Farhan was declared by his commanders to be mentally unfit and not allowed to be entrusted with weapons. On Wednesday, November 27, after years of stagnation in the civil war, al-Khuli’s commander called him. The commander, who was in a different post, told him that a convoy of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebel group was rushing towards his post. He said he and his comrades should fight them. Al-Khuli switched his phone to flight mode, changed into civilian clothes, left his rifle in the field, and fled. As he walked south, he saw other groups of soldiers also abandoning their positions. Earlier this week, less than two weeks after the start of a surprise attack, the rebels managed to conquer Syria and defeat Bashar Assad who fled his country. The civil war ended in a resounding defeat for the Syrian army. Syrian officials, and commanders of pro-Iranian militias from Iraq, spoke to Reuters and described the collapse of the Syrian army. They describe low morale, corruption among military officers, and excessive dependence on allies who helped Assad in the war and were forced to change their priorities. Dependence on allies The extensive Russian aid, the manpower from Iran and Hezbollah, along with pro-Iranian militias, assisted Assad to control most of Syria. His allies provided him with elite fighters, and Iranian military advisers were responsible for a significant part of the Syrian army operations. In early April, after the attack in Damascus attributed to Israel that killed senior commanders in the Revolutionary Guards, many Iranian advisers left Syria. The rest deserted last week. Hezbollah fighters and their commanders left Syria in October to focus on the war against Israel in Lebanon. After the Iranians and Hezbollah deserted, the Syrian army was left without a coherent plan of action or defensive strategy, especially in Aleppo, Syria’s second largest city. In late November, when the rebels attacked the city, the forces on the ground were given no clear plan for how to defend it. They were forced to formulate such a plan themselves, or retreat to the strategic city of Homs in an attempt to regroup. Mass defection from the army Aleppo fell to the rebels without a real fight on November 29, just two days after the start of the surprise attack, and its fall devastated the Syrian army. The army on the ground was left with a disconnected, poorly trained, and understaffed army. Some officers released soldiers from service in exchange for bribes. Others told soldiers to go home and took their salaries. On November 28, the day after the start of the surprise attack, the Syrian army ordered all forces to be on full alert, ready for battle. On December 1, after a military post in southern Syria was captured by rebels without resistance, the regime threatened that soldiers who did not fight back would be punished. Despite the threats, more and more soldiers and officers began to desert from the army. Instead of confronting the rebels, the soldiers were seen abandoning their positions, changing into civilian clothes, and going home. The corruption of Syrian military officers Farhan al-Khuli's story, who deserted his post near Idlib, illustrates the problems of Assad’s army. Farhan was drafted at age 19 for 18 months of compulsory service. He was supposed to join at age 18, but managed to bribe an officer and delay his enlistment for a year. When his compulsory service ended, he was required to remain in the army indefinitely. He deserted but was caught, sent to prison for 52 days, and then sent to the northern post. Al-Khuli received a monthly military salary of 500,000 Syrian pounds ($40). He sometimes used his entire military salary to buy food, while some of his better-off comrades paid officers $100 to get out of the army. One source who spoke to Reuters described Assad’s reliance on conscripts as a 'fatal mistake.' Zuhair, a 28-year-old former soldier, told Reuters about the corruption of Syrian army officers. He said he saw them steal and sell generators and fuel which belonged to the army. 'All they cared about was exploiting their position to get rich,' he said. Zuhair fought for Assad’s regime for years, while his cousins fought with the rebels. When they quickly took control of Syria, he cheered them on. 'I can’t describe how happy I am,' he said. Iran and Hezbollah abandon Assad To fight the uprising against him, which began in 2011, Assad had relied on his allies. Russia sent warplanes to Syria to bomb rebel positions, Iran sent military advisers and Hezbollah forces have crossed the border from Lebanon into Syria to fight Assad's battles. Pro-Iranian militias from Iraq and Shiite fighters from Afghanistan have also been sent to the field. The fighters who came from outside were much more skilled than any Syrian soldier. An Iraqi militia commander who served near Aleppo said that during his service he knew a Syrian platoon that was supposed to have 30 soldiers, but in fact, only eight were present. The militia fighters invited those soldiers to eat with them, out of pity for the poor conditions and meager pay they received. Hezbollah and militia fighters treated Syrian army soldiers with disdain. They did not trust them in important operations and generally avoided fighting alongside them. Sources who spoke to Reuters said amid the war in Gaza, Israel increased its attacks on Iranian targets in the region, including Syria. This may have led to Iran reducing its presence in Syria in the months after the Hamas attack on October 7 last year. On April 1, senior commanders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards were killed in the Iranian consulate building in Damascus, significantly reducing the number of IRGC commanders in Syria. One of the Iraqi officials who spoke to Reuters said that the Syrian army’s operational command subsequently became ineffective, and when Hezbollah left in October. The situation shortly thereafter worsened and Assad’s army had no operational plan. The Russian military continued to attack rebels who were advancing on Hama and Homs from the air, but there were no soldiers on the ground to act.

Last Friday, after rebels captured Hama, militia fighters were told to leave.

Doxing, arson, and graffiti: Can Australia combat the surge in an...	Daniel Weil on the ILTV News podcast: The Jewish community is in shock The Australian Jewish community has faced some of the most severe violent antisemitic attacks since the October 7 war, including arson targeting synagogues, damage to property owned by Jewish parliament members, and threatening graffiti on several buildings. 'We’re not talking about just people marching in the streets or waving flags,' stressed Daniel Weil, chairman of the Liberal Friends of Israel in Victoria and an active member of the Australian Jewish community. Speaking on ILTV News' most recent podcast, Weil said, 'It has been a very trying time for the Jewish community and for the broader community as well, because what's been going on has not just been affecting the Jewish community, but it's been affecting everybody through these protests that we've been seeing, which has been the case all over the world.' Watch previous video podcasts: 'We are in the Beginning of a Third World War’ Jonathan Conricus: Iran’s Threats Are All Talk – Here’s Why Jonathan Pollard’s Bold Call: ‘Destroy Hezbollah or Retire’ Yehuda Kurtzer: What’s Driving Modern Antisemitism? Weil noted that the community was 'in shock' that such acts of antisemitism could occur in Australia, a country that for many years had been 'by and large a very tolerant, very friendly country.' Before the recent war, Australia had relatively few antisemitic incidents, Weil explained, adding that the government was unprepared for the sudden spike. As a result, its response has been mostly 'reactionary,' with few preexisting policies in place that could have mitigated the situation. 'We're seeing now governments really responding by trying to set up things like antisemitism task forces, and looking at changing laws to protect places of worship. But a lot of it's very reactionary,' Weil said. Another challenge has been the rise of doxing. Weil described a significant incident about six months ago, where roughly 700 members of the Jewish community in a WhatsApp group discussing antisemitism in Australia had their messages leaked. Many had their personal details shared publicly, leading to death threats and damage to their businesses. In response to that incident, the Federal government implemented changes to make doxing a criminal offense, Weil explained. Weil is currently in Israel as part of a delegation hosted by DiploAct. He is traveling with several current and former Australian parliament members, as well as political candidates. Despite the rise in antisemitism, he affirmed that Australia remains a key ally of the State of Israel. 'Both our countries are built on Judeo-Christian values,' Weil said. 'It is really a minority of people that have been causing a lot of the issues.' He added, 'The Israeli people, and Israel as a country, can continue to rely on Australia going forward as a very, very strong ally.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjub6vf4kl	2024-12-12T23:21:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/HJdFNeNE1x/HJdFNeNE1x_0_19_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

'Behind us, we have one of the most important treasures that I have ever handled,' said Sharon Liberman Mintz, Sotheby’s International Senior Specialist for Judaica. 'It is the earliest stone tablet of the 10 Commandments. It dates back to the late Roman Byzantine period from over 1,500 years ago.' Weighing 115 pounds and standing about two feet tall, the marble tablet was unearthed in 1913 during railway excavations along Israel's southern coast. Remarkably, its significance remained overlooked for decades. Notably, this tablet features only nine of the traditional commandments. The third commandment, 'Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,' was replaced with a directive to worship. This extraordinary relic is expected to fetch between $1 million and $2 million at auction.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ubhwt41x	2024-12-12T22:45:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/13/HJ00Z8DFEJe/HJ00Z8DFEJe_0_14_632_356_0_small.jpg
Here's how AI can predict and preempt medical emergencies	New system developed by IDF’s 8200 intelligence unit reduces response times to under 90 seconds New technology developed by the IDF’s 8200 intelligence unit and United Hatzalah’s Operations and Technology Department can predict and preempt medical emergencies with over 90% accuracy in major cities, according to Dovie Maisel, vice president of operations for United Hatzalah. Speaking to ILTV News, Maisel said that by analyzing 18 years of data, the AI positions ambulances, medicycles, and volunteers closer to potential emergencies, significantly reducing response times to under 90 seconds. Faced with the challenge of over 7,000 volunteers being drafted during national crises, United Hatzalah collaborated with AI experts and volunteers to develop this system. EMTs have reported that the tool allows responders to save more lives and optimize their shifts.

Women in reserves: 'My husband says he's a reservist's wife'	Hundreds of thousands of reservists include many wives and mothers who leave the childcare to their husbands and spend countless days in uniform Major (res.) S., who serves in a classified position, cannot tell her children why she disappears for an extended period of time. Major (res.) Noa Tom's children think their mother is 'on vacation in the army,' when she sleeps in a tent for months. Yiftah, Eti, and Negev love their grandparents very much, but there is no substitute for their mother, Major (res.) A., and father, Major (res.) Assaf who were drafted into the reserves when the war broke out. First Master Sergeant (res.) Tzlil Fadael, who was exempted from reserves as a mother of three children, fought to enlist in the war during which she gave birth to her fourth child, Ilai. The women who gave the country so much share the difficulties of long reserve service, the support they receive at home, and their surroundings that did not always look favorably on their reserve service. Major (res.) S. and her children Koren, 15 and Inbar, 13 from Ein HaBesor S. 44, who serves as an operations officer in a classified unit, has already completed more than 300 days in the reserves since October 7. As soon as she landed in Israel on October 7 from a vacation abroad, she drove from the airport to Ofakim and joined the efforts at a Magen David Adom station. Throughout her flight until Sunday night, her children Koren and Inbar were besieged in their father's home in Ein HaBesor. 'Just before we took off, they managed to tell me that they heard gunshots and shouting in Arabic outside the window,' she said. 'I asked them to hide. I was completely helpless. As far as I was concerned, I wouldn't have children when I landed.' After a sleepless night in an ambulance, between evacuating the wounded and providing treatment on the ground, S. went to meet her rescued children. 'It was a great relief, I could breathe again,' she says. Since then, the two haven't gotten to see their mother much, as she travels between bases across the country. 'I'm doing something big, but I can't share anything with them, it's a bit of a challenge,' she adds. Koren shares that she misses her mother especially when she started in the new school in Tel Aviv to which they were evacuated, or during her 15th birthday. 'When she comes back, I filter out some of the things not to burden her, she's busy enough,' Koren says. Inbar admits that he occasionally gets annoyed when he can't reach his mother on the phone, but reminds her that 'she's doing something important and will get back to me.' Koren identifies with the feelings: 'Mom helps make a better future for the country.' In the meantime, the family helps as much as possible, including grandparents who were evacuated from Kibbutz Magen. 'When reservists ask me, 'Who's with the kids at home?', I ask them who's with their kids. Works every time,' S. concludes. Major (res.) Noa Tom and her children Gali, 8, Omer, 5, and Yuval, 2.5 from Zikhron Ya'akov 'I have been serving in the reserves for 20 years, I was also called up in the Second Lebanon War,' says Major Noa Tom, 41, a training officer in the 55th Division. 'The children are used to seeing their mother in uniform, but not with this intensity. Now it's really like I'm back in service.' For more than a year, she has accompanied the forces, moving between the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, sleeping in a tent for months. 'The division is made up mainly of men, from the soldier to the division commander,' she says, 'I am usually the only woman in the room.' Then she adds, 'I would like to live in a world where there is no need to make articles about mothers in the reserves, it would be obvious that both mother and father work, raise children, and serve in the reserves. This way, they'll stop telling my husband, 'Great job with the kids,' and telling me, 'Thank you for your service.'' On October 7, Noa packed a bag, said goodbye to her husband and children, and left for the unit. 'They're lucky because dad is softer than mom, he's the best,' she says humorously. Since then, every time she packs a bag and takes her weapon, 'the kids understand that my time at home is over and I'm going back to the army. There is a lot of crying so I calm them down and promise to come back.' Five-year-old Omer says that she is 'on vacation in the army.' Eight-year-old Gali says, 'Mom teaches the soldiers to fight. When Mom is away, I miss her very much and am afraid that something will happen to her, that she will be hit by a missile. I miss her every night when I want her to kiss me goodnight.' Omer adds, 'It's also fun with Dad, who takes us to the playground a lot.' Major (res.) A. and her children Yiftah, 9, Eti, 7, and Negev, 5, from a moshav in central Israel When the war broke out, A. and her husband, Major (res.) Assaf, put on uniforms. She is a flight controller in the Air Force and he is a combat soldier. They left their three children and five dogs at home in a moshav in central Israel. 'Thank God there are grandparents,' says A. and proudly describes her work: 'I am responsible for managing Israel's airspace. I am 24/7 on alert, identifying threats in the area and building an aerial assessment.' Due to her role, she is also responsible for coordinating ground forces. 'I knew where my husband was at all times,' she says. 'On the one hand, I had to stay focused on the mission, on the other hand, I was afraid when he was in the field. In any unusual event or evacuation of wounded soldiers, I had to disconnect my emotions.' A. says that the most significant challenge is the transitions. 'From dealing with human lives and missions of national importance, I go back to a pile of laundry and grocery shopping.' She also hasn't forgotten the criticism she received in the first months of the war, saying that it doesn't make sense for children to grow up with grandparents. 'My mother is in the children's school WhatsApp groups,' A. says, 'When I come home, she makes sure I know what to send to school with them.' Nine-year-old Yiftah says, 'Mom tells the planes where to fly and dad is fighting in Gaza. In one moment, both my parents went from their jobs to the army and have been in the reserves ever since. It's hard because they're not with me, or they come for a while. In the meantime, I'm with my grandparents, whom I love very much, but they can't replace my parents. I'm waiting for the war to end and for us to go back to being a family like we were before.' First Master Sergeant (res.) Tzlil Padael and her children Imri, 7, Lishai, 3.5, Ofri, 2, and Ilai (5 weeks old) from Pardesiya Before October 7, Tzlil was exempt from reserve service as a mother of three children. 'I quickly started looking for a way to return to service,' she says, 'there was no question at all.' Since she was assigned a position, she has been serving as an adjutant of the Be'eri Battalion. 'The battalion, which was established after the outbreak of the war, is made up of former combat soldiers from special units who have reached the exemption age,' she says, 'They are 40 and older, parents of children, senior managers who could not stand by. They are fighting in Rafah and the Netzarim corridor.' Tzlil, 36, says 'My husband goes around saying that he is the wife of a reservist. Basically, he raised three small children alone.' A month after starting her service, Tzlil discovered that she was pregnant. 'It was hard for Itamar that I insisted on continuing, but he quickly realized that there was no way I would stop,' she adds, 'Until the seventh month, when my belly started to stick out, no one even noticed the pregnancy.' On the morning of November 5, she was taken to Hadassah Ein Kerem. After 40 minutes in the delivery room, Ilai was born. 'The first person to know that I had given birth was my commander,' Tzlil says. 'When I was discharged from the hospital, I went straight to the base to make sure everything was okay.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She plans to cut her maternity leave, which is supposed to end in February. She now voluntarily travels to her base three times a week to visit. 'At first, they thought it was a gimmick,' Tzlil says, 'that I would want to go back to the children at home very soon. I received a lot of comments. At first, I would argue, but today people have stopped commenting. My place, even among the soldiers, is clear.' Seven-year-old Imri says 'There is no other child in my class whose mother is in the reserves, but my friends' fathers go to the army. Mom is going to the army so there will be someone to take care of us. Mom is fighting bad people, along with my uncle Gidi. I'm glad she's there, even though I miss her and she doesn't always answer me when I ask her when she's coming back. But I trust her to do her best.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjgxruy4yl	2024-12-12T22:29:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/HkDYJAIEyg/HkDYJAIEyg_0_67_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Turkey sends intelligence head to Syria in bid to secure country'...	Erdogan reaches for foothold in the region, sending to first official to post-Assad Syria; Blinken heads to Ankara to discuss future with US-backed Kurdish fighters Four days after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, Turkey became the first country to send a senior official to Damascus, seemingly in a bid to quickly secure a foothold in the country’s shaping future. Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin was in Damascus on Thursday, two sources with knowledge of the visit said, for what the Syrian information ministry said would be talks involving its new rebel leadership. The ministry said that Kalin and Qatar's head of state security, Khalfan al-Kaabi, arrived in the capital to meet with Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani and caretaker prime minister Mohammad al-Bashir. Turkey's foreign ministry denied the Syrian ministry's additional notice that Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan was also in Damascus for talks, saying he remained in Turkey. Fidan attended events in Ankara on Thursday including the arrival of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and is to meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Ankara on Friday. Doha did not immediately confirm that Kaabi had arrived. The fall of Assad's regime, which dealt a blow to its patrons in Russia and Iran, has created strategic opportunities in the region for countries like Turkey, the U.S. and Israel. Throughout the 13-year civil war, Turkey, which shares a border with northern Syria, was one of the main backers of the rebels against Assad and is believed to have played a role in the recent blitz attack that toppled the regime. A friendly regime in Damascus could advance Turkey's interests, particularly against the Kurds in northern Syria near its border, as well as in its dealings with Israel. Kalin's visit would be the first by a senior foreign official to Damascus since rebels toppled former president Bashar Assad on Sunday, ending his family's 50-year rule in a swift takeover after 13 years of civil war. The Turkish intelligence agency MIT did not immediately comment on the visit. Turkish news outlet Yeni Safak and broadcaster TVNet published a video of Kalin at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus with heavy security. A Reuters reporter saw at least one car moving toward the mosque amid heavy security and large crowds but it was not immediately clear who was inside the car. Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammad al-Golani, leads the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former affiliate of al Qaida, that spearheaded the overthrow of Assad. Both NATO allies supported the rebels during Syria's civil war, but their interests diverged regarding one particular faction: the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Led by the Kurdish militia People's Defense Units (YPG), which Turkey considers a branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist group, the SDF is a key U.S. ally in its fight against the Islamic State (ISIS). With ISIS still present in eastern Syria, Blinken recently warned that the conflict could embolden the terror group. Blinken's visit to Turkey comes after Turkish-backed rebels captured the northern city of Manbij from the SDF, which has also withdrawn from Tell Rifaat and parts of Aleppo since the rebel offensive began. Turkey also attacked YPG positions in recent days, destroying 12 missile trucks in northeastern Syria. A Turkish official said that Syria will be the focus of Friday’s discussions between Blinken and Fidan, with Turkey ready to support a stable and secure Syria under a representative government. However, Fidan is expected to stress Turkey's sensitivities regarding northern Syria. Diplomatic sources told Arab media outlet Asharq Al-Awsat that Turkey will demand a 'clear stance' from the U.S. regarding its support for the SDF. A senior Turkish military official reiterated that 'Turkey has repeatedly told the U.S. that one terror group (ISIS) cannot be eradicated by using another terror group (the Kurds).' Meanwhile, Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that Iran's Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani visited Iraq to meet with leaders of pro-Iranian militias to discuss developments in Syria and ongoing Israeli strikes. According to the report, some pro-Iranian militia leaders expressed their commitment to Iraq's neutral stance on the Syrian crisis, opting to wait and see how events unfold rather than opening new fronts. Russia, Assad’s staunch ally throughout the conflict, announced on Thursday that it has begun direct contacts with Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) political wing. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said that Moscow aims to maintain its military presence in western Syria to continue 'fighting international terrorism.'

Paraguayan embassy reopens in Jerusalem, 6th country to do so	The president of the South American country inaugurated the Paraguayan embassy on Har Hotzvim in Jerusalem, 6 years after it opened in the capital and was moved to Tel Aviv after only 4 months; Hope in Israel: Argentina next in line Paraguayan President Santiago Peña reopened the Paraguayan embassy on Har Hotzvim in Jerusalem Thursday, six years after it was moved to Tel Aviv. The opening ceremony of the new embassy was attended by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana and Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion. 'I was saddened that it was closed,' Peña said, 'and I am very happy that it is happening now.' After the embassy opening event, Netanyahu held a private meeting with Peña in his office, during which the president invited the prime minister to visit Paraguay. From there, the two continued on to a reception at the Foreign Ministry, during which a signing ceremony was held for several memoranda of understanding and bilateral agreements. Peña said that it was a great privilege for him to make the decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem. 'I was very happy to see that during the time that I was minister of finance, the government of Paraguay took a very bold decision, a very ambitious decision to open the Paraguayan embassy in Jerusalem,' he said. 'I was very sad a couple months later when a new administration, driven mostly by revenge, an internal revenge, nothing to do with the people of Israel, decided to move it back. I am very happy that this is taking place in this very moment that the world is living, where a lot of people talk but not many people act. For us, not only saying but doing is very important.' Netanyahu acknowledged the appeal. 'You recognize the truth here: Jerusalem is Israel’s capital. It will always be Israel’s capital. It will be the undivided capital of Israel; it will never change. This is a fact and you recognize it and we recognize the fact that you speak out and stand up for that because of the common values,' the prime minister said. The story of Israel is a parable for all nations. Because if the Jewish people were able to not merely survive but to ford the torrential river between annihilation and salvation, to reconstitute our life here, to rebuild our capital, to be a thriving power and a thriving innovator for humanity. This means that there is hope for all nations of the world.' Paraguay is the sixth country to open an embassy in Jerusalem after the U.S., Guatemala, Kosovo, Honduras and Papua New Guinea. Israel hopes that Argentina will be the seventh country to move its embassy to the capital, and Argentine President Javier Milei, who is considered an Israel-lover, is expected to visit next month, where he will reiterate his promise to move the embassy. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Paraguayan embassy had already opened in Jerusalem in 2018, after the U.S. moved its embassy to the capital, and it was then the third embassy to open in the city. Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes, who was a friend of Israel, came to Jerusalem to inaugurate the embassy in a festive ceremony and was even invited a year later by Netanyahu to the torch-lighting ceremony on Mount Herzl. But four months later, a new left-wing president, Abdo Benitez, was elected to lead Paraguay and he reversed his predecessor's decision, claiming that 'Paraguay wants to contribute to increasing regional diplomatic efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.' Israel was outraged by the decision, and Netanyahu ordered the Israeli ambassador to the capital, Asuncion, to be recalled for consultations, and ordered the Israeli embassy to be closed. In August last year, following Peña's victory in the elections, he announced that Paraguay would move its embassy 'this year' to Jerusalem, and Israel also reopened its embassy in Asuncion. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjve11r00vje	2024-12-12T12:29:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/12/rkJJFv004yl/rkJJFv004yl_0_278_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Biden sets record for number of pardons, commutations in one day	Weeks before the end of his term, the president announced pardons for 39 Americans and commuted the sentences of 1,500 serving long prison terms; 'They have proven they deserve a second chance'; Comes weeks after he granted a pardon to his son, who was convicted of weapons and drug offenses and is in Trump's sights Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he is commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. The names of the convicts who received pardons were not released. Clemency is the term for the power the president has to pardon, in which a person is relieved of guilt and punishment, or to commute a sentence, which reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn’t exonerate the wrongdoing. The US Constitution gives the president the authority to grant pardons, and toward the end of their term, presidents usually announce a series of pardons for convicted criminals. This time, the scope of the pardons and the commutation of sentences is exceptional: The White House said that this was the largest single-day act of clemency in modern American history. \ Biden's series of pardons comes more than a week after the outgoing president's controversial decision to pardon his son, Hunter. Biden's son was convicted of drug and weapons offenses, but his father pardoned him, despite promising not to interfere in the trial. The decision made by the outgoing president this month drew harsh criticism against him in the United States. Before pardoning his son, Biden had repeatedly pledged not to do so. He said in a statement explaining his reversal that the prosecution had been poisoned by politics. Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. 'America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,' Biden said in a statement. 'As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses.' The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before leaving office in 2017. White House lawyers said those pardoned by Biden were convicted of non-violent crimes, such as drug offenses. Those whose sentences were commuted were those who were serving long prison sentences and were sent to house arrest during the coronavirus pandemic, when the pandemic raged in U.S. prisons and one in five prisoners contracted the virus. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Biden and his team believe the justice system has wronged those prisoners and sentenced them to too harsh a sentence. 'They have shown that they deserve a second chance,' the outgoing president said. He believes that if they were convicted today, their sentences would be shorter given the laws, policies and procedures of 2024. Biden has promised to announce more pardons in the coming weeks. He is under pressure from advocacy groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January. He’s also weighing whether to issue preemptive pardons to those who investigated Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and are facing possible retribution when he takes office. The president had previously issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons. He’s also broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia, and pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1fznt004kl	2024-12-12T11:29:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/ry1csPX4kl/ry1csPX4kl_0_142_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
UN food agency faces challenges in Syria	The U.N. food agency is trying to deal with massive needs in Syria not only from escalating war-related food insecurity and an upsurge in displaced people fleeing Lebanon but also the dramatically new environment following the ouster of Bashar Assad, a senior U.N. official says. 'It's a triple crisis and the needs are going to be massive,' said Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the World Food Program, in an interview with The Associated Press late Wednesday. The WFP estimated that 3 million people in Syria are 'acutely food insecure' and very hungry. However, that estimate was made before the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon pushed many Syrian refugees back to their home country, plus the instability caused by the overthrow of Assad. Due to funding cuts, the WFP had been targeting only 2 million of those people, he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hygbqpu4jl	2024-12-12T11:12:01-08:00	
7-week cease-fire: Hamas hostage deal talks continue as Sullivan ...	U.S. national security advisor and Biden's Middle East envoy meet with Netanyahu and security officials to discuss war, Iran and hostage deal amid optimism that agreement close to completion U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and U.S. President Joe Biden's Middle East envoy Brett McGurk, met on Thursday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several senior Israeli officials, including Mossad chief David Barnea and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar, to discuss advancing normalization with Saudi Arabia, the cease-fire in Lebanon and the situation in Syria. Sullivan is expected to continue meetings in Qatar and Egypt. Barnea met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani in Doha to discuss advancing a hostage deal on Wednesday, about two weeks after a secret meeting held in Vienna. Optimism and progress have been reported following the talks, with one indication of the seriousness of the talks being the near-total secrecy surrounding the matter – partly to prevent internal political pressures on Netanyahu. Qatar is currently the main mediator for the deal, with the outgoing U.S. administration cooperating fully with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration to achieve a humanitarian agreement before Trump’s inauguration in January. Reports indicated the deal is likely to proceed in stages, beginning under the Biden administration and continuing under Trump's. The first phase is a humanitarian one and will involve the release of hostages in exchange for a seven-week cease-fire. Such a deal could pave the way for broader agreements, including ending the war and normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 'It’s estimated that the process will continue after the humanitarian releases; the key is getting the parties committed,' an Israeli official said. However, it remains unclear whether Hamas will agree to a smaller deal without ending the war. Contradictory reports have emerged, with some suggesting Hamas is willing to allow a limited Israeli presence in Gaza while others claim Israel has agreed to a temporary withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor, though this remains unverified. Israeli assessments suggest a deal could be reached within two weeks. Meanwhile, families of American-Israeli hostages met with Michael Waltz, slated to become Trump’s national security advisor. The families urged Waltz to support Netanyahu and empower him to move forward with the deal, stressing the need to 'conclude the deal and not succumb to [Itamar] Ben-Gvir and [Bezalel] Smotrich.' Estimations indicated the U.S. is incorporating the issue of normalization with Saudi Arabia to help Netanyahu achieve a historic agreement and overcome domestic political challenges. Against the backdrop of progress in the hostage negotiations, Sullivan visited Israel. He addressed his meeting with Netanyahu at a press conference concluding his visit, saying: 'A cease-fire and a hostage deal would start bringing those hostages home. It would also allow for a massive surge in humanitarian assistance.' 'We discussed this, steps already taken to expand aid flow and further measures required. The U.S. stands by Israel and seeks to reduce civilian suffering wherever it takes place,' he added. When asked if Netanyahu is waiting for Trump to finalize a deal, Sullivan responded, 'I believe every day brings new risks, so urgency is essential. We've seen the tragic deaths of hostages. I didn’t get that impression; I think Netanyahu wants a deal.' 'My goal in Doha is to close a deal this month. We were close before but didn’t succeed. I can’t promise, but I wouldn’t be here if I thought this would drag on until January 20 – we’ll use every day to it’s fullest,' he said. Sullivan noted a shift in Hamas' stance following the Israel-Lebanon cease-fire. 'For months, Hamas waited for players and forces to come to its rescue. Once we reached a cease-fire, the negotiations took on a different tone,' he said. 'We’re working to finalize a hostage deal that will end the war and reunite the hostages with their families. It’s time to finish the job.' He added that he met with families of American hostages, pledging, 'I’ll do everything in my power to bring your loved ones home.' Sullivan highlighted his seventh visit to Israel as national security advisor, recalling his October 18 visit last year alongside Biden to send a strong message of support to Israel. 'A year later, I was with the president in the situation room where he directed the military to take direct action to defend Israel against Iran’s attacks. American aircraft helped intercept ballistic missiles,' he said. He stressed the broader context of the conflict, saying, 'People forget the basic fact of this conflict — Israel didn’t seek or start this war. Hamas initiated it by invading Israel and Iran chose to escalate it into a multi-front war.'

Sullivan stressed the importance of continued pressure on Iran and vigilance against its threats, saying, 'The U.S. will never allow Tehran to obtain nuclear weapons.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk2tti00njl	2024-12-12T11:06:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/10/rkxkiHCbJg/rkxkiHCbJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
No evidence New Jersey drone sightings pose security threat, Whit...	The U.S. government has no evidence that drone sightings reported in New Jersey pose a national security or a public safety threat, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Thursday. Speaking at a press briefing, Kirby said the drone sightings highlight an oversight gap, and he urged Congress to pass legislation to expand the ability of authorities to identify and counter drones that are a threat to airports or other critical infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating the sightings and working with state and local law enforcement using 'numerous detection methods,' Kirby said. The Pentagon has said an initial assessment had shown the drones were not from another country and that the U.S. military had not shot them down because they did not pose a threat to any military installations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkmlt2unye	2024-12-12T10:44:48-08:00

Netanyahu takes his case directly to the Iranian people, again	Your regime is terrified of you, the people of Iran': Prime minister releases a video in English addressed to the Iranian people, in which he states that 'just as we want peace with you, you want peace with us' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the citizens of Iran Thursday evening, in light of the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, and emphasized that 'Israel wants peace. We want peace with all those who truly want peace with us.' 'I have no doubt that you, the people of Iran, know this. I know that just as we want peace with you, you want peace with us. But you suffer under the rule of a regime that subjugates you and threatens us,' Netanyahu also said. In a video he posted in English with Arabic subtitles, the prime minister added that the regime in Iran 's terrified of you, the people of Iran. And one day, I know that. One day this will change. One day Iran will be free. Women, Life, Freedom.' 'That is the future of Iran' Netanyahu continued. 'That is the future of peace. And I have no doubt that we will realize that future together – a lot sooner than people think. I know and I believe we will transform the Middle East into a beacon of prosperity, progress and peace.' The prime minister acknowledged the unprecedented chain of events in recent days in Syria in the opening of his message. 'As we see history unfold before our very eyes, I can only imagine what you're feeling right now,' he said. He noted that 'your oppressors spent over $30 billion supporting Assad in Syria. Today, after only 11 days of fighting, his regime collapsed into dust. Your oppressors spent billions supporting Hamas in Gaza.' Regarding support for Hamas in the Gaza Strip, he added, 'Your oppressors spent billions supporting Hamas in Gaza. Today their regime lies in ruins.' The 'tyrants from Iran' also invested more than $20 billion in support of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Netanyahu noted, adding that: 'In a matter of weeks, most of Hezbollah’s leaders, its rockets and thousands of its terrorists went up in smoke. The money your oppressors stole from you literally went up in smoke.' Netanyahu continued: 'You must be furious imagining the new roads, schools, hospitals that could have been built with the tens of billions of dollars your dictators wasted backing terrorists who lose over and over and over again.' Netanyahu rhetorically asked if the Iranians know why their oppressors keep losing. 'It's not only because they are incompetent and cruel. They are. It's because they seek to conquer other nations, to impose fundamentalist tyranny on the Middle East - on the entire world. The only thing Israel seeks is to defend our state. But in so doing, we're defending civilization against barbarism.' He said that the 'historic events we witness today' are a 'chain reaction to the pounding of Hamas, the decimation of Hezbollah, the targeting of Nasrallah, the blows we delivered to the Iran regime's axis of terror. And all this came as President Trump pointed out this week, 'because of Israel and its fighting success.'' About two and a half months ago, Netanyahu also directly addressed the Iranians, effectively asking them to rebel against the regime. 'Don't let a small group of fanatic theocrats crush your hopes and your dreams. You deserve better. Your children deserve better. The entire world deserves better,' he said then. 'The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you. May we together know a future of prosperity and peace.' 'I speak a lot about the leaders of Iran. Yet at this pivotal moment, I want to address you – the people of Iran. I want to do so directly, without filters, without middlemen,' he said. 'Every day, you see a regime that subjugates you, makes fiery speeches about defending Lebanon, defending Gaza. Yet every day, that regime plunges our region deeper into darkness and deeper into war. Every day, their puppets are eliminated. Ask Mohammed Deif. Ask Nasrallah,' he said, referring to Israel's killing of leaders of Iranian terror proxies. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He then threatened the ayatollahs again, saying that: 'There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country. With every passing moment, the regime is bringing you — the noble Persian people — closer to the abyss. The vast majority of Iranians know their regime doesn't care a whit about them. If it did care, if it cared about you, it would stop wasting billions of dollars on futile wars across the Middle East. It would start improving your lives.' He described a world in which Iran and Israel are at peace, instead of Iranian citizens living in 'endless poverty, repression and war.' 'Don't let a small group of fanatic theocrats crush your hopes and your dreams. You deserve better. Your children deserve better. The entire world deserves better,' he said, concluding: 'The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you. May we together know a future of prosperity and peace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bypdk300vkg	2024-12-12T10:41:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/29/HJ9L7sUCA/HJ9L7sUCA_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Nasrallah's daughter: 'Israeli perception that my father spent hi...	Zeinab Nasrallah says in interview to terror group-affiliated outlet that her father lived among the Lebanese people and only hid in a bunker during war Zeinab Nasrallah, daughter of former Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, asserted in a recent interview that 'the Israeli perception that my father spent his entire life in a bunker is completely incorrect.' She explained he was in the bunker where he was eliminated last September in Beirut’s Dahieh district 'only during the war.' In an interview with Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Nour radio, she said that her father lived among the people and resided on upper floors 'where he could see them, even if they couldn't see him.' She added that it makes sense for an operations room managing a war to be secure and that every person, even a commander, must protect his life. Zeinab Nasrallah gained attention during the war months when she visited the family of former Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash, to offer her condolences. She was accompanied by the daughter of Hezbollah's previous leader Abbas al-Musawi, who was assassinated in 1992. Zeinab, Nasrallah's only daughter, is married. Her elder brother, Hadi Nasrallah, was a Hezbollah operative who died in an IDF operation in 1997. Nasrallah’s formal funeral arrangements have yet to be announced. Meanwhile, the location of his assassination in Beirut has become a pilgrimage site. Nasrallah was eliminated on September 27. The site, once Hezbollah's central command, remains a rubble-filled area that has yet to be restored. Despite the destruction, Hezbollah supporters hold events there and visit daily. A few days ago, a commemorative event titled 'Light from Light' (*Nur Min Nur* in Arabic) was held at the site in Nasrallah's memory. Hundreds attended, carrying pictures of the former secretary-general, waving the terror organization’s flags and lighting candles. The entire area was illuminated with strong red lighting that bathed the ruins. Speeches eulogizing Nasrallah and slogans calling to follow his path were heard in the background. The event also featured recordings of Nasrallah's voice. Numerous media outlets, both local and foreign, covered the gathering. Saudi network Al-Arabiya reported from the site last Wednesday. According to the outlet, Nasrallah’s supporters and followers of all ages have visited the site in recent days. Hezbollah raised its yellow flags alongside images of Nasrallah and the late head of its executive council, Hashem Safieddine, who was killed last October. Banners with the captions 'We won' were displayed but don’t reflect the reality in the district, where dozens of destroyed buildings have turned into open lots.

Russia in contact with Syrian rebels, hopes to keep military base...	odionov, Editing by Ron Popeski and Rod Nickel)Russia has established direct contacts with the political committee of Syria's Islamist rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov as saying on Thursday. Bogdanov, speaking to journalists, also said that Moscow aimed to maintain its military bases in Syria to continue 'fighting international terrorism.' Bogdanov said contacts with HTS, the most powerful force in the country after the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad, were 'proceeding in constructive fashion.' Bogdanov said Russia hoped to maintain its two bases in Syria - a naval base in Tartous and the Khmeimim Air Base near the port city of Latakia - to keep up efforts against international terrorism. 'The bases are still there, where they were on Syrian territory. No other decisions have been made for the moment,' he was quoted as saying. 'They were there at the Syrians' request with the aim of fighting terrorists from the Islamic State. I am proceeding on the basis of the notion that everyone agrees that the fight against terrorism, and what remains of IS, is not over.' Maintaining that fight, he said, 'requires collective efforts and in this connection, our presence and the Khmeimim base played an important role in the context of the overall fight against international terrorism.'

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan defended Israel's operations in Syria since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad, saying on Thursday it had a right to defend itself from risks to its security. 'What Israel is doing is trying to identify potential threats, both conventional and weapons of mass destruction, that could threaten Israel, and, frankly threaten others as well,' Sullivan told a press conference in Tel Aviv following a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In the aftermath of Assad's flight from Syria, Israeli jets and missile ships hit military targets including fighter jets, helicopters, naval vessels, missile stores and weapons manufacturing sites to stop them from falling into the hands of the rebel forces that toppled Assad. Sullivan said the situation in Syria presented a range of risks 'including the potential for fracture in that state'. He added that power vacuums could give room for terrorist groups to grow and said the new power in Damascus could be hostile to neighbors including Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjtq0ooeyl	2024-12-12T09:41:59-08:00

A keffiyeh in the Vatican's Nativity scene raises eyebrows, then ...	The Pope led services over the weekend in front of a manger scene in which baby Jesus was placed on a keffiyeh, the central symbol of the Palestinians and of anti-Israel protests; By Wednesday, the keffiyeh had disappeared; It isn't clear if it will return in time for Christmas Italian media outlets have once again focused on Pope Francis' attitude toward the war between Israel and Hamas, after reporters who attended his weekly general audience Wednesday at the Vatican discovered that an item that appeared in a previous prayer service held by the Pope which caused a stir was missing: a Palestinian kaffiyeh. The keffiyeh had been draped over the manger that holds the baby Jesus. The wooden Nativity scene in the Vatican’s main audience hall had generated headlines when it was unveiled December 7 because of the presence of the keffiyeh, the black-and-white checkered headscarf that has become a potent symbol of the Palestinian cause. Pope Francis had prayed before the creche briefly that day when he greeted the artists and donors responsible for all the Vatican’s Christmas decorations this year, which include various depictions of the manger in a Bethlehem stable where Jesus is said to have been born. This year, the Nativity scenes were made by Bethlehem-based artisans. Representatives of the Palestinian Embassy to the Holy See, as well as special representatives of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, had been on hand at the Vatican that day for the unveiling. By Wednesday, when Francis was seen again in the audience hall, the keffiyeh, manger and infant Jesus had been removed from the Nativity scene, while the figures of parents Mary and Joseph remained. While it is tradition in the Vatican for the infant Jesus to only be placed in the manger on December 24, when Catholics celebrate the birth of Jesus, often the mangers remain in the scenes empty until that date. The Christ figure had apparently been placed in the manger on December 7 to show off the finished product while the donors, artisans and Pope were there to see it. A Palestinian official said the Vatican had removed the keffiyeh without explanation, and it was unclear whether it would be restored on Christmas Eve. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA, in its report on the unveiling, noted the significance of the Jesus figure being wrapped in a keffiyeh. During the encounter with the Christmas donors, Francis again referred to the 'martyred Palestine' and, noting the broader conflict, repeated his call for an end to war. The Holy Land, including Bethlehem, is home to a small Christian community. 'Let us remember the brothers and sisters who, instead, right there and in other parts of the world, are suffering from the tragedy of war,' he said. 'With tears in our eyes, let us raise our prayer for peace. Brothers and sisters, enough war, enough violence!' Francis has called for Hamas to release hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but he has long been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. He recently caused an uproar when he called for an investigation to determine if Israel’s attacks in Gaza constituted genocide. Two Palestinian children presented the Pope with a 'Bethlehem Star' award, which WAFA said was a 'powerful reminder of the suffering and sorrow endured by Palestinian children amid the ongoing Israeli war and blockade in Gaza.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Israeli Embassy to the Holy See declined to comment on whether it had complained about the keffiyeh creche or asked for it to be removed. Vatican officials merely recalled Vatican tradition that calls for the infant Jesus to only appear in the manger on Christmas Eve. PLO executive committee member Ramzi Khoury who attended the unveiling, expressed deep gratitude for what he said was the Pope’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and his tireless efforts to end the war on Gaza and promote justice, WAFA said. Coincidentally, Francis on Thursday is due to meet Abbas, the Palestinian president, at the Vatican. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjrpgjdv1x	2024-12-12T09:19:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/12/SyZMy11F00E1e/SyZMy11F00E1e_404_526_527_297_0_small.jpg

Israeli Air Force concludes operations on northern border, readie...	Officials present impressive military data on fighting against Hezbollah and make preparations for a possible strike on Iranian soil following Assad's fall and Trump's return to Washington The Israeli Air Force (IAF) concluded its operations on the northern border on Thursday, identifying more opportunities than threats in the region, while preparing for what could be its next major mission — neutralizing Iran's nuclear facilities. Within just one week, IAF fighter jets dropped over 1,800 munitions, mainly heavy bombs, on Syrian military targets following the collapse of the Bashar Assad regime. The IAF has dropped approximately 83,000 munitions across all fronts since the beginning of the war in Gaza. The extensive airstrikes in Syria, concentrated over a dramatic 48-hour period, aimed to strip Assad’s military of its key capabilities to prevent them from falling into rebel hands. Given the Syrian military's large but outdated arsenal and the unexpected collapse of Assad’s regime that took Israel and the West by surprise, the IAF rapidly devised a strike plan, prioritizing targets in Syria. Significant amounts of Syrian military equipment – including old artillery, tanks, anti-tank weapons, light ammunition and personal arms – remain in Syria. However, the IAF noted that even if it intended to destroy all these stockpiles, it would lack the munitions to do so in a single strike amid an extended, multi-front conflict that necessitates careful resource management. According to the IAF, about 80% of Syria’s air defense array, including the lethal SA-17 and SA-22 systems, has been destroyed. This includes hundreds of Sukhoi and MiG aircraft, attack helicopters, missile launchers for Raad and Scud types, cruise missiles and chemical weapons systems. Assad’s firepower suffered a massive blow, with 90% of its key surface-to-surface missile batteries neutralized. The IAF also destroyed 44 radars and jammers, 390 launchers and missile components, 27 fighter jets, 24 attack helicopters and 12 cruise missile launchers. The destruction of most of Syria’s densely packed air defense systems has opened the skies for IAF pilots in the northern fronts, allowing unimpeded operations over Damascus for the first time in over 50 years. 'Our UAVs can now fly as far as eastern Syria and our fighter pilots circle Damascus freely. This is unprecedented,' a military official said, adding that the withdrawal of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officials and initial signs of Russian troop pullbacks, including S-300 batteries, have further bolstered confidence. The IDF is now updating its plans to target Iran's nuclear facilities, motivated by concerns that the collapse of the Shiite axis and Hezbollah’s weakening might drive Tehran to make a desperate move toward reaching military nuclear capabilities. Other factors are also at play include the upcoming inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, signaling potential shifts by 2025; the IDF’s significant blow to Iran’s air defense capabilities in a major strike six weeks ago and the loss of Hezbollah, Iran’s primary regional deterrent against an attack on its nuclear sites. Meanwhile, the IAF continues bi-daily strikes on Syria-Lebanon border crossings. Despite these developments, the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah is under constant strain. 'Hezbollah tests the boundaries with cease-fire violations daily and we respond with strikes,' a military official said. The IDF has highlighted the success of its operations in eliminating both senior and tactical leadership within the terrorist organization. Approximately two-thirds of Hezbollah's rockets and missiles have been destroyed, achieving a high interception rate. Out of 12,000 rockets and missiles launched from Lebanon, 900 fell in open spaces, but only 12 caused significant damage, marking a 91% interception rate. The success of these interception extends to enemy drones as well: Of the 239 drones launched from Lebanon during Operation Northern Arrows, which began in September and concluded last month, 36 hit their targets effectively, including the attack on a Golani Brigade base, while the interception rate stood at 94%. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, the IAF has completed its investigation into the October 7 massacre and plans to present its findings to the IDF’s General Staff next week. The report will later be made public, but the IAF might demand the simultaneous release of investigations from other branches, such as Military Intelligence, the Southern Command and the Operations Directorate. This approach aims to provide the public with a comprehensive view of the failures that led to Hamas’ attack, avoiding the narrow focus seen in the controversial release of the investigation into the battle at Kibbutz Be'eri, which disproportionately blamed tactical-level commanders. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1h9oyd41e	2024-12-12T08:27:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/07/r1KPdDge0/r1KPdDge0_0_308_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
American man who went missing in Hungary freed from Syrian prison	Travis Timmerman was freed from Syrian prison by rebel forces and later found wandering barefoot in Damascus; Seven months ago he disappeared from Hungary after leaving for a Christian pilgrimage through the Middle East, where he was arrested at the Syrian border A man identified as an American citizen from Missouri named Travis Timmerman was discovered in Syria Thursday, just days after being released from a prison in the suburbs of Damascus. He had been in custody for more than six months. During the occupation of Syria and the overthrow of Bashar Assad's regime, rebel forces stormed regime prisons and freed thousands of prisoners. One of them was the American citizen. In an interview with CBS, Timmerman, 29, said that seven months ago he was arrested in Syria, after he had spent a month in Lebanon. He arrived at the Syrian border without a visa, tried to cross into the country and was arrested. Before arriving in the Middle East, Timmerman has been in Hungary, and in late May he was listed as missing in Budapest. Authorities said he was last seen at a church and had since 'left for an unknown location.' The Christian American said he had come to Lebanon and Syria for 'spiritual reasons as part of a religious pilgrimage.' Timmerman said that on Monday, the day after the Assad regime was overthrown, two men with Kalashnikov rifles broke into his cell. They broke the door with a hammer. 'The door was broken, I woke up. I thought the guards were still here,' he told the American media. He said he was surprised to learn that the prison had been taken by the rebels without a fight. 'The moment we left there was no resistance, there was no real fighting,' he said. Regarding his time in prison, Timmerman said that he was treated relatively well. 'They never beat me. The only thing that was bad was that I couldn't go to the bathroom whenever I wanted, only three times a day.' Timmerman said that he had heard of young people being tortured in prison, but that he was not treated violently. He last spoke with his family on the phone three weeks ago from the prison in Damascus. After his release from the Syrian prison, Timmerman, along with other prisoners, attempted to walk toward the Jordanian border. He was seen wandering barefoot in a neighborhood in southern Damascus, and residents offered him lodging and a place to stay. On Thursday, videos from Syria showing Timmerman as a free man were released online. In the video, Timmerman could be seen lying on a mattress under a blanket in what appeared to be a private house. A group of men in the video said that he was being treated well and would be safely returned home. It was not immediately clear where Timmerman had been held. As the video emerged online of Timmerman, he was initially mistaken by some for Austin Tice, an American journalist who went missing in Syria 12 years ago.

In a video released a few weeks later, he was seen blindfolded and surrounded by armed men. This was the last footage of him. The Assad regime denied that they were holding him or that they were responsible for the kidnapping of the American journalist. U.S. media has reported that the United States currently is making efforts to locate Tice, in the wake of the overthrow of the Assad regime. The White House announced that President Joe Biden has spoken with Turkey and other countries, in order to obtain information about his whereabouts. The Americans believe that he is still alive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1fnbcdejx	2024-12-12T08:19:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/12/H1azjHd41g/H1azjHd41g_428_47_423_238_0_small.jpg

IAEA's 35-nation board condemns attacks on Ukraine's energy infra...	The U.N. nuclear watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Thursday condemning attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, but failing to mention Russia as the culprit. Ukraine called Thursday's emergency International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board meeting to discuss a wave of attacks on Nov. 28 that Russia unleashed on its energy infrastructure, triggering deep power cuts across the country. The drone and missile attacks hit electricity sub-stations used by three of Ukraine's nuclear power plants to receive and transmit off-site power, which is critical to their safety since that power is necessary to cool their nuclear fuel and avoid a potentially catastrophic nuclear meltdown. Diplomats at the closed-door meeting in Vienna said 22 countries voted in favor of the resolution with 10 abstaining and two, Russia and China, voting against. Unlike previous Board resolutions on Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, however, it failed to mention Russia by name. The last Board resolution on Ukraine was in July, condemning a military strike on a children's hospital in Kyiv and blaming Russia. Ukraine sees such resolutions as a way of pressuring Moscow on the international stage, though texts are often watered down to gain wider support.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syrcqtdn1l	2024-12-12T07:11:03-08:00

The magazine noted that Trump had previously boasted about avoiding wars during his first term but acknowledged that such a conflict might be necessary during his upcoming term, which is set to begin in January. Talking about the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump said he intends to broker an agreement. 'The only way you're going to reach an agreement is not to abandon [Ukraine]. It's crazy what's taking place,' he said. He criticized Kyiv for using American-made missiles to strike Russian territory last month but tempered his earlier campaign promise to mediate a peace agreement within 24 hours. 'I think the Middle East is going to get solved. I think it's more complicated than the Russia-Ukraine, but I think it's easier to solve,' he said. Reports on Wednesday detailed understandings that Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer reached with Trump’s team, ensuring Israel's interests in Gaza are safeguarded after a hostage deal, akin to the arrangement with Lebanon. This contrasts with Trump’s expressed desire to 'end,' the war as he said in the interview. Those involved in the negotiations with Hamas describe the process as serious and optimistic, though no resolution is expected in the immediate future. It might take two to three weeks for a decision to be reached. Trump, for his part, has issued an ultimatum to Hamas, saying there would be 'all hell to pay' if hostages held in Gaza aren’t released by the time he returns to the White House. Following his declaration, mediators reported increased flexibility from Hamas, though no concrete evidence supports this claim. This wasn’t the first time the incoming president addressed the hostage situation. In an interview with NBC, Trump speculated that the number of living hostages in Gaza is likely much lower than Israel estimates. He stressed that this was his opinion and not based on updated intelligence. 'I’m not a big believer in the fact that there are too many of them living, sadly,' Trump said.

I want him to end it but you have to have a victory. People forget about October 7. That was as violent. I noticed that a lot of people are saying, ‘Oh, it never really happened.’ That’s like the Holocaust.' 'Now you have October 7 deniers and it just happened. No, October 7 happened. And I’ve seen the pictures. What happened is horrible,' Trump said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1p1jkovye	2024-12-12T06:53:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/13/ryD00G8fG1g/ryD00G8fG1g_0_104_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Time magazine names President-elect Trump 'Person of the Year'	Time magazine on Thursday named U.S. President-elect Donald Trump its 'Person of the Year,' citing his deep impact on American politics and the country's role in the world.

The Haredi officer who volunteers at a police station in an Arab ...	Maor Korsias, a Haredi Jew from Tiberias, has become an unconventional presence at the police station in Kafr Kanna, with his long sidelocks and black kippah; He has earned the respect of the local community, who affectionately call him 'the Sheikh'; But how does he balance his Torah studies in a kollel with volunteering as a police officer? At the police station in Kafr Kanna, near Nazareth, the officer with a black yarmulke and long, curled sidelocks is a familiar sight. Known as 'the Sheikh' by those who come to file complaints or report issues, his presence might seem like a scene out of a satirical show, but it’s the real story of 22-year-old Maor Korsias. A devout Haredi Jew from Tiberias, Korsias spends his mornings studying in a Torah institute (kollel) and dedicates his afternoons to volunteering with the Israel Police. Having grown familiar with the Kafr Kanna police station over the past year, Korsias now hopes to enlist as a full-time police officer. 'I was raised in a Haredi home and studied in prestigious Torah institutions throughout my youth,' he explained. 'A year ago, I got married and began studying in a kollel led by a prominent rabbi in northern Israel. For most of my life, with my wife's blessing, my focus was solely on Torah study.' Korsias shared that his decision to join the police stemmed from family tradition and a sense of duty. 'My father and brothers all served in the security forces, and I felt the need to contribute as well. With my wife’s support, I decided to split my time – studying Torah half the day and volunteering as a patrol officer with the Israel Police a few times a month.' His role places him in a station far from his hometown, a deliberate choice to maximize the impact of his unique background. 'I wanted to serve in a place where my identity as a Haredi Jew could make a difference, both within the police force and among the community we serve,' Korsias said. His arrival at the Kafr Kanna station sparked curiosity among officers and the local Arab population. 'At first glance, it might seem like an unusual combination, but perhaps because of a sense of shared values, my appearance as a Breslov Hasid commands respect,' he noted. 'The residents who interact with the police have embraced it in a unique way. They even call me 'the Sheikh.' While I’m a Torah scholar, not a rabbi, the nickname reflects their view of me.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Describing his daily routine, Korsias said, 'My mornings are devoted to Torah study, and in the afternoons, I volunteer at the station. My knowledge of Torah and my appearance have a meaningful influence on the environment, which holds me to a higher standard.' He concluded, 'It’s possible to contribute to society while remaining immersed in Torah study. My volunteer work strengthens the community, and my studies provide spiritual protection and bolster the resilience of the state. One does not come at the expense of the other.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skc8vpo4kl	2024-12-12T05:29:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/12/SkJw9edEye/SkJw9edEye_0_0_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Who toppled Assad? Biden and Netanyahu's tug-of-war over credit	Biden says weakening Assad’s allies—Russia, Iran and Hezbollah—key to toppling regime, while Netanyahu claims ignoring US calls to avoid wider conflict led to Assad’s fall; Biden’s NSA Jake Sullivan meets Netanyahu to discuss Syria and hostage talks After 54 years of brutal rule, Syrian rebels made history by toppling President Bashar Assad, who fled to Russia, ending the reign of the Assad dynasty. But who deserves credit for this? That depends on whom you ask. U.S. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu each claim responsibility. Biden and his administration argue they laid the groundwork by relentlessly working to weaken Assad’s key backers—Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. According to their narrative, it was no coincidence that none of Assad’s allies were willing or able to save him in his moment of need. Netanyahu, however, tells a completely different story. He asserts that Assad’s fall was solely due to Israel’s elimination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, which Netanyahu called 'a turning point in the axis's collapse.' Israeli officials were quick to note that Netanyahu authorized the strike against U.S. advice, as the Biden administration feared it might trigger a broader war. Netanyahu did not shy away from criticizing Biden, claiming that the key was his own decision to ignore calls to 'end the war before achieving all of our objectives.' His message was clear: had he heeded Biden’s warnings to avoid a wider war, Assad would likely still be in his palace. The New York Times addressed the matter, with Suzanne Maloney, a Brookings Institution scholar specializing in Iran and the region, suggesting Biden’s claims of creating pressure may hold some truth. However, she emphasized that there was no American plan to overthrow Assad’s government. 'I think it is probably true that U.S. policy contributed to the fall of Assad,' she said. 'It is probably untoward for the Biden administration to take credit.' If there was an American contribution, it did not begin with Biden’s presidency. As early as 2011, former President Barack Obama declared that Assad 'must step aside.' Two years later, during a visit to Israel, Obama stood alongside Netanyahu and said that Assad had lost all legitimacy. However, there was no concrete plan to oust Assad, and when his regime finally collapsed, the speed of its downfall surprised even U.S. intelligence officials. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Both leaders have political motives to claim credit for the fall of Assad’s regime. Biden, nearing the end of his term, is shaping the legacy he will leave behind, while Netanyahu faces a corruption trial and tough questions about his government’s failures. On Tuesday, Israel conducted additional strikes on Syrian targets, including chemical weapons sites. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby avoided endorsing or criticizing the Israeli attacks, stating only that 'we have strong intelligence cooperation with Israel' without elaborating on the U.S. role in the operations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan arrived in Israel on Thursday amid Syria’s dramatic upheavals. His agenda includes a range of regional issues. Washington insiders say efforts are underway to broker a hostage deal in Gaza and advance normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, though skepticism remains about achieving these goals in the limited time frame before the next administration assumes office on January 20. During his meeting with Sullivan, Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed that Israel would take all necessary measures to defend its security against any threat. He explained that this included his directive for the IDF to temporarily take control of the buffer zone in Syria until an effective force is established to enforce the 1974 disengagement agreement. Netanyahu’s office added that the prime minister emphasized the critical need to support minorities in Syria and prevent terrorist activities originating from Syrian territory against Israel. What about the future of Syria and the United States? President-elect Donald Trump has proposed an entirely different approach. Just days before Assad’s escape, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform a call to action for the U.S.: 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.' True to his 'America First' philosophy, Trump has not provided a clear solution to the challenges arising from Syria’s collapse, including fears of chemical or biological weapons falling into hostile hands. Some believe this is the moment for Washington to take the lead in shaping Syria’s future. For now, however, the question of whether the U.S. will play an active role in stabilizing the situation in Syria remains unanswered. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkdbodo4jx	2024-12-12T05:25:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/12/HynPP8dNyg/HynPP8dNyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Blinken meets Jordan's king in Syria diplomacy push	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Jordan's King Abdullah in the Red Sea town of Aqaba on Thursday as he arrived in the region for talks on Syria following the overthrow of Bashar Assad.

Did you participate in genocide?': Israelis denied visas to Aust...	Omer and Ella Berger planned to visit their 100-year-old great-grandmother in Australia but were denied entry and asked to complete a 13-page form due to their IDF service; 'Decision reflects government’s increasingly hostile stance against Israel,' relative says Omer Berger, 24, and Ella Berger, 22, were denied visas to Australia after being asked to complete a 13-page document typically required for military personnel involved in war. The siblings had planned to visit their 100-year-old great-grandmother, a Holocaust survivor. The denial comes against a backdrop of heightened scrutiny following the arson of Melbourne's Adass Israel Synagogue and criticism of the government’s handling of antisemitism. Aaron Berger, a family member, told The Nightly that the decision reflects Australia's increasingly stringent stance toward Israel amid its war with Hamas and Hezbollah. 'Why are we treating friendly allies as if they are war criminals?' Berger asked. 'This certainly seems tied to the government’s position on Israel.' According to Berger, six family members applied for Australian visas two months ago. While all were promptly approved, Omer and Ella were told to submit the extended form. The questions included whether they had participated in physical or psychological abuse, served as guards or officials in detention facilities or engaged in war crimes or genocide. Ella, who had received a week’s leave from her military service to attend the celebration, gave up waiting and returned to Israel. Omer, a reservist, remains in Thailand, hoping for a resolution.

Herzog says Netanyahu pardon 'not currently on the table'	President does not dismiss clemency for PM in ongoing corruption trial; 'I will always act according to my conscience,' Herzog says, stressing respect for rule of law and calling Netanyahu's court appearance 'not a happy day' President Isaac Herzog said on Thursday that the potential for clemency for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid his ongoing corruption trial is 'not currently on the table.' Addressing questions at the Makor Rishon conference, Herzog said that 'no such request has been made.' 'I believe in respecting the rule of law; no one is above it,' he added. 'There are certain rules I won’t elaborate on. I will always act according to my conscience and basic principles. The process involves many parties, and right now, there is an ongoing trial. It was not a happy day to see the prime minister in court. No one should take joy in this.' On Wednesday, Netanyahu completed the second day of his testimony in the Tel Aviv District Court as part of the ongoing 'Case 4000' trial, known as the Bezeq-Walla affair. The defense focused on countering allegations that Netanyahu received favorable coverage from the Walla news site, owned by co-defendant Shaul Elovitch, in exchange for regulatory benefits. Netanyahu denied requesting coverage from Elovitch and claimed he was unaware of requests allegedly made by his wife, Sara. Netanyahu is accused of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, with prosecutors alleging he granted regulatory favors to Elovitch in exchange for favorable media coverage. The indictment includes a document listing 315 requests for coverage directed to Walla by Netanyahu’s associates. Prosecutors consider the preferential coverage as a bribe and cite breach of trust to establish a conflict of interest between Netanyahu and Elovitch. The trial will resume next week on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, with proceedings scheduled from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. During the first day of testimony earlier this week, Netanyahu paused for a brief recess after receiving notes in sealed envelopes from a National Security Council representative. The judges granted his request for the break. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Separately, retired judge Asher Kula, formerly the deputy president of the Nazareth District Court, said in a radio interview that a plea deal should have been reached in Netanyahu’s case. 'There’s still an opportunity to do so,' Kula remarked. 'This country needs governance, and it is not good for the state to have a prime minister accused of crimes with a trial lasting 6-8 years.' What is a clemency request and how is it filed? A clemency request seeks to ease the consequences of a criminal conviction, often aiming to reduce a sentence, alter components of a verdict, or occasionally annul a part of it. Lt. Col. (res.) Ran Cohen-Rochberger, an attorney specializing in military and security law and a former chief military defense attorney, explained: 'The president’s initiative is particularly relevant for expunging criminal records. While a secondary outcome of a conviction, a criminal record is effectively a punishment in itself, often with harsher repercussions than the sentence itself. It can restrict employment opportunities and continue to harm an individual’s reputation.' He noted that entities with access to criminal records before they expire include the Israel Police, Military Police, licensing authorities, the Civil Service Commissioner, the Education Ministry, public security regulators and others. What are common grounds for clemency requests? 'In general, clemency is granted only in exceptional cases where unique and extraordinary circumstances justify reducing or altering a sentence. Requests can only be submitted after all legal proceedings in the case have been exhausted,' Attorney Limor Goldenberg-Haddad, head of the Justice Ministry’s clemency department, said. Cohen-Rochberger added: 'Each case is unique, but typically requests focus on the applicant’s rehabilitation process, life circumstances surrounding the offense, current challenging conditions, or specific needs like a pending job offer, a requirement for a license or eligibility for security-related work. The request must convey that the offense is firmly in the applicant’s past and will not be repeated.' Can a clemency request be filed without a lawyer? There is no requirement to file through an attorney. Applicants themselves are not obligated to write the request, which can also be submitted by immediate family members. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byjlfs00v1g	2024-12-12T03:06:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/11/13/S12xXI0Bi/S12xXI0Bi_0_0_3000_1996_0_small.jpg

Swedish prosecutors closed a rape and sexual assault investigation on Thursday, saying there was insufficient evidence in a case that local media said involved French soccer star Kylian Mbappe.

Some of the biggest names in the poker world paid $10,000 each to join a tournament where all proceeds were donated to support IDF widows and orphans; renowned poker star Daniel Negreanu, though not a participant, made a generous $10,000 contribution to the cause as well Two poker tables are at a luxury resort in the Bahamas, and some of the most notable figures in the poker world are sitting in the chairs surrounding them. They compete amongst themselves, raise, bet, and occasionally bluff when needed. This time, however, the goal isn’t cash or World Series of Poker bracelets, but rather to raise money for IDF widows and orphans. A charity poker tournament was organized in the Bahamas, where the proceeds were donated to the IDFWO. The funds will go towards organizing empowerment camps and retreats for the orphans. The path from an idea to a successful event The initiative originated when Ory Weihs, who alongside his wife Anna Meissner co-founded the Czech-based philanthropic, pro-Israeli charity Shalem, reached out to Robbie Strazynski with an idea to host a $10,000 buy-in poker tournament, of which half would be donated to the IDFWO. Robbie, an Israeli-American residing in Karnei Shomron, Israel, Founder of Cardplayer Lifestyle, and a highly involved figure in the global poker industry, was thrilled by the idea and pushed for the event. Strazynski used his connections in the industry to get Daniel Negreanu, Poker Hall of Famer and an avid pro-Israeli supporter, on board. Another key figure who joined the initiative was Isai Scheinberg, founder of the online poker site PokerStars, who used to live in Israel. Scheinberg connected with Michael Kim, founder of the current largest online poker website: GG Poker, which recently acquired the rights to the World Series of Poker. The involvement of Scheinberg and Kim became fundamental for the event, as Kim agreed to host it in the Bahamas during the World Series of Poker Paradise, a series of high-end tournaments in the Caribbean attracting the world’s top players. 'We don’t need to be scared anymore' To avoid harassment and negative press from the anti-Israel movement, the tournament organizers maintained a low profile. They approached potential players privately but chose not to advertise the event publicly. Only 24 hours before the game, Strazynski revealed the story on his website: 'Now that we did it, we don’t need to be scared anymore,' he says, 'maybe next time we will do it more openly, and fill 50 tables.' In the end, 12 players showed up for the $10,000 buy-in tournament. Among the players were some well-recognized faces in the industry: Bertrand Grospellier, better known as ElkY, an ambassador of GG Poker; Ari Engel, a Jewish-Canadian player who has collected over $9 million in career tournament winnings, who is also the son of an orthodox rabbi; Jeff Platt, a popular poker tournament presenter, Isai Scheinberg himself, and others. In a surprising turn of events, Ory and Anna were the tournament’s final two participants, having eliminated the other 10 players. Realizing the opportunity, the pair immediately decided to donate the entirety of the raised amount instead of just the 50% agreed on initially. So the tournament on its own ended up raising $120,000. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: That, however, was not the final sum donated to the IDFWO charity. Negreanu, who couldn’t participate in this tournament due to participating in a simultaneously occurring event, donated $10,000. Phil Hellmuth, who holds the record for most WSOP bracelets, spontaneously donated $2,000. Together with additional donations, the final sum raised was about $140,000. Shlomi Nahumson, CEO of the IDFWO charity, commented on the initiative: 'It’s not only a poker game; it’s a warm hug and show of unity to our community. The amazing support of leading figures in the poker world and their generous donations remind us that the human spirit and the spirit of giving cross any and all borders. The money raised will allow us to continue to operate and support widows and orphans by providing the right tools for dealing with life’s challenges and fostering support and empowerment.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byiw7mu4ye	2024-12-12T01:50:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/B1R00fR8VJg/B1R00fR8VJg_0_185_2040_1148_0_small.jpg
Torn Assad photos, old gas masks: Inside an abandoned Syrian army...	Two decades ago, the IDF ceased training its soldiers to capture Syrian outposts; 101st Battalion forces achieved the feat without firing a single shot, uncovering damp trenches, rusted weapons, iron mess kits and dark, abandoned rooms deep within the hilltop position Last Friday around midnight, observers from the IDF Bashan Division (210) and border security troops stationed in southern Golan Heights were stunned by what they saw: a Syrian officer assembling his troops in a U-shaped formation at the Tel Kudana outpost. The officer then ordered them to abandon the company base, which overlooks Israeli communities like Keshet and Aloni Habashan. Within ten minutes, the soldiers hastily boarded trucks and fled eastward, leaving behind three Soviet tanks, seven anti-tank missiles and damp trenches. Two days later, 101st Battalion paratroopers captured the outpost—nicknamed the 'Syrian Pita'—without firing a single shot. Fifty years of cease-fire agreements dissolved in an instant, without a fight. After a bumpy half-hour ride in an armored Tiger vehicle along the rugged route from Aloni Habashan to Syrian territory, the shift was clear. Descending through a grove of pine trees, the color of the barrels marking the border changed to red, white and black—the colors of the Syrian flag. We had crossed the border. The barrel line marks the internationally recognized border between Israel and Syria, which held firm for exactly 50 years under the cease-fire agreement between Hafez Assad's regime and Israel. Now, this border has blurred, nearly disappeared, and could remain so for months or even years. The IDF's official line is that it is 'securing commanding points in the buffer zone along the border,' but this buffer zone is sovereign Syrian territory, which until Friday was under the control of Assad's army. Four battalion combat teams from the Paratroopers, Commando Brigade and the 188th Armored Brigade are operating here in what the IDF calls 'forward defense.' This contingency plan, long in place in every regional division, has been employed in past wars and operations: to seize key positions on enemy soil near the border during an emergency to preempt and push back potential threats to Israeli civilians. Hundreds of IDF soldiers now traverse the area in light vehicles like Defender jeeps and pickup trucks, as well as tanks and D9 bulldozers. They are moving through the streets of Quneitra and other Syrian border villages, including Kudana. On Wednesday, Israeli journalists entered these areas for the first time. The Syrian children born in Israel It may be hard to believe, but for the Syrian residents here, the situation feels almost natural. 'They didn’t greet us with rice (as the residents of southern Lebanon did during Operation Peace for Galilee in 1982), but they were happy we came. They spoke to us openly after years of fearing to do so under the watchful eyes of Assad’s soldiers,' said Lt. Col. (res.) Inon Oriya, deputy commander of the 474th Regional Brigade, who lives in the Golan Heights near Syrian villages. 'A few days ago, an elderly Syrian couple approached me in broad daylight, sharing their joy at Assad’s fall while working their fields,' Oriya added. 'They want nothing but peace and livelihood and remember the help we provided them during the civil war a decade ago.' Approximately 70,000 Syrians live in the Syrian Golan, with Khan Arnaba, near Quneitra, serving as the regional center. 'The IDF quickly understood the importance of stabilizing the situation proactively this time, learning from past lessons in Gaza and southern Lebanon,' explained a senior commander. Positive messages were sent to the Syrian regional governor and local village leaders. This dialogue, while not new, was seeded during Operation Good Neighbor, when Israel provided millions of shekels in medical aid to thousands of Syrians treated in Israeli hospitals and, according to foreign reports, supplied them with weapons. Dozens of Syrian babies born in Israeli hospitals like Ziv Medical Center in Safed or Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya are now eight-year-old children, watching Egoz and Paratrooper soldiers patrol their villages. IDF forces plan to remain in the area through winter, preparing for the snowy conditions ahead. Bulldozers are carving new routes, and soldiers have received thermal clothing for their static security duties, including guard posts, patrols and ambushes. Heated, collapsible living quarters have been deployed to outposts alongside noisy generators, replacing the old Syrian bunkers, which soldiers described as unpleasant for sleeping. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A makeshift guard post, marked with a large sign reading 'Gatekeeper,' is manned by three Paratrooper soldiers. One of them, requesting anonymity, cited concerns over global perceptions of IDF operations following the Gaza war. Despite this, morale is high, with optimism evident among the troops. 'This feels different,' said an officer. 'For the first time, it seems something good is on the horizon, both for the region’s residents and the Middle East as a whole.' A Druze officer even took advantage of the new reality to send aid to relatives in Syria. IDF soldiers have been actively establishing control. In the first two days, they intervened when local Syrians, likely backed by armed rebels, were caught looting equipment from an abandoned UNDOF outpost. The soldiers forced the items to be returned to UN peacekeepers, who, while still patrolling in their blue uniforms, are effectively redundant. 'The IDF plans to stay until a legitimate and recognized government is established in Damascus capable of taking responsibility for the Syrian Golan,' a commander explained. 'We won’t allow another border with terrorists like Gaza or Lebanon. The baton will only be handed over to a structured, state-backed force, even if it takes a year.' Tracking IDF movements This tumultuous year is once again upending the IDF’s operational plans. Battalions have unexpectedly arrived in the Golan Heights from southern Lebanon, disrupting all projections. Some rear IDF positions on the Israeli side of the border may now need to adjust, adding to the military’s already full plate of challenges. For now, front-line defense will be handled by regular forces under the command of Brig. Gen. Yair Paley, head of the 210th Regional Division. Paley, a seasoned officer, began his career as a Golani Brigade recruit and later commanded the brigade in ground operations in Gaza. He is likely the only officer here who trained in capturing 'Syrian Pita' outposts—a skill no longer practiced since the early 2000s, when the outbreak of the Second Intifada marked the end of any realistic chance of such operations in Syria. These outposts, perched on hilltops, earned their nickname due to their pita-like shape. Circular trenches surround the outposts, and within them are fortified living quarters for soldiers. On Wednesday, I walked through these abandoned and damp Syrian trenches. On the wall of one, I saw a torn picture of Bashar Assad, pierced through the forehead by a hanging hook. At a sniper post extending from the trenches, a paratrooper stood alert, peering through a scope aimed at the terrain. The observation slit he used had been manned by a Syrian soldier just a week earlier. The sniper, a lone soldier from the 101st Battalion, spoke in a heavy American accent: 'In recent months, I fought in Gaza and southern Lebanon. This place is entirely different.' Inside the outpost’s rooms, I found a discarded Syrian gas mask and iron mess kits resembling those used by IDF soldiers in the 1960s. One still contained moldy food, evidence of the Syrian soldiers' hasty retreat last weekend. Scattered nearby, among charred ceilings and empty ammunition boxes marked with Cyrillic script, lay dirtied sheets of paper written in Arabic. A quick translation revealed them to be observation logs detailing IDF soldiers and their daily routines across the border—records kept from this vantage point for the past 50 years. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjthsvuvkx	2024-12-12T01:45:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/BJk464P41l/BJk464P41l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Berlin nixes joint Israeli-German pavilion at Frankfurt Book Fair, marking 60 years of ties; Israeli officials criticize 'delays' by Germany’s Foreign Ministry, noting no budget allocated for commemorative events this year Germany has announced the cancellation of a planned joint Israeli-German pavilion at the Frankfurt Book Fair, originally intended to mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The decision was conveyed to Israel by Yoel Pollak, the coordinator for the 60th anniversary on behalf of Germany’s Foreign Ministry, in a brief message without explanation. Senior Israeli officials expressed disappointment, citing 'delays, difficulties and foot-dragging' from Germany’s Foreign Ministry in advancing projects to commemorate the anniversary. Unlike past milestones, such as the 50th and 55th anniversaries, no dedicated budget has been allocated by Germany, raising doubts about the feasibility of significant activities to mark the occasion. Israel places strategic importance on its relationship with Germany, given their unique and complex shared history.

Deposed Syrian dictator instructed to board private jet, disable transponder and land at Russian air base near Latakia before continuing to Moscow; while Putin approved operation, he reportedly has no plans to meet with Assad Russian intelligence agents orchestrated Bashar Assad's escape from Syria as rebels closed in on Damascus, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing three sources familiar with the matter. Assad was instructed to board his private jet without informing anyone and to disable the plane’s transponder, the sources said. He landed at the Russian Khmeimim Airbase near Latakia before continuing to Moscow, likely aboard a Russian military aircraft. According to the report, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the operation to rescue the Syrian dictator but has no plans to meet with him now that he is in exile in Russia. According to Bloomberg, Russian agents urged Assad to leave Syria once it became evident he would lose the battle against rebel forces. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed over the weekend that Assad was evacuated from Syria 'in the safest possible way.' During the escape early Sunday, Assad’s plane disappeared from radar, sparking concerns it might have crashed.

US-backed, Erdogan’s rivals and tied to Israel: Who are Syria’s K...	Despite Assad’s fall, Syria rife with militias and terror groups clashing over opposing interests; US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Kurdish-led group active for 9 years, fight ISIS and Turkish-backed rebels while seeing Israel as a model The regime of dictator Bashar Assad has been toppled, and the former president has fled to Russia, where he has been granted political asylum. However, the fighting in Syria shows no signs of abating, as various factions with opposing interests continue to battle across the country. Overnight Wednesday, reports emerged that the Kurdish rebel forces, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), reached a cease-fire agreement with Turkey-backed rebels near the city of Manbij. The truce was brokered by the United States. The SDF commander confirmed the agreement to Reuters, just days after the Kurdish rebels announced they had shifted to a defensive posture against 'Turkish occupation and its mercenaries.' Among the many groups currently fighting in Syria, here’s what is known about the Syrian Democratic Forces. US-backed Kurds fighting ISIS: A decade of the SDF In October 2024, the SDF celebrated nine years since its founding. The alliance was established in the midst of the Syrian Civil War in the fall of 2015, in the city of Qamishli, located in Syria’s northeastern Al-Hasakah province, a predominantly Kurdish border region. This area also became the SDF’s main theater of operations during the civil war. According to a recent BBC Arabic report, the SDF has enjoyed U.S. support since its inception, having been created to serve as a local partner for the international coalition fighting ISIS. When the SDF was launched, it described itself as a 'national military bloc' representing all Syrians, including but not limited to the Kurdish minority. Its primary goal was to defeat ISIS and reclaim all territories seized by the terror group. Backed by financial and military aid from the coalition, the SDF made significant gains on the battlefield. However, as the Syrian Civil War progressed, Turkey—Syria’s northern neighbor—viewed the SDF’s armed structure, its concentration in northeastern Syria and its successes with increasing hostility. Against this backdrop of Pentagon support and U.S. activity in parts of Syria, CNN reported on Wednesday that SDF forces mistakenly shot down an American MQ-9 Reaper drone in northern Syria. According to several U.S. officials, the Kurdish fighters believed the drone was Turkish and deemed it a threat. CNN noted that a single MQ-9 drone costs around $30 million. The conflict with Turkey and Trump’s abandonment The SDF succeeded in driving ISIS out of several strategic areas and took control of large swathes of northeastern Syria. Although ISIS was declared defeated in 2019, the victory did little to secure the Kurdish forces, who feared displacement or annihilation. Their concerns grew following then-U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw most American troops—a move the Kurds viewed as abandonment. The U.S. alliance with the SDF had long been a point of contention between Washington and NATO allies, particularly Turkey. Ankara, a NATO member, opposes the Syrian Democratic Forces and Kurdish aspirations along the borders with Syria and Iraq. Turkey vehemently criticized U.S. support for the SDF and repeatedly launched operations against the group. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: But Turkey wasn’t the only challenge for the SDF. The Syrian regime also opposed the Kurds’ 2016 declaration of a federal system in the areas under their control. According to a BBC report, Turkey’s attacks on the SDF escalated following the outbreak of the Gaza war last year. Ankara views the SDF as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a group Turkey designates as a terrorist organization. Turkey has waged a decades-long war against the PKK, resulting in significant casualties. Just this October, tensions between Turkey and the Kurds flared again after the headquarters of the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS) in Ankara was bombed. Even before the PKK claimed responsibility, Turkey launched a wave of intense air and ground strikes against the Kurds in Syria and Iraq, reportedly targeting SDF positions. In addition to Turkey's hostilities, the SDF faced clashes with Arab tribes in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor region, with a second wave of fighting breaking out in August 2023 following earlier clashes in September. Pro-Iranian groups have also attacked SDF positions, adding to the challenges faced by the Kurdish-led alliance. Challenges for the SDF and its ties with Israel The main adversaries of the SDF are jihadist groups involved in the Syrian war, particularly ISIS, Turkey-backed Syrian opposition groups and factions linked to al-Qaeda. However, the SDF faces additional challenges. Opinions are divided regarding the SDF’s exact composition. Some argue that the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) make up the vast majority of SDF fighters and form the backbone of the organization. Other reports suggest that the number of Arab fighters has increased as the SDF advanced into Arab-majority territories. According to the Pentagon, in March 2016, the SDF comprised 40% Kurds and 60% Arabs. Other sources claim a lower percentage of Arab fighters, but there is consensus that Kurdish leadership dominates the group. The SDF is made up of several armed factions with varying compositions, including the Sanadid Forces, the Syrian Christian Military Council, the Army of Rebels and the YPJ, an all-female militia. These groups have also been active in the Syrian Civil War, striving to protect the independence of Syrian Kurdistan and resisting the Assad regime’s attempts to annex the region. The SDF’s commander, Mazloum Abdi, whose real name is Ferhad Abdi Şahin, was born in Kobani, Aleppo province, Syria. According to a recent BBC report, Abdi recently congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory but had previously criticized U.S. policy toward Syria during Trump’s first administration. Announcing a cease-fire agreement with Turkish-backed Syrian opposition forces, Abdi said, 'Our goal is to cease fire throughout Syria and enter into a political process for the future of the country.' The Kurds’ strong ties with Israel are well-documented, and the SDF views Israel as a model. Speaking at a press briefing on Monday about recent Israeli strikes on various targets in Syria intended to prevent those assets from falling into extremist hands, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar confirmed that Israel maintains contact with the Kurds in the country. Over the years, the Kurds have also fought against the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militia, led by Abu Mohammed al-Golani. Al-Golani, who had spearheaded efforts to topple Assad in what has been termed 'Deterrence of Aggression,' recently sent messages advocating for 'avoiding sectarian violence and building a new Syria for all.' However, given Syria’s fragmentation, only time will tell if these optimistic messages are genuine and achievable, or if the country will once again spiral into complex internal warfare driven by competing interests. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj8jtudnkg	2024-12-11T12:24:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/BJ00xnHw4ke/BJ00xnHw4ke_0_192_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Syrian refugees in Europe fear being forced home after Assad's fa...	As European nations reassess asylum policies for Syrians following fall of Assad regime, many fear being forced to return despite rebuilding their lives abroad Najem al-Moussa was delighted when news of Syrian President Bashar Assad's overthrow first beamed from the television in his tiny Athens apartment. Then came a dreaded thought: what if Assad's fall meant he and his family would be forced to return to the devastated country they had fled nine years before? Events in Syria took a seismic turn on Sunday when rebels poured into Damascus after a lightning offensive that forced Assad into exile in Russia and raised hopes of an end to a 13-year civil war that has left the country in ruins. Now, as European countries rethink their asylum policies for Syrians in the light of developments, many fear they will have to go back. 'I consider my life to be here. Not just me but my children,' said al-Moussa, a lawyer by training who works as a cook in Athens and has been transfixed by the television news for days. 'The life that was provided in Greece, my country was not able to offer.' Hundreds of thousands of people have died in Syria's war, which began in 2011 and pitted Assad's army against various rebel groups. Whole cities have been flattened by bombing. Millions fled or are in need of humanitarian assistance. Thousands of civilians who moved to neighbouring Turkey and Lebanon rushed back into Syria this week, their cars filled with people, luggage, and hope of a peaceful homecoming. But 10 Syrian refugees who spoke to Reuters in Europe and the United Kingdom thought differently. Returning would mean an end to a new life they have risked everything to build. Al-Moussa and his wife Bushra al-Bukaai fled Damascus in 2015 after the birth of their second child. They spent everything they had on a two-year journey that took them to Sudan, Iran, Turkey and eventually Greece. They now have five children who are all in school and speak fluent Greek. None speak the Arabic of their parents' homeland. 'When we talk, they ask: 'Daddy, can we really go back to living in these areas? How did you live there before?,'' Al-Moussa said. His wife agrees. 'I cannot imagine my children building their future in Syria. Not at all,' she said, their youngest son in her lap. Joy and despair First-time asylum applications by Syrians to the EU were highest in 2015 and 2016 - more than 330,000 in each of those years - before dropping off significantly in the next three years, EU data show. But applications trebled between 2020 and 2023 after a devastating earthquake and as violence and economic hardship persisted. Thousands of those applications are now on hold after several European countries including Greece this week suspended asylum applications from Syrians while they consider whether Syria is safer now that Assad has gone. It is not clear if asylum seekers will be forced home. ProAsyl, a German NGO providing legal help to asylum seekers, said cases would be in limbo until the foreign ministry publishes its updated security assessment report on Syria, which could take months. ProAsyl spokesperson Tareq Alaows told Reuters the decision could face legal challenges as authorities in Europe must decide on asylum applications within three to six months of their submission. Still, Al-Moussa's Greek residence permit is up for renewal and he is worried. He is not alone. Syrian vet Hasan Alzagher was in a German language class in the city of Erfurt on Monday when he heard that his asylum application for Germany, which he hoped would be finalized by the end of the year, was put on hold. 'This is mentally devastating. It's difficult that after you set your mind to live here, build a new life here, learn the language and integrate in this country, you now have to return to your homeland where basic necessities are still missing,' he told Reuters by phone. In fear of being recruited into the army or a militia group, Alzagher, 32, said he fled the city of Raqqa in 2018. He spent time in Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey before heading to Germany in 2023. 'The fall of Assad is a huge joy for all Syrians, but we who came here and went into debt to finance this journey, every time we arrive in a new place, we have to start over again. It's difficult to think about returning to Syria now.' Alzagher's worries were echoed by Syrians in the United Kingdom, which has also paused decisions on asylum claims.

Nahhas, 34, from Aleppo, said he was a wanted man in Syria after participating in an anti-government protest there. His grandfather was jailed for 13 years and many of his friends have been detained and tortured, he said. He has been granted asylum in the UK, but is nervous now, especially as his wife is pregnant. The 'possibility that they (UK authorities) could blindly reverse some decisions without any personal circumstances being factored in' was worrying, he said by phone. 'It's a whirlwind of thoughts, uncertainties and unnecessary additional concerns in our lives.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skuwgpvnjg	2024-12-11T10:44:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/B1CtDPPNJe/B1CtDPPNJe_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

IDF in Syria: Seven villages, two brigades and winter preparation...	Without resistance, IDF forces took control of Syrian outposts, confiscating tanks, missiles and equipment; preparing for a prolonged stay, troops received living containers; local villagers maintain daily life as army awaits stable governing entity In a historic move on the Syrian Golan Heights, IDF forces have completed the capture of five key sectors in the buffer zone beyond the border with Syria. Over the past two days, thousands of residents from seven local villages have effectively come under the protection of IDF troops from the Paratroopers Brigade, the 188th Armored Brigade, the 7th Armored Brigade and the Commando Brigade. The weekend operation, which involved seizing outposts and positions, was conducted without resistance. Syrian soldiers abandoned their security posts facing Israel, retreating eastward on trucks and not returning. Armed rebels, reportedly from the Daraa area and unaffiliated with the extremist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), alerted some Syrian troops about the IDF's advance. In some instances, these rebels looted a UN post, though Israeli forces later mediated to ensure the stolen weapons and equipment were returned to UNDOF observers, who remain in the area but hold little practical influence. The long-standing 1974 ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria under former autocrat Hafez Assad is now effectively obsolete, as a new, undefined political entity has taken power in Damascus, unrecognized by the international community. In response, the IDF is preparing for an extended presence in Syrian territory, roughly five to seven kilometers beyond the international border, until a stable governing authority assumes control of the region and renews or renegotiates the longstanding accord between Jerusalem and Damascus. The decision is driven by a determination to avoid a scenario where the border mirrors the volatile conditions seen along the Gaza Strip and Lebanon prior to October 7, with armed terror groups operating near Israeli communities. To bolster security, the IDF is racing to complete engineering defenses in the area. Approximately 15 kilometers (10 miles) of a new barrier have been constructed along the international border, known as the 'barrel line,' located one to two kilometers east of Israel’s existing security fence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The barrier includes deep trenches to block the advance of light vehicles such as pickup trucks, elevated earth embankments and the reinforcement of minefields. These measures complement the high-tech security fence built over the past decade along the 80-kilometer (50-mile) stretch from Hamat Gader to Mount Hermon. 'Not much was invested in these outposts' IDF troops seized Syrian army outposts after soldiers hastily abandoned their bases, boarding trucks and fleeing east. 'We found a few outdated tanks and anti-tank missiles we confiscated, rusty infrastructure and documents translating data about our forces for their troops,' an IDF commander described. 'It seems not much was invested in these outposts.' The commander noted that the IDF has already provided its soldiers with comfortable living containers, explaining, 'It's unpleasant to sleep in these Syrian bunkers. We've also brought in a generator and are clearing paths from Israeli territory ahead of the coming snow. Any potential threat will remain far from Israeli communities.' Meanwhile, forces from the elite Shaldag Unit completed an operation on the Syrian Mount Hermon, during which they confiscated explosives, mines, anti-tank missiles and other military equipment. According to soldiers, Syrian villagers welcomed the IDF presence. 'They didn’t throw rice or sweets, but many expressed relief at the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. They remember the aid we provided during the last decade of civil war,' one soldier shared. Life in the villages continues as usual, with locals openly conversing with Israeli troops, cultivating their land and tending livestock, no longer fearful of Assad’s soldiers. The IDF troops, now settling into the area, describe a relatively calm environment. They walk without helmets, have decent phone reception and remain in high spirits. One soldier, a sniper from the 101st Battalion, observed from a fortified position previously held by a Syrian soldier. 'I know this isn’t Gaza or Lebanon; it’s something completely different,' he remarked. Despite the unfamiliarity, most commanders—except for 210th Division Commander Brig. Gen. Yair Paley and perhaps the brigade commanders—had not trained for such operations, as the IDF discontinued Syrian outpost drills in the early 2000s. However, the army is making active efforts to establish good relations with the local population, even if temporary. Positive messages have already been sent to the governor of the region based in Khan Arnabah near Quneitra. 'We were prepared for Shiite jihadists from the pro-Iranian militias deeper in Syria, and now we’re preparing for Sunni jihadists. Both have similar pickup trucks, weapons and extremist ideologies,' IDF officials explained. 'The Syrian villages here are trying to make sense of the situation. They just want peace and a livelihood.' Soldiers have been instructed to prepare for at least a year-long presence or until further decisions are made at the political level. Brig. Gen. Paley, who commands the 210th Division overseeing the sector, emphasized: 'We will continue to monitor and defend against any threat. Our mission is clear: to protect the citizens of Israel and the Golan.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qhiiw4jx	2024-12-11T09:37:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/HJcpIHDN1g/HJcpIHDN1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

How is Israel merging tech and biology to tackle climate change?	Shai Melcer: 'Bioconvergence is the world in which biology meets other technologies from the world of engineering—both hardware and software' Bioconvergence is a cutting-edge field that spans diverse markets, from healthcare and food to agriculture and sustainability. In Israel, the National Bioconvergence Program is revolutionizing the industry by addressing every aspect of its ecosystem. The program promotes investments in bioconvergence companies, builds essential research infrastructure, develops skilled human capital, and tackles regulatory challenges to pave the way for innovation and growth. 'Bioconvergence is the world in which biology meets other technologies from the world of engineering—both hardware and software,' explained Shai Melcer, head of the National Bioconvergence Program in Israel. 'It’s where high-tech meets biotech, and they both enrich each other’s worlds.' In addressing the global climate crisis, bioconvergence offers groundbreaking solutions. By combining biological components with advanced hardware and software, this field enables more accurate climate monitoring and innovative strategies to tackle challenges on both local and global scales. A prime example is BugEra, a pioneering Israeli company that uses advanced genetic engineering to create novel strains of black soldier flies (BSF) that significantly boost oil production. By breaking down economic barriers in BSF farming, BugEra produces sustainable oils that can replace traditional food oils and biofuels. Their process also upcycles diverse organic waste, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fuel and waste while advancing the circular economy. 'This helps Israel overcome some of its food security challenges by becoming self-sufficient in producing its own protein for animal feed and agriculture,' said Yoav Etgar, co-founder and CEO of BugEra. 'This industry will lead to actually using black soldier flies as a bioconverter of Israel's organic waste into alternative protein, alternative oil for feed, animal feed, agriculture feed, and biofuel, and by that, to promote Israel's self-sufficient capabilities.' Another innovative company is Biotic, which produces fully bio-based, biodegradable PHBV polymers using marine biomass as feedstock in its precision fermentation process. These polymers aim to replace fossil-based plastics, eliminating the need for traditional recycling. Unlike most bioplastics—which rely on terrestrial resources, fresh or treated water, and industrial composting—Biotic offers a cost-effective, scalable solution. Currently, bioplastics meet less than 2% of global demand and cost at least three times more than fossil-based plastics. Biotic is breaking this mold, paving the way for sustainable, accessible alternatives to traditional plastics. 'If we take something nature knows how to do and do it naturally, and are just emphasizing it and scaling it up, in this way we are not harming nature but rather helping it recreate itself,' said Adi Goldman, co-founder and CEO of Biotic. Melcer added: 'Israel has a good, strong record in the high-tech industry and top-notch biological research in all fields. Putting these two together gives you a robust approach to the tech requirements of dealing with climate change.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkgfg4p41x	2024-12-11T06:45:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/ryvd7VPVkg/ryvd7VPVkg_1_27_623_351_0_small.jpg
You're responsible for your territory': Israel’s direct messages...	Arab outlet publishes files found following Assad's fall and detailing alleged messages sent by agent who warned regime of cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah Arabic-language outlet Sky News Arabia reported on Wednesday that documents discovered following the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad indicate messages were sent directly from Israel to Syria concerning Iran's presence, its proxy organizations in the country and arms smuggling operations executed by Tehran to bolster these groups. The report is based on documents published on social media whose authenticity remains uncertain. However, the documents bear Syria's state emblem under Assad and appear to have been authored by military top brass. According to the documents, an agent named 'Mussa' or 'Moses' conveyed messages directly to former Syrian Defense Minister Ali Mahmoud Abbas and passed on to Assad's former national security advisor Ali Mamlouk. Israel reportedly expressed discontent on several occasions over Syria's approval of Hezbollah or Iranian activities on its soil. The agent detailed these incidents in his messages. On April 8, 2023, according to the documents and report, the agent warned that Hamas had launched rockets against Israel from the Golan Heights. 'Three rockets were launched from the Golan under Khaled Mashal's command. 'We demand you stop these incidents — or consequences will follow. You are responsible for what happens on your territory,' he wrote. 'Our last step was a warning shot. If you don't curb these actions, the next attack will be far more severe. You’ll pay an unprecedented price.' Warnings continued on May 7, 2023, when Israel allegedly struck Hezbollah-linked weapons depots. 'We won’t allow the presence of Haj Hashim or his soldiers in southern Syria,' the agent wrote, referring to Musa Ali Daqduq, also known as Abu Hussein Sajid, who was reportedly killed in an Israeli strike. The documents revealed additional warnings. On May 17, 2023, eight aircraft reportedly landed at Khmeimim Air Base — four Iranian and four Syrian planes. They allegedly delivered weapons to depots in Latakia and Qutayfah. 'The Russian mechanism allows you to operate without risking an Israeli response. However, supporting Iran and Hezbollah will compel us to act with severity. Any unmonitored activity bypassing Russian oversight will be seen as a direct threat to Israel and prompt a response,' the agent warned. In another warning on July 14, 2023, Moses wrote that Israel was dissatisfied with the cooperation between Iran and Hezbollah. 'Supporting Hezbollah’s air defense capabilities is an act against Israel. It serves Hezbollah’s interests alone and harms your army.' Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed on Wednesday that Israel's actions in Syria violate the 1974 disengagement agreement signed after the Yom Kippur War. She called Israel's airstrikes in Syria 'very concerning' and called for restraint to avoid escalating tensions. Last week, Reuters reported that the U.S. and UAE discussed a plan in recent months to ease harsh U.S. sanctions on the Assad regime and provide financial aid from the UAE and Saudi Arabia on the condition he distanced himself from the Iranian axis and prevented weapon deliveries to Hezbollah through Syrian territory. According to sources familiar with the discussions, the rebels’ success demonstrates a 'weakness' in the Iranian axis, which Washington and Abu Dhabi hoped to exploit to drive a wedge between Assad and Tehran. Last month, the Lebanese newspaper Aljoumhouria, affiliated with Hezbollah opponents, reported that Israel had proposed lifting sanctions on Assad if he permanently closed the Syria-Lebanon border to Hezbollah weapons smuggling from various sources.

Syrian activist: 'We are ready for peace'	Rawan Osman says 'happy' Israel destroyed weapons in Syria A Syrian expatriate and activist has commended Israel for destroying Syrian weapons, citing concerns that they could fall into the wrong hands. Speaking to ILTV News, Rawan Osman said, 'I’m happy that Israel has destroyed these weapons and warships.' She added that the Kurds should also be grateful, as such actions could prevent them from being targeted by jihadists. Osman further shared that individuals on the ground in Syria and Lebanon have expressed a readiness to pursue peace with Israel. 'We are sick of the Axis of Resistance and the misery they have brought,' she said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkmbe4w4ye	2024-12-11T06:32:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/rJMRekV27kg/rJMRekV27kg_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg
European pilots fear flying over Middle East	Growing safety concerns in the European air industry due to escalating tensions in the Middle East following Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 and the war in Gaza; 'No one should be forced to work in such a hazardous environment' In late September, an experienced pilot at low-cost European airline Wizz Air felt anxious after learning his plane would fly over Iraq at night amid mounting tensions between nearby Iran and Israel. He decided to query the decision since just a week earlier the airline had deemed the route unsafe. In response, Wizz Air's flight operations team told him the airway was now considered secure and he had to fly it, without giving further explanation, the pilot said. 'I wasn't really happy with it,' the pilot, who requested anonymity from fear he could lose his job, told Reuters. Days later, Iraq closed its airspace when Iran fired missiles on Oct. 1 at Israel. 'It confirmed my suspicion that it wasn't safe.' In response to Reuters' queries, Wizz Air said safety of crew and passengers is its utmost priority and would not be compromised 'in any circumstances', adding its decisions on where to fly are based on stringent risk assessments in collaboration with third party intelligence specialists. 'Our aircraft and crews will only fly in airspace that has been deemed safe and we would never take any risks in this respect,' Wizz Air also said in a statement. Reuters spoke to four pilots, three cabin crew members, three flight security experts and two airline executives about growing safety concerns in the European air industry due to escalating tensions in the Middle East following Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 and the start of the war in Gaza. The Middle East is a key air corridor for planes heading to India, South-East Asia and Australia and last year was criss-crossed daily by 1,400 flights to and from Europe, Eurocontrol data show. The safety debate about flying over the region is playing out in Europe largely because pilots there are protected by unions, unlike other parts of the world. Reuters reviewed nine unpublished letters from four European unions representing pilots and crews that expressed worries about air safety over Middle Eastern countries. The letters were sent to Wizz Air, Ryanair, airBaltic, the European Commission and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) between June and August. 'No one should be forced to work in such a hazardous environment and no commercial interests should outweigh the safety and well-being of those on board,' read a letter, addressed to EASA and the European Commission from Romanian flight crew union FPU Romania, dated Aug. 26. In other letters, staff called on airlines to be more transparent about their decisions on routes and demanded the right to refuse to fly a dangerous route. There have been no fatalities or accidents impacting commercial aviation tied to the escalation of tensions in the Middle East since the war in Gaza erupted last year. Air France opened an internal investigation after one of its commercial planes flew over Iraq on Oct. 1 during Tehran's missile attack on Israel. On that occasion, airlines scrambled to divert dozens of planes heading towards the affected areas in the Middle East. The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran and the abrupt ousting of President Bashar al-Assad by Syrian rebels at the weekend have raised concerns of further insecurity in the region. The use of missiles in the region has revived memories of the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014 and of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 en route from Tehran in 2020. Being accidentally shot-down in the chaos of war is the top worry, three pilots and two aviation safety experts told Reuters, along with the risk of an emergency landing. While airlines including Lufthansa and KLM no longer fly over Iran, carriers including Etihad, flydubai, Aeroflot and Wizz Air were still crossing the country's airspace as recently as Dec. 2, data from tracking service FlightRadar24 show. Some European airlines including Lufthansa and KLM allow crew to opt-out of routes they don't feel are safe, but others such as Wizz Air, Ryanair and airBaltic don't. AirBaltic CEO Martin Gauss said his airline meets an international safety standard that doesn't need to be adjusted. 'If we start a right of refusal, then where do we stop? [When] the next person feels unhappy overflying Iraqi airspace because there's tension there?' he told Reuters on Dec. 2 in response to queries about airBaltic flight safety talks with unions. Ryanair, which intermittently flew to Jordan and Israel until September, said it makes security decisions based on EASA guidance. 'If EASA says it's safe, then, frankly, thank you, we're not interested in what the unions or some pilot think,' Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told Reuters in October, when asked about staff security concerns. EASA said it has been involved in a number of exchanges with pilots and airlines on route safety in recent months concerning the Middle East, adding that disciplining staff for raising safety concerns would run counter to a 'just culture' where employees can voice worries. Reassurances are not enough One Abu Dhabi-based Wizz Air pilot told Reuters he was comfortable flying over the conflict-torn region as he believes the industry has a very high safety standard. But for some pilots and crew members working at budget airlines, the reassurances of the companies are insufficient. They told Reuters pilots should have more choice in refusing flights over potentially dangerous airspace and requested more information about airline security assessments. 'The fact that Wizz Air sends emails asserting that it's safe is irrelevant to commercial employees,' read a letter from FPU Romania to Chief Operating Officer Diarmuid O'Conghaile, dated Aug. 12. 'Flights into these conflict areas, even if they are rescue missions, should be carried out by military personnel and aircraft, not by commercial crews.' Mircea Constantin, a former cabin crew member who represents FPU Romania, said Wizz Air never gave a formal response to this letter and similar ones sent earlier this year, but did send security guidance and updates to staff. A pilot and a cabin crew member, who declined to be named for fear of retaliatory action, said they got warnings from their employers for refusing to fly on Middle Eastern routes or calling in sick. Congested skies over the Middle East Last month, 165 missiles were launched in Middle Eastern conflict zones versus just 33 in November 2023, according to the latest available data from Osprey Flight Solutions. But airspace can only be enforcedly restricted if a country chooses to shut it down, as in the case of Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Several airlines have opted to briefly suspend flights to places like Israel when tension rises. Lufthansa and British Airways did so after Iran bombarded Israel on April 13. But this limits the airspace in use in the already congested Middle Eastern skies. Choosing to fly over Central Asia or Egypt and Saudi Arabia to avoid Middle Eastern hot spots is also more costly as planes burn more fuel and some countries charge higher overflight fees. Flying a commercial plane from Singapore to London-Heathrow through Afghanistan and Central Asia, for instance, cost an airline $4,760 in overflight fees, about 50% more than a route through the Middle East, according to two Aug. 31 flight plans reviewed by Reuters. Reuters could not name the airline as the flight plans are not public. Some private jets are avoiding the most critical areas. 'At the moment, my no-go areas would be the hotspot points: Libya, Israel, Iran, simply because they're sort of caught up in it all,' said Andy Spencer, a Singapore-based pilot who flies private jets and who previously worked as an airline pilot. Spencer, who has two decades of experience and flies through the Middle East regularly, said that on a recent flight from Manila to Cuba, he flew from Dubai over Egypt and north through Malta before refueling in Morocco to circumvent Libyan and Israeli airspace. EASA, regarded by industry experts as the strictest regional safety regulator, issues public bulletins on how to fly safely over conflict zones. But these aren't mandatory and every airline decides where to travel based on a patchwork of government notices, third-party security advisors, in-house security teams and information sharing between carriers, leading to divergent policies. Such intelligence is not usually shared with staff. The opacity has sown fear and mistrust among pilots, cabin crew and passengers as they question whether their airline has missed something carriers in other countries are aware of, said Otjan de Bruijn, a former head of European pilots union the European Cockpit Association and a pilot for KLM. 'The more information you make available to pilots, the more informed a decision they can make,' said Spencer, who is also an operations specialist at flight advisory body OPSGROUP, which offers independent operational advice to the aviation industry. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When Gulf players like Etihad, Emirates or flydubai suddenly stop flying over Iran or Iraq, the industry sees it as a reliable indicator of risk, pilots and security sources said, as these airlines can have access to detailed intelligence from their governments. Flydubai told Reuters it operates within airspace and airways in the region that are approved by Dubai's General Civil Aviation Authority. Emirates said it continuously monitors all routings, adjusting as required and would never operate a flight unless it was safe to do so. Etihad said it only operates through approved airspace. Passenger rights groups are also asking for travelers to receive more information. 'If passengers decline to take flights over conflict zones, airlines would be disinclined to continue such flights,' said Paul Hudson, the head of U.S.-based passenger group Flyers Rights. 'And passengers who take such flights would do so informed of the risks.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjpa2zvn1l	2024-12-11T05:26:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/01/14/H1yDx5p0w/H1yDx5p0w_0_108_885_498_0_small.jpg

Kfar Aza and surrounding communities begin massive restoration ef...	Kibbutz Kfar Aza begins its restoration journey 14 months after start of Gaza War; Backed by a $52 million government plan, efforts include rebuilding homes, upgrading infrastructure and fostering community resilience with the focus of long-term recovery Fourteen months after the tragic events of October 7, demolition and reconstruction efforts have begun in Kibbutz Kfar Aza as part of a government-funded recovery initiative led by the Tkuma Directorate. The comprehensive restoration plan includes repairs to 400 structures – 360 residential buildings and 40 public facilities – as well as infrastructure damaged during the Gaza War. Additionally, 97 buildings are slated for demolition, including 48 in the young people's neighborhood, where a final decision on their fate is still pending. The decision to rehabilitate Kfar Aza has not been without challenges, as kibbutz members struggled to reach a consensus. Ultimately, an agreement was reached, and state-funded restoration efforts are now underway. Most residents of Kfar Aza are currently living in temporary housing in Kibbutz Ruhama, while at least 100 others are staying in Kibbutz Shefayim. It remains unclear how many families will return to Kfar Aza, a place that bore the brunt of the October 7 attacks. The restoration of Kibbutz Kfar Aza is part of a broader recovery program led by the Tkuma Directorate, with an estimated total budget of $390 million The Tkuma Directorate has allocated approximately $52 million for the restoration plan, which includes demolishing and rebuilding private and kibbutz-owned homes, constructing a new young people's neighborhood in a different location, and repairing public infrastructure damaged during the war. The plan also involves creating new public facilities, establishing a new residential neighborhood, and upgrading public buildings, sports facilities and recreation centers. To manage the project, the kibbutz has partnered with the management firm A. Epstein & Sons Ltd. In recent months, the Brothers in Arms organization, along with volunteers, has already begun renovating parts of the kibbutz where homes were damaged but did not require complete demolition. However, full-scale reconstruction from the ground up is a complex task that only the government can undertake. The restoration plan for Kibbutz Kfar Aza was developed in collaboration with the kibbutz community. As part of a broader vision for recovery and independence, the Tkuma Directorate’s framework emphasizes community-led execution. This approach expands the existing compensation mechanism through the Israel Property Tax Fund, increasing it by up to 400% to address the unique circumstances and severe impact of the Gaza War on the kibbutzim and surrounding communities. Following a request from Yossi Sheli, head of the Tkuma Directorate, to Rabbi Natan Elnatan, chairman of the National Planning and Building Council, the kibbutz’s application for a permit exemption was approved. The permit allows for the construction of a neighborhood with 55 single-family homes, a new young people's zone with 60 housing units, a public building and a shared workspace. The plan also includes demolishing existing structures, relocating three portable residential units, and rebuilding 41 housing units and one public building across 29 damaged structures. Additional work includes paving roads, creating parking lots, developing open spaces, upgrading infrastructure and modifying existing buildings. Among the communities in the Tkuma region, a unique financial arrangement was developed for 10 kibbutzim, including Kfar Aza, Be’eri, Nir Oz, Nirim, Re’im, Kerem Shalom, Ein HaShlosha, Holit, Kissufim and Nahal Oz. This agreement, made between the Tkuma Directorate and the Israel Property Tax Fund in collaboration with kibbutz leadership, eliminates the need for individual claims to the tax fund. Instead, the allocated budget for restoration is comprehensive and includes settlements with the Property Tax Fund. This arrangement reduces bureaucracy and provides flexibility for the kibbutzim to tailor their recovery and rebuilding plans to the needs of their communities. The restoration of Kibbutz Kfar Aza is part of a broader recovery program led by the Tkuma Directorate, with an estimated total budget of $390 million. All the kibbutzim in the region have joined the initiative, each at various stages of planning, approval, and implementation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'On the anniversary of the October 7 attacks and the outbreak of the Gaza War, the vast majority of the kibbutzim in the Tkuma region have begun implementing local recovery plans, despite numerous challenges,' the Tkuma Directorate stated. These challenges include the ongoing conflict, security concerns, the relocation of communities to temporary housing, debris removal, and the emotional toll and uncertainty faced by communities, some of which still have members held in captivity. 'The Tkuma Directorate will continue to work alongside the communities of the region to ensure recovery, development, and prosperity,' the statement concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/h1jzkgw4je	2024-12-11T03:54:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/rJgz5Z1vEJl/rJgz5Z1vEJl_0_0_1536_2048_0_small.jpg
The Israeli Jews who spied for Iran are biggest infiltration in d...	The arrest of almost 30 mostly Jewish citizens who allegedly spied for Iran in nine covert cells has caused alarm in the country and points to Tehran's biggest espionage effort in decades Israel's arrest of almost 30 mostly Jewish citizens who allegedly spied for Iran in nine covert cells has caused alarm in the country and points to Tehran's biggest effort in decades to infiltrate its arch-foe, four Israeli security sources said. Among the unfulfilled goals of the alleged cells was the assassination of an Israeli nuclear scientist and former military officials, while one group gathered information on military bases and air defenses, security service Shin Bet has said. Last week, the agency and Israel's police said a father and son team had passed on details of Israeli force movements including in the Golan Heights, where they lived. The arrests follow repeated efforts by Iranian intelligence operatives over the past two years to recruit ordinary Israelis to gather intelligence and carry out attacks in exchange for money, the four serving and former military and security officials said. The sources asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 'There is a large phenomenon here,' said Shalom Ben Hanan, a former top Shin Bet official, referring to what he called the surprising number of Jewish citizens who knowingly agreed to work for Iran against the state with intelligence gathering or planning sabotage and attacks. Shin Bet and the police did not respond to requests for comment. Iran's foreign ministry did not respond to questions. In a statement sent to media after the wave of arrests, Iran’s UN mission did not confirm or deny seeking to recruit Israelis and said that 'from a logical standpoint' any such efforts by Iranian intelligence services would focus on non-Iranian and non-Muslim individuals to lessen suspicion. At least two suspects were from Israel's ultra-Orthodox community, police and the Shin Bet have said. Unlike Iranian espionage operations in previous decades that recruited a high-profile businessman and a former cabinet minister, the new alleged spies were largely people on the fringes of Israeli society, including recent immigrants, an army deserter and a convicted sex offender, conversations with the sources, court records and official statements show. Much of their activity was limited to spraying anti-Netanyahu or anti-government graffiti on walls and damaging cars, Shin Bet has said. Nonetheless, the scale of the arrests and involvement of so many Jewish Israelis, in addition to Arab citizens, has caused concern in Israel at a time it remains at war with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza and that a cease-fire deal with Hezbollah remains fragile. Shin Bet on October 21 said the espionage activities were 'among the most severe the state of Israel has known.' The arrests also follow a wave of attempted hits and kidnappings linked to Tehran in Europe and the United States. The unusual decision to provide detailed public accounts of the alleged plots was a move by Israel's security services to signal both to Iran and potential saboteurs inside Israel that they would be caught, Ben Hanan said. 'You want to alert the public. And you also want to make an example of people that may also have intentions or plans to cooperate with the enemy,' he said. Israel has achieved major intelligence successes over the past few years in a shadow war with its regional foe, including allegedly killing a top nuclear scientist. With the recent arrests Israel has 'so far' thwarted Tehran's efforts to respond, one active military official said. Iran has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the related fall of Tehran's ally, former president Bashar Assad in Syria. Social media recruits Iranian intelligence agencies often find potential recruits on social media platforms, Israeli police said in a video released in November warning of ongoing infiltration attempts. The recruiting efforts are at times direct. One message sent to an Israeli civilian and seen by Reuters promised $15,000 in exchange for information, with an email and number to call. Iran has also approached expatriate networks of Jews from Caucasus countries living in Canada and the United States, said one of the sources, a former senior official who worked on Israel's counter-espionage efforts until 2007. Israeli authorities have said publicly some of the Jewish suspects were originally from Caucasus countries. Recruited individuals are first assigned innocuous-seeming tasks in return for money, before handlers gradually demand specific intelligence on targets, including about individuals and sensitive military infrastructure, backed by the threat of blackmail, said the former official. One Israeli suspect, Vladislav Victorsson, 30, was arrested on October 14 along with his 18-year-old girlfriend in Ramat Gan. He had been jailed in 2015 for sex with minors as young as 14, according to a court indictment from that time. An acquaintance of Victorsson said he had told her he had spoken to Iranians using the Telegram messaging app. She said that Victorsson had lied to his handlers about his military experience. The acquaintance declined to be named, citing safety fears. Igal Dotan, Victorsson's lawyer, said he was representing the suspect, adding that the legal process would take time and that his client was being held in tough conditions. Dotan said he could only respond to the current case and had not defended Victorsson in earlier trials. Shin Bet and police said Victorsson knew he was working for Iranian intelligence, carrying out tasks including spraying graffiti, hiding money, posting flyers and burning cars in the Hayarkon Park in Tel Aviv for which he received over $5,000. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the investigation made public by the security services, he was found to have subsequently agreed to carry out an assassination of an Israeli personality, throw a grenade into a house and also look to obtain a sniper rifle, pistols and fragmentation grenades.

Trail of 5 who attacked Maccabi Tel Aviv fan after match in Amste...	Suspects, ages 19 to 32, are accused of acts of 'violence against the public' and other crimes after Amsterdam soccer match; Two additional suspects to be held for trial later in week The trial of five suspects began on Wednesday for the lynching that took place after the soccer match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in the UEFA Europa League, a month and three days after the pro-Palestinian assault in Amsterdam. One of the suspects, a 22-year-old, is accused of attempted murder and has been in custody since November 19 (11 days after the incident). The others, between the ages of 19 and 32, are charged with several offenses, including 'committing acts of violence against the public,' incitement to violence and spreading antisemitic messages in a WhatsApp group. According to Dutch outlet Trouw, two more suspects are expected to begin their trial on Thursday. Last week, the Amsterdam police released a photo of 12 suspects – 11 men and one woman – on television calling on them to turn themselves in. In the footage, the female suspect is seen holding a Maccabi Tel Aviv fan by the neck and others are recorded kicking other fans. The images were blurred and the police said that the suspects were involved in several incidents following the match between the two teams. Dozens of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were attacked after their team's 5-0 loss at the Amsterdam Arena. One victim, a 30-year-old, said: 'I had just finished four months of reserve duty in Gaza and what I experienced there was no less frightening. They ran me over and pulled a knife on me.

Alan Dershowitz on Netanyahu trial: 'He should be allowed to be t...	Famous defense attorney tells Ynet that having a sitting prime minister sit in court is 'unrealistic' and shares his hopes for good relations between the Trump and Netanyahu administrations; 'Trump believes in peace through strength' Following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s testimony in his alleged corruption trial on Tuesday, set to continue Wednesday afternoon, U.S. defense attorney Professor Alan Dershowitz spoke in an interview with Ynet about the consequences of an incumbent prime minister being held on trial for the first time in the country’s history. Professor Dershowitz, how realistic is it that a prime minister runs a country like Israel and at the same time testify three times a week for a month? 'It's totally unrealistic, totally illogical and this case proves beyond any doubt that the American approach is far superior to the Israeli approach. Under the American approach, if you're the president, you cannot be put on trial during the presidency.' 'Being a president is a full-time job, and no prime minister should ever be put to the choice of ‘Are you going to resolve the issues in Syria? Are you going to fight Hezbollah? Are you going to try to get the hostages back?’ And at the same time have to defend yourself against cigars and champagne.' 'It's the wrong approach. There's no reason why Netanyahu's trial could not be postponed until after he's out of office and an ordinary citizen. This case proves beyond any doubt why the American system works. And if anybody ever tries to change the American system, we will cite the situation in Israel as proof why the American system is far better than the Israeli system.' Does this imply you feel that Prime Minister Netanyahu is being prosecuted by the legal system? 'I don't think that the case, as I've seen it, is strong enough to bring criminal charges. The criteria aren't clear, there should be rules as there are in many countries saying $1,000 of goods or items, not a penny more, but not a penny less. It shouldn't be left to the discretion of prosecutors and judges to determine how much is too much.' 'There are too many matters of degree in this case and matters of degree should never be the basis for criminal charges. The line should be crystal clear, and it's not.' Does seeing Prime Minister Netanyahu in court as a defendant cause Israel damage, especially in these times? 'I don't think he's causing them damage. I think the damage is being caused by the system. He should be allowed to be the prime minister 24/7.' 'He should be allowed to make the hard decisions about whether Israel should go into the Golan Heights, whether they should be bombing the chemical factories [in Syria], what attitude should be made toward the return of the hostages. That's a full-time job. It's not his it's the fault of the system that he's being detracted from that.' 'I know he said he can do both, the point is can he do it as well? And my view is that he should be allowed to be the prime minister as long as he is the elected prime minister of Israel without any interference. That doesn't put him above the law, that just changes the law so as to recognize the reality that a prime minister's job is a full-time job.' To your knowledge, how involved is U.S. President-elect Trump in the hostage negotiations? How significant is it for him? 'We don't know for sure, but President Trump's election by itself has had a big impact on the Middle East. There's no doubt that President Trump's election increased the deterrence against Iran attacking Israel.' 'Remember, Iran promised it would attack immediately and then as soon as Trump was elected, somehow that was forgotten. Now Trump has said that he wants the hostages returned by January 20. Don't know whether that will be, but it's a good thing. And so I'm glad from Israel's point of view that Trump is being very tough on the hostages. I hope it will have an impact. We all hope it will have an impact.' Can we assume that Trump's inauguration will bring about a hostage deal faster? 'We hope so. Trump believes in peace through strength. That you get peace through strength.' How do you think the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu will look like in the new administration? 'I can tell you this, just weeks after Trump was elected the first time, I was at Mar a Lago for dinner with a friend, and Trump walked in. He turned to me and he said: ‘You, I have to talk to you.’ And I said, ‘Why?’ He said, ‘You're a friend of Prime Minister Netanyahu.’ I said, ‘Yes.’ 'And he said, ‘I want to use you to send messages to your friend the prime minister.’ And I did. And I continue to serve, hopefully, as a bridge between two people I know quite well. Now, obviously, Trump can talk directly to the prime minister who he knows.' 'He can talk to, the prime minister's team who he knows and many people on Trump's team are very close to Israel. Obviously, Mike Huckabee, and many others. It's a close connection that has been nurtured over many years and I think it will serve both countries very well.' Can you share with us some of those, messages you delivered? 'Of course not.'

Issues that need indirection rather than direction. Look, I'm happy to help any president of the United States, whether they're liberal or conservative or Republican or Democrat. I'm American. I'm a Zionist.' 'Everybody knows my views on Israel and America and I'm happy to help both countries in any way that's mutually beneficial.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkzj3cin1e	2024-12-11T02:09:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/S1ExcdrNyx/S1ExcdrNyx_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

Iran's Khamenei says Assad's fall is US-Israel plot	Iran’s Supreme Leader accused the US and Israel of overthrowing the Assad regime in Syria, as tensions rise in Tehran; Revolutionary Guard commanders engage in a blame game, with criticism mounting against Quds Force leadership over Iran’s collapsing influence in Syria and the region Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, addressed what he called the 'recent regional developments' in a public speech, breaking his silence on the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria. Khamenei pointed fingers at the United States and Israel, declaring, 'There is no doubt that what happened in Syria was orchestrated in American and Israeli command rooms.' However, contrary to Khamenei’s claims, global intelligence agencies – including Israeli organizations like the General Intelligence Directorate and Mossad – were reportedly caught off guard by the rebels’ rapid success and Assad’s downfall. Turkey, Tehran and Moscow were equally blindsided by the speed of the regime’s collapse. During his speech, Khamenei also took aim at an unnamed 'neighboring country to Syria,' accusing them of playing a role in Assad’s fall. 'Even the neighboring government has had a hand in this, but the main culprits are the U.S. and Israel,' he said. Without elaborating, he added: 'There is a nation that played a prominent role in what happened in Syria – and continues to do so.' Despite the collapse of Assad’s regime, Khamenei maintained that Iran’s regional influence remains intact. 'The resistance will now expand across the entire region, stronger than ever before,' he proclaimed. 'Those who believed weakening the resistance would weaken Iran fundamentally misunderstand the essence of resistance. Iran is strong and will only grow stronger. The more they fight the resistance, the broader its front will become, encompassing the whole region.' In an official statement released before Khamenei’s speech, Iran reiterated its commitment to maintaining 'friendly' relations with Syria, stating, 'Iran and Syria share a long history, and we expect this friendly relationship to continue.' Blame game erupts in Iran over Assad’s collapse Even before Khamenei’s speech, Tehran was already embroiled in a heated internal blame game over the rapid collapse of Assad’s regime, which many see as a devastating blow to Iran’s regional axis of power –an influence it had painstakingly built over decades. Within Iran’s security forces, tensions have reached a boiling point. Members of the Revolutionary Guard described the atmosphere as chaotic, filled with mutual accusations and frustration. 'It’s a mix of people yelling at each other, punching walls, kicking over trash cans – everyone is blaming someone else,' a source in Tehran told The Telegraph. 'No one is taking responsibility.' The source explained that Iran’s leadership was completely unprepared for Assad’s departure. 'No one ever anticipated Assad would flee. For the past 10 years, our entire focus was on keeping him in power. And it wasn’t because we loved him, but because his presence ensured our proximity to Hezbollah and Israel.' Iran had invested millions of dollars in propping up Assad’s regime, actively intervening in Syria’s civil war since the mid-2010s. Yet, Assad fled the country just before rebel forces reached Damascus. The rebels’ offensive was launched as a surprise attack, coinciding with a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah – another key pillar of Iran’s regional axis. 'You need people on the ground to send weapons, but they’re either being killed or fleeing,' another Revolutionary Guard source shared. 'Right now, everyone is focused on figuring out how to move forward from this deadlock. No one is even talking about weapons anymore; everyone is just trying to make sense of what’s happening and how dangerous this situation is for Iran.' Some within the Revolutionary Guard have begun directing their anger at Ismail Qaani, the commander of the Quds Force, accusing him of allowing Assad’s army to fall apart. 'No one dares to tell him this directly, but he bears responsibility. He didn’t do anything to stop Iran’s interests from collapsing. Our allies are falling one after another, and he’s just watching from Tehran. Worse days may be ahead,' the source warned. Tehran faces leadership crisis amid defeat Behind the scenes, Tehran is grappling with an internal crisis. Revolutionary Guard insiders have suggested Supreme Leader Khamenei may be considering replacing Qaani, with growing calls for his removal. The commander has come under increased scrutiny, particularly after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated. Following Nasrallah’s death, Qaani disappeared for an extended period, leading to speculation that he might have been under investigation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to sources, Khamenei has summoned senior commanders several times in recent days as the Syrian rebels advanced toward Damascus. 'The situation is bizarre, and heated discussions are taking place. There’s also increasing concern over what to tell Iran’s supporters,' a Revolutionary Guard insider revealed. For years, Syria has served as a linchpin in Iran’s broader regional strategy, providing a critical corridor for supporting Hezbollah and exerting influence in the Middle East. The sudden collapse of Assad’s regime has dealt a heavy blow to this strategy, leaving Tehran scrambling to reassess its position and navigate the fallout from this unexpected defeat. With its axis of influence unraveling, Iran faces the sobering challenge of rebuilding its regional foothold in the face of mounting adversities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hktv3pivje	2024-12-11T01:18:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/Hkghj1aL4Je/Hkghj1aL4Je_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Rebels take over 70% of Syria, as Israeli strikes on country's mi...	Leading Syrian rebel faction has remained silent about Israeli strikes on Syrian government military infrastructure; Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham in the northwest and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast are trying to reach a permanent cease-fire to ensure 'a political process for Syria’s future' Reports continue to emerge from Syria showcasing the extensive destruction of former President Bashar al-Assad’s military infrastructure, targeted by Israel. According to IDF estimates, the campaign has wiped out approximately 70%–80% of Syria’s strategic capabilities. Over 350 airstrikes were carried out, hitting around 320 critical targets. One of the most significant strikes occurred at Kamishli Airport, located near the Turkish border, over 400 miles from Israel’s northernmost point. Additionally, new images from Barzeh, near Damascus, reveal near-total destruction of the infamous Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, a facility linked to Assad’s chemical weapons program. This site, suspected of being used by Iran for missile development, has been repeatedly targeted by Israel in recent years. Meanwhile, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, the leading Syrian rebel faction, has remained silent about the Israeli strikes. The group's focus appears to be on forming a provisional government to consolidate control over Syria following the rapid fall of Assad’s regime. NBC News reports that the Biden administration is considering removing Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham from the U.S. list of terrorist organizations, a move that would also lift the $10 million bounty on the group’s leader, Abu Mohammad al-Julani. Residents of Damascus describe the recent days as a surreal mix of terror and relief. 'Gunmen are firing into the air in celebration, shaking the streets, while Israeli airstrikes echo in the distance. It feels like a nightmare, but then you remind yourself it’s also a dream come true – because Assad is gone,' Moutaz Hussein, a local, told The Wall Street Journal. Another resident, Hani Qousbatoi, told The Washington Post: 'The fear is starting to fade, but now the only concern is the Israeli strikes.' While Assad and his family have reportedly sought asylum in Moscow, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed in an NBC interview that Russia facilitated their 'secure relocation.' When asked if Assad would face trial, Ryabkov deflected, saying, 'Russia is not a party to the International Criminal Court.' Arab media has closely followed the developments in Syria, particularly Israel’s unprecedented military activity. Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar, known for its ties to Hezbollah, headlined the situation as 'The Struggle of the 'Day After.'' The outlet noted that since Assad’s fall, Israel has launched its most extensive strikes on Syria since 1973, combining airstrikes with limited ground operations. Qatar’s Al-Arabi al-Jadid newspaper accused Israel of turning Syria into 'fair game,' highlighting its strikes on military infrastructure and defensive systems, as well as alleged Israeli actions in the Golan Heights, which have drawn official condemnations from several Arab nations. UN Special Envoy to Syria Geir Pedersen called for Israel to halt its strikes, accusing it of exploiting the situation. 'This must stop. Syrian factions are working to establish a stable government, and international actors should not derail this process,' he said. The operation primarily targeted Iranian entrenchment in Syria and the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, while also aiming to create a secure buffer zone along Israel’s northern border. The IDF has emphasized the campaign is an ongoing effort requiring constant monitoring and precise intelligence. Military officials stress that Israel is not involved in Syria’s internal conflict and is operating solely to protect its own security and the residents of the Golan Heights. They also noted that, despite their activity in the buffer zone, Israeli forces are avoiding direct engagement with local Syrian populations. Israel began its operation even before Assad’s fall was certain. In the 24 hours leading up to the operation, the IDF expanded its air superiority, enabling hundreds of strikes on key targets. These included aircraft, coastal and surface-to-air missiles, underground facilities, weapons depots, Scud missiles, cruise missiles, radar systems, tanks, and advanced Syrian naval vessels equipped with coastal missiles. Intelligence for these strikes had been gathered over years. Rebels take control of 70% of Syria, but fighting continues The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebel forces now control 70% of Syrian territory. However, fighting persists in several regions. Hassan Abd al-Rani, a senior rebel commander, announced that opposition forces have fully captured Deir ez-Zor, a city in eastern Syria that had been a stronghold for pro-Iranian militias. The city was heavily bombed by U.S.-led coalition forces during the war, and coalition bases in the region were also targeted in retaliatory strikes. In another hotspot, the northern city of Manbij in Aleppo Province, clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – comprised of Kurdish rebels and financed by the United States – and opposition forces reportedly led to a ceasefire agreement. SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi stated that his forces, with U.S. backing, reached a truce with Turkish-supported Syrian opposition groups to ensure 'safety and security for the people.' Abdi added, 'Our goal is a nationwide ceasefire and a political process for Syria’s future.'

They also announced a ban on the seizure of public property and the occupation of government institutions or military outposts. The situation in Syria remains fluid, with significant challenges ahead despite the rebels’ territorial gains. As the dust settles from Assad’s downfall, the focus now shifts to rebuilding and stabilizing a fractured nation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkzzj2lvye	2024-12-10T23:47:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/11/BJXwziUE1l/BJXwziUE1l_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Three men who made pilgrimage to West Bank shrine managed to escape and evacuate to the hospital after suffering minor injuries; IDF reports incident is under investigation Three Breslov Hasidic Jews entered Joseph’s Tomb in the West Bank's Nablus Tuesday overnight independently and without coordination with security authorities. According to security sources, suspects opened fire at their vehicle. The three sustained minor injuries and managed to escape, eventually reaching Hadassah University Hospital. 'A report was received overnight regarding suspects opening fire at an Israeli vehicle that breached a checkpoint and illegally entered the city of Nablus,' the IDF said in a statement. 'The vehicle exited the city and its occupants independently evacuated themselves to the hospital. The incident is under investigation.' 'The three men are being detained for questioning by the Israel Police. Entry into Area A is dangerous and prohibited for Israelis by law,' the military added. This incident comes just two days after a similar case in which Hasidic Jews entered the site without coordination. That incident ended with their vehicle being found abandoned and set on fire.

IDF expedites strengthening of Syria buffer zone with October 7 a...	Division working near the Golan Heights plants new mines and combat engineering tactics to prevent possible terrorist infiltrations on the border The IDF is accelerating its 'New East' project and adding new combat engineering elements along the international border in the Golan Heights to prevent the scenario of armed terrorists infiltrating Israel. The 210th Division’s engineering unit, which oversees the Golan Heights sector, mobilized additional work teams from other regions in recent days to expedite the plan that began even before the start of the war in Gaza – with the goal of disrupting vehicle-mounted incursions using light off-road vehicles. Teams are operating throughout the week, sometimes at night, and, following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime and the takeover of the Syrian Golan by unaffiliated armed rebels, the work teams are also secured by deployed IDF forces in the buffer zone over the last week. Tactical combat engineering lessons learned partly from how Hamas' Nukhba terrorists’ breached the western Negev are being applied in the Golan. The work includes new minefields, deploying explosive charges and digging deep trenches. The IDF is prioritizing fortifications in areas closer to threatened settlements in the area and sectors with limited visibility, such as the hilly northern Golan or the rocky Wadi ar Ruqqad in the south. Some operations involve engineering explosives to give the buffer zone near the border a 'facelift' not seen since the 1974 cease-fire agreement with Syria. 'We've also leased civilian equipment and dozens of bulldozers and excavators are working swiftly and efficiently. It's a dynamic border obstacle with components tailored to the threat,' one of the division’s officers said on Tuesday. The morning after Assad's regime fell, the IDF entered the buffer zone. According to foreign reports, tanks and infantry forces were stationed along the Golan border’s Alpha Line. That night, IDF fighter jets reportedly carried out waves of strikes around Damascus, targeting advanced weapon systems and arms production facilities to prevent them from falling into rebel hands. A chemical weapons depot in Syria was also targeted. The IDF stressed at the time that 'the IDF does not intervene in events taking place in Syria. The IDF will continue to operate as necessary to maintain the buffer zone and protect the State of Israel and its citizens.' Strikes in Syria continued at the same time and the IDF prevented arms smuggling into Lebanon. After special forces operatives crossed the border and seized the highest Mount Hermon peak – for the first time in over 50 years – the military bolstered artillery and tank forces in the Golan and the buffer zone, as well as at key Syrian control points near the border. Syrian army posts in the Golan were abandoned and the IDF is monitoring the remaining weaponry in the area. The Syrian opposition-affiliated Voice of the Capital news outlet claimed that 'Israel is systematically destroying all brigades and battalions of the previous regime in southern Syria, directly targeting all air defense systems, missile depots and development and production facilities. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The targets include any site that participated in, produced or developed weapons that could threaten Israel,' according to the report. Assad’s regime developed various capabilities over the years with support from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.

The rebel groups are diverse and unpredictable, making weapons like chemical arms in the hands of extremist Sunni Islamic rebels a serious risk. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rki2ajlvyl	2024-12-10T23:00:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/HyXfg00UN4ke/HyXfg00UN4ke_0_728_1536_864_0_small.jpg

Syrians return home after 11 years in exile, face legal and infra...	Turkish political parties in the government and the opposition have long called on refugees to return to Syria voluntarily – an appeal made much more relevant by the fall of the regime After 11 years living as a refugee in Gaziantep, Turkey, Mohammed returned home to Aleppo for the first time this week. He is just one of the thousands of Syrian refugees already returning to Syria in the wake of Bashar Assad’s fall from power, in the first voluntary, formal return of Syrians since the civil war broke out in 2011. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians in Turkey took to the streets on December 8 to celebrate the end of the Assad regime, but the return home may be more complicated than the celebration suggests. Syria lacks basic infrastructure, and many refugees are missing official documents and legal records. Mohammed, who arrived in Aleppo yesterday with his wife and children, said that he had reunited with his mother after 11 years of separation. His decision to return wasn’t thoroughly planned, but it seemed inevitable once the regime fell, Mohammed said, since Assad was the reason his family fled. The return of Turkey’s 3 million Syrian refugees has long been advocated by Turkish opposition parties as well as the government. Hosting the Syrians, who have temporary residency status, has created a burden on Turkey. The strain has sparked political tension between parties and increased racist incidents in recent years. Violent attacks on Syrian refugees have often been met with a lax response from authorities. On Wednesday, Turkey announced that all its border crossings with Syria would operate 24/7 and allow for the free passage of belongings and household items into Syria. Analysts view this as an effort to clear major Turkish cities of Syrians, whom opposition parties have used as a pressure point against the Turkish government. Human rights activist Molham Al-Sayed said that opposition parties have long pushed for a voluntary return of Syrians when clashing with the government. Turkish authorities made similar arguments when clashing with the EU, Al-Sayed said. Now that many Syrians are voluntarily returning, those polemics will be put to bed, he said. Many Syrians in Turkey believe it is still premature to make the return, fearing that Syria could spiral back into chaos. Ahmed Mansour, a refugee living in Istanbul, said that he has not yet decided whether to return. He cited Syria’s current state of disorder and emphasized the need for careful consideration. Legal expert Mahmoud Hammam told The Media Line that refugees ought to resolve any legal issues in Turkey before leaving. He cautioned against a hasty departure, noting that unresolved issues such as bank accounts, electricity and water accounts, or improperly returned properties could result in significant losses. Some of those returning to Syria have lived their entire lives in Turkey.

'These are historic moments for Syrian families,' she said.

Optimistic messages and conflicting reports: 'Not there yet' on h...	Senior Israeli officials have been informed that Hamas is interested in a cease-fire and hostage deal but there are still gaps, including the number of hostages who will be released in the first round; Sources familiar with the details have denied reports that Hamas lists of living hostages have been transferred to Egypt Senior Israeli officials were informed Tuesday night that Hamas wants a cease-fire and hostage release deal, in light of the visit of Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi to Egypt , and the assessment in Israel that a deal could be reached within a month. Israel, however, denies that there lists of hostages who will be released in the first phase of the deal have already been produced and passed from Hamas to Egypt in recent days, despite Arab reports. 'We're not there yet,' said sources familiar with the details. In addition, there is also substantial disagreement over the number of hostages who will be released in the first round. In Egypt, Bar and Levy met with their counterparts and discussed regional security issues against the backdrop of assessments that a deal could be reached to release the hostages 'within a week or two.' The meeting dealt, among other things, with the sensitive situation in the Middle East after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. In addition, they also discussed security issues between the countries, including the issue of the hostage deal and specifically the Philadelphi Corridor, although as far as is known this is not an official negotiating delegation. Senior Israeli and Egyptian officials have met from time to time and as needed several times since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip in order to discuss security issues. According to the same reports about the lists that were transferred, such as one published in the Saudi Asharq Al-Awsat, the meeting between Halevi and Bar and their Egyptian counterparts included receiving a list of names of live hostages, some 30 in number. The newspaper quoted a 'source familiar with the details of the deal' as saying that 'the meaning of the visit is that we are closer to a cease-fire.' The newspaper noted that acceptance of the Egyptian proposal might come by the end of the week, or at the latest by the middle of the month. According to the same source, the proposal under discussion talks about a cease-fire of up to 60 days, at a rate of two days for each Israeli hostage, while Hamas will keep the soldiers and 'the most important hostages' for additional rounds. A political source told Ynet Tuesday that progress has been made on the issue of negotiations for a hostage deal. 'The starting point so far was that Hamas did not want a deal, and today it seems as if this has changed. Until two weeks ago, I thought Hamas did not want a deal, and today I tend to think that it has changed its mind,' he said. 'The situation has changed,' the source also claimed. 'The conditions have changed. Hamas wanted many fronts and that's over. There are no fronts, so there is a chance of reaching a deal in the coming month.' Former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant met Tuesday at the White House with Brett McGurk, the U.S. presidential envoy to the Middle East. 'At the center of our conversation was the real possibility of a breakthrough on the issue of the release of the hostages in the near future. I emphasized to the presidential envoy that the coming days will be critical for the release of the kidnapped and that I view this mission as of supreme national and ethical importance,' Gallant said. 'The current progress is made possible by the series of operational achievements that the State of Israel has achieved through its security forces in all sectors of the fighting - in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran, which has established the strength and supremacy of the State of Israel throughout the Middle East, and weakened the Shiite axis, to the point of the fall of the murderous Assad regime. Also in the continuation of my expected meetings in Washington, I will place the vital task facing us at the center of the discussion - to return the hostages to Israel.' Meanwhile, Minister Yoav Ben-Tzur of the Shas Party said that party chairman Aryeh Deri 'is working in every way for the welfare of the families of the hostages, and in the confidential discussions he is pushing with all his might for a deal to return them, a deal that security officials support.' He added: 'The return of the hostages is our duty and our responsibility, and our desire is a quick deal and the release of everyone in one fell swoop.' A senior Egyptian official told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth Tuesday morning that the announcement of an arrangement that would lead to a cease-fire and a deal is 'very close.' A Hamas delegation led by senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya left Cairo on Sunday night, following discussions with the head of Egyptian intelligence, General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad, and his team. On Tuesday, it was reported that the delegation had handed over to the Egyptians a detailed list of Israeli hostages - sick and elderly, women and men - that Hamas is offering to release in the first phase. The Hamas delegation also handed over a detailed list of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons that Hamas is demanding to be released as part of the new deal. The Egyptian official clarified that an Israeli delegation is scheduled to leave for Cairo this week for a meeting at the intelligence headquarters, during which they will be given the lists of Palestinian hostages and prisoners. Hamas made it clear to Egypt that 'there is a better chance than ever before of closing a deal,' in exchange for the release of the prisoners and Israel's withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor and other areas in the Gaza Strip.

This is how world media is reporting about Netanyahu's corruption...	International media outlets emphasize the precedent of a sitting prime minister going on trial - in the middle of a war; Fox News notes Netanyahu's jab at former President Barack Obama The leading Western media outlets did not ignore the historical event that took place on Tuesday in Tel Aviv, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the country's first sitting prime minister to testify as a criminal defendant. CNN noted that this was the first time that a serving prime minister in Israel had been called to testify in a criminal trial against him, and emphasized that Netanyahu claimed that the Israeli media, which is characterized by left-wing ideologies, had attacked him for years for his 'security policy.' CNN also noted that the 75-year-old Netanyahu has been forced to testify during the war in Gaza and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, splitting his time between the courtroom three times a week and the war room in the defense headquarters at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv, which is just minutes away. 'Outside the courthouse, he is one of the most powerful men in the Middle East,' wrote the New York Times, who oversees 'Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, its occupation of southern Lebanon and recent strikes in Syria.' The newspaper chose to emphasize that: 'As he stepped into a cramped and sweltering underground courtroom in Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel morphed into the defendant in Case 67104-01-20 – charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.' The New York Times added that: 'Eight years after the police started investigating him and four years after his trial began, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister was taking the stand for the first time to respond to accusations of corruption that have defined and disrupted Israeli public life for nearly a decade.' Obama made it clear to me that U.S. policy was going to take a sharp turn against the ideas I believed in The Wall Street Journal opened with a description of Netanyahu's duties as prime minister as well as his long-awaited trial. 'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand on Tuesday to testify in his long-running corruption trial even as he manages a multi-front war – underscoring the tensions around his leadership,' the newspaper reported. The WSJ also did not ignore the fact that this was a precedent in Israel, listing the charges against Netanyahu and the fact that his testimony would last at least several weeks. The Journal also emphasized that the trial is a reminder of the controversy in Israeli society surrounding his leadership, the change in Netanyahu's attitude toward the judicial system following his legal troubles, the attempted judicial overhaul and the protests that followed. The Washington Post focused on the fact that Netanyahu had tried to avoid appearing in court for years, despite the prime minister's claims that he had 'waited eight years to speak and present the truth.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Netanyahu rejects 'absurd' charges at corruption trial,' read the BBC headline. The British news website, known for its hostile attitude toward Israel, reported that the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history had become the first sitting prime minister to take the witness stand as a criminal defendant. His lawyer, Amit Haddad, claimed that this was a biased trial and that his client was 'the victim of a political witch hunt,' since 'the prosecution did not investigate a crime, but an individual.' It later noted that Netanyahu had downplayed the charges against him, emphasizing his political legacy. A different and unusual angle of coverage was presented on the Fox News website, where it emphasized Netanyahu's rocky relationship with former President Barack Obama and his then-Secretary of State John Kerry. 'Obama made it clear to me that U.S. policy was going to take a sharp turn against the ideas I believed in,' Netanyahu recounted of his interactions with the U.S. in the early days of the Obama administration.

Yemenis wish for fall of the Houthis just as Damascus was liberat...	The collapse of the Axis of Resistance emboldens Yemeni dissidents to hope for the fall of the Houthis; Political researcher in Yemen says: 'What happened in Syria should worry the Houthis' The overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria and the weakening of the Iranian-Shiite axis raise concerns for the Houthis in Yemen. There are already those who do not rule out the possibility that Sanaa will be liberated from the Houthis just as Damascus was liberated from Bashar Assad. 'It is a matter of time before the Houthis will face the anger of the people over their injustices,' Yemeni political commentator Mahmoud al-Taher told the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. The Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote on Tuesday that the consequences of the rapid collapse of the Assad regime are not limited to Syria, and are expected to affect the entire region, especially the Iranian proxies, which include the Houthis. The resistance axis has been subjected to extensive attacks in Lebanon and Syria in recent months, and Iran has also suffered a blow from Israel. The impact on support for militias loyal to the axis could be decisive. Yemeni political researcher Adnan Hashem told the Qatari newspaper that the fall of Assad could certainly symbolize the end of the Axis of Resistance, or at least deal a strategic blow that should worry the Houthis and make them reconsider their steps. 'They are part of the axis, and Iran is recalculating,' said the political researcher. 'Therefore, the question is whether there is an element that is able to benefit from the circumstances.' Iran's intervention in Syria and its protection of the regime then led the Houthis to storm Sanaa The researcher also noted that the collapsed regime in Syria did not have any significant relations with the Houthis as Assad recently closed the Houthi-run Yemeni embassy in Damascus and asked its employees to leave Syria. At the same time, he was the first to recognize the terrorist organization and gave it military advice. 'The revolution in Syria will lead to the weakness of the Houthis' Yemeni journalist Salman al-Makrami told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the Arab region cannot be separated, especially when it comes to geopolitical changes such as the fall of the Assad regime. According to him, Iran's intervention in Syria and its protection of the regime then led the Houthis to storm Sanaa. The journalist explained that the fall of the city of Aleppo in 2016 to the Syrian regime and later to other cities in its territory, led to the concentration of efforts by Iran and Hezbollah in the conflict in Yemen and the Houthis' shift from defense to offense. Therefore, he said, 'the revolution in Syria will lead to the weakness of the Houthis.' Makrami added that the Houthis' are heavily dependent on Iran, Hezbollah, the Syrian regime, and the Hashd al-Shaabi forces, which unite Shiite militias supported by the Iraqi government. According to him, the loss of these arms makes the Houthis, for the first time since their establishment, dependent on an incompetent ally. 'Until now, the Houthis have not dared to publish a statement of support in which they mentioned the Syrian government. Their media has launched a fierce attack on the Syrian opposition,' he explained. The Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported on Monday that the dramatic events in Syria have awakened the appetite of Houthi opponents who are hoping for a coup in Yemen. While members of the terrorist organization are fearful of the developments, the opponents have not hidden their joy at Iran's defeat in Syria, and hope that something similar will lead to the restoration of Sanaa. The chairman of the Presidential Leadership Council in Yemen, Rashad al-Alimi, said: 'The time has come for the Iranian regime to lift its hand from Yemen, respect its sovereignty and identity, and allow its children to build their country and create the best future that everyone deserves.' The Yemeni people certainly have good reasons to be angry. The images of prisoners seen being released in recent days from prisons in Syria, after decades of being held in harsh and horrific conditions, remind Yemenis of what the Houthis are doing in their country. This terrorist organization also holds political opponents in prisons, carries out indiscriminate arrests, and separates children from their families to take them to terror camps.

On Monday, they claimed responsibility for launching the drone that exploded in Yavne, and earlier this week they took additional responsibility for 'attacking a military target in the south.' Due to the Houthis' support for Hamas since the beginning of the war, Israel has attacked Yemeni territory several times. Now, with the weakening of the Iranian axis, how do the Houthis intend to continue their actions in support of Gaza? >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1dsv484yl	2024-12-10T13:30:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/19/SklwNmuO0/SklwNmuO0_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Israel can ‘completely destroy enemy army without war’ if it cont...	Israel has taken control of Syria's buffer zone, including Mount Hermon, citing strategic security; Experts warn instability post-Assad poses risks, with extremist groups gaining ground requiring potential long-term Israeli presence Israel’s concern that the instability in Syria could spill over into its territory has led it to major action in the neighboring country, essentially opening an additional front in the multi-front war it has been engaged in for 14 months. Over the weekend, the Israel Defense Forces took control of the demilitarized buffer zone in Syria that was established as part of a 1974 cease-fire reached between the two hostile countries. In that buffer zone is Mt. Hermon's highest peak, the highest point on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea. 'The territory guarantees strategic control over the whole southern Syrian arena, which generates an immediate threat to Israel,' according to Kobi Michael, a researcher at INSS and the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. 'There is no higher vantage point than the Syrian part of the Golan.' Power in Syria is now de-centralized, with the country fragmented between several groups, most of them extreme Islamist, potentially posing a new array of threats to Israel. 'Israel is not looking to apply sovereignty to the buffer zone, but rather to militarily control the area in order to prevent danger under conditions of instability,' Michael assessed. Israeli officials have emphasized the tactical nature of the move, which also likely stems from the trauma from the surprise attack executed by Hamas terrorist on its border with Gaza last year. 'For decades, the Israeli security establishment considered the border with Syria its quietest and closely associated to the Assad regime,' said Dr. Joel Parker, a researcher from the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. 'Assad is the devil Israel knows, but at the same time, with the de-facto commitment to non-aggression with Syria, Israel watched it build up military abilities, including the development of chemical weapons, to levels that were far beyond when the armistice line was created.' In 2007, however, Israel carried out an airstrike against a suspected Syrian nuclear site. Years later, it took responsibility for the attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not allow its neighbors to develop nuclear weapons. Syria denied the site was a nuclear reactor. Now, Israel is taking advantage of the internal chaos. The Israeli military swiftly entered Syria, apparently reaching deep into its territory and taking control of the peak of Mount Hermon, which allows for an advantageous view of both Syria and Lebanon. Reportedly, the army also conducted airstrikes in Syria against sites that stored unconventional weapons, air-defense systems, and navy vessels. Video on social media showed explosions in various cities and pictures of alleged Syrian Air Force bases destroyed. 'This is an unprecedented event in which the Israeli army has the ability to completely destroy an enemy army without a war,' said Michael. 'This opportunity is being used wisely by Israel in order to ensure a better reality.' The IDF only confirmed it had entered the buffer zone and was holding positions there, denying reports its forces were approaching the capital, Damascus. This offensive has so far gone without a response from Syria or any of the factions currently holding control. Israel captured part of the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war. It annexed the territories in a move that was considered illegal by most of the international community, which still considers the territory Syrian. In 2019, the US departed from decades of policy and recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the territory. The other part of the mountainous area remained in Syria’s control. UN forces have patrolled the buffer zone since the 1974 agreement. 'The Golan Heights will be an inseparable part of the State of Israel forever,' said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a press conference he held on Monday night, indicating his country’s intentions. Netanyahu defined the movement into the buffer zone as temporary, but in the Middle East, what often begins as temporary often becomes permanent. The UN said the move violated international agreements. Arab leaders condemned it, and a spokesperson for the US State Department said that while it expected the move to be temporary, the US understood Israeli motives. 'The Syrian army abandoned its positions in the area … which potentially creates a vacuum that could have been filled by terrorist organizations that would threaten the state of Israel…every country has the right to take action against terrorist organizations, and every country, I think, would be worried about a possible vacuum that could be filled by terrorist organizations on its border, especially in volatile times, as we obviously are in right now in Syria,' said Matthew Miller. Israel is concerned that the different groups that are now clamoring for power in Syria after the regime of President Bashar Assad collapsed will be hostile. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who led the insurgency against Assad, is a former Al-Qaida terrorist who claims he has reformed and abandoned extremism. Classified by the US as a terrorist and previously imprisoned for his activities, he has been associated with the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Al-Golani leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), or the Organization for Liberating Syria. Videos on social media earlier this week showed HTS members vowing to help Palestinians in Gaza act against Israel and liberate Jerusalem from Israeli control. 'What is known about al-Golani poses red flags for Israel,' said Parker. 'He is the new kid on the block, associated with many jihadist operatives in the world, which has access to almost unlimited manpower. His charisma, his jihadi ideology, and his current control in Syria have Israel wanting to have access to chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, and even helicopters.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When the swift insurgency began, the Israeli army already put its forces on high alert, sending reinforcements. 'There is no way to tell where this is going,' said Michael. 'Israel could be facing a difficult reality that will force it to stay and broaden its hold on territory, perhaps even act more forcefully in order to pre-empt danger.' The collapse of the Assad regime is one of the most significant shifts to occur in the Middle East in decades. While Israel and Syria were sworn enemies under both Bashar Assad and his father, there was stability in the relationship, which has now been rattled. While this has removed Iranian presence from Israel’s border, it could be replaced by extreme Islam, which is also not favorable to the Jewish state. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkkwevlvkl	2024-12-10T12:52:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/HJfS4147VJe/HJfS4147VJe_0_207_1280_721_0_small.jpg

World Central Kitchen fires 62 employees in Gaza deemed 'security...	Aid organization fires dozens of employees after security background checks conducted by Israel; Comes after 3 of its employees were killed in IDF strike targeting one of the men, a Hamas terrorist who participated in the October 7 massacre The international aid organization World Central Kitchen, which operates community kitchens in the Gaza Strip, has fired at least 62 of its 500 employees after security background checks conducted by Israel. The layoffs came after several employees were identified as potential 'security threats,' and a week after airstrikes killed three of the organization's employees. The dismissals occurred a week after the Israeli Air Force attacked a vehicle belonging to the organization, which led to the deaths of five people, including three employees of the organization. The IDF said at the time that the target was a Hamas operative who participated in the October 7 massacre and was later found to be an employee of the organization In response, the organization issued an internal notice in Arabic to its employees, stating that the names of the employees had been transferred to Israel for security checks, and that a number of team members had been identified as a security threat and that it had been decided to terminate their employment 'for the safety of everyone in Gaza.' The World Central Kitchen, founded by Spanish chef Jose Andres, currently operates dozens of community kitchens in Gaza, mainly in the center and south of the strip. The organization's activities were suspended for a week after the latest airstrike. 'We are heartbroken that a vehicle carrying our employees was attacked by Israel. We are working with incomplete information, and are looking for more information,' the organization said at the time. 'We had no idea that anyone in the vehicle was in any way connected to the Hamas attack on October 7. The organization is suspending its activities in the Gaza Strip for the time being. Our hearts are with our colleagues and their families at this time.' In April, seven of the organization's employees were killed in an Israeli drone attack on its convoy of vehicles. The IDF later admitted that the attack was carried out by mistake after the vehicles were incorrectly identified. The incident, which sparked an international outcry, led to a suspension of the organization's activities. After about two and a half months, it resumed operations. Among the dead were three British citizens, a Polish citizen, an American-Canadian citizen, an Australian citizen, and one Palestinian. In Israel, the organization produces food under the supervision of chef Ruthie Russo, which it distributes to residents of the north. Since the outbreak of the war, the organization has distributed nearly two million food portions to residents, approximately 40,000 portions per day - all funded by the WCK. The organization's catering operates in the Tefen local council, which is near Karmiel, and produces hot meals as well as food baskets that include vegetables, fruit, milk and bread - all according to the needs of the residents. The food baskets are packaged at the Pitchon Lev organization headquarters in Karmiel, and are distributed through the municipal authorities.

Nasrallah assassination site becomes pilgrimage center	Although a funeral date has not yet been set for former Hezbollah Secretary-General in Beirut, his supporters and followers have established a commemoration site in his honor The date for the funeral of former Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah has not yet been announced, but in the meantime the site of his assassination in the Dahieh district, a Hezbollah stronghold, has become a pilgrimage center. Nasrallah was assassinated on September 27 and the attack site is still a disaster zone of rubble, but the destruction does not prevent Hezbollah supporters from holding daily events there. A few days ago, a festive event was held there in memory of Nasrallah. The event, called 'Light from Light' was attended by hundreds of participants who waved pictures of the assassinated Hezbollah leader, waved the terror organization's flag, and lit candles. The entire complex was illuminated with strong lighting, which colored the ruins red. In the background, eulogies for Nasrallah and slogans calling for following in his terrorist footsteps were heard. As part of the event, excerpts of Nasrallah's voice were also played. Local and foreign media outlets were present. The Saudi Al-Arabiya network reported on Wednesday from the site of the assassination that supporters and followers of all ages attended the events. Attendees waved Hezbollah flags alongside pictures of the organization's leaders who were killed throughout the war. The victory posters throughout Dahieh do not reflect the situation on the ground. Dozens of destroyed buildings have become open spaces. A notable visitor last week in the rubble of Nasrallah's assassination site is the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon. He returned to Lebanon the previous Sunday for the first time since being injured in the September pager bombing operation and being transferred to receive medical treatment in Iran. He arrived at the site of Nasrallah's assassination on Tuesday, just two days after returning to his position in Lebanon. This was not his first media appearance after the injury, but his first appearance in Lebanon. From the scene of the assassination, he said: 'The Lebanese people will continue their resistance and these attacks will not benefit Israel. Lebanon will remain strong, will regain its lands, and we will continue to support it. I wanted to hold my first appearance after the treatment from here, so that we can draw determination and strength from the souls of the dead.' Al-Arabiya claimed that most visitors arrive at the site dressed in black, and that many of them doubt the ability of Nasrallah's successor, the current Secretary-General Naim Qassem, to steer the ship. A visitor who was present on the day of the Iranian ambassador's arrival praised Nasrallah: 'He should be an example for every Lebanese.' According to Al-Arabiya, supporters of the late Hezbollah secretary-general are awaiting the date of Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine's funeral, which is expected to take place in Dahieh. According to the report, Hezbollah has not yet decided whether to hold the funeral before the end of the 60-day cease-fire with Israel or after. Hezbollah wants the event for Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine to be exceptional and without interruptions.

According to al-Diyar, Hezbollah is interested in building a shrine for Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine, similar to the one erected for former Hezbollah Secretary-General Abbas al-Musawi in the village of a-Nabi Chit in the al-Baqa'a region in Lebanon. The location of the shrine is reportedly currently under discussion, with three options – two of them in Beirut's Dahieh and one in the area of the old road leading to the airport. The location will be chosen based on the available space and the capacity to accommodate visitors. In the meantime, it seems that, as time passes, the site of the assassination in Dahieh, among the ruins, is becoming a significant focal point for visitors supporting the terrorist organization. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy6lxeiv1l	2024-12-10T11:22:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/HJ8d2Fg4kg/HJ8d2Fg4kg_737_36_1952_1099_0_small.jpg

Car ramming in Bnei Brak declared terror attack	Young man, 21, run down by vehicle and slightly injured; Arab Israeli driver arrested in nearby parking garage; Incident first called criminal but later determined to be terror-related; Comes after earlier stabbing attack at at the Karmiel police station A 21-year-old man was slightly injured Tuesday in a car-ramming attack in Bnei Brak. Immediately after the incident, the police arrested the suspected driver, an Arab Israeli man from the northern Arab town of Zemer in his 20s, who tried to flee the scene of the attack. The police initially suspected that the incident was criminal, but later determined that it was a terror attack. See Ynet's exclusive footage of the attack: The incident occurred at 5:40 p.m. The police received a report of a hit-and-run accident on the street in Bnei Brak, with the driver fleeing the scene and continuing on his way. A motorcyclist chased after the suspect's vehicle. Officers from the Bnei Brak-Ramat Gan Police Motorcycle Unit pursued and caught the suspect in the vehicle, in a nearby underground parking garage where he had fled. The police said that an initial investigation revealed that, the driver of the vehicle swerved onto the sidewalk while driving, and intentionally hit a pedestrian and continued driving until he was stopped by the police. A Magen David Adom spokesperson said: 'A report was received at MDA's 101 hotline in the Dan region about a pedestrian who was hit by a vehicle in Bnei Brak. MDA medics and paramedics are providing medical treatment and are taking a 21-year-old man to Mayanei Hayeshua Hospital in a minor condition with injuries to his limbs and back.' At noon, a police officer and a security guard were stabbed at the Karmiel police station, and after initially reporting that the background was criminal, the police updated that 'the investigation is examining all possibilities.' A young resident of the Arab town Nahf was arrested, and the condition of the station security guard is described as serious. The Shin Bet is involved in the investigation, and it appears that this was a nationalist attack.

California wildfire forces evacuations in Malibu; Pepperdine U st...	A rapidly intensifying wildfire burning just northwest of Los Angeles forced some residents in Malibu to evacuate as it threatened homes, knocked out power and closed roads in the beach community. The brush fire blaze, called the Franklin Fire, grew overnight from five acres (two hectares) to 2,200 acres (737 hectares) along steep terrain, spreading south over the Pacific Coast Highway in the picturesque coastal city of about 10,000 people. The fire, which has not yet been contained, has destroyed a small number of homes, but has not caused any injuries or deaths, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone told a news conference on Tuesday. 'We are going to have a coordinated ground and air assault,' Marrone said, noting that 300 additional firefighters will join the 700 already battling the blaze. 'Because of the difficulties in this particular area, time is of the essence for us to grab a hold of this fire.' The fire's cause remains unknown, Marrone said. An order for people to shelter in place was issued overnight for Pepperdine University in Malibu, forcing some students to evacuate to the school's commons and library.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjmd1z8nkl	2024-12-10T10:00:57-08:00

About 80% of Syrian military capabilities destroyed, IDF estimate...	After overthrow of the Assad regime, IDF attacked about 320 'strategic targets' in Syria; Monitoring what is happening in the neighboring country - as well as staying in the buffer zone - is an 'ongoing process,' IDF says; PM, in message from defense HQ, says: 'We want relations with the new regime, but if it allows Iran to return we will respond forcefully' The IDF estimates Tuesday evening that Operation Arrow of Bashan, which began on Saturday night, marks the end of the strategic phase of the offensive in Syria; Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reached out to the new regime and in a surprise statement said that Israel wants 'relations with the new regime.' In a statement from the Defense Ministries headquarters at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv, hours after his first day of testimony in his corruption trial, Netanyahu said that 'we have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs, but we clearly intend to do what is necessary to ensure our security. We want relations with the regime, but if it allows Iran to return or establish itself in Syria or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah or attacks us - we will respond forcefully. What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this regime.' 'Within this framework, I authorized the Air Force to bomb strategic military capabilities left behind by the Syrian army, so that they would not fall into the hands of the jihadists. This is similar to what the British Air Force did when it bombed the fleet of the Vichy regime that collaborated with the Nazis, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Nazis,' the prime minister added. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates 'strongly' condemned the IDF's takeover of areas in the Golan buffer zone. The Foreign Ministry in Abu Dhabi said that it rejects Israel's actions, which 'threaten further regional escalation.' About 80% of Syria's strategic capabilities have been neutralized During Operation Arrow of Bashan, the IDF says, some 320 strategic targets were destroyed in over 350 airstrikes, which focused on aircraft, weapons depots, missiles and air defense batteries, along with strikes on warships and advanced missiles of the Syrian Navy. The operation, which began overnight between Saturday and Sunday, was conducted in close coordination between the IDF branches, with the Military Intelligence and Northern Command forces leading the planning and execution of the operation on the ground, while maintaining air superiority and maximum protection of the buffer zone. The operation included strategic strikes that involved, among others, the Air Force and the Navy. The actions taken were primarily intended to harm Iranian attempts to establish themselves in Syria and prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, while creating a safe buffer zone on the northern border. The IDF estimates that approximately 70%-80% of Syria's strategic capabilities were neutralized during the operation, and additional actions are being taken to ensure that strategic weapons do not fall into the hands of hostile elements. The IDF emphasizes that this is an ongoing process that requires constant monitoring and accurate intelligence gathering. The army also emphasized that it does not intervene in the internal fighting in Syria, and acts solely to protect Israel and the residents of the Golan. In this context, the IDF said that, despite the activity in the buffer zone, troops are avoiding friction with locals in Syria. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At the same time, the IDF continues to monitor the stabilization of the terrain in the various conflict zones, while coordinating with the U.S. and the Lebanese army to prevent the weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist elements and other threats. Even though the Russian army has reduced its presence in the region, the IDF still identifies an Iranian presence and continues to monitor its activities. As part of cooperation with Egypt, high-level meetings were recently held that dealt with regional security issues, and the IDF emphasizes the importance working closely with international partners to preserve security stability. The IDF initiated the operations in Syria even before it was clear whether the Assad regime had fallen, and in the 24 hours preceding the operation in the buffer zone, it established air superiority and expanded it - which made possible the hundreds of attacks according to the priority of targets: aircraft, coastal missiles, underground bases, ships, weapons depots and weapons production facilities. Scud, cruise and surface-to-sea missiles, radars, tanks, surface-to-air missile batteries were also attacked, and the Air Force also attacked advanced vessels of the Syrian Air Force that had surface-to-sea missiles on them. Intelligence on all the targets was collected over several years, according to the IDF. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj2emwueke	2024-12-10T09:38:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/ryByBor4kg/ryByBor4kg_0_165_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Former hostage Noa Argamani recalls being injured in IDF strike o...	During emergency discussion with president on medical condition of remaining hostages, rescued hostage expresses concern about those she left behind; 'Doctor said I was a medical miracle, their fate might be worse than mine' Noa Argamani, who was rescued from captivity in Gaza in a heroic operation six months ago, participated Tuesday in an emergency discussion at the President's Office about the medical condition of the hostages. She said that in the full video of her taken by the terrorists during her captivity, she can be seen 'bruised, bleeding, with my entire head open, and no one came to help me. Not the Red Cross, not doctors, no one.' She referred in the public forum to the condition of the remaining hostages in captivity with great concern. 'We don't know what the condition of the 100 hostages who are still there is, and it is possible that their fate will be worse than mine,' she said. Argamani was joined by freed hostage Yocheved Lifshitz, whose husband Oded is still held captive in Gaza; Daniel Lifshitz, Oded's grandson; Professor Hagai Levine, head of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum health system, and Dr. Einat Yehene, a specialist rehabilitation psychologist from the forums' health system. Before Argamani's speech, the video from her Hamas captivity was shown. 'This is the shorter, censored video, because I wanted to spare you the full video,' she said. 'What actually happened was that the Air Force missile hit the building that I, Yossi Sharabi, and Itay Svirsky were in. As you know, Yossi did not survive. Two days later, Itay Svirsky was murdered and just this week his body was returned to Israel.' She added: 'I was left injured, and you see it in the full video. I'm talking about the fact that I was left there bruised, bleeding, with my whole head open, and no one came to help me. Not the Red Cross, not doctors, no one. When the doctors saw all the injuries when I returned, they said it was a medical miracle.' 'I was given the opportunity to be filmed while I was still in Gaza. I don't know how many hostages there are who suffered from the same situations as me, but they didn't have the right, they didn't get to publish a video like mine. In the end, I didn't receive treatment even though there was a video. We don’t know the condition of the 100 hostages still there, and their fate might be worse than mine.' Yocheved Lifshitz recalled how sick she was when she was released in the week-long hostage-for-prisoner exchange. 'I was in captivity for 17 days too many,' she said. 'I returned in a very sick state. I was sick and that was actually the reason they decided to release me because they were afraid I would infect everyone. While I was in captivity, I lost five kilos and my blood pressure dropped to the floor. If I had returned after 50 days, I would have returned in a coffin. What saved me was my contagious disease and the fact that the captors did not want me there.' Grandson Daniel Lipshitz spoke about how difficult it is to wait for the return of hostage relatives: 'The situation today is difficult and impossible, for each of the families who are still waiting. 431 days. 431 days of unimaginable suffering, physical and mental. Days of crying. The physical and mental deterioration is evident every day. There is nothing harder than waiting, knowing that you don't know what is happening, that you are all expecting a miracle to happen. And, yet, what gives the strength to continue and hold on is hope. The hope of seeing our loved ones return home for healing and burial,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Mr. President, I am addressing you directly,' he continued. 'We need you now. You are the moral voice of the State of Israel. You have expressed your opinion time and again about the need to stop this pain and return the kidnapped. Now more than ever, a sharp and clear public statement is needed that will say: 'All other things will stand aside, the return of the hostages is the main thing, this is the most important task now. We must use every possible means to ensure that no kidnapped person is left there. They cannot survive there any longer.'' Levine said the health of the hostages is a serious concern. 'Their health is deteriorating and they may not survive the upcoming winter. They do not have the reserves of the previous winter, they are all fragile and humanitarian cases. Despite all the challenges and threats, hope has not died. I was privileged to accompany Alma Avraham, after months of intensive care she is walking, recovering and getting better. As soon as the hostages reach us, we will know how to treat them, but for that they need to come here. The only cure is the return of all the abductees.' Yehene added that the hostages also are at a high risk of suicide. 'They can lose hope that they will be saved,' she explained. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjkhux8vkl	2024-12-10T09:00:33-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/HJfRB3rEkx/HJfRB3rEkx_59_54_740_416_0_small.jpg

UN envoy warns against sending refugees back to Syria too soon	Following the fall of the Assad regime, European countries rush to stop the waves of Syrian refugees as an act of repatriation, which the UN envoy opposes The U.N. special envoy for Syria said on Tuesday that European nations should not rush to repatriate Syrian refugees following the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, and he urged foreign players, including Israel, not to intervene militarily. Syria remained in disorder three days after Assad's overthrow, with conflict continuing in the northeast and Israel bombing targets and expanding its buffer zone inside the country. 'The situation in Syria is still fluid,' Norwegian diplomat Geir Pedersen told a news conference at the United Nations' Geneva headquarters. While many Syrians were eager to return home, 'there are livelihood challenges still. The humanitarian situation is disastrous. The economy has collapsed.' News of Assad's fall prompted politicians in several European countries to call for a pause to the processing of asylum applications or even for the repatriation of refugees from 13 years of conflict. '(Going back) is something many, many Syrians are hoping for, but let's makes sure the international community is helping them in this process,' he said. Israel's campaign of bombarding military installations in Syria - something it says is essential to its security - 'needs to stop,' Pedersen said. 'It is extremely important that we don't see any action from any international actor that destroys the possibility for this transformation in Syria to take place.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Syria's transitional arrangements also needed to be as inclusive as possible, involving the broadest possible spectrum of Syrian society, or risk further conflict erupting, he added. To that end, the international community should be 'realistic' about the terrorist designation of the HTS rebel group that toppled Assad. 'It is now nine years since that resolution (declaring HTS's predecessor a terrorist group) was adopted,' he said. 'The reality is so far that HTS and also the other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people ... of unity, of inclusiveness.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybg8j8ejl	2024-12-10T07:57:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2015/04/01/5970359/5970359_0_463_4288_2414_0_small.jpg
Israel ranks at bottom in reading and math for OECD countries	In literacy for adults ages 16 to 65, Israel ranks 27th out of 31 OECD countries, and in math at 26th; Data shows disparity between Jews and Arabs, with the gap in favor of Jews widening considerably A cause for concern: Israel is at the bottom of the OECD countries in reading and math. This is according to data published on Tuesday by the Central Bureau of Statistics and refers to the years 2022-2023. In reading literacy, Israel's average score is 244 compared to the OECD average of 260, and it was ranked 27th among the 31 countries that participated in the survey. Israel's score is similar to Italy. The data also shows that Israel is on a downward trajectory. Israel's score fell by 10 points compared to the first data cycle, which was conducted about a decade ago (2014-2015), and is mainly affected by the increase in the share of those with a low level of proficiency. Math does not look good either. Israel's average score is 246 compared to the OECD average of 263, and it was ranked 26th. The CBS found that Israel's score was similar to that of Italy, Lithuania and the United States. There was no significant change in Israel's score compared to the previous cycle. In adaptive problem solving, Israel's average score is 236 compared to the OECD average of 251, and it was ranked 25th. Israel's score is similar to Portugal, Croatia and South Korea. This is the first time that this skill has been measured in the survey. The Skills Survey is an international survey conducted by the OECD for the second time, and 31 countries participated in it. The survey examines the level of proficiency of adults (ages 16 to 65) in three basic skills: reading, mathematics and adaptive problem-solving. The CBS explains that these skills are considered extremely important for integration into the professional world and functioning as citizens in contemporary society. The survey directly measures the level of mastery of the skills and the way they are used at work and in everyday life. These skills are relevant to many contexts and situations in the world of work and in social life, and can be learned, so they can be influenced through policy. These skills give those who master them a good chance of making the most of the opportunities in today's information-rich society, while those who do not master them may be 'left behind.' The data also shows that a high proportion of the adult population in Israel has low levels of basic skills. The proportion of the population at low levels of reading literacy is 36%, compared to only 26% for the OECD average. The proportion at low reading levels in Israel increased from 27% in the first cycle. The proportion of the population at low levels of mathematical literacy is 34%, compared to only 25% for the OECD average. The proportion in Israel increased from 31% in the first cycle. In addition, the proportion of the population at low levels in adaptive problem solving is 40%, compared to the OECD average of only 30%. In the three measured categories, a large gap was seen between Jews and Arabs, similar to the first cycle. The Arab population saw a significant decrease of 26 points in reading literacy (from 225 to 199). In contrast, the Jewish population did not change, and its score remained similar to the OECD average (259 and 260, respectively). As a result, the gap in favor of the Jews widened from 39 points in the first cycle to 60 points in the current cycle. The data show that 70% of the Arab population has a low level of reading literacy. This is a significant increase compared to 46% in the previous cycle. The rate among Jews is only 25%. There was no change in mathematical literacy in either of the two population groups compared to the first cycle.

Trump’s close ties to Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and defacto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, drew heavy criticism after the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi The Trump Organization said it has leased its brand to two new real estate projects in Saudi Arabia just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. It will partner with Dar Global, a London-based luxury real estate developer that will lease the Trump brand but fully own and develop the projects in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. The two have partnered on other projects in the region, including the development of a golf resort in neighboring Oman. 'Following the remarkable success of Trump International Oman, as well as our most recent ventures in Dubai and Jeddah, we are thrilled to announce two additional projects in Riyadh,' Eric Trump, the president-elect’s son who oversees the company’s real estate interests, said in a statement released on Monday.

Satellite imagery show that Russian naval ships have left Moscow's base at Tartous on Syria's coast and some have dropped anchor offshore following the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by rebel forces. An image taken on Dec. 9 by Planet Labs showed at least three vessels in Russiaâ's Mediterranean fleet, including two guided missile frigates and an oiler, moored around 13 km (eight miles) northwest of Tartous. The rest of the fleet could not be immediately located in satellite imagery. In Moscow, Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Since Syrian rebels seized the capital Damascus on Sunday, Moscow, which was an ally of the Assad regime for decades, is now scrambling to make a deal with the rebels to guarantee the safety of two strategically important military bases. Russia has a major air base in the coastal city of Latakia and its naval facility at Tartous. The Tartous base is Russia's only Mediterranean repair and replenishment hub, and Moscow has used Syria as a staging post to fly its military contractors in and out of Africa. Previously, Russia had five surface ships and one submarine at Tartous, according to an analysis of satellite imagery by BlackSky and Planet Labs. An image taken on Dec. 5 by BlackSky showed all six vessels at the base. The Dec. 9 satellite images confirm earlier reports by Russian war blogger Ryba that the warships had left Tartous and taken up position off the coast for security reasons.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syojvcbvyg	2024-12-10T06:04:38-08:00

Optimistic message from Egypt: Hostage deal is 'very close'	Egyptian official tells Ynet that announcement of an agreement leading to a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is imminent; Source says that an Israeli delegation is set to arrive in Cairo this week and will receive from Hamas a list of living hostages; Hamas has made it clear: 'The chances of a deal are better than ever' After a senior Israeli official said on Monday that it would be possible to reach a hostage deal 'within a week or two ,' a senior Egyptian official also told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth on Tuesday that the announcement of an agreement that would lead to a cease-fire and a hostage deal is 'very close.' A Hamas delegation led by senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya left Cairo on Sunday night, following discussions with Egyptian intelligence chief Major General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad and his team. It was learned yesterday that the delegation had handed over to the Egyptians a detailed list of Israeli hostages - including the sick and elderly, women and men - that Hamas proposes to release in the first phase. The Hamas delegation also handed over a detailed list of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons that Hamas demands to be released as part of the new deal. The Egyptian official clarified that an Israeli delegation is scheduled to leave for Cairo this week for a meeting at the intelligence headquarters, during which they will be given the lists of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Hamas made it clear to Egypt that 'there is a better chance than ever before of closing a deal,' in exchange for the release of the prisoners and Israel's withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor and other areas in the Gaza Strip. The Al-Araby channel and the Al-Jazeera network in Qatar reported that, in talks in the Egyptian intelligence offices, an understanding was reached between Egypt and Hamas regarding the places from which the IDF will withdraw in Gaza, and that a week after the withdrawal, a cease-fire will be declared and the round of releasing Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners will begin. Israel, the Egyptian source clarified, will first withdraw from Rafah and areas to be determined in advance along the Philadelphi Corridor. Meanwhile, Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari commented on the progress in the negotiations, saying that his country had renewed contacts with Hamas and Israel 'in good faith' as part of the mediation toward a cease-fire in Gaza. 'We are open to any path that leads to an agreement, we have not given up on mediation,' he said. 'Negotiations are continuing and it is too early to talk about developments.' On Monday, an Israeli senior official estimated in an interview with Ynet that 'within a week or two' it would be possible to reach a hostage deal, and said that 'the conditions are ripe.' At the same time, sources close to a senior Hamas official said Monday that there had been significant progress in talks for a deal. According to the same sources, the terrorist organization agreed to a gradual cessation of the war, and to a deal that is divided into three stages and includes a gradual withdrawal. According to the proposed deal, they said, between the sixth and eighth weeks of the cease-fire, IDF forces will withdraw from the Rafah Crossing and from city centers, after which negotiations will begin for a permanent cease-fire and the release of the kidnapped soldiers. Hamas, the insiders claimed, has handed Egypt a list of the living Israeli hostages - and is waiting for Israeli agreements regarding the list of Palestinian prisoners it requested, which also includes high-security prisoners 60 'trial days', Presence in Gaza during the cease-fire An Egyptian official explained last week to Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth that the new proposal put forward by Cairo includes a gradual cessation of fighting in Gaza, with the Israeli side withdrawing from the Rafah Crossing, in parallel with the declaration of a temporary cease-fire for about 60 days. He emphasized that the first 60 days would be designated as 'trial days' for both sides - Israel and Hamas - and that, if the plan holds up, it would be 'the end of the conflict between the sides.'

During the 60-day trial cease-fire, Israel will maintain a military presence in Gaza. The proposal also addresses the possibility of Palestinian refugees returning to the northern Gaza Strip, as Hamas demands. As for the Rafah Crossing, according to the plan it is expected to be transferred to the management and supervision of the Palestinian Authority. In previous contacts, Israel raised the possibility of maintaining a certain surveillance capability through cameras at the Rafah Crossing. In addition, according to the senior Egyptian source, a joint management committee from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be established, which will include between 10 and 15 'independent Palestinian political technocrats.' The committee will be supervised by American representatives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by6osarnjg	2024-12-10T05:38:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/BJPNZehlye/BJPNZehlye_0_9_853_480_0_small.jpg

Syrian rebels swear to take revenge after freeing Assad prisoners	Rebel leader says will come after officials in Assad's regime and accuses them of war crimes after prisons holding his opposers are emptied, and they show signs of torture and abuse Efforts to form a new government in Syria continued on Tuesday following the historic overthrow of Bashar Assad’s regime and the end of the civil war that began in 2011, culminating in a resounding victory for rebel forces. Meanwhile, with the revelation of further evidence pointing to the regime's brutality against its opponents, the leader of the organization responsible for Assad's downfall has vowed to punish 'war criminals.' Syrian rebels told AFP on Monday that they found around 40 bodies with signs of torture in the morgue of a hospital located in a Damascus suburb. According to AFP, the bodies were placed in numbered sacks, with some labeled with the victims' names. AFP also reported that the morgue contained recently murdered victims alongside human remains. 'I opened the door of the morgue with my own hands, it was a horrific sight: About 40 bodies were piled up showing signs of gruesome torture,' a Syrian told the news outlet. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, who led the regime's overthrow, said the rebels intend to hold Assad regime officials accountable. 'We will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security officers and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people. We will pursue war criminals and ask for their hand over from the countries to which they fled,' he said. 'We will offer rewards to anyone who provides information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes. We have affirmed our commitment to tolerance for those whose hands are not stained with the blood of the Syrian people, and we have granted amnesty to those who were in compulsory service,' he added. Lebanese newspaper Nida' el-Watan on Monday reported that senior Assad regime officials, including some of his relatives, fled to Beirut under Hezbollah's protection. The report, citing 'senior security sources,' noted that among them was Ali Mamlouk, Assad's former national security adviser and head of the Syrian intelligence agency. The report added Assad himself received political asylum in Russia, where his wife and children are also located. Al-Jolani met with the toppled regime’s prime minister Mohammed al-Jalali to advance the establishment of an interim government and is set to meet Mohammed al-Bashir, who has been appointed to lead the government, on Tuesday. 'We are in the process of transferring executive authority to the interim government,' Al-Jalali said on Monday. 'We'll assist Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir in managing the next phase.' 'The government leading this transition has a plan and an understanding of the country's challenges. Our goal is to preserve Syria's state institutions and employees. The new administration seeks to build relations with neighboring countries,' he added. Meanwhile, banks in Damascus reopened for the first time since the regime's fall on Tuesday – a significant step toward a return to normalcy. Businesses in the capital also reopened. Released after 38 years in Assad’s prison The symbol of Assad's regime's cruelty is Sednaya Prison, located near Damascus. Rebels stormed the prison and freed inmates as they stormed the capital on Sunday. Videos published by Arab media showed the shocked prisoners cheering. Assad regime opponents called Sednaya a 'slaughterhouse,' where countless regime opponents — ranging from armed rebel fighters to peaceful protestors and dissenting military personnel — were sent since the uprising began in 2011. According to a 2017 Amnesty International report, up to 13,000 regime opponents were hanged in the prison between 2011 and 2015. The Associated Press reported that dozens of prisoners were freed from the prison on Sunday, but many remain unaccounted for. Over the past two days, thousands of Syrians have gathered outside the prison, hoping for news of loved ones who were sent there or disappeared during the war. Prisoners described how families waited anxiously for word of survivors, while frantic efforts inside the prison sought to locate hidden underground cells. However the White Helmets aid organization announced on Tuesday that searches in the prison concluded without any findings. The organization deployed five expert teams, including specialists in locating and rescuing individuals, wall breaching and accessing fortified doors, as well as search dogs and medical personnel. The organization said they 'found no hidden areas in the facility,' adding, 'We share the profound disappointment of the families of the thousands who remain missing and whose fates are unknown.' White Helmets Director Raed al-Saleh said on Monday that prisoners held in Sednaya endured 'hell': '[Sednaya] doesn’t give the impression that it is a prison. It is a human slaughterhouse where human beings are being slaughtered and tortured.'

Pope Francis will meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday, the Vatican said, as the Catholic pontiff has become more vocal in his criticism of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Abbas travels to Italy this week, where he is expected also to meet with Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The Vatican announced the meeting with Abbas in a brief note on Tuesday, but did not offer further details. In November, Francis suggested the global community should study whether Israel's campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people. The comment, in a forthcoming book, drew a public rebuke from Israel's ambassador to the Holy See. Francis and Abbas have met several times, and are last known to have spoken on the phone in November 2023, a month into the Israel-Hamas conflict. The pope, as leader of the 1.4-billion-member Catholic Church, is usually careful about taking sides in conflicts, but has recently been more outspoken about Israel's campaign. He has also criticized Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon, where it is fighting Hezbollah, as 'beyond morality.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1fr11phekg	2024-12-10T04:27:34-08:00

IDF demolishes Syrian navy in Latakia	While officials emphasize security measures international reactions range from condemnation by Arab states to cautious support from the US The Israeli Navy carried out a significant operation on Monday night, targeting and destroying much of the Syrian regime’s naval fleet. Missile ships struck numerous vessels armed with anti-ship missiles at the Al-Baida and Latakia ports, aiming to prevent these weapons from falling into the hands of hostile entities such as the salafist rebels who have taken over Syria. At the same time, reports from Reuters and Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al-Mayadeen indicated that IDF units crossed the buffer zone and advanced deep into Syrian territory, a claim the IDF denied. According to regional and Syrian security sources, Israeli forces are now positioned approximately 15.5 miles from Damascus, with some units reaching the town of Qatana, about 6.2 miles inside Syria, east of the buffer zone. Al-Mayadeen further claimed IDF troops had taken control of at least nine villages and towns in rural areas south of Damascus, approximately 12 miles from the Syrian capital. However, these claims were denied by a Syrian opposition-affiliated channel, which stated that Israel does not control villages in the Syrian Hermon region. 'Israeli warplanes launched over 100 strikes... including on the Barzeh scientific research centre,' the UK based Observatory for Human Rights said. Western countries including the United States struck the facility in 2018, saying it was related to Syria's 'chemical weapons infrastructure'. In response to the reports, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee dismissed them as 'completely false,' asserting IDF units remain within the buffer zone, stationed at defensive positions near the border to safeguard Israel’s security. Meanwhile, AFP reported that a 'scientific research center' in Damascus, tied to Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons program, was completely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. Additionally, the pro-Iranian Iraqi-affiliated Sabrin news agency reported that a chemist was assassinated at his home in Damascus. During a UN Security Council meeting, Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon defended Israel’s actions, describing them as 'limited and temporary measures.' 'Israel is not interfering in the ongoing conflict between armed groups within Syria. Our actions are solely focused on ensuring our security, and we remain committed to the 1974 disengagement agreement,' he stated. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told journalist in a briefing to the foreign media on Monday that the IDF operations near the border were designed to prevent a scenario similar to the events of October 7 from Syria. 'What guides us is safeguarding the security of Israel and its citizens,' Sa’ar said in a briefing to foreign journalists. The reported movement of IDF armored forces has drawn international condemnation. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry accused Israel of 'destroying Syria’s chance to restore security,' while Egypt referred to the operations as an 'occupation of Syrian lands.' In contrast, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller described the Israeli actions as a 'temporary measure' in response to Syrian military movements, adding, 'Ultimately, we want to see full adherence to the disengagement agreement, and we will ensure Israel follows through.' IDF continues forward defense operations in the buffer zone, deploying forces across strategic points to counter potential threats. This comes a day after the beginning of proactive measures to secure Israeli communities in the Golan Heights amid Assad’s regime collapse. Engineering, infantry, and armored units are also operating under the command of the 474th and 810th Brigades, stationed along the Israel-Syria border to defend the area.

Air Force commando units captured the summit, which provides critical observation and fire control over the rest of the Hermon range, as part of a broader strategy to strengthen Israel’s hold in the region. Additionally, residents in five Syrian villages near the border were instructed to remain indoors due to IDF operations. The Israeli Air Force has carried out over 300 airstrikes on military targets across Syria, primarily focusing on Syrian Air Force infrastructure. Western intelligence sources indicate these strikes aim to destroy Assad’s military assets, preventing them from falling into the hands of rebel forces who could potentially use them against Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkwb00cb41e	2024-12-10T03:35:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/BkewMHqrE1l/BkewMHqrE1l_336_331_2280_1284_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu says criminal trial is politically motivated, press aga...	Prime minister testifies as court begins to hear the defense against bribery, fraud and breach of trust; claims he would not have been indicted had his views been left-leaning; rejects he sought favors from benefactors Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was wrongly indicted because he was the leader of Israel's right-wing that his opponents sought to depose. The prime minister took the stand on Tuesday to testify in his defense in his criminal trial for three counts of corruption including bribery, fraud and breach of trust. If I were holding left-wing views, I would not have been suspected of criminal offenses or indicted, Netanyahu said after his defense council Amit Haddad argued that the prosecution was politically motivated. Netanyahu criticized the decision of the judges' panel for refusing to reduce the days he is to testify each week, after they rejected his attempts to delay his testimony. 'I am leading a country at war on seven fronts,' he said. 'A tectonic shift not seen in a century has occurred. That demands balancing the needs of the trial, which I recognize, and the needs of the country.' In response to a general question from Hadadd, Netanyahu recounted the many challenges he faced as prime minister in the years he was alleged to have committed crimes of corruption, including having to deal with the American administration under then president Barak Obama who wanted him to stop building in the West Bank settlements and tried to convince him to leave security of the West Bank in the hands of the Palestinian Authority. He spoke at length about the hostile media coverage that he received and still receives and said his efforts in engaging with publishers of leading media outlets – part of which was considered illegal and the basis of some of the charges against him, was to bring about more diversity in the Israeli media which he said was primarily left-leaning. Netanyahu is accused of providing his co-defendant Shaul Elovich with considerable business advantage for his Bezeq communictions company in exchange for more favorable coverage on Elovich's Walla news site. According to the charges, Netanyahu or his wife were in daily contact with Elovich and Walla executives to promote favorable stories or limit unfavorable coverage. Netanyahu said he was too busy to enjoy the amenities he was accused of accepting from benefactors, also among the charges he faces in his criminal trial. In on of the counts, he is accused of accepting valuable gifts and a steady supply of expensive cigars and Champaign from movie mogul Arnon Milchan. 'I work 17, 18-hour days and eat lunch at my desk. I occasionally enjoy a good cigar but never manage to spoke it entirely because I am interrupted by my work,' he said. 'I hate Champaign,' he added Netanyahu's testimony was the opening of the defense's presentation in the trial that has already been underway for four years. He will testify for the defense and then face cross examination by the prosecution. He was not forced to testify and chose to do so to improve his chances of acquittal but has tried repeatedly to delay his testimony citing the needs of the war. Since he told the Supreme Court that the criminal proceedings against him would not prevent him from carrying out the duties of prime minister and was therefore spared from having to recuse himself for the duration of the trial, that argument came with some risk.

Israeli project takes on challenges for parents with disabilities	Designer Dana Yahya and former Paralympic swimmer Erel Halevi talk about new initiative providing solutions for parents with disabilities in Israel since the October 7 attack The ongoing war in Gaza has left hundreds of young Israelis with new disabilities, many of them at an age when they are starting a family or raising young children. For them, and for thousands of other Israelis with disabilities, the question 'How can I take care of my children?' becomes a complex daily challenge. The answer to this challenge is provided by TOM - Tikkun Olam Makers, an Israeli-American initiative that has become a global movement operating in 35 countries, that develops innovative, accessible and affordable solutions for the needs of people with disabilities. Erel Halevi, a 33-year-old former Paralympic swimmer, is a living example of the ability of technology to change lives. A year and a half ago, when her eldest son Ron was born, she encountered a challenge that seemed insurmountable at the time. 'I've been walking with crutches since I was 11 and when Ron was born I realized that I had no way of handling the stroller,' she says. 'I wanted to go on walks like every mother, but how is that possible when you need both hands for the crutches?' The solution came in the form of a unique harness developed for her at TOM. 'We worked together on the development,' says Erel. 'The harness connects to the waist and allows me to push the stroller with my body’s movements, while my hands are free for the crutches. It simply changed my life.' 'For almost 16 years I represented Israel in competitions, including three Paralympic games,' she adds, 'Today I want to help others find the solutions that will allow them to live a full life despite, and with, their disabilities.' 'Every person should dream, and every person should believe that this dream is able to be realized', said Dana Yichye Shwachman, the head designer of TOM. 'When it comes to being a parent, it's not just a dream - it's a basic right.' Dana speaks from personal experience. She grew up in the 1980s with a wheelchair-bound father, at a time when the word 'accessibility' was almost foreign in Israel. 'I personally experienced the meaning of inaccessibility,' she shares, 'the frustration when my father could not take care of me himself.' What is the answer that the project gives to parents with disabilities? Dana: 'We develop solutions that allow them complete independence in caring for their children. For example, we took an IKEA crib and added a sliding opening mechanism with automatic locking, which allows a parent in a wheelchair to access the baby easily and safely.' 'Solutions that cost 80% less' The project, founded in 2014 by the Israeli-American entrepreneur Gidi Grinstein, who currently serves as the president of the project, is based on two central principles: open-source, and user participation in the development process. 'I don't think that those who use our products are people who have difficulty raising children,' emphasizes Dana. 'It is more likely that they simply do not have an environment that is adapted to their abilities. That is why our solutions are available to everyone - there is no intellectual property, everything belongs to the global community, and anyone can download the designs and manufacture the products themselves.' And what about the prices? 'We work with the Frugal Innovation approach, and use simple tools and available materials. The result is solutions that cost 80% to 99% less than market prices.' 'I don't think that those who use our products are people who have difficulty raising children,' emphasizes Dana. 'It is more likely that they simply do not have an environment that is adapted to their abilities. That is why our solutions are available to everyone - there is no intellectual property, everything belongs to the global community, and anyone can download the designs and manufacture the products themselves.' As part of the project's expansion of activities, Grinstein notes that TOM developed a unique university program. 'We operate in 57 leading universities in the world, training students to lead maker activities for the development and manufacturing of solutions on campus. This is an excellent way to reach young talent and harness them to our goal.' Students from Shenkar College and the Holon Institute of Technology HIT have already developed solutions that have gained international recognition. Among other things, they developed a unique safety belt that allows a parent in a wheelchair to sit a child on their lap safely - a solution that won the 'Community Award' in the 2023 TOM Global Innovation Challenge. A look to the future As a result of the ongoing war, the necessity of the project is re-validated. According to Grinstein, since October 7, 2023, communities of engineers and designers have been recruited to respond to the wounded soldiers of the IDF, in cooperation with the Rehabilitation Division and the Ministry of Defense, as well as hospitals and rehabilitation centers in Israel. The recognition of this activity was manifested in winning the prestigious Zero Project Award for 2025, which will be awarded this March in Vienna together with 77 other organizations from 45 countries. 'This is a great opportunity to present Israeli activities to the world,' Grinstein emphasizes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: With over 2,200 active volunteers, of which 750 are in Israel, the project continues to grow. 'We already have about a thousand solutions in development,' concludes Dana, 'from solutions for everyday needs such as eating and drinking - to sports and music. 'All solutions are available for free download on the website, and there is also the option of seeking help from the project's volunteer community, which also appears on the website. It is not only about Technology - it's about the basic right of every person to live independently and with dignity.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1w1mpnvye	2024-12-10T02:19:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/05/B14pqlJ4Je/B14pqlJ4Je_361_81_1452_817_0_small.jpg

Ministers, lawmakers show up to support Netanyahu at his criminal...	PM's coalition allies bemoan the ongoing legal proceedings as politically motivated and harmful to Israel’s security, while opposition voices highlight the stark contrast with the plight of hostage families Cabinet ministers and lawmakers, including the Knesset speaker came to support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Tel Aviv District Court on Tuesday when he began testifying in his defense in his criminal trial for corruption. This marks the first time in Israel’s history that a sitting prime minister has testified as a defendant. Before beginning his testimony, Netanyahu shook hands with politicians and other supporters who came to stand by him. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir attacked Atorny General Gali Baharav-Miara as he has been doing in the past year. 'I expect all ministers—whether present here or not—to bring to the next cabinet meeting a proposal to consider her removal,' he said, accusing her of 'fabricating cases' to bring down the right-wing government. Transportation Minister Miri Regev and Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi made a point to walk through the pro-Netanyahu demonstrators outside the courthouse. Regev emphasized her support for the prime minister. 'I am here to strengthen and support Netanyahu. It’s disgraceful that he is forced to testify during one of the most complex wars Israel has faced, a war imposed on us on seven fronts,' she said. 'A prime minister on the witness stand during wartime, in an attempt to humiliate and degrade him, is a blow to the country’s security. Who does this spectacle serve? Iran, Syria, Lebanon. And then people ask why public trust in the judiciary is eroding. This is why—because people see selective enforcement, because they see a political witch hunt against Netanyahu. I regret this situation, but it will not help anyone. We will continue to lead.' Karhi echoed the sane sentiments. 'The leaks and threats aim to bring us down—not just the prime minister, but all of us.' When asked by Ynet why he chose to attend the hearing instead of focusing on efforts to free the Israeli hostages held in Gaza, Karhi responded: 'Ask the prosecutors why they insist on holding three days of testimony a week instead of letting the prime minister focus on what matters now—hostages, the war, Lebanon, Gaza, Syria.' When pressed to comment on the criticism from families of hostages, who have called on Netanyahu to prioritize their plight over his trial, Karhi said: 'I think their call is important—to ask the judges and prosecutors to allow the prime minister to manage the war efficiently, instead of taking up his time three days a week.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Justice Minister Yariv Levin also commented on Netanyahu’s testimony, calling it a moment of profound injustice. 'It’s hard not to feel a deep sense of injustice this morning, seeing these proceedings continue against Netanyahu after years of legal harassment—and especially during these critical days when so much rests on his shoulders,' Levin said. 'Along with many Israeli citizens, I want to express my support for him. I know that today, too, he will stand tall and present the plain truth as it is.' Outside the court house the families of hostages held a vigil carrying pictures of Ron Arad, an air force navigator who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986 and has not been seen since soon after he was captured. They said they feared the same fate would befall their loved ones after being held by Hamas for over 430 days since the Oct. 7 massacre and after they accused the prime minister of refusing to make a deal that would bring about their release. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjw4pfh41g	2024-12-10T01:39:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/SJaIO00rEJl/SJaIO00rEJl_138_109_1115_628_0_small.jpg

Bereaved daughter establishes healing center for war victims	Shira Mark, who lost her father to a terror attack, brother to accident and younger brother in Gaza, says she wants to choose life and aid those who need it despite the pain The story of the Mark family is a chilling and unfathomable chain of losses, yet also a testament to the resilience of the human spirit to rise from grief. Shira Mark, who found herself taking on the role of an older sister and maternal figure to her younger siblings at a young age, is now establishing the 'Michael Center' in the Golan Heights — a recovery and healing center for those affected by war. The first tragedy struck the family eight and a half years ago when her father, Rabbi Michael (Miki) Mark, was murdered in a shooting attack in the southern Hebron Hills in the West Bank. Terrorists opened fire on the family vehicle, leaving Shira’s mother, Chava, critically injured, while two of her younger siblings, Pdaya and Tehila, were also wounded. Rabbi Mark, the head of a yeshiva in the settlement of Otniel and a central figure in the community, left behind a wife and ten children. In 2019, less than three years after her father's murder, Shira lost her older brother Shlomi. A former company commander in the Givati Brigade’s Shaked Battalion who continued into a career in the Shin Bet, Shlomi had been an anchor in Shira's life. He died in a motorcycle accident during his service. With the outbreak of the Gaza war, the family endured another blow. Their beloved cousin, Elchanan Kalmanson, fell during a heroic battle in Kibbutz Be'eri. Elchanan, an expert in urban defense and counterterrorism, worked tirelessly for 14 hours rescuing trapped residents in the kibbutz. Alongside his brother Menachem and nephew Itiel, a former team commander in the IDF Combat Engineering Corops’ Yahalom unit, they used an armored jeep to go house-to-house, saving civilians based on cries for help. Among others, they rescued a young girl hiding in a closet after her parents were murdered. Their efforts saved over 100 kibbutz residents before Elchanan was fatally shot by terrorists. Then came yet another devastating loss. Shira's younger foster brother, Pdaya, was killed in December 2023 during operational activity in Gaza. Lieutenant Pdaya Menachem Mark, a combat soldier in Givati's reconnaissance unit, was just 22 years old when he fell alongside seven of his comrades. Upon hearing of his cousin Elchanan's death, Pdaya refused to leave his soldiers to attend the funeral. He hadn’t returned home since the war began. 'Pdaya waited to serve in the IDF his whole life,' his sister Orit said. 'He always loved the land and family was everything to him.' Shira added, 'His bravery in battle was extraordinary, but Pdaya was a hero in everyday life as well, ever since the horrific attack that took our father and left our mother injured.' 'Pdaya managed to live a life full of meaning, resilience, and strength,' she recounted. 'Despite this third loss in our family, I don’t feel we’re defeated. This is a victory because Pdaya fought out of love, not hate.' From the depths of unimaginable pain and loss, Shira Mark has chosen life and aid for others. The 'Michael Center,' to be established in the Golan Heights, aims to provide a refuge for war victims — soldiers, women, men and children. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Named after her father, the center will stand as a living testament to the power of the human spirit to transcend pain and transform it into a source of hope and healing for others. 'I reach out to you with an open heart and a life story woven with pain and loss but also with hope and growth,' Shira said. 'Despite all the loss and hardship, I wholeheartedly believe in the power of healing and the possibility of living a life of hope and love.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hk54qe4ekg	2024-12-10T00:20:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2016/07/03/7109813/7109813_1_0_980_551_0_small.jpg
West Coast antisemitism: Israeli struck in California vehicular a...	A suspected hit-and-run in California leaves an Israeli-American injured, a yeshiva student stabbed in Brooklyn, and reports of over 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the US highlight a disturbing surge in hate crimes amid the Israel-Hamas conflict A night out turned violent for Roi Gross, a 28-year-old Israeli-American. While leaving a nightclub in Laguna Beach, California, Gross and three friends became involved in an altercation with two men who, according to reports, identified themselves as being of 'Palestinian-Iranian' descent. What started as a verbal clash reportedly escalated into accusations against Israel and criticism of the war in Gaza. The situation took a dangerous turn when one of the suspects allegedly got into his car, accelerated toward Gross and his group, and struck two of them. Gross suffered a broken leg and was taken to the hospital, where he underwent surgery and is awaiting another operation. Authorities have arrested several individuals connected to the incident, including one of Gross’s friends. Laguna Beach police are treating the case as a potential antisemitic hate crime and have vowed to hold those responsible accountable. 'This is the first time I’ve experienced such violence,' Gross, a former IDF soldier who moved to the United States in 2014, said. 'We tried to avoid confrontation, but the suspect acted maliciously, with clear intent to harm.' Yeshiva student stabbed in Crown Heights, Brooklyn In a separate incident, a yeshiva student in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood was stabbed in the neck and transported to a hospital in moderate but stable condition. The attack occurred near a well-known community event hall, and the suspect fled the scene immediately afterward. Police are working with local volunteers to track down the perpetrator, using security footage that shows the suspect, described as a young white male. The local 'Shomrim' organization stated that the stabbing stemmed from a personal dispute between the victim and the suspect, who is reportedly known to the community from prior incidents. They emphasized that the attack is not being treated as an act of terrorism or a hate crime. Investigations into the motive and circumstances are ongoing. Antisemitism surges to record levels amid Israel-Hamas conflict The first year of the Israel-Hamas conflict has seen a disturbing spike in antisemitic incidents across the United States. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), over 10,000 antisemitic incidents were recorded between October 7, 2023, and early September 2024, marking the highest number ever documented in a single year since the ADL began tracking such incidents in 1979. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: For comparison, the previous year saw 3,325 antisemitic incidents, highlighting the sharp increase in hate crimes targeting Jewish communities. This dramatic surge reflects the heightened tensions and divisions spurred by the ongoing conflict, with Jewish individuals and institutions increasingly targeted by violence and hostility. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk7xjoheyl	2024-12-10T00:19:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/rkeKE2rrNJe/rkeKE2rrNJe_0_239_570_321_0_small.jpg

Blame game in Iran after the fall of ally Assad's regime, report	IRGC official says Quds force commander watched from Tehran as Iranian allies fall; says no one in Iran expected Assad to flee leaving their assets compromised A 'blame game' is unfolding in Tehran, according to an official in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Crops (IRGC) on Tuesday, after the fall of the Assad regime and what appears to be the collapse of the Iranian axis established to spread the influence of Iran in the Middle East. An Iranian official told the British Telegraph newspaper that no one could have envisioned Assad fleeing Syria after the efforts of the past decade to keep him in power, not because he was much loved in Tehran but because the Iranians wanted to be close to Hezbollah and the Israeli border. Iran had invested millions of dollars in the support of Assad's regime after it intervened in the Syrian civil war. But Assad fled his country shortly before the rebels reached Damascus after their surprise uprising that began when the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, Iran's main proxy, came into effect. The official who spoke to the Telegraph said that Iran needed someone on the ground to receive arms, but everyone had either been killed or escaped. Now, he said the Iranians are trying to understand what was happening and how dangerous the situation was for Iran. He said some of the blame is being directed at Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Qudz force for allowing the Syrian military to dissipate as it had done but no one dares tell him to his face that he must assume responsibility. He did nothing to prevent Iran's interests to dissolve. Iran's allies have fallen one after the other as he sat watching from Tehran, he said, warning that worse days were ahead. Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei was expected to speak publicly on Wednesday about the recent developments. His office said Iran hoped to continue the 'friendly' relations with Syria. But behind the scenes, Tehran is in crisis. The IRGC official said there are rumors that Qaani would be replaced. After the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah by Israel in August, the Quds Force commander dropped out of sight for a time and the word on the streets was that he was being investigated. He said Khamenei summoned senior commanders of the IRGC a number of times in recent days, as the Syrian rebels advanced and that there were heated discussions and concerns about what Iran must tell its supporters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r15vjtrvyg	2024-12-09T23:51:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/SJUcbqsxke/SJUcbqsxke_0_0_2168_1220_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu begins testifying in his defense against charges of cor...	Prime minister set to take the stand in court for the first time after his attempts at delaying his appearance were overruled by judges in his case Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared at the Tel Aviv District Court on Tuesday to begin his testimony in his corruption trial. Netanyahu was indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust on three counts. This is the first time in Israel's history, a sitting prime minister has testified in his own criminal trial — the testimony expected to last no less than two months. Netanyahu arrived at the court house while ministers in his cabinet, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and lawmakers from his coalition gathered to support him. His son Avner was there as well. Protesters gathered outside the court including families of hostages held in Gaza who accused Netanyahu of delaying the release of their loved ones from captivity for political reasons. Following 120 prosecution witnesses, the defense phase in Netanyahu’s 'Case 1000, 2000 and 4000' trials begins with Netanyahu's testimony — a pivotal moment, as the prosecution's cross-examination will be crucial in determining the case's outcome. Netanyahu will take the stand from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and unusually, on Wednesday from 2:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Netanyahu has submitted four requests to the judges in the past month — asking for delays, reduction of testimony days and schedule changes — alongside petitions from Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana and Security Cabinet members. A petition to the High Court seeking to declare Netanyahu incapacitated during his testimony was also dismissed. Amid threats against his life and attempts to alter the testimony's format, Netanyahu's testimony will take place in a secure underground hall in the Tel Aviv District Court, despite the trial being held thus far in the Jerusalem District Court, as required by law for indictments against a sitting prime minister. Last week, the Shin Bet recommended moving the testimony to Tel Aviv for security reasons. The defense phase will begin with Netanyahu’s testimony followed by defense witnesses chosen by his legal team. The first day of testimony will open with a speech by Netanyahu's attorney, Amit Hadad, mirroring the opening statement by lead prosecutor Liat Ben-Ari during the prosecution phase. After Netanyahu’s defense witnesses, testimony will proceed with the other defendants: Yedioth Ahronoth and Ynet publisher Arnon Mozes in Case 2000 and Shaul Elovitch in Case 4000, each presenting their own defense witnesses. As with any witness, Netanyahu’s testimony will have two parts: direct examination by his attorney, featuring open-ended questions to align with the defense's strategy and cross-examination by Tel Aviv district attorney for tax and finance prosecutor Yehudit Tirosh for Case 4000 and her deputy Jonathan Tadmor for Cases 1000 and 2000. Unlike the prosecution, which must notify the defense of its witnesses immediately after filing the indictment, the defense has no such obligation. However, it’s customary for the defense to inform the prosecution of its witnesses shortly before their testimony. The defense has yet to disclose its witnesses but previously indicated plans to summon former Police Internal Investigations Unit heads Uri Carmel and Dovi Scherzer, Likud MK Moshe Saada and former Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit to address the issue of the AG's approvals for launching investigations into the prime minister. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Typically, prosecutors involved in a case don’t testify, and Mandelblit’s summon would require court approval if called on. In a press conference held last night — his first in 99 days — Netanyahu addressed his upcoming testimony. 'I've heard the media claim I want to evade the trial,' he said. 'Evade? What nonsense. For eight years, I've been waiting for this day — waiting to present the truth, waiting to completely dismantle the absurd and baseless accusations against me, waiting to expose the 'witch hunt' method once and for all.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy74twsvkg	2024-12-09T22:50:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/18/HkzYmNAdzyl/HkzYmNAdzyl_325_238_851_479_0_small.jpg

Top Assad regime officials find refuge in Beirut's finest hotels	Senior members of the deposed Syrian regime in Lebanon after fleeing to Hezbollah’s protection as rebel forces approached Damascus; coordinated escapes, bribes, and secret crossings highlight the regime’s collapse Fleeing what might have been a far more gruesome fate, senior Syrian officials and members of former President Bashar Assad’s family have reportedly sought refuge in Beirut, cloaked under the protective umbrella of Hezbollah. According to Lebanese newspaper Nidaa al-Watan, the high-ranking defectors, including intelligence officers and business elites, are now holed up in luxury hotels across the Lebanese capital, with Hezbollah and Lebanese security forces ensuring their safety. Among the notable figures is Ali Mamlouk, Assad’s former national security advisor and head of Syrian intelligence, who is no stranger to controversy. Convicted of terrorism by Lebanon for his alleged involvement in the bombing of two mosques in Tripoli, Mamlouk is said to be hiding in a five-star Beirut hotel. Meanwhile, Assad himself has reportedly fled to Russia, where he has been granted political asylum by President Vladimir Putin. The Lebanese report delves into the shadowy logistics of this escape. Assad’s associates, including intelligence operatives and businessmen, began their exodus just days before Damascus fell to rebel forces. The operation, meticulously coordinated by Hezbollah and a senior Lebanese border official linked to Mamlouk, involved crossing the Syrian-Lebanese border through both legal and illicit routes. To avoid detection, Hezbollah operatives swapped Syrian license plates for Lebanese ones. Notable among those who fled are Assad’s cousins, Mamlouk’s mother (who is married to Assad’s uncle), and Khaled Qaddour, a businessman with close ties to Assad’s brother, Maher. These individuals reportedly paid hefty bribes—amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars—to Lebanese security officials to secure their passage. Now, they remain under heavy Hezbollah protection in Beirut, with Lebanese security forces patrolling the perimeters of their hideouts. While Assad’s inner circle retreats to Beirut, the dictator himself appears to have found sanctuary in Moscow. Russian officials confirmed his arrival in the capital along with his wife Asma and their three children—Hafez (24), Zein (22), and Karim (21). Yet, the Kremlin remains tight-lipped about his exact location. When asked about Assad’s presence in Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tersely replied, 'I have nothing to say on the matter,' adding that no meeting between Putin and Assad has been scheduled.

Reports suggest that Assad and his wife possess a vast fortune, estimated at $2 billion, spread across offshore accounts, shell companies, tax havens, and global real estate ventures. This financial cushion likely ensures the family’s continued access to substantial funds, even as their political fortunes have clearly been decimated. As Assad’s regime crumbled in the face of rebel forces, the fallout from this exodus underscores the intricate interplay of geopolitics in the region. While Beirut shelters key regime figures, Moscow offers Assad an escape route—a stark reminder of the shifting allegiances and power dynamics in the Syrian conflict. For now, the world watches as the Assad regime’s remnants scatter, leaving behind a legacy of destruction and uncertainty. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rydb1drejx	2024-12-09T22:21:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/08/SygM8gXJyg/SygM8gXJyg_186_407_2319_1306_0_small.jpg
Switzerland suspends Syria asylum proceedings after Assad's fall	The Swiss government said it was suspending asylum procedures for Syrians until it can better assess the situation in the Middle Eastern country following the capture of Damascus by rebels and Syrian President Bashar Assad's flight to Russia. The state secretariat for migration said on Monday evening it was currently unable to conduct a thorough check on whether grounds for asylum exist for Syrians or whether carrying out a deportation order for them would be reasonable.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h174dwhvyx	2024-12-09T22:06:18-08:00

From hate to dialogue: Afghan, Pakistani Diaspora leaders discove...	Nearly a dozen leaders from the South Asian diaspora met with Israeli counterparts as part of a person-to-person peacebuilding effort Growing up in Afghanistan, Ehsanullah Amiri was taught to hate Israel. 'I heard a lot of bad things about Israel, a lot of politically motivated propaganda by clerics, tribal leaders,' Amiri, a journalist who moved to Canada three years ago to escape the Taliban, said. Since his childhood, much has changed for Amiri. Following the October 7 massacre, Amiri wrote many articles in Canada's National Post defending Israel’s right to protect itself. Those articles earned him a wave of hate mail and harsh responses — from his own community as well as Islamists in Canada. Amiri’s experience with Islamic extremists piqued his interest in understanding the October 7 attack and Israel’s fight against terrorism. As a member of Afghanistan’s Hazara minority, he hoped to learn from Israelis how to stand firm against terror groups. So when a friend told Amiri about Sharaka, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting peace between Israel and the Arab world, he was curious, and he agreed to join a delegation visiting Israel for a week. 'I wanted to get to know Israel, the Jewish people, the nation and build bridges,' Amiri said. 'We have a lot of wars in the region and in the world. Why not make peace?' Sharaka’s mission to Israel this month brought nearly a dozen South Asian leaders together with their Israeli counterparts. The mission was designed to help participants collaborate on projects to influence communities in Israel, America, Pakistan and beyond. The delegation visited several sites in Jerusalem’s Old City, received a briefing at the Knesset, toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, visited southern Israel, and met with October 7 survivors, among other stops. Dan Feferman, executive director of Sharaka, said that citizens of countries critical of Israel are increasingly interested in seeing another side of the story. 'Sharaka’s ongoing work in bringing impactful delegations from the Abraham Accords countries and beyond shows the appetite for such bridge-building programs in the region,' he said. Noam Meirov, Sharaka’s managing director, said that the Islamic diaspora is 'very influential' in shaping events in the Middle East and in Western countries that Muslims have relocated to. He described two camps of Muslims in the U.S.: one representing a radical stream of Islam and another supporting a more moderate form of the religion. The moderate camp believes in peace with Israel, even if it is sometimes critical of the Jewish state, Meirov said. He said that Sharaka’s focus is on empowering moderate Muslims and providing them with accurate information about Israel and tools to stand up for Israel. 'We saw that through engaging people to people, creating programs, studying about the Holocaust, [and] studying about radicalism in Israel [and] in the Arab countries, we found mutual allies in more countries,' Meirov said. He said that Sharaka has succeeded in shifting the narrative from a struggle between Jews and Arabs to a struggle between moderates and extremists. Mubashir Ali Zaidi was another participant in the mission. A Pakistani journalist and writer now living in the UץSץ, he grew up amid anti-Israel sentiment much as Amiri did. 'They teach us that [Jews] are our enemy and Jews are not good people,' he said. 'You are taught that you can travel anywhere in the world except to Israel.' Upon moving to the United States, Zaidi befriended members of the American Jewish community and quickly realized his perceptions were wrong. After October 7, Zaidi wrote that Israel should wipe out Hamas once and for all 'because otherwise there will be no peace.' That stance drew backlash from religious leaders in Pakistan who attacked him on social media. 'I thought I should go and find out the other side of [the] story, see what Israelis think,' Zaidi explained. He assumed he would have to wait until he obtained an American passport, but Sharaka was able to arrange entry using his Pakistani documents. Zaidi described himself as neither pro-Israel nor pro-Palestinian. With more than 100,000 followers on Facebook and more than 15,000 YouTube subscribers, he said his goal was to understand the complete picture in order to share with his audience. 'I cannot convert people. I cannot convince more people, but I can tell them a story, and maybe 5 out of 100 people will think, okay, so we should study more, we should learn more about Israel, and maybe we were wrong,' he said. Hina Akhtar also took part in the Sharaka trip. In Pakistan, Akhtar was a teacher, and since moving to Israel, she has worked in health care, serving patients from diverse backgrounds. She said her goal was to foster awareness and empathy about Israel and Jewish history. 'My dad was a progressive Muslim, and he never stopped me from asking questions,' she said. For decades, Akhtar felt uneasy when she thought about the hatred between different sects of Islam. After the October 7 attacks, that same feeling of unease resurfaced. 'If we are all the children of Abraham, why are they hurting each other? What is the reason?' she recalled thinking. She also wondered why Muslims are 'tagged as a violent nation.' She joined the trip to try to find answers to those questions, help other Muslims challenge their misconceptions about Jews, and bear witness to the reality in Israel, she said. 'I always thought there has to be another side of the story which is not being portrayed in the media,' Akhtar said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: While in Israel, Akhtar attended a Shabbat dinner at the house of a Sharaka leader. She described being struck by the parallels between Jewish and Muslim traditions and prayers.

'I am definitely going to take this forward.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bkgodlhvyl	2024-12-09T21:36:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/28/SyOJk3SRR/SyOJk3SRR_0_225_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Israel seizes the opportunity to destroy the last remaining advanced weapons systems on its borders; forces enter nine villages on the Syrian Golan according to reports Explosions were heard early on Tuesday, in the area of Damascus. Overnight the IDF targeted the Defense Research Institute in Aleppo, and the Scientific Research Center on the outskirts of the capital among other sites. Israel has seized the historic opportunity after the fall of the Assad regime, to destroy the last remaining advanced weapons systems on its borders. According to the UK based Observatory for Human Rights, Israel had 'destroyed the most important military sites in Syria' with around 250 air strikes since the fall of president Bashar al-Assad's regime. The strikes targeted airports and warehouses, complete Russian Mig and Sukhoi fighter squadrons, radars, military signal stations, and multiple weapons and ammunition depots. According to estimations the Syrian air force could be destroyed within days and would not fall into the hands of the rebels. Air defenses including surface to air missile systems have also been put out of commission, solidifying Israel's air superiority.

Should Israel take Syrian territory?	Jonathan Schanzer warns of 'dangerous' consequences Israel should be cautious about taking territory in Syria, as it risks embroiling the Jewish state in another war, according to Dr. Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. 'Taking territory could be … dangerous,' he told ILTV News. 'The reason why is that it could be used as a casus belli by the Sunni jihadis to say, look, the Israelis are now occupying territory that should have been Syrian, at least by their calculus, and they may use that as a reason to wage war against Israel.' However, Schanzer noted that if Sunni jihadis are present on the other side of the buffer zone, it makes sense for Israel to deploy forces there and ensure sufficient defenses to prevent any invasion by these groups. Israel has been targeting chemical and advanced weapons facilities in Syria to prevent such weapons from falling into the hands of Sunni jihadis. Schanzer described this approach as entirely logical. 'You have some of those advanced weapon assembly plants that Iran had created inside Syria, IRGC facilities. Some of those have apparently been destroyed as well,' he said. 'We're talking about precision-guided munitions that are apparently being destroyed by the IDF.' When asked whether Israel should celebrate the fall of Syrian President Bashar Al Assad and the prospects of a new regime, Schanzer urged caution. The groups that overthrew Assad are linked to Al Qaeda and backed by Qatar and Turkey, known sponsors of groups like Hamas and ISIS. 'We're not looking at particularly moderate actors here,' Schanzer explained. 'On the one hand, we have the departure of the Assad regime, which has been associated with Iran and its axis, as it's known across the region, and it has been a regime that has helped Hezbollah arm up with Iranian weapons. That's gone. That's a positive. But now what we have in his place is a Sunni jihadi vacuum of sorts.' He emphasized that for now, all the U.S. and Israel can do is signal to the rebels and their backers that 'we’re watching carefully and that there will be repercussions if the jihadis turn their sights on either Israel or the Kurds, two of America's most valuable allies in Syria.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1phoshnye	2024-12-09T19:53:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/r1D00YA4N1x/r1D00YA4N1x_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

‘People are still afraid’: Northern residents hesitate to return ...	ILTV heads North to the abandoned Israeli town of Metula About 10 days after a ceasefire was signed with the terrorist group Hezbollah, ending more than a year of cross-border violence, the people of northern Israel are beginning to return home. For the first time in months, more stores have opened in the local mall near Kiryat Shemona. Traffic on the roads has increased enough to cause slight delays, a small but noticeable sign of life returning to the region. These changes offered a welcome respite on Sunday after months of eerie silence during the conflict. When Hezbollah began firing rockets, the government evacuated more than 60,000 people from their homes along the northern border with Lebanon to minimize civilian casualties. Unlike southern Israel, which was attacked by Hamas on October 7, the north lacked sufficient bomb shelters to protect its residents. Now, 14 months later, the destruction in Israeli towns like Metula is extensive. Damage has been caused by Hezbollah rocket fire, IDF tanks and personnel who used the towns as bases, and by neglect, with homes overrun by rats and mold after more than a year of abandonment. Most residents remain hesitant to return, uncertain whether the 60-day ceasefire agreement will hold. In towns like Metula and Manara, located around six kilometers from the border, the prospect of moving back feels nearly impossible. ILTV visited Metula on Sunday and met 75-year-old resident Arie Almog. Almog and his partner were the only ones who remained in Metula after evacuation orders were issued. He told ILTV that while some neighbors have returned to assess the condition of their homes since the ceasefire, few, if any, have decided to move back full-time. 'People are still afraid from the situation, which is not very clear,' Almog said. 'I think if the government would make it more clear what exactly is going to happen then I think people would commit to come back as soon as possible. As long as people will not feel safe enough, I don’t think they will come back so quickly.' Last week, IDF Northern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Ori Goldin informed regional mayors that they could begin planning the rebuilding of their towns. However, residents have received little to no compensation for their losses, and the government has shown insufficient commitment to investing in the reconstruction of some communities. Still, Almog remains optimistic, saying he believes recovery is possible. 'I think they should take care of themselves as much as they can,' Almog said of his fellow residents. 'I think we will be able to collect outside money to help us recover this village that has been damaged quite a lot – some are really bad, some are not so bad. It can be repaired and rebuilt. It will take a lot of time, and I believe that the government will be able to give whatever possible. Don’t forget, we are at war for a year and two months now.' Over the past year, more than 8,000 rockets, drones, and anti-tank missiles were launched from Lebanon, killing 45 civilians. Another 76 IDF soldiers and reservists lost their lives in cross-border attacks and a ground operation in southern Lebanon that began in late September.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkmd11rse1e	2024-12-09T19:27:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/10/HyvwMSrVyg/HyvwMSrVyg_0_192_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Iranian analyst praises PM for dismantling Tehran’s regional influence, citing IDF strikes on Hamas, Hezbollah and Iranian proxies in Syria and Yemen; he criticizes US Democratic leaders, calling Netanyahu a confident and strategic leader As the Iranian regime grapples with the fallout of the Assad regime's collapse in Syria, an Iranian political analyst has offered a blunt assessment of what many in the Middle East and beyond have observed: the steady dismantling of Iran's so-called 'Axis of Resistance' under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Through calculated and sustained military operations, Netanyahu has directed the IDF to deliver crippling blows to Iran's regional network. These efforts have undermined Hamas in Gaza, inflicted severe damage on Hezbollah—long considered Tehran's most significant regional ally—and targeted Iranian interests in Syria and Yemen, including crushing blows to Iranian-backed Houthi forces.

In the same post, Garshasbi criticized U.S. Democratic administrations, praising Netanyahu for having 'poisoned the den of Uncle Obama and Aunt Kamala’s mafia,' a reference to prominent Democratic leaders.

Israel strikes Syrian air bases, strategic military targets as pr...	Arab media reports that, since Assad's fall, the IDF has been striking Syrian military targets; IDF says it is eliminating military assets such as chemical weapons production facility and air defense systems Israel continues to target Syrian military assets after the fall of the Assad regime throughout Syria, so that they will not pose a threat in the future. Arab media reported widespread attacks in various areas throughout Monday as the second day of attacks. The Saudi Al-Hadath channel reported that the Israeli Air Force has carried out more than 250 strikes in Syria in the past two days - about 100 of them in a few hours on Monday evening. According to Arab reports, Israel's attacks on Monday targeted fighter jet squadrons, airports, air defense batteries, weapons and ammunition depots, scientific research centers, and missile brigades in various provinces in Syria. Two Syrian security sources told Reuters that the IDF had attacked major air force bases across Syria and that infrastructure and dozens of helicopters and planes were destroyed during the attacks. Attacks in Damascus near scientific research center The Assad regime has developed various capabilities over the years with the support of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, with the rebels taking over, everything it had in its possession could fall into their hands and be directed against Israel. The rebel groups are diverse, and therefore chemical weapons, for example, falling into the wrong hands such as unpredictable extremist Sunni Islamic rebels could pose a serious risk. Arab media outlets reported Monday evening that Israel attacked the port in the city of Latakia, on the coast in northwestern Syria. According to the Saudi Al-Arabiya channel, the Syrian Navy ships were attacked. Security sources told the Reuters news agency that the attack was aimed at an air defense facility near the port. The Sabrin channel, affiliated with pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, reported that the port's defense system was destroyed in the attack. In Damascus, explosions reportedly were heard near the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center where, according to reports, Iran had previously operated to produce long-range missiles and where the Assad regime was suspected of producing chemical weapons. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network, the center was destroyed. On Monday, photos of the attacks against the airport in southwest Damascus on Sunday attributed to the IDF were published. Israel has previously attacked senior Iranian-Shiite figures at that location. The Saudi Al-Hadath channel reported that Israel attacked dozens of MiG-29 aircraft belonging to the Syrian army on Sunday night. On Monday evening, another airport in Damascus was reported to have been attacked - Al-Maruhiyat in the Aqraba area. According to Al-Mayadeen's report, Israel destroyed military helicopters and attacked the Damascus countryside. Airstrikes are defense against extreme scenarios On Sunday night, just after midnight, explosions were reported in the 12th Brigade and the 175th Battalion of the Syrian Army, near the city of Izra, after Israel attacked weapons depots. Later, an attack was reported in the Tel Haruf area. Meanwhile, after the IDF captured the Syrian Hermon on Sunday, the Syrian Voice of the Capital channel reported Israeli attacks in the mountainous area where the Syrian army's 4th Division operates, commanded by Assad's brother Maher Assad. The Syria TV channel, which is affiliated with the rebels, reported an attack against the 9th Division of the Syrian army on the 15th Brigade of the Syrian army. In addition, it was reported that military warehouses were attacked in the northern countryside. Israeli officials told the Wall Street Journal on Monday that the purpose of the airstrikes in Syria is to protect Israel's borders and citizens against extreme scenarios. For example, if the new Syrian government becomes hostile to Israel it might attack. Another possible scenario is that Syria would be dragged into a long-term civil war, during which rebel groups could gain access to unconventional weapons left behind by Assad's army. Tehran cuts off weapons and smuggling routes from Syria A day after the fall of the Assad regime, the IDF has identified that Iran is cutting off weapons and smuggling activists from Syria so that they can survive. At the same time, the IDF is attacking and preventing weapon transfers from Syria to Lebanon. The IDF has intensified additional forces with artillery and tanks in the Golan and the buffer zone, as well as in Syrian-controlled points near the border. The Syrian army has abandoned its posts in the Syrian Golan, and the IDF has seized the weapons remaining in them.

Living between worlds: A love story in sign language	Micha Koitni and Lola Adir’s love story defies stereotypes, blending sign language, resilience and advocacy; From Micha’s ultra-Orthodox upbringing to Lola’s journey through grief, their partnership inspires change, challenges stigmas and highlights the power of communication and acceptance Eight years have passed since Micha Koitni and Lola Adir first met at a sign language course held at the Silvia Bumper club, a meeting space for both deaf and hearing individuals. Even now, they speak of that encounter with heartfelt excitement. Born deaf to hearing parents in a Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox family, Micha’s world couldn’t have been more different from Lola’s, who grew up in the settlement of Alfei Menashe. Yet, the connection between their contrasting worlds has been a fascinating journey. 'I was a bit nervous when I arrived at the club,' Micha recalls. 'Suddenly, I saw this beautiful woman with long hair, a tattoo, drinking beer and signing fluently. A friend told me, ‘Go talk to her.’ I approached her, and now we’ve been together for eight years. It’s a great love.' 'We both came into the relationship as adults who knew what we wanted,' says Lola. 'I had just come out of two years where I didn’t want a relationship at all due to a personal crisis, partly following my father’s death. I felt ready for a fresh start.' How did your families react to your relationship? Lola: 'There wasn’t any real opposition, but at first, they asked if it would be hard for me or if I’d need to help him. Over time, they realized he doesn’t need help and that I’m not his caregiver. This is a great love like any other. Once you have a shared language, mutual care and a willingness to make things work, it really doesn’t matter what others say. Some questioned the challenges of such a relationship, but honestly, what relationship doesn’t have challenges and gaps to address?' 'We don’t need to prove our love; we love each other,' Micha adds. After eight years together, isn’t it time to talk about marriage? Lola: 'We’ve never been interested in a wedding ceremony. We’re registered as common-law partners, and that’s as married as it gets for us.' Micha, 43, a social activist and food blogger who creates sign language and subtitled content on social media, and Lola, 37 (whose official name is Ella Yael), produce accessible content and videos together and give a lecture called 'Talking with Hands.' In thh last week, they have shared their life story at a special event as part of the 'Please Touch: Art Beyond Limits' festival, which opens at the 'Please Touch' Center in Jaffa Port. The festival, which celebrates the International Day for Equal Opportunities for People with Disabilities, also featured appearances by notable figures such as Lior Ashkenazi, Dvir Benedek, Anat Atzmon, Daniel Salomon, Haim Be'er, Karni Postel, and Yoav Ginai. Childhood in silence Micha was born in Petah Tikva into a Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox family. His younger sister is also deaf. 'When I was six months old, my parents noticed I didn’t respond when they called me. They took me to Sheba Medical Center for a hearing test and discovered I was deaf,' he recalls. 'They were at a loss. They were told there were several options, including hearing aids and schools where deaf and hearing children study together.' 'I attended mixed kindergartens and schools, with both hearing and deaf students. Often, when the teacher turned to the board and spoke at the same time, I missed what was being said because I couldn’t read her lips. My classmates didn’t help me at all. I’d come home and review the material to catch up on what I’d missed in class.' In eighth grade, Micha moved to a yeshiva. 'We studied Torah from seven in the morning until 11 at night,' he says. 'There were about 500 hearing students, and I was the only deaf one. Since they knew I was deaf, they helped me.' At 27, Micha received a cochlear implant, thanks to his sister, who also had one. 'I was able to recognize sounds, but it didn’t make me hear like a person without hearing loss. Today, I can identify cars on the road, even voices, but fully understanding words is still difficult.' At some point, Micha felt he wasn’t progressing in his yeshiva studies and asked to leave. It took time to convince his parents. 'I started working under two conditions – first, that I’d work in a public job suitable for religious people, and second, that I’d finish work by 5 p.m. and continue studying Torah for two to three hours afterward.' What about matchmaking? 'In the yeshiva, everyone married at a very young age, and I was very jealous. The few matches I went on were complicated, and before every meeting, I was investigated thoroughly. In many cases, the match was rejected even before I met the girl. 'They would say I was an honest man, a good person, God-fearing, but that I had too many shortcomings– my father is Ashkenazi, my mother is Yemenite – in short, a mixed heritage. In the ultra-Orthodox world, Ashkenazis and Sephardic don’t mix in matchmaking. The fact that I’m deaf was also a disadvantage. It was only when I entered the working world that my perspective began to widen.' Were you disappointed? 'I came to terms with reality. All my siblings got married. When my younger brother wanted to get married, he had to ask for my permission because I’m the oldest. I told him, ‘Go ahead, don’t wait for me. Get married.’' 'I discovered life could be bright too' After leaving the yeshiva, Micha started working in a baby products store. 'On the way to work, I’d always sit in the back of the bus, so people wouldn’t notice my implant,' he recalls. 'One day, I noticed a fellow passenger making all sorts of hand movements. I was shocked. It was the first time I saw someone communicating in sign language.' How did you react? 'I approached him and asked, ‘Excuse me, what is this?’ He replied, ‘What, are you kidding me? It’s sign language.’ After he finished his conversation, we started talking openly. He explained what it was and began teaching me basic signs, like ‘good morning,’ ‘good evening,’ and ‘Shabbat Shalom.’' It surprised you that much? 'The religious world is very closed. I thought speech was all there was. I told my parents about it, and they told me not to use my hands to communicate. I asked why, and they replied, ‘What do you prefer – to communicate like a mime or like a normal person?’ ‘Of course like a normal person,’ I answered, and at that moment, I decided not to bring it up with them again.' The following day, Micha once again encountered the deaf man on the bus. This time, he sat next to him, and the man continued teaching him additional signs. 'I asked him where I could meet more deaf people,' Micha recalls. 'He immediately replied, 'Come to Yehud, there's a deaf soccer game there once a week.'' Micha followed his suggestion and arrived at the soccer field in Yehud, only to be taken aback by what awaited him. 'Everyone was speaking in sign language,' he remembers. 'I stared at them in shock, amazed that they understood each other without asking questions.' How did they react to you? 'I was the only religious person there. They looked at me and asked, 'Did you come here by mistake? Did you fall from the moon?'' When Micha returned home, he felt the need to examine himself and understand whether he was taking a risk with his actions. 'On Shabbat, I told my parents I was going to study Torah. I went to the yeshiva, hung up my suit, removed my kippah, and my heart was pounding,' he recounts with excitement, reflecting on the moments when he acted against the principles he had been raised with for 30 years. 'I quickly left the yeshiva, headed toward the intersection, and caught a sherut taxi, line 51, to Tel Aviv. The driver asked me, 'Are you getting in?' I checked to make sure no one familiar was watching me and got in. After all, the Torah says that someone who desecrates Shabbat is to be put to death. And here I was, sitting in a sherut taxi, realizing everything was fine. The doors closed, and I told the driver, 'Please drive, drive,' and he didn’t understand what I wanted from him. 'When we started driving, I felt someone tap me on the shoulder, and I panicked. I imagined my father had caught me red-handed. It turned out that one of the passengers was handing me five shekels to give to the driver,' he shares. 'When I got off the taxi in Tel Aviv, I was in shock. Suddenly, I discovered that life is actually bright and that people walk around the streets without worry. For 30 years, I hadn't felt good about myself. That was the moment I realized I didn’t want to go back.' On his way home, after getting off the return taxi to his city, Micha re-entered the yeshiva, put on his kippah, and donned the suit that had been waiting for him where he had left it. 'When I got home, everyone asked me, 'Why is your face red?'' he recalls. 'I remember panicking and thinking to myself: they'll throw stones at me if I tell the truth. 'I sat outside and read in the sun,' I quietly answered, and my parents responded, 'Good for you, we're proud of you.' I was both lying and had also ridden a taxi on Shabbat – and yet, I was still alive.' When did you tell your parents? 'A few weeks later. I approached them and said, 'If you thought I went out to study Torah, I'm sorry – I went out to hang out with friends. You know, I'm already 30 years old. I have a different life now, one that's different from the past, and I'm enjoying it.'' Lola: 'Among other ultra-Orthodox families, the connection would have been severed in such a case, and Micha expected that to happen with his family as well. But it didn’t.' Breaking stereotypes Lola was introduced to sign language during her military service as an educational soldier. 'In one of the programs where I taught children and teens with cerebral palsy, where some also had speech or hearing impairments, I began gathering information about sign language,' she shares. 'I had a plan that once I finished my service, I would study sign language professionally because the language fascinated me. Ten years later, I fulfilled that plan.' Why only a decade later? 'When I was 25, my father died after a long illness. That was a turning point for me, lasting three years. The decision to take this step was part of my effort to overcome that crisis. At the time, I was mainly working in hotels, with lots of night shifts and minimal interaction with people. When I decided I needed to get back on my feet, I returned to sign language, but this time I studied it seriously.' In their lectures, Lola and Micha aim to challenge common but misguided perceptions about deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals through personal stories and plenty of self-deprecating humor. 'Misunderstandings between deaf and hearing people are often very funny,' she says with a smile. 'One of the issues important to us and many other deaf social activists is erasing the stigma that a deaf person is pitiful and reliant on charity. You could say that deaf people begging for money give a bad name to the entire hard-of-hearing community,' she adds. 'Often, when people hear Micha speak, they think he has a cognitive or intellectual issue. But in the end, it's just his speech that’s different. Of course, beyond that, there are many changes that the state and public institutions still need to implement.' What changes, for example? 'We often encounter situations where service representatives call our home and insist on speaking with Micha to approve certain bureaucratic matters listed in his name. Or, when I speak to representatives from the bank or insurance company, they insist on talking to him as well. Every time, I have to explain again that he can’t talk on the phone and that I can identify myself on his behalf – he can’t. Today, there’s the option of video calls – why not use that technology for identification processes?' Are there enough interpreters in Israel today? 'There are between 200 and 300 interpreters, but more are needed. It’s important to remember that 20–30 years ago, awareness of sign language was very different from what it is today. Back then, doctors recommended teaching children to speak rather than use sign language. Today, some TV programs include interpreters, but unfortunately, not all of them do.' Their work in blogging about cooking and giving lectures fills their lives. 'When I lived with my parents, I didn’t know how to cook. The only two dishes I could make were toast and an omelet,' Micha shares. 'The kitchen was my mom’s special room. When Lola and I moved in together, I decided I wouldn’t order takeout and started cooking.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Lola: 'When we started living together, I didn’t eat meat. I told him, 'If you want to eat meat, you’ll have to cook it yourself.' Since I was diagnosed with cancer, and especially now with my health values being very poor, I have to eat meat. I decided my health is more important than anything else, and dealing with the illness is already overwhelming – so adding a dietitian’s menu on top of it? I preferred to avoid more bureaucracy.' Lola continues, 'Two months ago, I was hospitalized at Ichilov for two and a half weeks. Usually, when a deaf person arrives for treatment or a checkup, an interpreter accompanies them. This time, it was the opposite – I was the patient, Micha was the one accompanying me, and I had to both talk to the doctors and translate what they were saying to Micha.' During this time, new communication challenges emerged between them. 'When I was recovering after surgery, I had oxygen masks on and swollen hands, so I couldn’t sign or spell out words to him,' Lola explains. 'There were moments that later made us laugh – I meant to tell him I was thirsty, and he understood that I was happy. So, I grabbed his hand and started writing on it, and that’s how we communicated.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1f8q6441x	2024-12-09T13:34:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/03/rJWhAI2mJl/rJWhAI2mJl_0_0_1619_1080_0_small.jpg

Assads acclimate to their new luxurious life in Russia	The fugitive Syrian dictator is believed to be in Moscow with his wife and three children, and is said to have more than $2 billion in assets; Meanwhile, Asma Assad battles cancer for the second time A day and a half after the overthrow of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, Russia still refuses to provide information on his whereabouts. However, senior Russian government officials had already told local media that Assad landed in Moscow and had received political asylum with his family from President Vladimir Putin. When Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov was asked when the fugitive dictator arrived in Russia, he replied he had nothing to say on this matter and then said that, for now, no meeting with Assad has been scheduled for Putin. Assuming that the Assads are with Putin, they will now have to build a new life in Russia with a plan to live at the same level of luxury they did in Syria. According to estimates, Bashar Assad is currently in Russia with his wife Asma and their three children, Hafez, 24, Karim, 21, and Zain, 22. The British Daily Mail reported that the State Department estimates that Assad and his wife have a net worth of about $2 billion spread across several bank accounts, shell companies, tax havens and real estate ventures across the globe, so it is likely that they still have access to vast sums of money. In addition, the Daily Mail said that Assad's extended family owns at least 20 apartments in Moscow, worth up to nearly $40 million, adding that Assad's uncle, Mohammed Makhlouf, has purchased 18 luxury apartments in an exclusive complex in the Russian capital in the past decade, where ministers in the Russian government and wealthy Russian businessmen also live. The Assads may live in one of these apartments or in a secure location allocated by Putin. As Syrians took over Assad's palace in Damascus, they got a glimpse of the family's ostentatious lifestyle for the past 24 years during his rule, finding a fleet of luxury cars. Videos from the palace showed Syrian civilians and rebels wreaking havoc, looting, and setting parts of it on fire. During the past decade, reports have already sparked worldwide anger that Asma Assad, while her husband is slaughtering his own people, continues to spend a fortune on luxury goods such as handbags and clothes. The Assad family has long been familiar with Moscow, even if they have not lived there. The deposed president has visited multiple times to meet with Putin and other Russian officials. Hafez, Assad's eldest son, studied there at university and even wrote his thesis in Russian, and just last year Asma came there to attend his graduation ceremony. On the other hand, the move to Russia comes at a difficult time for the family, not only because of the humiliating escape from Syria. In May, Asma announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer again, this time leukemia, and that she would be required to quarantine and would be absent from events and activities. Her announcement came almost five years after she announced that she had recovered from breast cancer, which the Arab world followed closely. Some are now wondering what will happen to her treatments in Russia. Meanwhile, in Damascus, the feeling of euphoria following the overthrow of the regime continues despite the enormous challenges that await Syria in the near future and the fear of an all-out war between the rebel organizations that carried out the military coup. Syrian residents gathered in Umayyad Square, raised the Free Syria flag, and hugged each other. Drivers passing by the square honked their horns in celebration, and rebels deployed nearby fired shots in celebration. 'It’s indescribable, we never thought this nightmare would end, we were reborn,' said Reem Ramadan, a finance ministry employee who came to celebrate in the square. 'For 55 years we were afraid to speak, even at home, we used to say that the walls have ears. Now we feel like we’re living in a dream.' Life in Damascus has yet to return to normal. There was little traffic in several neighborhoods of the capital today, and many vendors refused to open their shops. Public institutions and schools also remained closed, and rebel forces deployed near the central bank. 'Thank God, we were liberated,' said 61-year-old Amr al-Dabbas, who arrived in Umayyad Square. 'Now we are waiting for things to slowly improve.' Still, no one knows who will rule Syria and what kind of regime they will lead. The force that appears to be the strongest at the moment is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist organization formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate of al-Qaida in Syria. It has led the rebels on a campaign of conquests and victories over the past two weeks that has led to the fall of the regime, and its leader Abu Muhammad al-Julani entered Damascus on Sunday as a victor. Over the past week, al-Julani has made an effort to put on a moderate mask, but the West still views him with suspicion and wants to make sure that he does not seize the opportunity to establish an extremist Islamist regime in Syria. On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden said that although al-Julani's people are currently saying 'the right things,' they will be judged by their actions, not their statements. On Monday, Germany joined this statement, warning against excessive optimism. The German spokesman emphasized that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham will have to be supervised although having made efforts to distance itself from its jihadist origins and to establish civilian structures. In the meantime, Syrians continue to search for their loved ones in Saydnaya prison north of Damascus in secret cells where people are still supposedly being kept. On Sunday, Assad's opponents were seen trying to break down walls and doors, and on Monday they were joined by the White Helmets aid organization, including experts and sniffer dogs. In a post on X, the White Helmets announced that it would give a $3,000 reward to anyone who provides information that will directly lead to the discovery of hidden cells in the prison. The organization promised anonymity for former prison personnel and security forces if they provide it with the necessary information. The White Helmets asked prisoners' families searching for their loved ones not to dig through the prisons themselves, as this could damage the physical evidence needed to bring the fallen regime's criminals to justice. The Saydnaya prison, located about 30 kilometers north of Damascus, is considered by many to be one of the main symbols of the Assad regime's oppression. This prison, which opponents of the regime have described as a 'human slaughterhouse,' has been used to house thousands of regime opponents since 2011, including armed members of the rebel organizations, non-violent protest activists and military personnel suspected of opposing Assad.

Qatar opens contacts with Syrian rebel group HTS, source says	Qatari diplomats spoke with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) on Monday, an official briefed on the developments told Reuters, as regional states race to open contact with Syria's leading rebel faction after its rapid offensive toppled Bashar al-Assad. Qatar plans to speak with HTS leader Mohamed Al-Bashir on Tuesday, the day after he was appointed to lead Syria's transitional administration, the official said. Governments across the region are scrambling to forge new links with HTS and other rebel groups involved in the offensive that seized control of much of Syria in the Middle East's biggest upheaval in generations. Assad fled to Russia, after 13 years of civil war and more than 50 years of his family's rule. Qatar's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters requests for comment about the contacts with HTS, a group formerly allied with Al Qaida and which is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., European Union, Turkey and the U.N. Assad's main regional ally Iran also opened a direct line of communication with rebels in Syria's new leadership, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, citing the need to 'prevent a hostile trajectory' between the countries. It was not clear if Iran's contacts were with HTS or another Syrian rebel faction.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hygalanvyg	2024-12-09T11:20:38-08:00

Europe scrambles to freeze Syrian asylum applications following A...	As Assad regime collapses, European nations move to freeze Syrian asylum applications amid uncertainty; Refugees rejoice at the prospect of returning, while far-right movements seize the moment to demand stricter immigration policies and reassessments of residency permits Millions of Syrians were displaced during the civil war that erupted in 2011. Now, following the resounding defeat of Bashar al-Assad and the collapse of his regime, countries that took in Syrian refugees are questioning how many will voluntarily return home and whether it is still justified to approve asylum requests for those whose cases remain unresolved. Several European countries announced on Monday evening that they are halting the processing of asylum applications for Syrians within their borders, awaiting greater clarity on Syria's situation under rebel control. In 2015, during Europe’s migration crisis, over one million Syrians arrived on the continent. Most sought refuge in Germany, where nearly one million Syrians still reside almost a decade later. In light of recent developments in Syria and the end of the war, Germany announced that its Federal Office for Migration and Refugees is suspending the review of asylum applications until further notice. According to the German news agency DPA, this decision will affect approximately 47,000 pending asylum requests from Syrians. 'I want to return to my country and help rebuild it' German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the review of asylum requests from Syrians currently residing in Germany will depend on developments in Syria. 'At this stage, it is impossible to determine a concrete possibility for returning to the country. In such a volatile situation, it would be unprofessional to speculate,' she said. 'The fall of Assad’s brutal dictatorship is a great relief for many who endured torture, murde and terror,' Faeser added. 'For many refugees who found safety in Germany, there is finally hope to return to their homeland and rebuild their country.' Thousands of Syrians celebrated Assad’s fall in Berlin on Sunday. 'Like many Syrians, I want to return to my country and help rebuild it,' said Bassam, a social worker who arrived in Germany in early 2016. Sabrine, a 36-year-old architect, shared her intention to assist her homeland from Germany: 'What Syria needs most is money and expertise. We can gather all of that from here for now.' The migration crisis has deeply divided European Union member states in recent years and fueled the rise of far-right movements across the continent. In Germany, for instance, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has gained significant popularity with its anti-immigration stance and criticism of government policies. Now, following the end of Syria’s war, the party has warned of another wave of Syrian refugees attempting to enter Germany. 'The borders are closed; we are not prepared to accept more,' party leader Alice Weidel declared. Many Syrians who reached Europe also settled in neighboring Austria, where close to 100,000 Syrians currently live. Like Germany, Austria’s government announced it is freezing the processing of Syrian asylum requests. Since the start of the year, 12,871 asylum applications have been submitted. Austria’s Interior Ministry stated that Chancellor Karl Nehammer instructed Interior Minister Gerhard Karner to suspend asylum processing and review all previously approved applications. According to the chancellor, Syria’s security situation must be evaluated to determine whether deportations are feasible. Karner added that he has directed officials 'to prepare a plan for organized returns and deportations to Syria.' Sweden joins the freeze, as far-right calls for a review of residency permits After Germany, Sweden has accepted the second-largest number of Syrian refugees in Europe. In 2015 alone, more than 50,000 Syrian asylum seekers arrived, and today nearly 200,000 Syrians live in the country. By evening, Swedish authorities announced they would suspend the review of asylum applications and deportations to Syria. 'Given the current situation, it is difficult to assess the grounds for protection at this time,' said Carl Bexelius of the Swedish Migration Agency. In recent years, Sweden has tightened its immigration policies. The far-right Sweden Democrats party called today for a reassessment of residency permits granted to Syrian refugees in recent years. In Stockholm, as in other European cities, Syrian refugees gathered on Sunday to celebrate the end of Assad’s rule. 'Destructive Islamist forces are behind the regime change in Syria,' claimed party leader Jimmie Åkesson. 'I see groups here in Sweden celebrating these developments. They should see this as an opportunity to return home. New circumstances require new evaluations. That’s why it’s important to reassess the residency permits of those who left Syria for Sweden.' Denmark, the UK, and Greece pause applications; France to decide soon A senior Greek government official told Reuters today that the country will stop processing asylum applications for approximately 9,000 Syrians. Bloomberg reported this evening that the UK (no longer an EU member) has joined the list of European nations halting decisions on Syrian asylum requests. Denmark and Norway have also decided to freeze the processing of Syrian asylum applications. Denmark’s refugee agency explained that the decision was made 'due to the uncertainty in Syria following Assad’s regime collapse.' Currently, the agency is handling 69 applications. In the summer of 2020, Denmark became the first EU country to reassess residency permits for Syrian refugees, stating the situation in Syria had changed and no longer justified granting or extending residency permits. However, Denmark has yet to execute any deportations. Norway’s announcement emphasized that the situation in Syria remains 'unclear and unresolved.' Since the start of the year, 1,933 Syrians have applied for asylum in Norway. In France, the government announced this evening that it also plans to suspend the processing of asylum requests soon. The French Interior Ministry said a decision on the matter would be made within hours. At Turkey’s border: 'Everyone will return, no one will stay' Turkey has hosted the largest number of Syrian refugees worldwide, with over three million Syrians currently residing in the country. In Istanbul and other cities, the Syrian community celebrated Assad’s downfall, with the opposition flag raised at the Syrian Consulate building in Istanbul on Sunday. Hosting such a large refugee population has strained Turkey in recent years, creating economic challenges and sparking tensions between Ankara and the European Union. Now, Turkey hopes most Syrians will voluntarily return home without government intervention. 'We will continue our efforts to ensure Syrians return to their homeland safely and willingly,' said Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Hundreds of Syrian refugees gathered today at two border crossings in southern Turkey, awaiting the moment they could cross back into Syria. 'Assad shot at us, murdered us. Now I’m going back to Syria,' said Mohammad, 28, who fled Damascus in 2016 and has been living in Istanbul ever since. 'Thank God, the war is over.'

Zakaria, 31, who arrived in Turkey in 2019, is also waiting at the border with his wife and two children to return to Aleppo. He hopes to rebuild his home, destroyed during the war. 'We came here because of the war. Now it’s over, and we’re going back.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkeytsnvkl	2024-12-09T11:10:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/rJeSx0KNNJl/rJeSx0KNNJl_458_190_2345_1321_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu: 'The absolute victory they mocked is at hand'	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convenes a press conference for the first time in 99 days and declares 'The Golan will forever be an inseparable part of Israel'; He also claims that 'collapse of the Syrian regime is direct result of severe blows we have inflicted on Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a press conference in Jerusalem on Monday evening on the eve of his trial that begins on Tuesday. This is the first press conference Netanyahu has held since September, and he has not answered questions for 99 days. The press conference came about 24 hours after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria, after which the IDF captured the Syrian Mount Hermon. 'Yesterday something happened, literally. The Assad regime in Syria, a central link in Iran's axis of evil, collapsed. Iran invested billions in Syria. It was a cruel tyrannical regime that trampled on its citizens and massacred them,' Netanyahu said at the beginning of his remarks. He thanked U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights in 2019, and emphasized: 'The Golan will forever be an inseparable part of Israel.' According to him, 'the collapse of the Syrian regime is a direct result of the severe blows we have inflicted on Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.' Netanyahu said that the assassinated Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was 'the axis of the axis,' noting that he 'not only focused the fire against him, he was the axis linking Hezbollah, Syria and Iran. His elimination was a turning point in the collapse of the Iranian axis.' The prime minister said that after the collapse of the Assad regime 'we want to see a different Syria. We proved this at the beginning of the civil war when we built a field hospital, which treated thousands of wounded Syrians.' Netanyahu met with reporters amid reports of progress in negotiations for a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. According to a report Monday in the Hamas-affiliated Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, the parties have begun to detail the implementation of the hostage and prisoner exchange agreement. 'The parties are serious about reaching an agreement,' a source described as 'reliable' told the Qatari newspaper. The prime minister visited near the Syrian border on Sunday and referred to the fall of Assad: 'This is a historic day in the history of the Middle East. The Assad regime is a central link in Iran's axis of evil. This regime has fallen. This is a direct result of the blows we inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah, the main supporters of the Assad regime. This has created a chain reaction throughout the Middle East of all those who want to be free from this oppressive and tyrannical regime.' He said, 'This of course creates new, very important opportunities for the State of Israel. But not without risks. We are working first and foremost to protect our border. This area was defined for nearly 50 years as a buffer zone that was agreed upon in 1974, the Separation of Forces Agreement. This agreement collapsed, and the Syrian soldiers abandoned their positions.'

U.S. hostage affairs envoy Roger Carstens is in Beirut as part of 'intensive efforts' by the U.S. government to find American journalist Austin Tice and return him from more than a decade in captivity in Syria, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Monday. Tice, a former U.S. Marine and a freelance journalist, was 31 when he was abducted in August 2012 while reporting in Damascus on the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who was ousted by Syrian rebels who seized the capital Damascus on Sunday. Syria had denied he was being held.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1xnip44kx	2024-12-09T10:34:30-08:00

Israel cautiously optimistic for hostage deal within 'a week or t...	Talks on a potential hostage deal – ramped up by Qatar, Egypt and Turkey – are intensifying, with Hamas reportedly agreeing to phased cease-fire terms; Israel remains cautious, demanding hostages' return before halting military operations A senior Israeli official suggested on Monday evening, during a conversation with Ynet, that conditions are aligning for a potential Hamas hostage deal within 'a week or two.' While the Prime Minister's Office sought to temper expectations earlier in the day, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar struck a more hopeful tone, stating: 'We’re not there yet, but I hope we’ll get there.' Parallel reports from sources close to a senior Hamas official indicated significant strides in negotiations. They believe Hamas has tentatively agreed to a phased cessation of hostilities, with a proposed deal unfolding in three stages. This framework includes a gradual Israeli withdrawal, with Israeli forces expected to pull back from Rafah and urban centers between the sixth and eighth weeks of a cease-fire. Following this, talks for a permanent truce and the release of Israeli hostages would commence. Hamas has reportedly provided Egypt with a list of Israeli hostages confirmed to be alive and is awaiting Israeli approval of its demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile detainees. These developments come as Jake Sullivan, the outgoing U.S. national security adviser, is set to arrive in Israel on Thursday. As first reported by Ynet, Sullivan will engage with Israeli officials on a range of pressing issues, including the cease-fire in Lebanon, escalating tensions in Syria, and the ongoing hostage negotiations in Gaza. Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, addressing foreign journalists in Jerusalem, underscored Israel’s position: 'The hostages must return before Israel agrees to end the fighting. There will be no ceasefire in Gaza without a deal.' While acknowledging indirect negotiations are underway, Sa’ar cautioned against premature conclusions. 'I don’t want to say things that will harm the negotiations, but indirect negotiations are taking place. We can be more optimistic than before, but we’re not there yet. I hope we’ll get there. We are serious in our desire to reach a hostage deal, which will be tied to a cease-fire in Gaza. There will be no cease-fire in Gaza without a hostage deal. We are working to achieve this, and I hope we succeed,' he said. Meanwhile, Palestinian factions holding Israeli hostages in Gaza have reportedly been instructed by Hamas to prepare detailed files on their captives. According to Saudi channel Al-Sharq, Hamas has directed Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front, and the Popular Resistance Committees to compile information on the hostages under their control. A Hamas source told Al-Sharq that without an Israeli withdrawal and freedom of movement between northern and southern Gaza, reaching all groups holding hostages would be challenging. The source emphasized that a serious deal, free from ongoing bombings and military operations, is the only viable path to resolving the hostage crisis. Additionally, Hamas’ military wing and other factions require sufficient time, without drones overhead, to verify the status of living hostages and locate the remains of deceased captives. A senior Hamas official revealed that Egypt, Qatar and Turkey have intensified their mediation efforts, with indirect negotiations expected to begin within days. However, Israeli officials have downplayed these reports, and the Hostage Directorate in the Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement to families of the hostages: 'In recent hours, various reports have been published in the Arab media about negotiations for the return of the hostages. These reports, which are also being circulated in Israel, are not accurate.' Last week, a senior Egyptian official outlined a proposal to Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth that includes a gradual cessation of fighting in Gaza, coupled with an Israeli withdrawal from the Rafah crossing. This would coincide with a temporary cease-fire lasting approximately 60 days. The official described this period as a 'test phase' for both sides, noting that if the plan holds, it could signify 'the end of the conflict between the sides.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Under this proposal, about a week after the cease-fire begins, the process of returning Israeli hostages still alive would start. Simultaneously, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails, based on terms agreed upon by both parties. During the 60-day cease-fire, Israel would maintain a military presence in Gaza. The plan also addresses Hamas’ demand for the return of Palestinian refugees to northern Gaza. Regarding the Rafah Crossing, the proposal suggests transferring its management and oversight to the Palestinian Authority. In previous discussions, Israel floated the idea of retaining some level of surveillance through cameras at the crossing. Additionally, the Egyptian official mentioned the establishment of a joint management committee comprising representatives from the West Bank and Gaza, including 10 to 15 independent Palestinian technocrats. This committee would operate under the supervision of American representatives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjmufcv4jl	2024-12-09T09:47:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/07/ryATF11Wk1x/ryATF11Wk1x_99_128_2708_1525_0_small.jpg

UN refugee chief urges patience as Syrian refugees weigh options	The U.N. refugee chief on Monday called for patience as millions of Syrian refugees displaced by the 13-year civil war weigh a possible return to the country after the toppling of autocratic president Bashar al-Assad. 'There is a remarkable opportunity for Syria to move toward peace and for its people to begin returning home,' said United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi in a statement sent to journalists. 'But with the situation still uncertain, millions of refugees are carefully assessing how safe it is to do so. Some are eager, while others are hesitant.' He called for 'patience and vigilance' as refugees weigh their options.

US journalist Austin Tice still alive in Syria, in dire need of f...	Tice has been held hostage in Syria since 2012; Efforts are underway to ensure the safety and rescue of detained journalists, including Tice, following the fall of the Assad regime Exclusive information obtained by The Media Line confirms that U.S. journalist Austin Tice, who was abducted in Syria in 2012, and several other detained journalists are alive, but in urgent need of food and water. Tice, a former U.S. Marine Corps officer, and the other journalists are being hidden in a secure location by a member of the ousted Syrian regime who is attempting to ensure their safe escape from the country. Efforts to ensure the safety of the detained journalists are ongoing. A source in Damascus told The Media Line that Tice and the others have been without food or water since the regime fell. Deliveries are impossible as the person protecting them is in a separate location, and any movement risks compromising their safety. Tice vanished on August 12, 2012, while reporting on clashes near Damascus during Syria’s civil war. A month later, a video surfaced showing him blindfolded and in the custody of unidentified armed men. No group has ever claimed responsibility for his abduction. The Assad regime repeatedly denied knowledge of his whereabouts, though U.S. officials maintained that he was likely being held by the Syrian government or its allies. Born in Texas in 1981, Tice graduated from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service in 2002 and completed two years at Georgetown’s Law Center before traveling to Syria as a freelance journalist. A former Marine Corps infantry officer, he served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan before pursuing his passion for reporting. Tice’s journalism, which included battlefield dispatches from inside Syria, was published by The Washington Post, McClatchy, Al Jazeera English, and Agence France-Presse, among others. His reporting was among the contributions cited when McClatchy received the George Polk Award for war reporting in Syria. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In the years following his disappearance, Tice’s parents have worked tirelessly to raise awareness about his case. Advocacy efforts include the #FreeAustinTice campaign launched by Reporters Without Borders and a $1 million reward offered by the FBI for information leading to his location. U.S. President Joe Biden has repeatedly affirmed the U.S. government’s commitment to securing Tice’s release, stating with certainty in 2024 that Tice was being held by the Syrian government. On the day of the Assad regime’s fall, President Biden said: 'We think we can get him back,' offering renewed hope for Tice’s return. As Syria faces an uncertain future, the safe rescue of detained journalists, including Tice, remains a priority for those negotiating with remnants of the ousted regime.

3 IDF soldiers killed in anti-tank attack in Jabaliya	The soldiers from the Givati Brigade were killed as they boarded an armored truck; 12 soldiers were injured in the same incident with 3 in serious condition Three soldiers from the Givati Brigade were killed Monday in Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip, after an anti-tank missile was fired at them while they were preparing to board an armored truck, the IDF spokesperson announced on Monday evening. Some 12 additional soldiers were injured, three of them seriously, and were evacuated by helicopter to a hospital. The soldiers were from the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade. They are: Staff Sergeant Ido Zano, 20, from Yehud-Monosson, a combat medic; Staff Sergeant Barak Daniel Halpern, 19, from Kiryat Ono, a squad commander; and Sergeant Omri Cohen, 19, from Ashdod. Details of the initial investigation into the incident will be provided after they are passed on to the bereaved families. Sergeant Omri Cohen's funeral will take place at 9:30 p.m. on Monday night in Ashdod. The Amit Ashdod Yeshiva, where he studied, said after his death: 'We are saddened and mourn the fall of the yeshiva graduate in defense of the people and the country, on the Gaza border. Omri, an outstanding student in his studies, had a heart of gold who was loved by his friends and teachers and wanted to serve the country and contribute to it as much as he could.' The head of the yeshiva, Rabbi Shalom Malul, said that Omri was one of its special graduates. 'A boy who loved life and therefore sought to protect it,' he said. 'The loss is difficult and the grief is heartbreaking. Many of our graduates serve on the front lines and we pray every day for them and for all IDF fighters and soldiers. Omri was a beloved and talented student with high abilities who achieved excellent achievements. His educators and teachers, together with the entire yeshiva, share in the terrible grief of the parents and family members.' Rabbi Guy Bitan, Omri's 12th grade teacher, eulogized him: 'We lost a young man full of joy for life, energetic, sharp and brilliant, a true friend and much loved by all. A leader. He loved this country and our state so much and dreamed of continuing his contribution in the army in meaningful service. Our hearts are with his dear family and all who loved him.' Earlier, an IDF spokesman named four reservists of the 226th Brigade's 9263rd Battalion killed during operational activity in southern Lebanon. They were named as Maj. (res.) Evgeny Zinershain, 43, from Zichron Yaakov, a company commander; Capt. (res.) Sagi Ya’akov Rubinshtein, 31, from Lavie, a platoon commander; Master Sgt. (res.) Binyamin Destaw Negose, 28, from Beit Shemesh; and Sgt. 1st Class (res.) Erez Ben Efraim, 25, from Ramat Gan. These are the first casualties to fall in battle in Lebanon since the ceasefire with Hezbollah came into effect. The collapse occurred Sunday afternoon during a clearance operation near the village of Labbouneh. The 226th Brigade’s engineering team was working to expose underground compounds suspected of housing weapons. During the operation, a large explosion caused the collapse of a bunker, burying the soldiers under the rubble. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Home Front Command teams worked for hours to recover the soldiers’ bodies. No other injuries were reported. The IDF is investigating whether the explosion was caused by a pre-existing explosive device or accidentally triggered by IDF forces. Officials are probing the possibility that the detonation was unintentional and linked to equipment used by Israeli troops.' Since the outbreak of the war on October 7 last year, 816 people have been killed, 384 of whom have been killed since the start of the ground maneuvers in the Gaza Strip about three weeks later. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvwrjveyl	2024-12-09T08:22:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/HJFBEqVEJx/HJFBEqVEJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
These are the 4 IDF heroes killed in a building collapse in Leban...	Binyamin is the 17th casualty from Beit Shemesh, Evgeny was about to be discharged, Erez's co-workers mourn his loss and Sagi was the embodiment of a patriotic Zionist; The 4 soldiers who fell on Sunday in Lebanon leave a void Major (Res.) Evgeny Zinershain, 43, from Zichron Ya'akov, who was killed on Sunday in a building collapse in southern Lebanon, was a devoted father of three. His widow, Alexandra, tearfully shared: 'It’s incomprehensible. We had an amazing bond; he cared so much for me and the kids – they were truly his entire world. I’m an optical and physics engineer, and Evgeny was a computer science engineer. A friend introduced us during our studies at the Technion, and we built an incredible home together.' 'Evgeny knew it was necessary to go to war; this was his third round,' she added. 'He went up with his battalion on October 7, then stayed in the reserves until February. After that, there was a second round, from summer to spring, and then the third round starting at Sukkot, which was supposed to end at the end of this month. He didn’t share much and didn’t want to tell us how dangerous it was. I always worried about him because, after all, this is Lebanon, and the war hasn’t truly ended.' Alexandra said that 'I loved his smile so much; that’s how I fell in love with him. He was always proud of our family, deeply involved, and a truly brilliant person. He always said we must give everything for the country, leading from the front alongside the soldiers and commanders. He emphasized that this is our duty so that our children would also continue to serve meaningfully for the country he loved so much. It was important to him to keep contributing, performing significant and positive reserve duty. We were all so proud of him.' Alex Hassis, Zinershain’s cousin, shared their last exchange. 'Yesterday morning, around 8:38 a.m., I texted him. He didn’t write much, only asked how the family was doing. Our world has collapsed. At the start of his service, when he enlisted, Evgeny wasn’t in the paratroopers. Later, he transferred and also attended the officers’ course. He was very proud of his long military service. He was supposed to be discharged at the end of this month, and now we’ve been struck by a terrible tragedy that no one can comprehend.' Master Sergeant (Res.) Binyamin Destaw Negose, 28, is the 17th casualty from Beit Shemesh since the war's onset. The municipality issued a statement of condolence: 'The Beit Shemesh municipality mourns the loss of this dear family member and accompanies and embraces them during such difficult moments. Municipal teams will provide the family with all necessary support.' Beit Shemesh Mayor Shmuel Greenberg came to comfort the family. 'The tears have not yet dried from the loss of Staff Sergeant Zamir Burk, and this morning we woke to another loss – Master Sergeant Binyamin Destaw Negose. The heart aches, and words fail to express the magnitude of this loss. We will remember his bravery in protecting the people of Israel, forever,' the mayor said. His funeral will take place today at 3:00 p.m. at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Sergeant First Class (Res.) Erez Ben Efraim, 25, from Ramat Gan left behind parents and two brothers. Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shama-Hacohen eulogized him: ''I have no more words' is what I told the person who informed me this morning that the city had lost another gem in this war. Sergeant First Class Erez Ben Efraim, our hero, fell in battles in Lebanon. Erez, born and raised in Ramat Gan, graduated from Shimon Ben Zvi High School and worked as a programmer at 'Clal Insurance.' He served as a combat soldier in the paratroopers. Erez was the youngest son of Galit and Yaron, and brother to Ehud and Eyal.' 'Beloved Erez was the most precious thing to his family,' according to the mayor. 'His family described him as a rare child, talented and handsome. It’s hard to put into words the talent, abilities and character Erez possessed. His family added that calling him 'the salt of the earth' doesn’t do him justice. All of Ramat Gan shares in the family’s immense grief, embracing and supporting them during this time.' The 'Clal Insurance' workers’ union issued a statement following the death of Ben Efraim: 'Dear employees, with deep sorrow and heavy hearts, we announce the devastating news of the loss of Erez Ben Efraim, who worked at the company and was a cherished colleague to all of us. Erez fell during an operational mission in southern Lebanon, fulfilling his role in protecting the nation’s security. Our hearts are with his family during these difficult times. We extend our deepest condolences and keep them in our thoughts and prayers.' Asaf Ben Shabbat, a coworker, shared that 'Erez felt like the younger brother or child of everyone in the office. A creative, talented guy with a magnetic personality. Every time you passed by his desk, he’d ask how you were. Always happy to help—creative, funny, and kind. We missed him during his reserve duty and waited for his return. Now, we’ll miss him forever.' Rabbi Nitzan Berger, head of the Yeshivat AMIT Kfar Ganim , eulogized Capt. (res.) Sagi Ya’akov Rubinshtein: 'Teachers and educators who taught Sagi were shocked by the heartbreaking news. Sagi had an enormous heart. Volunteering, helping others, and his care for people were at the center of his life. For years, he volunteered with sick children through 'Simcha LeYeled,' (Joy to a Child) always striving to give, contribute and bring light into the world through good deeds. Our hearts go out to his parents, Yoram and Dalia, and all who loved him. We will remember him and teach his kindness and contributions wherever he went.' Rabbi Yoel Manovich, head of the Golan Yeshiva, remembered his student: 'Sagi – how hard it is to say this – was one of the sweetest and finest fruits of the hesder yeshivas. He deliberated on where to enlist but always said, 'Wherever I’m needed, I’ll go.' He had a mix of toughness and natural humility. He completed a commanders’ course, was offered officer training, but chose to return to participate in the yeshiva’s 'officer Torah learning' program to build himself spiritually before resuming command in the military. He returned to the battalion, served as a commander in the paratroopers, finished as a deputy company commander, and returned to further his Torah studies. Later, he married Tal, and together they built a sweet home filled with values and a sense of mission.' Rabbi Manovich concluded: 'Sagi was a beacon of action and values. At every crossroads, he sought ways to contribute to the people of Israel –not for fame, but out of genuine responsibility. He was as strong as a cedar when heading into battle but as tender as a worm when studying Torah. That’s what made him not only an excellent fighter and commander but a truly exceptional person.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His parents, Dalia and Yoram Rubinshtein, wrote: 'With great sorrow and grief, we announce the death of our son Sagi in battle in southern Lebanon.' Rubinshtein also left behind a twin brother, Roi. Management at Laniado Hospital in Netanya, where Roi works as a nurse, expressed condolences for his profound loss. Zohar Oberman, a friend from Kibbutz Lavi, spoke of Rubinstein: 'Sagi was born in Petah Tikva but moved to Lavi after marrying Tal, a daughter of the kibbutz. A father of three, Sagi worked as a paramedic in Magen David Adom in the Galilee and as an informal education instructor in the kibbutz. Over the past year, he spent more than 200 days in reserve duty on the northern border and in Lebanon. He was a joyful, Zionist, patriotic, and value-driven man who loved the people and the country. He always answered the call, always first to contribute to the community and the nation.' Petah Tikva Mayor Rami Greenberg also mourned Rubinshtein, whose parents live in the Hadar Ganim neighborhood. He said, 'Sagi joins the hundreds of heroes who gave their lives for us, for the security of the State of Israel. We share in the family’s overwhelming grief and will assist them however needed.' Avishai Mizrahi, Rubinstein’s teacher in Petah Tikva, said: 'What a light Sagi Rubinshtein was. A big heart, always ready, always extending a hand, first to help, always dependable, taking full responsibility and leading.' The Lower Galilee Regional Council announced it bows its head over Rubinstein’s death. His friend, Deputy Council Head Dudu Berger, eulogized: 'Sagi, may his memory be blessed, was a quiet, modest, introverted, and humble man. Beloved by all, a man of kindness. Sagi volunteered in Magen David Adom’s emergency medical services in the Lower Galilee, saving many lives within the community and beyond. He always sought ways to help, support, and give to anyone in need.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sjr00mt4e1g	2024-12-09T08:06:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/Bkl04BVVJl/Bkl04BVVJl_0_77_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Former Israeli president claims Queen Elizabeth ‘saw Israelis as ...	Reuven Rivlin exposes frosty ties with late monarch but praises King Charles as 'so friendly' in speech at Technion gala In London Reuven Rivlin revealed the extent of his frosty relationship with Queen Elizabeth II in a speech in London on Sunday night. The former president of Israel said that: 'The relationship between us and Queen Elizabeth was a little bit difficult, because she believed that every one of us was either a terrorist or a son of a terrorist.' He added: 'She refused to accept any Israeli official into (Buckingham) Palace, apart from international occasions.' By comparison, he revealed that King Charles III was always 'so friendly.' Asked to clarify his surprising comments, Rivlin said: 'These are my words, this is what I said.' Israel’s 10th president made the unprecedented remark during a gala dinner commemorating 100 years of the Technion Institute of Technology, held at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London. King Charles twice visited Israel unofficially for the funerals of Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, before undertaking an official visit in 2020. Queen Elizabeth II never visited Israel during her 70-year reign. 'I hope the new U.S. president will herald a new era in the Middle East. We (Israel), alongside the Arabs and Arab nations are not doomed to live together, our destiny is to live to together,' Rivlin told the 300-strong audience. 'They (Arab nations) cannot kick us out as we have nowhere else to go. So let us all get on and live together in peace.' Rivlin offered some advice for the current prime minister, saying that 'Iron Dome is very important but you must have strategy before any tactics. Rivlin was honored at the event as recipient of the 2024 Churchill Award, whose former winners include Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev and King Hussein of Jordan. Israel has received five academic Nobel prizes, four of which are attributed to the Technion. These include the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of ubiquitin mediated protein degradation, as well as the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems. The leading research university has produced countless technological advancements, from harvesting the first embryonic stem cells in the world to inventing drip irrigation systems that have revolutionized agriculture in arid regions worldwide.

'This has not been an easy year for the Technion. We have been severely hit by the war and its aftermath. Many of us have lost family members, with 12 of our family being abducted to Gaza on October 7. Seven are still there,' said Professor Uri Sivan, president of the Technion. 'We are therefore proud to mark 100 years but are not celebrating.'

U.S. officials are communicating with people in Syria to seek information about Austin Tice, an American journalist captured there more than 12 years ago, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday. 'This is a top priority for us - to find Austin Tice, to locate the prison where he may be held, get him out, get him home safely to his family,' Sullivan said on ABC's 'Good Morning America.' 'We are talking through the Turks and others to people on the ground in Syria to say, 'Help us with this. Help us get Austin Tice home.'' Tice, a former U.S. Marine and a freelance journalist, was 31 when he was abducted in August 2012 while reporting in Damascus on the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who was ousted by Syrian rebels who seized the capital Damascus on Sunday. Syria had denied he was being held. President Joe Biden said on Sunday the U.S. government believes Tice is alive. Tice's parents said on Monday they were watching families reunited in Syria and know that will be possible for them as well. 'Austin Tice is alive, in Syria, and it's time for him to come home. We are eagerly anticipating seeing Austin walk free and we are asking anyone who can do so to please assist Austin so he can safely return home to our family,' Marc and Debra Tice said in a statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s10wxcee1e	2024-12-09T06:44:24-08:00

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to step up the country's engagement in the Middle East to support long-term stability, the government said on Monday. 'The stability of the Middle East is paramount to delivering a foundation of security at home,' the statement cited Starmer as having said during his first visit to the region since taking office in July. 'The Prime Minister said the UK will play a more present and consistent role in the region, and work with partners to increase defence cooperation to strengthen deterrence of threats across land, sea, space, air and cyber.' Starmer also set out an additional 11 million pounds ($14.07 million) of humanitarian aid for Syria, where rebel forces have seized the capital of Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad has fled to Russia.

Following drone strike on central Israel apartment, IDF considers...	A drone from Yemen exploded in a Yavne penthouse, causing heavy damage but no injuries; Residents question how it evaded detection as IDF investigates the failure to intercept and plans better defenses against recurring aerial threats Appearing to come out of nowhere, a drone exploded in a penthouse apartment in the central city of Yavne, adjacent to the Mediterranean shore on Monday. It approached from the sea, crossed over Sderot, and turned northward. Detected near Ashdod, it triggered electronic warfare countermeasures. Detection lasted only minutes before the drone disappeared from tracking systems, rendering interception by a scrambled fighter jet impossible. The IDF is now investigating why the drone did not trigger any warning sirens, examining responses to attacks in Yemen, and exploring ways to bolster defenses against this recurring threat that continues to reach Israel from the east every few days. Initially, the IDF claimed the incident stemmed from a solar water heater explosion. However, reports from residents raised suspicions, pointing to a drone attack. 'Reports were received of a suspicious aerial object falling in Yavne’s vicinity. No siren was activated, and the incident is under investigation,' the IDF spokesperson said in a statement. Later, there was confirmation. 'Following the initial report, a UAV that likely originated in Yemen impacted in the area of Yavne. As of now, no injuries were reported. No sirens were sounded. The incident is under review,' according to the IDF spokesperson's office. Footage captured the dramatic moment when the building was hit, documenting heavy damage to the 16th-floor penthouse balcony. Drone fragments scattered around the building provided further evidence of the incident. Etti Avivi, the penthouse owner, shared her relief that her 14-year-old dog Humi survivedg the crash without injury. 'A drone crashing into my balcony? I have a better chance of winning the lottery,' she quipped. 'I was outside when I heard the crash and boom. I never imagined it was my home. I was worried about Humi, who was alone in the house.' 'I was outside when I heard the crash and loud boom, never imagining it happened at my home,' she also said. Neighbors joked, 'Now Humi will be classified as a victim of hostile actions.' Avivi, a mother of four, including two soldiers currently on active duty, added: 'I’m so relieved Humi was safe. He must have been in the living room. I heard the explosion like everyone else, but only realized it was my home when calls started coming in. We’re lucky no one was hurt.'

Syria, Gaza and Lebanon on the agenda: Biden's senior advisor wil...	National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan set to land in Israel on Thursday, the same day that the political-security cabinet is set to convene; He is scheduled to meet with prime minister and defense minister Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor to outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Thursday. The political-security cabinet is expected to convene on that day. Sullivan, one of the senior advisors in the Biden administration, will discuss with his Israeli colleagues the cease- fire in Lebanon , the dramatic developments in Syria, and also the talks for a hostage deal in the Gaza Strip . As part of his visit, Sullivan will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, and is also expected to discuss various issues with Minister Ron Dermer and National Security Council Chairman Tzachi Hanegbi. Reuters reported earlier Monday that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's designated Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he 'hopes the hostages will be released before the president's inauguration.' Trump has threatened that if Hamas does not release the hostages by his inauguration on January 20, there will be 'all Hell to pay in the Middle East.' Witkoff added that he is 'praying for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.' Suillivan's visit will also deal with developments in Syria. The Israeli Air Force attacked dozens of targets across the country overnight in numerous waves of attacks, targeting various weapons depots, so that they would not pose a threat to Israel in the future. A day after the fall of the Assad regime, the IDF recognizes that Iran is cutting off weapons and smuggling operatives out of Syria, so that they can survive. At the same time, the IDF is attacking and preventing the transfer of weapons from Syria to Lebanon. On Monday, the IDF deployed additional forces with artillery and tanks in the Golan and the buffer zone, as well as in Syrian-controlled points near the border. Syrian army posts have been abandoned in the Syrian Golan, and the IDF is monitoring the weapons remaining in them. The IDF is also detecting initial movements of Russian forces and their resources in Syria. Assad's loyalists are left with a last enclave of the Alawite community in Little Syria near the coast, between Tartus and Latakia. The chairman of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz, said at his faction's meeting in the Knesset in light of the latest developments in the region: 'The IDF did well and it is good that the political echelon approved seizing the controlling positions in the Syrian Golan and operating against the significant weapons facilities. For years, we have operated against weapons shipments and we have operated against Iranian entrenchment. Now we understand how critical this was. We must now set the rules of the game: No Iranian shipment will cross into Syria; No Iranian foothold will be accepted on our border; And no threat will be built near our cities.' 'We must not stop, in the face of anyone who threatens us,' Gantz added. 'The Houthis must suffer a fatal, continuous and severe blow that will stop their attacks - the port of Hodeidah should only be the Beginning. And if it is not enough to hit Yemen - we must respond directly to Iran. We must weaken Hezbollah's influence on Lebanon, and connect it to the axis of moderate countries. And we must look not only north but mainly far east toward Iran. Iran is more dangerous now. A nuclear breakthrough as a response to developments is a realistic option. Therefore, we must prepare for dramatic and rapid actions.' Opposition leader Knesset member Yair Lapid said at a Yesh Atid faction meeting: 'Israel did the right thing when it took action on the Syrian Hermon. The change of government and the instability in Syria de facto nullify the 1974 separation agreement. The international community cannot have any objection to this step. It is proportionate and it is binding. Israel did and is doing the right thing when it continues to act against the weapons stockpiles in Syria, emphasizing chemical weapons and air defense systems.' Lapid added: 'On the political level, Israel acted exactly the opposite. Prime Minister Netanyahu's conduct was irresponsible, dangerous and also devoid of any political logic. There is no reason that less than 24 hours after the fall of Damascus, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense would stand on the Syrian border and say that Assad fell thanks to our actions. The last thing the rebels in Syria need or want is for them to say that they came to power thanks to Israel. This is unnecessary arrogance, it leads them to react. Sooner or later they will try to prove to the Arab world that this is not true.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar confirmed Monday morning that Israel attacked various targets in Syria, 'so that they do not fall into the hands of extremist elements.' In a briefing for foreign reporters at the Foreign Ministry, Sa'ar said: 'What guides us is the security of the State of Israel and its citizens. Therefore, we attacked strategic weapons arrays, residual chemical weapons capabilities, long-range missiles and rockets - so that they do not fall into the hands of extremist elements.' The border crossing between Syria and Lebanon has been rendered unusable following an Israeli attack, according to a report in the official Syrian news agency SANA on Friday. According to another report in Lebanon, the attack in Al-Arida cut off the road connecting the two countries. At the same time, IDF spokesman Brigadier General Daniel Hegary announced on Friday an 'attack on the routes for smuggling weapons and terrorist infrastructure to Hezbollah, near the Syrian regime's border crossings between Syria and Lebanon.' According to the announcement, the attack was part of the IDF's activity in recent weeks, aimed at damaging the capabilities of Hezbollah's Unit 4400, 'responsible for transferring weapons used to carry out terrorist attacks against the Israeli home front and IDF forces.' Regarding the deal to release the hostages, Lishay Lavi Miran whose husband Omri has been held captive by Hamas for 430 days, on Monday morning addressed the Qatari report about progress in talks for a deal, and shared in a conversation with Ynet that 'I have not received an update on the list.' Israel denied the report, and the Hostage Affairs Directorate in the Prime Minister's Office , headed by Brigadier General (res.) Gal Hirsch, stated that 'the publications are incorrect.' Lavi-Miran also participated in a meeting of families of hostages with Netanyahu, and said: 'I did not come out optimistic, but I wish I had been deceived.' Alon Nimrodi, the father of the kidnapped soldier Tamir Nimrodi, said that he was not present at Sunday's meeting. 'He only meets with his own people,' the father said, attacking the prime minister. 'I would tell Netanyahu everything he doesn't like to hear, my truth is painful for a kidnapped soldier. I am happy about the latest report that Hamas has passed a list, but as long as the head of the Mossad is in Israel - nothing is happening. Who on our side is currently conducting the negotiations?' he wondered.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryonzy441e	2024-12-09T06:24:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/01/SJbmDiTFRR/SJbmDiTFRR_0_29_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Hamas congratulates Syrians on ending Assad's rule	Hamas congratulated the Syrian people on Monday for achieving their 'aspirations for freedom and justice' after toppling President Bashar al-Assad. It was Hamas' first public comment since rebel forces swept into the Syrian capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning advance that sent Assad fleeing to Russia after a 13-year civil war and six decades of his family's autocratic rule. 'We stand strongly with the great people of Syria... and respect the will, the independence, and the political choices of the people of Syria,' the Islamist faction that has been ruling the Gaza Strip said in a statement. Hamas said it hoped that post-Assad Syria would continue 'its historical and pivotal role in supporting the Palestinian people.' In a separate statement,, Ziad al-Nakhala, head of the Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed group and an ally of Hamas, echoed that sentiment. 'The Islamic Jihad hopes Syria will remain a real support for the Palestinian people, their just cause, as it has always been,' said Nakhala. Hamas publicly endorsed the 2011 Sunni Muslim street uprising against Assad's rule and vacated its Damascus headquarters in 2012, a move that angered Iran, an ally of both Assad and the Palestinian group. Hamas, whose ideological roots stem from the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, distanced itself from Assad - a member of the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam - as he cracked down on the mainly Sunni Muslim protesters and rebels. The Palestinian group decided in 2022 to restore ties with the Assad government and sent a delegation to Damascus, where Hamas leaders met Assad in the hope of repairing relations. Assad's Syria and Iran formed an 'axis of resistance' with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and Palestinian militant groups to oppose Israel. Hamas's positive response to the fall of Assad contrasted with that of Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah , which played a major part propping up Assad through years of war.

Jabaliya to Khiam to Golan: IDF paratroopers face new challenges ...	Recently redeployed from Lebanon, troops now man forward outpost near Syria; tasked with destroying weapons stockpiles, they confront roaming militias and unclear rules of engagement, raising questions about permanence of presence in Syria Israeli paratroopers from the elite reconnaissance unit recently withdrew from Khiam, the northernmost Lebanese village held by the IDF during the past two months, after completing operations there. Their current mission places them in the northern Golan Heights, where they face a new array of challenges near the Syrian frontier. On Sunday, the soldiers were stationed in an abandoned IDF outpost in the Valley of Tears, overlooking the Syrian border. The position, now a maze of cold, dark tunnels, once housed their predecessors 51 years ago during the Yom Kippur War. Surrounded by basalt stone walls, they huddled around a small burner to stave off the biting December cold, a stark contrast to their recent missions in southern Lebanon and Gaza. 'It’s much colder here than in Lebanon,' said one soldier as he opened a can of tuna from his combat rations. 'At least in Khiam, we slept inside houses.' These young soldiers, barely 20 years old, have been at the forefront of Israel’s military campaigns in Gaza, Lebanon and now Syria within just three months. They fought Hamas in the Jabalya refugee camp, Hezbollah in Lebanon and are now positioned against a mix of armed Syrian rebel groups that could threaten Israeli communities such as Ein Zivan, Katzrin, Buq’ata and Meitzar. While some of their comrades hold advanced positions beyond the tall border fence built a decade ago, others operate deeper inside Syrian territory. Initially, the IDF secured the buffer zone between the internationally recognized border and Syrian-controlled territory. Over time, Israeli forces have seized key hilltops and commanding positions inside Syria, prioritizing strategic locations with difficult topography. Sunday morning, the Air Force’s elite commando unit, Shaldag, captured a significant area in northern Golan, securing critical high ground with commanding views over Quneitra and beyond. The IDF now controls vital observation and defensive positions along the region’s most contested zones. In the southern Golan, Israeli forces also extended their reach into the rugged Rokad Valley, a deep, jagged ravine marked by red-and-white boundary barrels but lacking a formal border fence. The soldiers’ presence highlights the shifting dynamics in the Golan Heights, where for the first time in over a century, the area’s geopolitical landscape is being redrawn. The Syrian border, established in 1916 by British and French diplomats, now separates not only a sovereign state but also a nascent new order as rebel factions carve out their territories. Danger at the tri-border area Fighters from the Golan Reconnaissance Unit, a newly formed and small force composed of West Bank settler youth and based on a similar unit disbanded last year, have been deployed to one of the most dangerous corners of the region. This area, near the tri-border zone at Hamat Gader and the striking Yarmouk River, has a troubled history. A decade ago, residents of the Syrian village of Jamla, on the eastern bank, hosted insurgents from Jabhat al-Nusra, the extremist rebel faction in southern Syria. From there, attacks involving roadside bombs and gunfire were launched against IDF forces, until Assad’s troops regained control of the region in 2019. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In southern Syria, between Daraa and Hauran near the Israeli border, the landscape is now dominated by a mix of rebel groups, far removed from the so-called 'moderate' Hayat Tahrir al-Sham led by the newly ascendant Islamist figure Abu Muhammed al-Golani, who captured Damascus on Sunday. 'In the Syrian Golan, we’ve observed armed groups over the weekend that remain unidentified, right along the buffer zone with us,' an IDF official said Sunday night. 'These groups operate with varying ideologies and a vast array of weapons circulating in a state armed like a monster. That’s why we recommended, at least temporarily, establishing forward defenses within enemy territory.' So far, the IDF's efforts to capture these positions have faced little resistance, with Assad’s soldiers abandoning their posts and fleeing the area. Closed military zone declared in the Golan Gunfire was absent in the Golan Heights on Sunday as restaurants began reopening, less than two weeks after the cease-fire with Hezbollah. The terrorist group had launched hundreds of rockets and drones at the region. Occasional distant explosions, however, echoed from Israeli Air Force strikes near Damascus, targeting potential threats to Israel, including surface-to-surface missiles, advanced air defense systems, remnants of chemical weapons and weapons development facilities. The Quneitra crossing, the closest point of contact between the IDF and Syrian forces, was abandoned by Assad’s troops over the weekend without clashes or mortar fire—common occurrences in the past decade. Primarily used by UNDOF observers, the crossing once saw wedding celebrations between Druze families on both sides of the border and apple shipments from Mas’ade to Syria, now distant memories. On Sunday, the Northern Command declared a closed military zone, restricting access to agricultural and tourist areas near the border fence. By midnight, the restrictions were lifted in the Marom Golan–Ein Zivan and Buq’ata–Khirbet Ein Hura areas. While soldiers remain deep in forward positions, civilians in the rear are beginning to clear the dust of war and recover. Signs of lingering tensions remain, with rear defense lines established this year revealing the region’s volatility. Camouflaged tanks and military vehicles were stationed discreetly near a kibbutz exit. The rules of engagement here vary along the border, as Syrian locals continue farming and herding livestock. Soldiers, many recently deployed from Lebanon, face challenges distinguishing threats, such as identifying armed combatants versus civilians in camouflage, or determining engagement limits for vehicles crossing the Quneitra road toward Marom Golan. The skies remain active, with fighter jets soaring at high altitudes and drones conducting surveillance below. Reserve soldiers who had recently returned to civilian life are back in uniform, resuming readiness in local communities. Despite this, the effort to maintain or project a sense of normalcy continues, even as uncertainties about the future loom. By late afternoon, four IDF D9 bulldozers arrived near the border fence below Majdal Shams, where residents were celebrating Assad’s downfall near the iconic 'Shouting Hill.' The bulldozers were poised to cross the border, ascend high Syrian positions and secure the Druze village of Hader. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjs1lpv41g	2024-12-09T03:37:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/rkZVQPGEVJl/rkZVQPGEVJl_0_1_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Syrian rebels free prisoners from notorious Assad prison, search ...	White Helmets teams, equipped with search dogs and rescue specialists, scoure Saydnaya prison for underground cells hidden behind walls and armored doors; while some located, others remain inaccessible, leaving prisoners’ fates unknown Just north of Damascus, in Saydnaya military prison—infamously called the 'human slaughterhouse' and a symbol of Assad’s regime—efforts are underway to uncover secret underground cells where prisoners remain trapped after access routes were blocked. On Monday, members of the White Helmets searched for hidden cells based on accounts from survivors. Five specialized teams, including search-and-rescue personnel, wall-breaching experts, search dogs and physicians, were deployed to the site. Since the start of the 2011 uprising against Assad, armed opposition forces and non-violent protesters were incarcerated there, as were military officers suspected of disloyalty to the dictator. According to Amnesty International, some 13,000 people were hanged in the prison between 2011 and 2015. As the insurgents swept toward Damascus, thousands of prisoners were freed from jails and on Sunday, the rebels reached Saydnaya. Women detainees, some with their children, screamed as men broke the locks off their cell doors. 'Don’t be afraid … Bashar Assad has fallen! Why are you afraid?' said one of the rebels as he tried to rush streams of women out of their jam-packed tiny cells. Hundreds of men were seen running barefoot from the prison, some wearing minimal clothing. Many gestured with their hands to indicate the number of years they had been imprisoned, their faces etched with disbelief and trauma. However, freed prisoners told rebels about hidden underground cells in the Red Block, a section reportedly reserved for high-priority detainees. Doors to these cells required codes known only to senior officials, leaving captives trapped. Rebels inspected the prison’s control room and discovered evidence bolstering suspicions about the existence of secret cells. While some were breached, others remain out of reach. According to reports, some of the cells were found and breached by the rebels but others remain out of reach. One former prisoner, speaking to Al Jazeera, described being packed with 25 others into a tiny cell. 'We sat with our heads bowed and didn’t even know the names of those around us,' he said. Arrested in Aleppo in 2019 for evading military service, he endured beatings, including being struck on the head with a hammer. A day before Assad’s fall, guards removed dozens of detainees, warning some they would be executed. Bashar Barhoum woke in his dungeon prison cell in Damascus at dawn Sunday, thinking it would be the last day of his life. The 63-year-old writer was supposed to have been executed after being imprisoned for seven months. But he soon realized the men at the door weren’t from former Syrian President Bashar Assad’s notorious security forces, ready to take him to his death. Instead, they were rebels coming to set him free. 'I haven’t seen the sun until today,' Barhoum told The Associated Press after walking in disbelief through the streets of Damascus. 'Instead of being dead tomorrow, thank God, he gave me a new lease of life.' Barhoum couldn’t find his cellphone and belongings in the prison so set off to find a way to tell his wife and daughters that he’s alive and well. Torture, executions and starvation in Syria’s prisons Syria’s prisons have been infamous for their harsh conditions. Torture is systematic, say human rights groups, whistleblowers, and former detainees. Secret executions have been reported at more than two dozen facilities run by Syrian intelligence, as well as at other sites.

Syria’s feared security apparatus and prisons did not only serve to isolate Assad’s opponents, but also to instill fear among his own people said Lina Khatib, Associate Fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at the London think tank Chatham House. 'Anxiety about being thrown in one of Assad’s notorious prisons created wide mistrust among Syrians,' Khatib said. 'Assad nurtured this culture of fear to maintain control and crush political opposition.' Families seek loved ones who have been missing for years Omar Alshogre, who was detained for three years and survived relentless torture, watched in awe from his home far from Syria as videos showed dozens of detainees fleeing. 'A hundred democracies in the world had done nothing to help them, and now a few military groups came down and broke open prison after prison,' Alshogre, a human rights advocate who now resides in Sweden and the U.S., told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, families of detainees and the disappeared skipped celebrations of the downfall of the Assad dynasty. Instead, they waited outside prisons and security branch centers, hoping their loved ones would be there. They had high expectations for the newcomers who will now run the battered country. 'This happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of prison and know where he is,' said Bassam Masri. 'I have been searching for him for two hours. He has been detained for 13 years,' since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. Rebels struggled to control the chaos as crowds gathered by the Court of Justice in Damascus. Heba, who only gave her first name while speaking to the AP, said she was looking for her brother and brother-in-law who were detained while reporting a stolen car in 2011 and hadn’t been seen since. 'They took away so many of us,' said Heba, whose mother’s cousin also disappeared. 'We know nothing about them ... They (the Assad government) burned our hearts.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj9nss4vye	2024-12-09T03:11:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/HJQs7f7Nyl/HJQs7f7Nyl_0_334_1080_608_0_small.jpg

Watch: Palestinian security forces launch rare counterterror oper...	Repeated IDF operations in Jenin bolster PA forces’ confidence to target PIJ terrorists; if successful, PA’s effort to regain and hold control of refugee camp could shift security landscape across West Bank Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces launched an operation against Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp on Monday, marking their first entry into the area in years. Previously, the PA refrained from operating in the camp, leaving counterterrorism efforts to the IDF. Images of the operation, an unusual offensive against terror squads in the camp, showed PA forces equipped with sniper rifles, tactical helmets and armored vehicles—all approved by Israel. The raid followed escalating tensions between PIJ operatives and PA forces, sparked when terrorists seized two PA vehicles and paraded them through the camp. PA intelligence chief Majd Faraj visited the camp to mediate and prevent further conflict, but Monday’s raid signaled a shift in power dynamics, with the weakening of the PIJ-led Jenin Brigade. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Photos of stolen PA jeeps adorned with Hamas and PIJ flags served as a tipping point for the PA's decision to act. On Thursday, PA forces secured Jenin’s hospitals, sealing access to the camp in preparation for their incursion. On Monday, they opened the gates and launched an assault, clearing explosive devices planted by terrorists. In a statement, PA security forces announced their mission to restore law and order in Jenin and its refugee camp for civilian protection. 'There will be no backing down from enforcing law and order, arresting criminals, confiscating resources and cutting off suspicious funds,' a spokesperson told the Wafa news agency, adding that all evidence would be presented to Palestinian courts and confirming that one security officer was moderately injured in the operation. The repeated IDF incursions into Jenin in recent months are believed to have bolstered the PA’s confidence to reclaim control of the area. However, it remains unclear if the PA can maintain its hold on the camp—an outcome with potentially significant implications for West Bank security. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjfsy444ye	2024-12-09T02:11:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/BylN00hfE4yl/BylN00hfE4yl_0_281_720_405_0_small.jpg

How a healthcare CEO’s killer became an American hero	Public outrage toward US healthcare system fuels notoriety of Brian Thompson’s killer; UnitedHealthcare CEO’s assailant remains at large, drawing attention and, for some, unexpected sympathy He murdered a man in cold blood in the middle of a Manhattan street, leaving two children fatherless. Yet, the man who shot Brian Thompson, CEO of the health insurance company UnitedHealthcare, in the back is gaining increasing support daily — to the level of a national hero in the U.S. A grainy photo of him from the hotel he stayed at before the murder has drawn comparisons to Hollywood stars and jackets similar to the one he wore have sold out online. On Saturday, a look-alike contest in his honor took place at Washington Square Park in Manhattan. The NYPD has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his capture, but so far, not only has no one claimed the prize, but the hotel where the killer stayed has been flooded with negative online reviews for cooperating with the police. This grim story — from a cold-blooded murder on a New York City street to the public's reaction — reiterates that the most hated industry in the U.S. is health insurance. For Thompson’s friends and grieving family, this is a horrific nightmare. But for many Americans, it’s become an opportunity to vent their frustrations at the health insurance system and the immensely wealthy, powerful figures leading it. According to a survey conducted last year by KFF, a nonprofit healthcare think tank, about 6 in 10 adults reported experiencing issues with their health insurance within the previous 12 months, such as surprise bills or denial of treatment approvals. The sicker individuals were, the worse their struggles with insurance companies became. UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare’s parent company, is the fourth-largest company in the U.S., raking in over $22 billion in 2023. Its insurance division is arguably the most despised, known for rejecting more claims than any other insurer. It employs tactics such as 'prior authorization,' requiring doctors to submit additional paperwork upfront to justify treatments and prescriptions and relying on algorithms to delay or deny approvals. American insurance companies bring in hundreds of millions in annual profits while subjecting policyholders to constant red tape. And the situation today is significantly better than before 2010, when then-president Barack Obama introduced comprehensive healthcare reform. Before the law, known as Obamacare, tens of millions of Americans couldn’t afford health insurance at all. Most workers receive insurance through their employers, but they remain just one job loss or serious illness away from financial catastrophe. For example, prior to Obamacare, there were no limits on out-of-pocket costs for patients. Insurers could refuse coverage for almost any reason, even for something as basic as being born with asthma. Women were routinely charged significantly higher premiums. While many of these issues have been addressed, the nightmare of needing an insurer's help during a real crisis remains unchanged. Adding to the killer’s 'heroic' image were three words etched onto one of the bullets that hit Thompson: 'depose,' 'deny' and 'delay.' All these words are associated with tactics insurers use to avoid paying claims. Users across social media commented that their empathy for this case had been 'denied.' Many posts received tens of thousands of likes, particularly those sharing stories of battling insurance companies' refusals to cover the exorbitant costs of medical treatments, especially those by UnitedHealthcare. For executives of major corporations, particularly in the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, Thompson’s murder is an especially shocking moment. It’s even led some large companies to remove their executives' photos from their websites. Alex Goldenberg, a senior advisor at the Network Contagion Research Institute — which tracks online threats — told The New York Times that the online rhetoric had left experts 'disturbed' at the glorification of Thompson's murder. The institute found that six out of the 10 most viral posts on X (formerly Twitter) on the day of the murder 'either expressed explicit or implicit support for the killing or denigrated the victim.' This dynamic mirrors discussions that often follow mass shootings on far-right online message boards like 4chan and 8chan. 'But what’s disturbing about this is it’s mainstream,' Goldenberg said. 'It’s being framed as some opening blow in a broader class war, which is very concerning.' The killer’s supporters come from both sides of the political spectrum. Hatred for health insurance companies is one of the few things that unite the American people today. The starkest example of support for Thompson’s killer is the silence of prominent Internet sleuths. These are some of the biggest online figures who have previously helped the FBI identify hundreds of Capitol rioters on January 6, 2021. Now, their silence is deafening.

Hamas provides names of first hostages to be freed as cease-fire ...	Terror group leaders in Cairo confirm progress in talks; Palestinian factions in Gaza reveal Hamas requested lists of hostages and details about their medical conditions ahead of potential agreement Negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza and hostage release are progressing, with Hamas submitting a list of hostages to mediators in Cairo, Qatari newspaper The News Arab reported on Monday. The paper cited advanced talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the U.S., including exchanges of names for a potential deal. Egyptian intelligence reportedly received names of hostages with medical conditions and elderly captives, as well as Palestinian prisoners to be freed from Israeli jails. An Israeli delegation was expected to arrive in Cairo on Monday to finalize aspects of the agreement. The report also claimed that four hostages with U.S. citizenship, not meeting the humanitarian conditions of the first phase, would be included. The Americans among the 100 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza include Edan Alexander, Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Judi Weinstein Haggai and her husband Gadi Haggai, with some reported to be deceased. Hamas confirmed its delegation left Cairo after talks with Egyptian intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Hassan Rashad. The terrorist group reportedly asked other Palestinian factions, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, to compile 'files' on the hostages they hold, including medical conditions and locations.

Iran not willing to give up hold on Syria, report	There is a debate in Tehran on the best way forward with some calling for dialogue with Syrian rebels who share a hate for Israel and a test of a nuclear weapon to establish Iranian regional control and others urging caution until Hezbollah can rebuild its force Tehran was not ready to give up its hold on Syria according to a report in the UK's financial Times, citing Iranian officials. Tehran invested decades in building its influence there and its loss would be a costly blow, the official said. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that ousted Syrian president Bashar Assad 'never asked' for Tehran's aid against the rebels that overtook Damascus in a lightning offensive and drove him from power. 'We were never asked for help,' Araghchi said in a live interview on state television, adding that it was Syrian army's duty to counter the offensive, which on Sunday toppled Assad. Iran had backed the Syrian leader with military advisers during his country's years-long civil war, in which forces of the Tehran-backed Hezbollah movement also supported the government. According to the Financial Times, Iran had lost faith in the Syrian dictator even before his fall and Araghchi told him during his last visit to Damascus that Tehran would not be able to send forces to his regime's aid after its proxy's long war with Israel. The paper said that according to an official close to the government in Iran, Assad told the visiting minister that his withdrawal from Aleppo was tactical and that he was still in control of his country. The source said the speed of Assad's fall was a shocking surprise to the Iranians. The FT said in its report that among the reasons for Iran's refusal to help their ally was the Israeli attacks on the Iranians in Syria and the feeling in Tehran that Assad was unreliable and even a traitor for not preventing those attacks. The source said there was a years-long frustration in the Iranian regime and that the past years made it clear to them that Assad's time was over. He said the Syrian leader had become and obstacle and his inaction against the Israeli strikes cost the Iranians dearly, adding that Assad seems to align himself with regional actors who promised him a future that never came. Some in Iran believed Assad was returning to the fold of other Arab nations such as the UAE after promises that they would help rehabilitate his country after the war, in exchange for distancing himself from Iran's influence. After his fall, those same voices accused officials in Damascus of leaking information about the whereabouts of Iranian commanders in Syria, to the Israelis and said Assad had deserted Iran when it needed him most. Still, the fall of the Assad regime is a devastating blow to Iran's foreign policy and regional strategy against Israel. Syria was a critical part of the 'ring of fire' Iran established around Israel and there are concerns in Tehran that the fall of the Assad regime would cause a ripple effect in Iraq, where Iran's hold is significant. Iranians officials said they now had to ensure that the same scenario played out in Syria is not repeated in Iraq and Yemen and that it was time to take action because the efforts undertaken over 40-years could unravel overnight. But other Iranian officials insist that Iran would be able to continue its influence on Syria even after the rebel takeover of the country and that negotiations with the rebel groups should begin. The source said that although Assad was removed by militants who oppose the Shiites, they do share a hate of Israel with Tehran. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: An Israeli official told the FT that Israel does not believe the Iranian influence near its borders would just disappear because Iran thrives in chaos. He said it was too soon to say whether Iran would withdraw from Syria or if Hezbollah would remove its operatives from that country and it was most likely that Israel would still have to deal with the Iranian threat for at least the next decade. It appears that there is some debate in Tehran over the right strategy going forward. One Iranian lawmaker said Tehran must not only revive its axis but also carry out a nuclear test to solidify its regional control. Others called for caution because Hezbollah was now weak, and the axis had taken a blow. They believed it would take time to rebuild Hezbollah's military capabilities and until that can be achieved Iran must consider its moves. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s17qnwnnke	2024-12-08T21:03:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/05/r1tl9sCR0/r1tl9sCR0_273_148_917_516_0_small.jpg
Australian Jews question their future amid escalating antisemitic...	Alon Cassuto says Australian Jewish community wonders if this is the 'beginning of the end' for them The Australian Jewish community is beginning to wonder if 'it is the beginning of the end' for them in the country, according to Alon Cassuto, CEO of the Zionist Federation of Australia. Speaking to ILTV on Sunday, Cassuto said, 'The saddest thing for our community is that many are losing hope that things will get better and are starting to expect things will get worse.' He noted that the community, which had been 'so strong and thriving' before October 7, is now questioning its future in Australia. This uncertainty has grown following a terror attack on Friday in which a Melbourne synagogue was set on fire. However, Cassuto admitted he was 'not entirely surprised' by the incident, citing a surge in antisemitic incidents over the past year. These included an assault on a local rabbi’s home, a synagogue being forced into lockdown, Jewish stores targeted by graffiti and violence, and even Jewish members of parliament having their offices set on fire. 'It’s been really the kind of escalation that's been happening over the course of many months. And our community,' Cassuto told ILTV. In the aftermath of the Melbourne attack, the government committed $32 million in security measures for the Jewish community, a move Cassuto described as 'significant.' However, he criticized the funding as a 'reactive gesture' rather than a 'proactive gesture' that addresses the root causes of the community’s vulnerability or ensures its safety. 'I'm more concerned than I've ever been for the security of my family, my community, and our people,' Cassuto said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r18ulzve1e	2024-12-08T21:00:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/06/BytjEMgVkg/BytjEMgVkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Syrians are rid of a tyrant': Israeli and Syrian Druze celebrate...	Syrian Druze rebel commander tells Ynet about their desire to break free from ousted Syrian dictator's rule and deep connection with Israeli counterparts Sheikh Loai, the commander of the Syrian Druze force that liberated Sweida, a province with a considerable Druze population, spoke with Ynet on Sunday amid celebrations following the fall of President Bashar Assad's regime. 'As soon as the rebels began liberating northern Syria, we realized we had to act and remove all symbols of the tyrant Assad's rule, from police stations to military bases,' He recounted. Sweida, located in southern Syria, is the largest Druze stronghold in the Middle East, covering 5,550 square kilometers (2,142 square miles) and home to around 300,000 residents. Assad made significant efforts to limit the independence of the Druze community within his territory. The community’s spiritual leader, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajri, approved their participation in the campaign while ensuring no civilian harm. 'When we saw the time was right, we acted swiftly,' Sheikh Loai said. 'We organized weapons and moved through the province, asking soldiers and police officers to abandon their posts. Most complied without resistance, but those who didn’t found themselves in armed confrontations. 'Right now, we’re filled with joy. We’ve waited so long for these moments and our region is finally free of the evil that Assad brought upon us,' he added, noting that the Druze's actions were coordinated with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebel group, which led the rebel offensive in northern Syria. Tarek, a Druze journalist who fled to France after being labeled a 'traitor' by the regime, described the situation for the Druze in Syria from afar. 'Assad's regime severely weakened the Druze. He marginalized us militarily, politically and economically.' 'Before Hafez Assad's rise to power, Druze could hold significant military roles, but under his rule, we were held off at the rank of brigadier general. Our province has been isolated and neglected,' he told Ynet. Following the Druze region’s liberation from Assad's rule, community leader al-Hajri issued a statement, saying, 'At this critical moment, we stress the need for vigilance, as the journey ahead is long and the battle is not over.' 'We call on everyone to protect both public and private property as a national and moral duty, prevent acts of vandalism and block any attempt to undermine security and stability in Sweida.' After this announcement, the Druze proudly raised their distinctive flag, an act previously forbidden under Assad's rule. One of the most traumatic events in the region in recent years took place in 2018 when over 250 people were killed in a series of jihadist attacks. This tragedy planted the seeds of rebellion within the Druze community, as the regime failed to come to their aid. Sweida’s Druze maintain strong ties with their brethren in Israel. For over 50 years, many of the thousands of Druze residents in Israel’s four villages in the northern Golan Heights — Majdal Shams, Mas’ade, Buq’ata and Ein Qiniyye — feared showing solidarity with Israel or obtaining Israeli citizenship, concerned that the Golan Heights might one day be returned to Assad’s rule. However, attitudes shifted during the Syrian Civil War in the past decade and some young Druze in the northern Golan even secretly enlisted in the IDF. In Majdal Shams, flags of the Syrian opposition were raised in solidarity with the fall of Assad's regime on Sunday. Salman Fakhr al-Din, a resident of the village with relatives in Syria, said, 'Finally, the Syrians are rid of a tyrant who stole public funds, starved his people and treated the country as his personal property.' Fakhr al-Din described the community’s joy: 'I can’t put the happiness into words. He was a ruler who destroyed everything, with no regard for humanity. People left prisons broken in body and spirit. History has never seen such a cruel leader. He not only slaughtered his own people but sidelined minorities.'

'This is Syria’s Independence Day — the people’s liberation from Assad’s brutal rule. He looted and massacred endlessly. We’re thrilled for our family there and hope they can now live better lives with dignity,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryg4hk7eye	2024-12-08T13:40:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/SJbFzRgXV1x/SJbFzRgXV1x_0_109_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Fall of Assad regime sparks hope for Israeli missing persons in S...	Eli Cohen, Guy Hever, Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldman remain missing for decades; with Assad’s regime toppled, their families hope for answers; 'Prisoners are being freed after 50 years. Maybe they were held in dark dungeons under the brutal regime' The collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime on Sunday has reignited hope among families of Israeli missing persons in Syria, who believe the leadership change could pave the way for the return of their loved ones—alive or for burial in Israel. Nadia Cohen, widow of Israeli spy Eli Cohen, whose body was buried in Damascus after his 1965 execution, expressed optimism that Assad’s ouster may bring closure. 'Since Syria’s instability began, I’ve urged Mossad to solve this issue and bring Eli home for burial,' she told Ynet. On Friday, which marked the centenary of Eli Cohen’s birth, Mossad chief David Barnea wrote her a heartfelt message emphasizing the importance of repatriating his remains. 'With recent events in Syria, I hope Israel understands this is the right time,' she said. Cohen recounted a past appeal to Assad himself, which was rejected. 'He said Eli would return ‘when the time comes.’ Perhaps that time is now,' she said. 'I don’t want Eli’s remains left in Syria. The turmoil there could work in our favor. I wish peace for both the Syrian people and us and hope this opportunity will lead to Eli’s body being returned to Israel so he can rest in peace. After all these years, I too will finally find peace. I haven’t forgotten him for even a moment, and nearly 60 years have passed since he was hanged.' The families of IDF soldiers Yehuda Katz and Zvi Feldman, missing since the 1982 Battle of Sultan Yacoub in Lebanon, also see a rare opportunity for resolution. Katz’s sister, Frehia Hyman, said the uprising offers renewed hope. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We have much hope. We’ve seen Lebanese prisoners released, so I keep checking footage to see if Yehuda is among them,' Hyman said, recalling signs that Katz was captured alive and noting that his tank commander was returned by Syria. 'This could be a serious turning point, but I don’t know what tomorrow will bring.' Still, Hyman voiced frustration with Israeli authorities. 'I have no trust in the state. For 43 years, we’ve been treated like enemies. But the possibility of finding Yehuda isn’t far-fetched—we’ve seen prisoners freed after decades.' Despite the passage of time, the family remains optimistic. 'I imagine his return—hugging him, smiling at him. Our family has always remained optimistic. So much time has passed but he’s still my little brother,' she said. 'Our parents passed away without this closure, but I hope they’re watching from above.' Feldman’s sister, Anat, echoed these sentiments. 'The events in Syria are a rare window of opportunity. We hope this will bring Zvika home,' she said. 'Assad and his father’s brutal regime may have held him in dark dungeons for decades.' News of inmates freed from Syrian prisons after 50 years has sparked hope. 'We’ve always said Zvika might be held somewhere. The state must act now—it’s a national responsibility,' she added. Anat noted that her family has maintained a low profile since October 7, due to the hostage situation in Gaza, but believes now is the time to push for action. 'This isn’t just about us—it’s about a tough battle where the IDF abandoned six soldiers. In 2019, they brought back the remains of Zachary Baumel who was in the tank with my brother. We want Zvika home too.' The families of other missing Israelis, including Guy Hever, also hold on to hope. Hever, a 20-year-old artillery soldier, disappeared in 1997 from his Golan Heights base, leaving no trace. Despite extensive searches, his fate remains a mystery. Hever left the base carrying his Galil rifle, but no evidence has surfaced to explain his disappearance. While his family believes he may have been abducted to Syria, no leads have confirmed his whereabouts in the 27 years since. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyoig5qvyl	2024-12-08T13:00:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/HJGjAIQEyx/HJGjAIQEyx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Elite units and tanks: IDF deployment across Syrian border signal...	As history unfolds, Israel strengthens its position by capturing key high points on Mount Hermon from the Assad regime, citing regional chaos as Iran’s influence wanes and Islamist forces rise in Syria In a rapid and calculated move, elite IDF units—special forces, armored brigades and paratroopers—have deployed to critical points across Syrian territory, including the summit of Mount Hermon and areas beyond the Golan Heights buffer zone. These operations, executed without resistance following the hasty retreat of Assad's forces, aim to secure key positions ahead of advancing Syrian rebel groups. IDF plans to continue these maneuvers in the coming days to strengthen its foothold in the region. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force is unleashing waves of strikes across Syria, including precise hits on Damascus. Among the reported targets is the 'Security Quarter' in the Syrian capital, home to Assad regime intelligence facilities and customs offices. Sources told Reuters that Israel also struck Syria's main military research center, which Iran allegedly used for missile development. IDF has described its actions as a temporary defensive deployment in the buffer zone, prompted by sightings of unidentified armed Syrians over the weekend. 'We are working to neutralize threats in Syria, where the situation is currently chaotic,' the IDF said. 'We’ve been closely monitoring developments and coordinating with other forces in the region to avoid unnecessary friction.' IDF emphasized its ongoing strikes in Syria, designed to remove immediate threats to Israel. 'Iranian influence in the region has weakened, and the Shiite axis has fractured,' the army explained. 'We are witnessing a monumental and dramatic shift. An Islamist force has risen in Syria, and we are closely observing its evolution.' Acknowledging its forces have taken strategic positions near the Syrian border, IDF explained this was a necessary move to boost regional security. Deployment was approved by senior Israeli political leadership. IDF also clarified that the rebel groups advancing in southern Syria, from Daraa to the Golan Heights, are not affiliated with the extremist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) organization led by Abu Mohammed al-Golani. 'These consist of a mix of groups with varying ideologies,' according to IDF. Meanwhile, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi addressed new Golani Brigade recruits at the Tel Hashomer recruitment center in central Israel, highlighting the army's multi-front challenges. 'IDF is fighting on four fronts—The West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon and as of tonight, Syria,' he said. 'Soon, this responsibility will fall to you. Our excellent ground forces—infantry, armor, engineering and artillery—work together seamlessly with other branches of the IDF, including air, naval and intelligence forces. Even after a challenging year, and following a very difficult day last Simchat Torah, IDF is moving forward strongly to defend the nation.' In a significant escalation, IDF issued urgent warnings to residents in five villages near the Israeli border, urging them to remain indoors. 'Urgent warning to residents of southern Syria in the villages of Ofaniyah, Quneitra, Al-Hamidiyah, Samadaniyah Al-Sharqiyah and Al-Qahtaniyah,' wrote IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee. 'The fighting in your area is forcing IDF movements, but we have no intention of harming you. For your safety, stay indoors until further notice.' The capture of Mount Hermon and control over the buffer zone were unanimously approved by the Security Cabinet. IDF reiterated that it is not intervening in Syria's internal conflict but will act decisively to safeguard the buffer zone and protect Israel and its citizens. Additionally, IDF has reportedly warned Syrian rebels in the Golan Heights, who toppled the Assad regime early Sunday, not to cross the Alpha Line, marking the start of the demilitarized zone. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings in Jerusalem on Sunday with families of Israeli hostages, claiming that the fall of the Assad regime—partly due to Israel’s firm actions against Hezbollah and Hamas—could help advance negotiations for their release. Earlier, IDF ground forces entered Syrian territory, with Ynet reporting that Sayeret Shaldag, the Israeli Air Force commando unit, successfully captured the Syrian Mount Hermon summit. This strategic operation aimed to enhance IDF's control over the region, particularly on the summit, which provides unparalleled observation and fire control over other Hermon ridges. The move coincided with a wave of Israeli Air Force strikes targeting airports in Damascus and southern Syria, as well as rural areas in Daraa and Sweida, according to Arab reports. The ground capture of Mount Hermon was not an isolated event. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an oppositional-affiliated war monitor, reported that Israeli forces advanced into various locations in the Quneitra countryside, using tanks and armored vehicles to reach as far as the Al-Raqad Bridge. Israeli units reportedly approached civilian homes in Al-Hamidiyah village, north of Quneitra. Reports claim the forces shot and killed a young man from Jabatha in northern Quneitra and detained residents of Rasm al-Rawadi village, gathering them at the local school. In essence, IDF is conducting operations along a 50-mile stretch of the Syrian border, securing critical positions to prevent them from falling into the hands of armed rebels following the collapse of Assad’s forces. The most strategically significant of these locations is the Mount Hermon summit, under Assad regime control for over 50 years, and is considered a vital strategic post. Reports suggest IDF has also conducted airstrikes near Damascus, targeting weapons depots and surface-to-surface missile sites. Ynet military analyst Yossi Yehoshua noted that one target included Al-Mezzeh, a key Syrian Air Force base previously hit by Israel. Another target, according to Syrian sources, was the Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC), also known as 'CERS,' near Damascus. Although officially a civilian research institute, the SSRC has long been suspected of serving as a hub for weapons development for the Syrian military, Iran and Hezbollah, leading to its frequent targeting by Israel in recent years. The opposition-affiliated Syrian outlet Voice of the Capital reported that Israel is systematically dismantling all remnants of Assad's military infrastructure in southern Syria. This includes direct strikes on air defense systems, missile warehouses and production facilities—essentially anything connected to the development of weapons capable of threatening Israel. The outlet also claimed discussions are underway for a Russian-Israeli agreement to transfer strategic sites in rural Daraa and Quneitra, including Tel al-Hara, to Israeli control. Prime Minister Netanyahu, accompanied by Defense Minister Israel Katz, visited Mount Bental in the Golan Heights near the Syrian border Sunday morning. Northern Command ChiefcMaj. Gen. Ori Gordin briefed them on the unfolding situation. Netanyahu hailed the developments as 'a historic day in the annals of the Middle East.' 'The Assad regime, a central link in Iran's axis of evil, has fallen,' Netanyahu declared. 'This is a direct result of the blows we’ve dealt to Iran and Hezbollah, Assad’s main supporters. It has set off a chain reaction across the Middle East, as people seek to free themselves from oppressive tyranny. 'This creates significant new opportunities for Israel, though not without risks. Our primary mission is to defend our borders. For nearly 50 years, this area was designated as a buffer zone under the 1974 Disengagement Agreement. That agreement has now collapsed, with Syrian soldiers abandoning their positions.

We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself along our border. Simultaneously, we are pursuing a policy of good neighborliness, as we did during the Syrian civil war, when we established a field hospital here that treated thousands of wounded Syrians. Hundreds of Syrian children were even born here in Israel.' Meanwhile, IDF's Northern Command has raised its alert level and activated emergency defense protocols in the Golan Heights, preparing for potential threats from the east. Defense Minister Katz affirmed, 'The prime minister and I, with Cabinet approval, instructed the IDF to secure the buffer zone and key positions to ensure the safety of all Israeli communities in the Golan Heights—Jewish and Druze alike—so they are shielded from threats on the other side.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkl1fw7v1x	2024-12-08T12:13:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/HJfS4147VJe/HJfS4147VJe_0_143_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Poor man's cocaine': What’s next for Assad’s drug empire after h...	Syria’s booming Captagon trade fueled regime’s economy, financed Hamas and Hezbollah, and wreaked havoc on Jordan; with Assad gone, questions loom over the future of this lucrative yet destabilizing industry With recent developments on the Syrian front, questions arise about the fate of the drug empire in the country established by President Bashar Assad's regime. Captagon, the stimulant drug nicknamed 'The Islamic State’s chemical courage' and 'poor man's cocaine,' was found among the belongings and in the vehicles of Hamas terrorists during the October 7 massacre. Generating at least $5 billion annually, Captagon has been Syria's number one export. The drug financed the Syrian army and Hezbollah, while billions also flowed into the private coffers of the Assad family, Syrian army generals and Hezbollah officials. This industry financially sustained the regime as Syria's economy collapsed during the civil war, with operations rivaling the scale of major drug cartels in Mexico and South America. The man responsible for managing Captagon production in Syria was none other than Maher Assad, the former president’s brother. Until recently, Maher commanded the Syrian army's Fourth Division, often referred to as the 'Captagon Division.' However, with rebels now taking control of various Syrian provinces, Maher's focus has likely shifted to his own survival. Reports on his whereabouts remain unconfirmed, with one claiming he was last seen in Qardaha on Syria's coast, possibly planning to leave through Khmeimim Airport. A video shared on a rebel-affiliated channel also revealed an underground bunker beneath his home. The fate of Bashar Assad himself was uncertain for hours until a Kremlin source confirmed that he and his family had fled to Russia. Captagon production, supported by Iran and in collaboration with Hezbollah, formed the backbone of Assad's regime. Neighboring countries have struggled for years to thwart the relentless smuggling of drugs from Syria. The border between Jordan and Syria, spanning over 375 kilometers (235 miles), presents a particularly challenging area to monitor. Recent developments in Syria suggest that production lines may have halted, at least temporarily, as Maher faces more pressing concerns. Tensions over Captagon have extended beyond Syria's borders. Over the past year, Jordanian fighter jets have reportedly targeted facilities linked to Captagon smuggling near the Jordan-Syria border, particularly in the southwestern Sweida province. These strikes, aimed at warehouses and hubs connected to the drug trade, occasionally resulted in civilian casualties. In one January strike, ten people, including two young girls, were killed in the village of Urman in the Sweida province. Protests erupted, with residents blaming Assad's regime for turning their homes into targets for Jordanian strikes. One demonstrator held a sign accusing Assad: 'The Captagon dealer is in his palace, not in Urman or Malah [two areas targeted by airstrikes].' Hezbollah has consistently denied involvement in drug production, yet reports indicate Iran established manufacturing facilities for the group in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, near the Syrian border. Though involved, Hezbollah has reportedly avoided placing its members in key smuggling roles. Al Jazeera reported earlier this year that Syria produces 80% of the world's Captagon supply. Jordan intercepted 65 million Captagon pills in 2022 alone, all originating from Syria. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Smuggling across the Jordanian border involves both foot traffic and drones, which are also used to transport weapons. The Jordanian army regularly highlights major smuggling busts through official media channels. Amid the ongoing upheaval alongside broader questions about Syria's future and the Assad family's fate, the issue of drug production still looms. Neighboring countries may hope for relief from this menace, but Iran remains active in the region, and Hezbollah, though weakened in recent months, remains a significant actor in the regional drug empire. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjijqvxe1e	2024-12-08T10:43:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/06/11/rkqQdL7w3/rkqQdL7w3_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Assad flees to Moscow with family, Kremlin confirms	Ousted Syrian dictator arrives in Moscow with his family and granted humanitarian asylum, Kremlin source says; Russia, Assad’s main patron, claimes he 'resigned' hours after rebels swiftly advanced into Damascus and toppled his regime Ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad has fled to Moscow, where he and his family have been granted humanitarian asylum, a Kremlin source told Russian media on Sunday. Assad’s whereabouts were uncertain for hours following the collapse of his regime, amid conflicting reports, including speculation that his plane may have crashed near Homs. Russia earlier announced that Assad had 'left Syria' after deciding to step down from the presidency. The Russian Foreign Ministry portrayed Assad’s departure as voluntary and responsible, stating that 'following negotiations with several parties to the Syrian conflict, Assad chose to resign, leave the country and provide instructions for a peaceful transfer of power.' It remains unclear when Assad arrived in Moscow. Reports emerged Saturday night that his wife, Asma, and their children had left Damascus, with confirmation on Sunday that they had traveled to the Russian capital. The whereabouts of Assad’s brother, Maher Assad, commander of the Syrian Army’s 4th Division, are also unknown, though he reportedly fled to an undisclosed location. Earlier Sunday, speculation intensified about whether Assad was still alive. Two Syrian sources told Reuters there is a 'very high likelihood' that his plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Damascus. According to the sources, the aircraft initially headed toward Syria’s coast before abruptly reversing course. Minutes later, it disappeared from radar. 'It disappeared off the radar, possibly the transponder was switched off, but I believe the bigger probability is that the aircraft was taken down...,' said one Syrian source without elaborating. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hours later, Russia confirmed Assad had left Syria. In a carefully worded statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry emphasized it had not participated in the negotiations leading to his departure. Moscow expressed deep concern over events in Syria, placing its military bases there on high alert. The ministry called for all parties to refrain from violence and resolve disputes peacefully, asserting that Russia remains in contact with Syrian opposition groups. According to a Kremlin official, opposition leaders have assured Moscow that Russian bases and diplomats in Syria are secure. The Syrians will have to manage Assad’s defeat is a blow to Russia, which has prided itself over the past decade on being a steadfast ally to its partners, in this case, the Syrian regime, and rescuing them when necessary. In recent days, however, Moscow has shown little enthusiasm for aiding Assad’s regime in its fight for survival—perhaps because it recognizes its inability to do so, particularly as it remains embroiled in the war in Ukraine. Konstantin Kosachev, deputy chairman of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, remarked this afternoon that Syrians will now have to face the prospect of a full-scale civil war on their own. The Assad regime’s downfall was completed early Sunday as rebels, led by the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), seized full control of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city, before advancing to Damascus and capturing the capital. Hours later, the rebels issued their first televised statement: 'We have liberated Damascus, toppled the Assad regime and freed all those unjustly imprisoned.' Rebels were filmed entering Assad’s palace in Damascus for the first time, removing portraits of Hezbollah’s slain leader Hassan Nasrallah and Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani from the Iranian embassy, and later ransacking and vandalizing the building. In central Damascus, crowds tore down a statue of Hafez Assad, Bashar Assad’s father and former president. By midday, reports confirmed that the reception hall of the presidential palace had been set ablaze and destroyed. Hours later, the rebels marked another historic milestone as HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani arrived in Damascus and kissed the ground. Shortly before his arrival, al-Golani delivered his first televised address on Syrian state TV, now controlled by the rebels. Once Assad’s propaganda machine, the channel broadcast al-Golani’s declaration: 'There is no turning back—we are determined to continue the path we started in 2011. The future is ours.' The fall of Assad marks a stunning conclusion to 13 years of civil war, which until recently seemed to have solidified his grip on power. The uprising against Assad began in March 2011 during the Arab Spring, but by 2015, he had lost control of most of Syria. With support from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Assad regained territory and confined the rebels to the Idlib province in northwest Syria. More than 500,000 people were killed in the conflict, and millions of Syrians were displaced as refugees within Syria or abroad. Since 2020, Syria’s battle lines had remained largely stagnant, and Assad had regained legitimacy among many Arab and Islamic countries that previously shunned him. His survival was seen as a remarkable comeback. However, in a dramatic and unforeseen turn of events, Syrian rebels launched an offensive from Idlib into neighboring Aleppo province just 10 days ago, mere hours after a cease-fire between Israel and a weakened Hezbollah took effect. Within nine days, they captured Syria’s three largest cities—Aleppo, Hama and Homs—before advancing to Damascus and toppling the regime. This marked the end of 54 years of Assad family rule. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjccrpqeye	2024-12-08T09:54:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/25/SyaPh9yKR/SyaPh9yKR_0_96_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Northern Gaza sees fewer clashes as IDF tightens grip on Jabaliya	Hamas resistance in Jabaliya weakens as IDF’s 162nd Division nears end of two-month operation, including raids targeting terrorists and tunnels, with 60 terrorists eliminated over weekend; fate of 70,000 displaced Gazans remains uncertain as destruction mounts Resistance of Hamas terrorists against Israel's 162nd Division during its extended raid in northern Gaza is steadily crumbling. Over the past week, the number of clashes and firefights has hit its lowest point since the IDF entered Jabaliya two months ago. This operation, spearheaded by three brigade combat teams—401st Armored Brigade, Givati Brigade and Kfir Brigade—is now closer to its conclusion than its beginning. Yet, one critical question remains: will the IDF allow tens of thousands of displaced Gaza residents, evacuated from areas like Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, to return to their destroyed homes? So far, even in neighborhoods where operations have concluded, the army has refrained from permitting any civilians to return. If a decision to allow them back is made, international accusations of 'ethnic cleansing' could arise, though similar situations have already occurred in other areas, such as the expanded Philadelphi Corridor near Rafah and the widened Netzarim buffer zone. These areas not only divide northern and southern Gaza but have also rendered the homes of thousands of Palestinians unrecognizable. From southern neighborhoods of Gaza City to central towns like Bureij and Nuseirat, homes haven’t just been reduced to rubble—they’ve been completely obliterated, leaving vast expanses flattened by Israeli forces. The next major test in Jabaliya will center around the 'small buffer corridor' established by Israel specifically for this raid. This corridor, permanently manned by IDF troops, begins at a large forward logistics base near the coast, close to the village of Al-Atatra. This base was recently reestablished after being used for the same purpose during a maneuver last year. From there, the corridor stretches east to the Israel-Gaza border, running between Kibbutz Erez and the Black Arrow Monument, cutting through the northern third of the Gaza Strip. Should the IDF maintain its presence there in the coming month, much like it did in the expanded Netzarim buffer zone earlier this year, and possibly even widen it for 'operational needs and troop security,' it is likely that 70,000 Gaza residents will remain displaced indefinitely. This would mirror the situation of approximately one million residents of Gaza City and its surrounding areas, who have been unable to return to their homes since the war began, now living in southern Gaza's humanitarian zones. On the battlefield, IDF is steadily dismantling the last pockets of Hamas resistance in Jabaliya, particularly in the city’s adjacent refugee camp. Increasingly effective operations are being conducted with smaller numbers of troops. For instance, over the weekend, a joint force from the 9th Armored Battalion and the Givati Reconnaissance Unit launched a surprise raid on a terrorist hideout within the refugee camp. According to the 162nd Division, approximately 60 Hamas terrorists were eliminated in this operation through coordinated airstrikes and direct ground fire, all within a few hours. 'We’re conducting surprise raids that deliver swift results, systematically dismantling the enemy while leveraging the extensive operational experience of our commanders at all levels,' IDF said. Even as the Jabaliya raid nears its conclusion, operations maintain their rigorous structure: soldiers involved in the raid are rotated out regularly for rest, including time at home, with entire battalions replaced one at a time.

'During the operation, dozens of booby-trapped shafts and a significant number of explosives were destroyed in the area. Forces uncovered and demolished an extensive underground tunnel network stretching hundreds of meters, which Hamas terrorists used to launch attacks against our troops,' the IDF said in a statement. 'Inside the tunnels, we uncovered blast-resistant doors, living quarters and RPG launchers used for terror activities. During the operation, forces encountered terrorists emerging from the tunnels to fire anti-tank missiles. Using coordinated ground and air strikes, the forces successfully eliminated the attackers.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylya47e1l	2024-12-08T08:46:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/04/SJ1111bViTXkg/SJ1111bViTXkg_150_196_1341_755_0_small.jpg
Jihadist leader proclaims victory in Damascus: 'We have defeated ...	Abu Mohammed al-Golani, leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, declares, 'No turning back' after Assad's fall; curfew in place amid unrest, while Iran calls for calm, and Ukraine mocks Russia: 'Dictators who bet on Putin will fall' The fall of Bashar Assad’s regime marked another historic milestone Sunday as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, leader of the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), arrived in Damascus and kissed the ground. His group spearheaded the stunning campaign that toppled Assad, ending a 13-year civil war. Shortly before his arrival, al-Golani delivered his first televised address on Syrian state TV, now controlled by the rebels. Once Assad’s propaganda machine, the channel broadcast al-Golani’s declaration: 'There is no turning back—we are determined to continue the path we started in 2011. The future is ours.' Rebels also aired their first news bulletin on state television, proclaiming victory: 'To those who once thought we were broken, we announce from Syria’s news channel the victory of the great Syrian revolution after 13 years of patience and sacrifice. We have defeated Assad, the criminal.' A curfew imposed by the rebels took effect Sunday afternoon, restricting movement in Damascus from 4 p.m. to 5 a.m. Streets began to empty as the deadline approached, though sporadic gunfire could still be heard. Concerns of security chaos loom large. Earlier in the day, anti-Assad forces stormed the homes and palaces of regime officials, including the Iranian embassy in Damascus, looting and causing significant damage. Islamist fighters also broke into the residence of Italy’s ambassador, fired shots at the walls and searched for Assad loyalists before leaving with three stolen cars. Embassy staff were unharmed. With Assad ousted, Syria’s future remains uncertain. The opposition is fragmented, comprising a wide array of factions with conflicting interests and ideologies. Fears are mounting that the country could descend into further violence. Hadi al-Bahra, leader of the Syrian opposition-in-exile in Qatar and head of the Syrian National Coalition, called for an 18-month transitional period to establish stability. 'We must create a safe, neutral and calm atmosphere to allow free elections,' he said. Al-Bahra proposed drafting a constitution within six months, followed by a referendum to determine the governance structure—whether parliamentary, presidential or mixed. 'Based on that framework, we will hold elections, and the people will choose their leaders,' he said. Russia claims Assad resigned and 'left Instructions' Russia announced that Assad had resigned and left the country, framing his departure as a responsible decision to transfer power peacefully. According to a Russian Foreign Ministry statement, Assad’s resignation came after negotiations with various factions in the Syrian conflict. 'Assad decided to step down, leave Syria, and provide guidance for a peaceful transition of power. Russia did not participate in these negotiations,' the ministry said. Moscow added that all Russian military bases in Syria are on high alert and urged all parties to refrain from violence and pursue peaceful resolutions. This development marks a significant blow to both Russia and Iran, Assad’s chief allies. Russia, which has portrayed itself as a steadfast protector of its allies over the past decade, is now facing questions about its reliability, particularly as its focus remains on the war in Ukraine. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump remarked Sunday morning that 'Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer.' Ukraine’s foreign ministry also took a celebratory tone, saying, 'Dictators who bet on Putin will fall.' Iran suffers strategic loss The fall of Assad’s regime is being viewed as a major defeat for Iran, which relied on Syria as a primary smuggling corridor for weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon and as a staging ground for its militias near Israel’s border. A senior advisor to the president of the UAE said that Iran’s 'deterrence concept has been shattered by events in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria,' though he emphasized that Iran remains an important regional actor with whom dialogue is necessary. Earlier in the day, pro-Iranian militias reportedly withdrew from Syria to Iraq, and Lebanese sources told Reuters that Hezbollah forces had also exited Syria, marking the end of their decade-long presence in the country. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: An official in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told The New York Times that the fall of Assad’s rule was a 'Berlin wall moment' for Tehran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' which includes Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Houthis and other Iranian-backed terrorist groups in the region. A U.S. official similarly told CNN that the events in Syria signify the collapse of Iran’s strategy across the Middle East. Tehran’s Foreign Ministry released its first official response midday, emphasizing respect for Syria’s sovereignty and unity. 'Determining Syria’s future is a matter for the Syrian people alone,' the statement read. Iran called for an immediate end to armed conflict, the prevention of terrorist activities and the initiation of inclusive national dialogue. Despite its loss, Iran vowed to maintain its long-standing ties with Syria, describing them as 'based on wisdom and far-reaching vision.' The statement added that Iran would continue efforts to help stabilize Syria and would monitor developments closely. Macron celebrates Assad’s fall: ‘At last, the barbaric regime is over’ The Assad regime’s downfall was completed early Sunday as rebels, led by HTS, seized full control of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city, before advancing to Damascus and capturing the capital. Hours later, the rebels issued their first televised statement: 'We have liberated Damascus, toppled the Assad regime and freed all those unjustly imprisoned.' Rebels were filmed entering Assad’s palace in Damascus for the first time, removing portraits of Hezbollah’s slain leader Hassan Nasrallah and Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani from the Iranian embassy, and later ransacking and vandalizing the building. In central Damascus, crowds tore down a statue of Hafez Assad, Bashar Assad’s father and former president. By midday, reports confirmed that the reception hall of the presidential palace had been set ablaze and destroyed. The fall of Assad marks a stunning conclusion to 13 years of civil war, which until recently seemed to have solidified his grip on power. The uprising against Assad began in March 2011 during the Arab Spring, but by 2015, he had lost control of most of Syria. With support from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Assad regained territory and confined the rebels to the Idlib province in northwest Syria. More than 500,000 people were killed in the conflict, and millions of Syrians were displaced as refugees within Syria or abroad. Since 2020, Syria’s battle lines had remained largely stagnant, and Assad had regained legitimacy among many Arab and Islamic countries that previously shunned him. His survival was seen as a remarkable comeback. However, in a dramatic and unforeseen turn of events, Syrian rebels launched an offensive from Idlib into neighboring Aleppo province just 10 days ago, mere hours after a cease-fire between Israel and a weakened Hezbollah took effect. Within nine days, they captured Syria’s three largest cities—Aleppo, Hama and Homs—before advancing to Damascus and toppling the regime. This marked the end of 54 years of Assad family rule. Leaders across Europe hailed Assad’s downfall while expressing concerns about Syria’s future. French President Emmanuel Macron declared, 'At last, the barbaric regime is over. I salute the Syrian people for their courage and patience.' European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas described Assad’s fall as 'a long-awaited positive development,' while Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called it 'a huge relief for millions in Syria,' but warned against the country falling into the hands of extremists, 'regardless of their guise.' In Washington, President Joe Biden was briefed by his national security team on what the White House called 'extraordinary developments in Syria.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk5unhmeye	2024-12-08T08:38:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/Hy3iaE7Nyx/Hy3iaE7Nyx_0_162_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF deploys troops to Golan buffer zone amid security concerns	The IDF announced Sunday that its 'defensive and temporary' deployment in the Golan Heights buffer zone stems from the movement of unidentified armed Syrians in the area over the weekend. The military said the action aims to eliminate potential threats. 'We monitored developments in Syria and coordinated with other forces in the region to avoid friction. This is a monumental and dramatic event,' the IDF said in a statement. Troops are reportedly securing key vantage points on the Syrian side of the border fence to enhance security.
