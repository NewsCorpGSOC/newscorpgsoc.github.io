IDF releases names of 4 reserve soldiers killed in Lebanon clashe...	Major (res.) Eliav Amram Abitbol, Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, Captain (res.) Amit Chayut and Master Sergeant (res.) Gilad Elmaliach all served at the 8207th Battalion The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported on Sunday that four reserve soldiers were killed in action in southern Lebanon as part of Israel's ground operation against Hezbollah. They are: Major (res.) Eliav Amram Abitbol, 36, from Eitan, a Company Deputy Commander in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade; Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, 43, from Jerusalem, a Military Rabbi in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade; Captain (res.) Amit Chayut, 29, from Haifa, a Platoon Commander in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade and Master Sergeant (res.) Gilad Elmaliach, 30, from Jerusalem, a soldier in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade. Three additional reserve soldiers and one soldier in compulsory service from the 8207th Battalion were severely injured, alongside a combat engineering officer from the 228th Brigade. 'The soldiers fell and were injured in a battle with terrorists in southern Lebanon. The details of the battle are under investigation,' The IDF said in a statement. 'Amit was a wonderful person with a heart of gold' Captain (Res.) Amit Hayut, 29, from Haifa, was killed in a battle in southern Lebanon. 'Our hearts are broken; Amit was a wonderful person with a heart of gold, a cheerful, responsible and noble man. He was always surrounded by friends,' his brother Dvir said. Amit was the son of Tzippi and Yehoshua and the youngest in his family. After his studies, he attended a year-and-a-half-long pre-military program and enlisted in the Golani Brigade. He completed a commanders' course with honors. Amit had a partner named Shiri, also a resident of Haifa, and his family said that the couple planned to get married. 'He completed over 300 days in the reserves. He had been serving in the north since October 7 and we knew he was now in southern Lebanon,' his brother said. 'The last time we talked with him was when he took a short break during Sukkot a week and a half ago. He returned on Saturday and we hadn't heard from him since he entered Lebanon,' he recounted. A day after Rosh Hashanah, Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Everyone has left their families and children, eager to go out to Your war, fighting to save brothers from the threat of murder. How many tears and hearts and souls and eyes have been poured out to You! Approaching the Holy Ark, filled with awe, with an incredible sense of mission and You will hear their cry from the heavens and their plea for help.' 'Their cries are here, calling out before You, and You will fight their battles for them, that they may not falter with their weapons, nor fail in their running, nor be frightened by the fire of the enemy and You will uproot the government of evil from the land!' The Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot published a statement mourning the loss of Master Sergeant (res.) Gilad Elmaliach, saying: 'The Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot, its rabbis, students and alumni mourn the death of our alumnus Gilad Elmaliach, in the battle for the revival of Israel and in defense of the northern border. Our hearts and prayers go out to his wife, children and family.'

Israel miscalculates will of Iranians, supreme leader says	In his first response to the Israeli attack on Iran's military targets including its aerial defenses, Al Khamenei says the response must be determined by the best interests of the Iranian people people Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that Israel made a mistake when it attacked Iran. Speaking for the first time since the Israeli strike on Iranian military targets early on Saturday, Khamenei said Israel miscalculated and must understand the will of the Iranian people. 'The evil committed by the Zionist regime (Israel) two nights ago should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated', Khamenei said. He said Iran's power should be demonstrated to Israel, adding that the way to do so should be 'determined by the officials and that which is in the best interest of the people and the country should take place.' An Iranian official told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper that Iran maintains the right to defend itself against any aggression. 'Whether its response would be immediate is unclear and the decision will be made based on security and political considerations and the conditions in the region,' the official said adding that Iran prefers to preserve its territorial integrity rather than engaging with Israel's plans to alter the regional order and break up the 'axis of resistance.' The security cabinet is scheduled to meet later on Sunday to discuss the strike on Iran, its results and a possible Iranian response.

British man sentenced to 12 years in prison for encouraging terro...	Gabriel Budasz, 24, was convicted on four counts of encouraging terrorism, including against Jews; The investigation began after the British Jewish security organization CST collected evidence from his social media accounts Gabriel Budasz, 24, who encouraged his followers on social media to carry out acts of terrorism - including against Jews in the country - was sentenced to 12 years in prison in Britain. He was convicted of four counts of encouraging terrorism, one count of distributing terrorist propaganda and one count of sending an electronic message with intent to cause distress or anxiety. Budasz, who was born in Poland and lived in Weston-super-Mare, in North Somerset, UK, published detailed instructions on how to make explosives from readily available household items, and created a plastic gun using a 3D printer. Judge Brian Forster wrote in the sentence, published Thursday: 'The evidence reveals that you had a clear interest in white supremacy, other terrorists including Brenton Tarrant, and massacres, including the shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand.' The judge later said: 'You also posted on Twitter: 'I'm going to build a bomb'. You distributed instructions on how to build a bomb, with the intention of encouraging terrorism.' Among the materials Budasz posted online was a video of him wearing clothes similar to the outfit Trent wore the day he live-streamed the 2019 murder of 51 Muslims at two Christchurch mosques. 'You said things like 'kill the Jews, kill the political leaders'. You also encouraged the need to take action,' Judge Forster added. Budasz posted a video on Telegram with 'horrifying and graphic' footage and gave instructions on how to torture and eventually murder a victim with a knife. The British Jewish security organization CST began investigating the defendant's online activity in September 2022. The organization said they collected evidence from Budasz's social media accounts, and handed the evidence over to counter-terrorism police in the summer of 2023. Budasz was arrested on August 1, 2023. During his trial, Budasz claimed that the videos he posted online were meant to be funny, from the point of view of a 'comedic' far-right figure. However, Judge Forster said that 'there is no direct connection between Budasz's mental disorder and his crimes.' During a search of Budasz s home in August 2023, various items of a far-right nature were seized books, masks and memorabilia, as well as a 3D-printed firearm.

Israel mulls expansion of Lebanon offensive	Forces operating in South Lebanon find massive amounts of weapons and ammunition placed in advanced of a planned invasion of the Galilee; commanders on the ground push for more time The IDF began expanding its operations in South Lebanon into the second line of towns and villages some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the border with Israel, after finding massive stores of Iranian and Russian-made weapons and ammunition in every home. Initially, the IDF said publicly and ensured the U.S. that it would limit its offensive to removing the threat of an invasion of the Galilee by Hezbollah's Radwan force, in an area containing up to 20 Shiite villages, spread along the 130-kilometer (81-mile) frontier. A decision to continue to expand the offensive to include up to 70 villages and towns would depend on the government, the rising number of casualties and the urging of military commanders on the ground, to allow them to fight on. The military believes there are between 5,000 and 10,000 well-maintained weapons in every village, put there to await Hezbollah's planned invasion. According to the IDF, it is easier for infantry troops operating in South Lebanon to capture members of the Radwan Force, because of their ability to maneuver quietly, in the terrain. Tanks and APCs are more exposed to Hezbollah's attacks. Troops have also begun using the weapons and ammunition found in the villages, that would eventually have to be destroyed. On Saturday, a controlled detonation of some 400 tons of explosives, triggered earthquake warnings.

Russian plane lands in Israel for possible mediation effort with ...	Israeli officials refuse to comment on an aircraft from Moscow, which landed in the country as reports suggest the Kremlin is negotiating the release of Israeli-Russian hostages in Gaza A Russian aircraft landed in Israel on Thursday afternoon and later headed back to Moscow for reasons that are currently not clear. Officials denied reports a Russian delegation arrived in the country to negotiate the release of two Israeli-Russian captives held by Hamas: Alexander (Sahsa) Trufanov and Maxim Herkin. Hamas' deputy politburo head Mousa Abu Marzouk visited Moscow on the same day and spoke with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov about their release. Abu Marzouk said that the two Russian citizens would be a high priority for release in any future deal with the terror group. The Russian arrival in Israel raised several questions: Why did a Russian plane connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin arrive? Was its arrival related to the delivery of messages from Israel to Iran via Russia or was it an attempt by Putin to mediate between Israel and Iran? Did Russia convey Israel's messages to Iran, clarifying that nuclear facilities would not be targeted but military sites would be and that Israel would retaliate harshly should Iran attack again? Israeli officials declined to comment on the plane's landing, leaving answers unclear. The Tu-214SR aircraft that landed in Israel is part of the special 'Russia' flight unit, which is under Putin's administration. Russian media reported the plane had previously landed at Ben Gurion Airport on October 17. The reports added that Hezbollah temporarily halted its rocket fire into Israeli territory for several hours during the Russian plane's stay. During a weekend press conference, Putin said that Israel faced a terrorist attack last year, but that its response was disproportionate and cannot be forgiven. 'No person on Earth can help but feel their heart bleed when they see what is happening in the Gaza Strip,' Putin said. He suggested that the war could be resolved via the establishment of a Palestinian state, adding that Russia 'is in close contact with Iran.' He also stressed Russia's intention to resolve Tehran's conflict with Israel based on compromises. 'Russia has been attempting to mediate between Iran and Israel for several weeks now,' social activist Alex Tenzer, who monitors Russian media, said. 'This is evident from Putin's words and meetings between Russia's Bogdanov and Israel's ambassador to Russia. Russia is trying to preserve its interests in the Middle East which are steadily deteriorating as Iran loses power.'

Satellite images show aftermath of Israel strike on secret Iran b...	Images show damage to Parchin missile production site; expert says even if key materials removed before strikes building would have provided 'intrinsic value for future nuclear weapons-related activities. An American researcher said an Israeli airstrike on Saturday hit a building that was part of Iran's defunct nuclear weapons development program, and he and another researcher said facilities used to mix solid fuel for missiles also were struck. The assessments based on commercial satellite imagery were reached separately by David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector, and Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a Washington think tank. They told Reuters that Israel struck buildings in Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran. Israel also hit Khojir, according to Eveleth, a sprawling missile production site near Tehran. Reuters reported in July that Khojir was undergoing massive expansion. Eveleth said the Israeli strikes may have 'significantly hampered Iran's ability to mass produce missiles.' The Israeli military said three waves of Israeli jets struck missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran early on Saturday in retaliation for Tehran's Oct. 1 barrage of more than 200 missiles against Israel. Iran's military said the Israeli warplanes used 'very light warheads' to strike border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and around Tehran. In posts on X, Albright said commercial satellite imagery showed that Israel hit a building in Parchin called Taleghan 2 that was used for testing activities during the Amad Plan, Iran's defunct nuclear weapons development program. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and U.S. intelligence say Iran shuttered the program in 2003. Iran denies pursuing nuclear weapons. Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security research group, was given access to the program's files for a book after they were stolen from Tehran by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency in 2018. On X, he said the archives revealed that Iran kept important test equipment in Taleghan 2. Iran may have removed key materials before the airstrike, he said, but 'even if no equipment remained inside' the building would have provided 'intrinsic value' for future nuclear weapons-related activities. Albright told Reuters that commercial satellite imagery of Parchin showed Israel damaged three buildings about 350 yards (320 m) from Taleghan 2, including two in which solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed. He did not identify the commercial firm from which he obtained the images. Eveleth said an image of Parchin from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, showed that Israel destroyed three ballistic missile solid fuel mixing buildings and a warehouse in the sprawling complex. Planet Labs imagery also showed that an Israeli strike destroyed two buildings in the Khojir complex where solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed, he said. The buildings were enclosed by high dirt berms, according to the image reviewed by Reuters. Such structures are associated with missile production and are designed to stop a blast in one building from detonating combustible materials in nearby structures. 'Israel says they targeted buildings housing solid-fuel mixers,' Eveleth said. 'These industrial mixers are hard to make and export-controlled. Iran imported many over the years at great expense, and will likely have a hard time replacing them.' With a limited operation, he said, Israel may have struck a significant blow against Iran's ability to mass-produce missiles and made it more difficult for any future Iranian missile attack to pierce Israel's missile defenses. 'The strikes appear to be highly accurate,' he said. Axios reported that Israel destroyed hit 12 'planetary mixers' used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, quoting three unnamed Israeli sources as saying this severely damages Iran's ability to renew its missile stockpile and could deter Iran from further massive missile strikes against Israel. Iran has the Middle East's largest missile arsenal and supplied missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine, and to Yemen's Houthi rebels and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, according to U.S. officials. Tehran and Moscow deny that Russia has received Iranian missiles. Planet Labs imagery reviewed earlier this year by Eveleth and Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey showed major expansions at Khojir and the Modarres military complex near Tehran that the pair assessed were for boosting missile production, Reuters reported. Three senior Iranian officials confirmed that conclusion.

Iran's vulnerability after Israel's attack concerning, officials ...	After Israel takes out Iranian aid defense systems protecting critical oil, petrochemical and gas sites sources say Iran's respond must be carefully considered because of the risks posed by another Israeli strike Israel's attack on Iranian air defenses early on Saturday has raised deep alarm in Iran, according to three Iranian officials who spoke to the New York Times. They protected several critical oil and petrochemical refineries and a large gas field and a major port in southern Iran, critical energy, and economic hubs, leaving them vulnerable to attack if the exchanges of blows between the two countries continue. The sites include Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex, in Khuzestan Province; the major economic port Bandar Imam Khomeini, adjacent to it; and at the Abadan oil refinery, the refinery for the gas field, called Tange Bijar, in Ilam Province, according to the officials, one of them with Iran’s oil ministry. Hamid Hosseini, an expert on Iran's oil and gas industry and a member of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce said Israel was sending a clear message to Iran. 'This can have very serious economic consequences for Iran, and now that we understand the stakes we need to act wise and not continue the tensions.' Iranian and Israeli officials told the paper that four Russian S-300 systems were destroyed in addition to those attacked last April when Israel attacked Iran in response to the Iranian missile and drone attack. 'This looks like a potential preamble to a much more effective strike against Iran’s infrastructure and even nuclear sites,' said Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group. 'Iranians don’t have the capacity to replace these systems in a timely manner, which renders the country much more vulnerable in future tit for tats.' In addition to the aerial defenses, the sources said, the Israeli strike also targeted three large missile production bases: Falagh, Shaid Ghadiri and Abdol Fath, which belong to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and military sites in Parchin and Parand, using drones. While Israeli officials said the attack disrupted Iran's ability to produce missiles, the Iranians said the damage was minimal and production would resume quickly. The Iranian military said four of its soldiers who operated the defense systems were killed. Local media said the number of fatalities was expected to rise. Two of the soldiers were from the city of Mahshahr, near the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex. Two Israeli officials said the initial plan of attack, prepared soon after Iran's October 1 ballistic missile strike, included attacks on Iran's energy industry and nuclear program. But the Biden administration urged Israel to avoid those targets, out of concern that they would prompt a severe response that would destabilize the world's economy and drag the United States into a regional war. Iranian officials including Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said repeatedly in interviews and to their Arab counterparts that those targets would be a red flag and if attacked, Iran would respond forcefully. Agraghchi also sent a letter to the UN on Saturday urging the condemnation of Israel and calling its attack 'unlawful and aggressive' and 'against the sovereignty and territorial integrity' of Iran. Iran's military claimed it successfully thwarted most of the Israeli attacks on its air defenses. In a statement the military said Israeli fighter jets did not enter Iran's airspace and fired missiles and drones from the airspace over Iraq. The force also accused the United States of complicity in 'the crime,' while Washington denied taking any part in the attack. Three Israeli officials told the New York Times that command and control sites and a radar, were also targeted. Israel believes those were damaged severely and were put out of use. One of the officials said that satellite images after the attack showed that only the defense systems at the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex were hit and not the complex itself. Iran's supreme council met for an emergency session on Sunday and was briefed by military commanders about the damage and the targets that were attacked. Three Iranian officials told the paper that the council discussed how Iran would respond but said no decision was reached. Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei has the authority to order an attack on Israel, in his role as supreme military commander. He is expected to issue a statement later on Sunday.

IDF deception tactics leave Iran weighing its next move	Israeli officials anticipate Iranian response, though specifics remain unclear, while US sources suggest Tehran may hold back; reports indicate high-level discussions in Iran, with its vice president saying response would come 'at appropriate time' Operation Days of Repentance, the Israeli response to Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack, targeted advanced Iranian air defense systems and missile production facilities following. According to sources, over 100 aircraft participated, focusing on gaining air superiority for future operations and disrupting Iran’s missile capabilities. Foreign reports indicated that Israel struck critical missile production components, including high-value planetary mixers essential to Iran’s missile program. The operation involved advanced maneuvers and deceptive tactics to enter Iranian airspace, with Israeli forces also targeting anti-aircraft batteries in Syria intended to shield Iranian facilities. Damage assessments are ongoing, with Israeli officials indicating it may take days to determine the full impact. According to opposition-aligned news outlet Iran International, F-35 jets also took part in the elaborate operation. As Tehran weighs its response, assessments of its likely course vary. While senior American officials suggested in comments to Ynet that Iran may hold off on retaliation, Israeli sources expect a response, though the timing remains unknown. According to Reuters, citing two regional sources briefed by Iran, Tehran held high-level meetings to determine the scale of its reaction to the strikes. One source described the damage as 'minimal,' though noted several Revolutionary Guard bases around Tehran were impacted. Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref, visiting Hamas headquarters in Tehran, issued a warning, saying, 'The aggressor should await a response; we will respond at the appropriate time.' Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking in conversations with Qatari, Saudi and Egyptian counterparts, urged international action to prevent further regional conflict, stressing Iran’s 'unlimited' commitment to its territorial defense. However, he refrained from mentioning a direct act of retaliation. In a statement, Iran’s military confirmed its right to respond but also called for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, a message AP analysts interpreted as a signal to avoid further escalation. The Iranian military alleged that Israel used U.S.-controlled airspace in Iraq to approach its targets near Tehran and along borders in Ilam and Khuzestan provinces. Several female navigators took part in the overnight sorties, as has been seen in similar operations previously. Major General Aviad Dagan, who is set to assume the role of head of the IDF’s Telecommunications Division, also joined the missions as a navigator. Dagan, a former commander of the Hatzerim Airbase, was among the experienced reservists participating, as more than 60% of the pilots involved in the operation were reserve forces. Israeli sources, meanwhile, indicated the operation struck a significant strategic blow to Iran, reducing its defense capabilities. 'If Iran chooses to respond, it risks a much stronger action, as its defense systems are now severely weakened,' an Israeli official said, adding, 'they are completely exposed.' 'This wasn’t a minor strike; it was a strategic blow and proof that Israel no longer fears Iran,' said another official. 'Israel did not aim for containment but was prepared for escalation, while Iran chose to retreat. The regime is downplaying the attack and may try to spin the narrative, but they know the reality.'

Can Qatar and Egypt’s rivalry drive a breakthrough hostage deal?	Mossad chief set to meet CIA director and Qatari PM in Doha create framework for potential deal; Qatar, noting Cairo’s increased involvement, aims to stay central in talks; US officials believe major breakthrough may only come after US elections Mossad head David Barnea will head to Doha on Sunday to join CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani for a summit focused on resuming hostage negotiations. The talks aim to reignite discussions on a potential hostage exchange deal, despite U.S. officials reportedly believing that any major agreement would likely be deferred until after the U.S. presidential election in early November. Egyptian intelligence head Hassan Rashad, who met with a Hamas delegation in Cairo over the weekend, is not expected to attend the summit, though Hamas could join the negotiations later. This meeting marks the first in Doha since the August summit and comes after the elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, a move Israel saw as removing a major obstacle to a deal. Israeli officials are cautiously optimistic, noting that a restrained Iranian response to Israel’s overnight attacks could shift Hamas’ focus away from regional conflict and back to negotiation. In recent weeks, Israeli and American officials, including Barnea, have coordinated behind the scenes to draft a framework that considers recent shifts in regional dynamics. CIA Director Burns hopes to use this momentum to push for consensus on a renewed framework. A proposed 'mini-deal' from Egypt that would release four hostages in exchange for a temporary two-week ceasefire is also under discussion. Encouraged by various recent developments—including Sinwar's assassination, Hamas’s engagement with Egyptian officials, and Hezbollah’s weakened position—Israel believes the timing is ideal for negotiations. With both Qatar and Egypt vying for influence in facilitating a potential deal, Israel hopes the Doha summit will align the Qatari and Egyptian frameworks into a unified proposal. The summit's outcome may hinge on U.S. pressure on Qatar, which Israel sees as capable of applying strong leverage on Hamas but thus far has refrained from doing so. An Israeli official emphasized that time is critical in resolving the hostage situation, adding, 'We are committed to advancing a deal as quickly as possible.'

More than 100 Israeli aircraft of various models participated in the overnight strike on Iran, targeting advanced air defense systems, military sources told Ynet Saturday night. The operation aimed to establish aerial superiority, potentially allowing Israeli fighter jets to conduct future low-altitude flights over Tehran, the sources said. Damage assessments from the strikes may take several days, given the scale and complexity of the targets involved. Meanwhile, Israeli forces destroyed anti-aircraft batteries in Syria early Saturday that were reportedly designated to assist Iran’s defenses against air incursions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sygrqn5eyx	2024-10-26T11:53:52-07:00	
Report: Israel struck Iran’s solid-fuel missile plant, disrupting...	Saudi media reports strike took facility completely offline, destroying around 20 heavy fuel mixers, each worth estimated $2 million; sources familiar with Iran’s missile industry say site will likely require at least 2 years to resume operations Israel targeted an Iranian solid-fuel plant crucial to the production of Kheibar and Qasem ballistic missiles, which were fired at Israel earlier this month, Saudi news site Elaph reported on Saturday, citing an informed source. According to the Saudi news outlet, which often receives security information from Israel, the strike is said to have taken the facility completely offline, destroying around 20 heavy fuel mixers, each worth an estimated $2 million. Sources familiar with Iran’s missile industry told Elaph that the facility will likely require at least two years to resume operations. Solid-fuel missiles, produced using these mixers, allow greater precision and defense advantages by avoiding the need for visible refueling seen with liquid-fuel systems. The solid-fuel propulsion improves both strike accuracy and durability, offering precision within a meter and increasing resilience against interception. Earlier, The New York Times reported that Israel targeted a 'critical component' in Iran’s long-range missile production facilities. Israeli sources described the strike on Iran's surface-to-surface missile production facilities as a 'strategic blow' that would severely hamper Tehran's missile manufacturing capabilities for years to come 'With the added damage to Iran’s air defense systems, the message is clear,' an Israeli official familiar with the strike said Saturday evening, warning that any Iranian retaliation 'risks an even stronger response, with weakened defenses that leave them vulnerable.' Struck with US coordination An official reported that the Israeli strike was coordinated with the United States, targeting missile production sites rather than oil or nuclear facilities, per a U.S. request. 'Both countries agreed on strategic military targets,' the official said, adding that the operation weakened Iran’s missile production and complicated its ability to supply weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Despite reports that Arab and European nations issued warnings to Tehran, Israel refrained from notifying Iran ahead of the strike. The operation included three waves targeting surface-to-surface missile factories, a move the official described as a 'strategic blow' and a clear message that 'the fear of Iran has ended.' Iran responded by downplaying the impact, though Israeli officials claim the strike caused severe damage to Iran’s air defenses and ballistic missile capabilities. Another senior Israeli source noted, 'Israel’s intelligence and Air Force operated in Iran as they saw fit, leaving Iran’s leadership to face the new reality.' The official also remarked that while Israeli public opinion often expects dramatic displays, the high level of U.S.-Israeli cooperation on security matters weighed heavily on operational decisions. The Security Cabinet unanimously approved the operation in a one-hour phone meeting, with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir emphasizing that 'this strike is an opening move against Iran’s strategic assets, a necessary step to counter the Iranian threat to Israel.'

IDF detonates 400 tons of explosives in Hezbollah bunker, rocking...	Built over 15 years, site larger than similar Gaza facilities and held supplies and weaponry to support two battalions; some launch bases may still be undiscovered The IDF on Saturday detonated approximately 400 metric tons of explosives to destroy a major underground Hezbollah facility in Lebanon, reportedly built over the past 15 years. The site, said to be the largest underground Hezbollah base neutralized by Israel to date, was operated by the terrorist group's elite Radwan Force and contained dozens of rooms and armories designed to support as many as two battalions consisting of hundreds of fighters, the IDF said. According to the military, the complex was over 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) long and equipped for extended stays with beds, food, storage units, anti-tank missiles, rockets, RPGs, mines and explosive devices. Forces from the 98th Division, the elite combat engineering Yahalom Unit and other specialized IDF units carried out the operation. At least two Hezbollah operatives were killed, while others reportedly escaped through a tunnel exit leading into the mountainside. The powerful blast triggered minor tremors, measured at a magnitude of 4.5 in northern Israel's Galilee region. To ensure safety during the explosion, Israeli troops were instructed to move about a mile from the blast zone.

Iran’s military alleged on Saturday that Israeli aircraft launched its overnight strike using airspace managed by U.S. forces in Iraq, approximately 60 miles from the Iranian border. The military claimed the strike targeted radar installations in Ilam and Khuzestan provinces, as well as areas near Tehran, causing minimal damage in some locations with repairs ongoing at others. In a statement, Iran condemned the 'violation of international law' and maintained it has the 'legal and legitimate right' to respond. Officials also renewed calls for a lasting cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1jwsjceje	2024-10-26T10:28:12-07:00	
Tehran resumes normalcy after Israeli strikes amid public fears, ...	Iran downplays impact of overnight attack, with state media emphasizing normalcy across capital and country; while some residents scoff at Israel's capabilities, others worried about potential Middle East conflagration Tehran sought to return to normal Saturday following a night of explosions from Israeli airstrikes, which Israel conducted in response to an earlier missile attack against it this month. Iranians returned to work, cafes and the streets as state media downplayed the attack’s impact. Officials emphasized that schools and sports events continued as scheduled. In Tehran’s streets, reactions ranged from indifference to unease over potential escalation with Israel. Some residents, like Houman, 42, who heard explosions while working his night shift, expressed anxiety about being drawn into a broader regional conflict. 'It was an echoing, dreadful sound,' he told AFP. 'There is now a war in the Middle East, and we fear being dragged into it.' Another resident, Moharram, 51, voiced concern that Tehran could face stronger retaliation from Israel if the conflict escalates. Flights over Iranian airspace were briefly halted following the strike but later resumed. Iranian media reassured citizens that Israel caused only 'limited damage,' crediting the Islamic Republic’s air defenses for containing the threat. Throughout the day, Iranian television showed scenes of regular traffic across major cities, stressing that life was carrying on uninterrupted. One broadcast featured residents singing and dancing atop a Tehran building during the strike, taunting Israel. Sepideh, 30, a Tehran insurance manager, described waking up and heading to work as usual. 'War is frightening, but I don’t think it will come to that here,' she told AFP. Another Tehran resident told Reuters, 'War harms ordinary people, and we’re already suffering.' Others conveyed defiance, with resident Hana Avniki saying the limited scale of the strike suggests Israeli caution. 'Some worry about further clashes, inflation and issues piling up—but it hasn’t affected my life yet,' she said, adding, 'If it continues, that will change.' One Tehranian was more direct: 'If by ‘attack’ Israel means last night’s firecrackers that didn’t even wake up anyone in Tehran, that’s their ‘power’—then shame on them.' Another resident dismissed concerns, saying, 'The Israeli regime is doomed, disappearing automatically without any need for an Iranian response.'

Hezbollah fires 125 rockets in 2 hours as IDF seizes launcher tru...	Terror group continues heavy rocket fire on northern Israel, launching 150 rockets since morning as IDF ramps up operations in Lebanon; army reports destroying launcher used in strikes on Majd al-Krum; fire crews tackling multiple blazes Hezbollah launched about 125 rockets toward northern Israel Saturday afternoon, with 150 total launched by 5 p.m., the IDF reported, amid a continued barrage that has persisted despite intensified Israeli operations against the terrorist group. The escalation follows a month of heightened Israeli strikes on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, particularly since Israel expanded its ground operations in the region. Friday marked the highest daily total of Hezbollah-claimed operations since hostilities began last October, with the group assuming responsibility for 48 separate incidents, a record number. Hezbollah’s rocket, missile and drone attacks have increased in precision and coordination, according to Israeli analysts, moving away from the sporadic strikes seen in September and early October to more strategic targeting intended to achieve both military and psychological impact. However, analysts note that heavy missile fire aimed at central Israel remains limited, possibly due to Israeli strikes on Hezbollah’s launch infrastructure or Iranian orders to hold back larger missiles for potential use in the event of an Israeli attack on Iran. The IDF said approximately 130 Hezbollah launchers were destroyed over the past week, including the one responsible for Friday's deadly strike on the Arab Israeli town of Majd al-Krum. Two civilians, Hassan Sawaed, 21, and Arjwan Manna, 19, were killed, and seven others were injured in that attack. Additionally, the military reported that 91st Division forces located four trucks this week loaded with launchers containing approximately 160 rockets ready for launch. Several fires erupted near She'ar Yashuv, in the Misgav industrial zone and the Hula Nature Reserve due to Saturday’s strikes. Northern District firefighting teams report that the fires have been contained.

Israel targeted ‘critical component’ in Iran’s long-range missile...	New York Times reports Israel's 2nd strike wave in Iran targeted 'critical component' in Tehran's long-range missile production; first wave struck sites in Syria and Iraq, with missile debris later found near Baghdad In the second wave of Israeli airstrikes on Iran overnight, Israel targeted a 'critical component' in Tehran’s long-range missile production process, The New York Times reported on Saturday, citing an Israeli source. While the source did not disclose the specific nature of the targeted component or confirm its destruction, they emphasized it as a uniquely prioritized objective. The report, which corroborates accounts from Arabic media outlets, indicated that Israel's initial strikes focused on air defense systems and radar installations in Syria and Iraq to reduce interception risks. Footage surfaced hours after the strike, showing missile debris near Samarra, north of Baghdad, though it remains unconfirmed if it is linked to Israel. Similar remnants were documented following an April strike in Iraq. Israel's military operations reportedly involved dozens of fighter jets and drones, targeting 20 locations, including military compounds, air defense systems, missile production facilities and ground-to-ground missile launchers in Tehran, as well as Iran’s Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in the west. Iranian sources informed The Times that an S-300 air defense battery positioned at Imam Khomeini International Airport, which protects parts of Tehran, was also struck. They noted that at least three Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps missile bases were damaged. Tehran has since acknowledged that two Iranian soldiers were killed in the strikes, with reports claiming that two additional soldiers died of their injuries hours later. Iranian officials additionally claimed that Israel had succeeded in hitting the Parchin military base, a site near Tehran associated with missile and suicide drone technologies as well as nuclear technology development. One drone reportedly struck the facility while others were intercepted. For over three hours, the Israeli Air Force conducted strikes in three separate waves, targeting military sites, air defense systems and missile production and launch facilities throughout Tehran and western Iran. According to The Wall Street Journal, Israel sent advance warnings to Iran through Arab and European intermediaries. The message outlined Israel’s planned targets and cautioned that any Iranian retaliation would prompt even more forceful Israeli responses. Following the strike, Iran’s Tasnim News Agency indicated that there would be a 'proportionate response' to the Israeli actions. Israeli officials assessed that Iran might retaliate. In a statement, IDF confirmed, 'Intelligence-guided air force strikes targeted missile production sites used by Iran to launch projectiles at Israel in the past year. Additionally, we struck Iranian ground-to-air missile arrays and other air defense capabilities intended to restrict Israel's operational freedom in Iran. The IDF has significant operational capabilities, many of which were exercised today in striking strategic sites deep within Iran. Israel reserves the right and responsibility to protect its citizens should the Iranian regime continue its attacks.' The military added that the scope of damage would become clearer in the coming days but noted the Air Force now has 'greater operational freedom.' With escalated readiness for defense and offense, Israel’s focus remains on the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza, while remaining vigilant against Iran’s attempts to instigate regional escalation. 'Our ability to strike anywhere in the Middle East has been demonstrated,' the IDF said.

Iran: Israeli strike hit 'secret military base', possibly conduct...	Israeli forces attacked strategic military targets across Iran, including the covert Parchin base near Tehran, known for missile and nuclear technology development; Parchin site had previously been identified by the IAEA for potential nuclear weapon research Beyond Iran's admission of two soldiers killed, including an officer equivalent to the rank of major, Iranian sources informed The New York Times on Saturday afternoon that Israel successfully struck the secret military base at Parchin on the outskirts of Tehran. 'One of the drones hit, while others were shot down,' they claimed. This base, also referred to as a 'security facility' in various reports, is known for developing missile and suicide drone technologies, alongside nuclear technologies. The Israeli strike involved dozens of fighter jets and aircraft, reportedly focusing on 20 different targets. According to the IDF, the operation targeted military complexes, air defense systems, missile production facilities, and ground-to-ground missile launchers in the Tehran province, as well as in the Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in western Iran. Iranian sources also told The New York Times that Israel attacked an S-300 air defense battery stationed at Imam Khomeini International Airport, which provides protection for parts of the Iranian capital. They added that at least three missile bases of the Revolutionary Guards were damaged in this round of Israeli strikes. The Parchin area, located approximately 18 miles east of Tehran, has been a focal point of Iran's military activities. Our analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, highlights that Iran has previously conducted experiments in this area aimed at enabling the production of nuclear weapons—the nuclear explosive device. While there is no solid information indicating Iran has renewed its efforts to develop a nuclear warhead, if reports of the Parchin facility being attacked are accurate, the goal seems to have been to thwart Tehran's ability to conduct experiments that would advance it in producing a bomb, should it decide to do so. According to foreign reports, this is not the first time Israel has targeted this mysterious Iranian base. In May 2022, an 'incident' was reported there, resulting in the death of engineer Ihsan Gad-Beigi. The New York Times reported then that the facility was attacked by drones. According to the report, quadcopter suicide drones exploded on a 'building of the Iranian Defense Ministry, where research is conducted for the development of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles.' The newspaper noted that the method of operation mirrored previous Israeli strikes, to which Israel declined to comment. A few days after the strike, Iranian military announced that Iranian Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri and Iranian Army Commander Abdolrahim Mousavi visited a 'subterranean drone base' whose location was undisclosed. An Iranian state television reporter covering the visit mentioned that the visit took place on a Thursday and involved a 45-minute helicopter flight from Kermanshah in western Iran to the 'secret underground drone facility.' He reported that he was allowed to remove his blindfold only upon arrival at the base, allegedly leaving him unaware of its location. Photographs released by Iranian television showed rows of drones armed with missiles inside a tunnel, reportedly hundreds of meters underground. The base where nuclear ambitions were nurtured In a severe 2011 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, about four years before the signing of the nuclear agreement, it was noted Iran built a facility at the Parchin military base for conducting hydrodynamic experiments, indicative of potential nuclear weapon development. The base was highlighted as a main focus of Iran's nuclear program, with reports of efforts to simultaneously detonate explosives integral to the bomb mechanism, alongside hydrodynamic experiments related to nuclear weapons development. At Parchin, it was claimed, there exists a special facility where Iranians attempted to develop the explosive casing to encase enriched uranium hemispheres, initiating the nuclear reaction. Ben-Yishai noted that this casing must explode simultaneously with precision measured in nanoseconds, requiring special detonators known as krytrons, which time the explosion and thus initiate the reaction—resulting in a nuclear explosion. In the months following the severe report, assessments and satellite images suggested Iran was cleansing the Parchin site of evidence of military-related nuclear activity. Among other actions, the Institute for Science and International Security revealed satellite images showing a 'pink cover' over a building at the military base, which UN inspectors sought to visit. The cover likely allowed Iran to clean or operate in the facility in a manner that prevented satellite tracking. A Western envoy said at the time that purification activities at Parchin were 'intensifying,' casting doubt on whether IAEA inspectors could find solid evidence there—even if granted access to the military site. It became evident that the Iranians sought to conceal the existence of experiments on the casing and miniaturization of the bomb intended to allow its insertion into the warhead of ballistic missiles. They attempted to remove soil layers in the area to obscure radioactive traces emitted during the use of nuclear materials, and also flushed the area with strong water currents. In fact, only in September 2015, four years after demanding access to the facility, did IAEA officials finally gain entrance—two months after the nuclear agreement was signed with world powers. That said, Iran has numerous underground facilities, some of which have been exposed in recent years. These underground bases typically house various types of drones, alongside missiles and electronic warfare systems, often located at significant depths underground. Additionally, nuclear development sites have been relocated underground following previous strikes. Regarding air bases, according to Al-Jazeera, Iran possesses dozens of air bases spread across its western, eastern, and southern command regions. These bases are associated with either the Iranian Air Force or the Revolutionary Guards and support various military missions.

Iran says two soldiers, one of which was an officer, were killed ...	As the Islamic Republic contemplates whether to respond or swallow their pride, an announcement says two Iranian troops were killed during the Israeli strike; Al-Mayadeen, associated with Hezbollah, says this was 'a win for Iran' On Saturday morning, around 11:00 AM, Iranian military acknowledged two soldiers were killed in the Israeli attack, one of whom held a rank equivalent to a major. Almost simultaneously, Sky News Arabic reported that Iran communicated to Israel, via a third party, that it had no intention of retaliating. If this report is accurate, it suggests that Israel's strategy was effective. This operation was described as a larger-scale response compared to the one Israel launched in April, during which Israeli forces struck central Iran, and Iranian officials claimed no damage was caused. The Wall Street Journal reported that, hours before the attack, Israel sent a warning to Iran through Arab and European intermediaries. This warning detailed the targets Israel intended to strike and indicated any Iranian retaliation would be met with even stronger subsequent attacks. Meanwhile, 'Nour News,' affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, stated that 'Tehran’s policy regarding the Israeli attack is to respond without haste. Israeli aggression cannot be ignored.' The Tasnim news agency reported that 'Iran reserves the right to respond to any aggression. Israel will face a proportional response to any action.' Conversely, the Lebanese network 'Al-Mayadeen' claimed, 'The confrontation ended with a victory for Iran. The resistance against Israel has established a new equation in the region.' In the meantime, Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement asserting that 'Iran is entitled and committed to defending itself against external aggressive actions.' So far, local media have been broadcasting images of normalcy from various cities across Iran this morning, including Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran, which was reportedly attacked. Iranian networks have mocked the Israeli attack, distributing videos of residents dismissing the threat, as well as a video comparing the Iranian attack on Israel to the Israeli attack on Iran. The only documented evidence of the attack's damage was broadcast by the Qatari channel 'Al-Arabi,' showing the destruction in the city of Shamsabad, south of Tehran, as a result of the Israeli strike. According to reports from media associated with the Iranian opposition, the target was an 'industrial innovation' factory in the city, which might produce drones. Additionally, Iranian sources informed The New York Times that among the sites attacked in Tehran province was an S-300 air defense battery at Imam Khomeini International Airport. According to these sources, this battery provides protection for parts of Iran's capital. They also claimed that at least three missile bases belonging to the Revolutionary Guards were damaged in the Israeli attacks, adding that 'drones attacked the secret military base at Parchin on the outskirts of Tehran. One hit the base, while others were shot down.' Our analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, highlights that in the Parchin area, Iran has previously conducted experiments intended to enable the production of nuclear weapons—the nuclear explosive device. There is no solid evidence indicating that Iran has resumed efforts to develop a nuclear warhead, but if the reports of the Parchin facility being attacked are accurate, the goal appears to have been to disrupt Tehran's ability to conduct experiments that would advance it in producing a nuclear bomb, should it decide to do so. Officially, Iranian officials remained silent this morning, with Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref merely posting on social media that 'Iran's strength humiliates the enemies of the homeland.' 'Impact comparable to hitting Rafael's missile production line' According to the IDF, during the night, Israel conducted three separate waves of attacks targeting missile production facilities, surface-to-air missile systems, and additional aerial capabilities in Iran. Despite Iranian mockery, Israeli sources asserted that 'Iran is trying to claim that the explosions were due to their successful air defense. This is false. They were a complete failure with zero interceptions.' Israeli assessments suggest that Tehran is expected to respond to the strike, though the nature of this response remains unclear. An Israeli source familiar with the details stated, 'The intelligence provided by the Military Intelligence Directorate in this event is like science fiction, far beyond imagination. The strike precisely targeted factories producing surface-to-surface missiles, ensuring a particularly significant impact on Iran. This is 16-digit precise intelligence (full coordinates) on an irreplaceable factory, with a precise Air Force strike, not near or approximate.' The source added, 'We attacked most of the surface-to-surface missile production capabilities. The goal was to prevent Iran from continuing their production. It's as if someone dismantled Rafael's missile production line.' In preparing for an Iranian response, it is worth noting that the U.S. warned Iran of 'consequences' for such actions and clarified that it was prepared in advance to defend Israel against a potential Iranian retaliation. IDF Spokesperson Brigadier General Daniel Hagari emphasized that Israel still has a 'large target bank' in Iran and will not hesitate to strike if Tehran chooses to attack. By targeting Iran's air defense systems first, and reportedly similar systems in Syria and Iraq, Israel effectively granted its Air Force planes and aircraft operational freedom in Iranian airspace. This knowledge—that Israel can strike Iran again without its defenses—will likely make Tehran reconsider before retaliating.

Washington post: Israel designed attack so Iran could 'deny major...	The American paper says the Israeli attack, made known ahead of time to the Biden administration, was designed to limit civilian casualties and allow the Iranian regime to save face, effectively taking the sting out of a possible response; Arab Sky News says Iran has notified this attack will not elicit another retaliation A source familiar with Israel's plans told the Washington Post on Saturday morning that 'Israel designed its strike with the intention of minimizing casualties and keeping the impact to a level that would allow Iran to deny major damage and contain the situation, according to a person briefed on Israel’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified matters.' According to the source, 'This was a larger-scale version of Israel's response in April when Israel struck central Iran, and Iranian officials claimed no significant damage was done.' It's worth noting that after Israel's response to the Iranian attack in April, which National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir even called 'weak,' sparking anger in Israel, Iran did not retaliate—thus effectively closing the chapter until it was reopened with the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Although Israel anticipates some form of response from Iran to last night's attack—which was significantly broader than the one in April—Tehran currently seems to be trying to de-escalate. Only hours after the strike did Iran's military admit that two of its soldiers were killed in the attacks, which focused on Tehran and the Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in the west. Earlier, Iran insisted that the strikes caused 'minimal damage' and that most were intercepted. Sky News in Arabic reported that Iran informed Israel, through a third party, that it would not respond to the attack. Conversely, according to 'Nour News,' affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, 'Tehran's policy regarding the Israeli attack is to respond without haste. Israeli aggression cannot be ignored.' Meanwhile, local media broadcast images showing normalcy from various cities across Iran, including Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport, which was reported to have been attacked. Iranian networks mocked the Israeli attack, sharing videos of residents dismissing it, as well as a video comparing the Iranian attack on Israel to the Israeli attack on Iran. While Iranian officials maintained silence this morning, Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref limited his remarks to social media, stating, 'Iran's strength humiliates the enemies of the homeland.' Despite Iran's ridicule, Israeli sources stated that 'Iran is trying to claim that the explosions are due to their successful air defense. That's a lie. They were a complete failure, with zero interceptions.' According to Israeli assessments, Tehran is expected to respond to the attack, though it is still unclear how. An Israeli source familiar with the details said, 'The intelligence provided by the Military Intelligence Directorate in this event is beyond imagination, extremely so. The strike was precise on factories producing surface-to-surface missiles to ensure a significant impact on Iran. This is 16-digit precise intelligence (full coordinates) on an irreplaceable factory, with a precise Air Force strike, not near or approximate.' The source claimed, 'We attacked most of the surface-to-surface missile production capabilities, aiming to prevent Iran from continuing their production. It's as if someone dismantled Rafael's missile production line.' Regarding the anticipation of an Iranian response, it is worth noting that the U.S. warned Iran of 'consequences' for such an action and stated it was prepared in advance to defend Israel against any potential Iranian retaliation. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari clarified that Israel still has a 'large target bank' in Iran and will not hesitate to strike if Tehran chooses to attack. The decision to first target Iran's air defense systems, reportedly also in Syria and Iraq, effectively allowed Israeli Air Force planes and aircraft free rein in Iranian skies. This knowledge—that Israel can strike Iran again without its defenses—will likely make Tehran think twice before retaliating.

Israeli Air Force strikes in Iran: Exact timeline	Military installations, air defense systems and missile manufacturing facilities were all in the IDF's sights as the attack unfolded overnight; responses from the international community pouring in, the Biden administration was updated ahead of time and details of the attack exemplify military precision About 900 miles from Israel, in the early hours of Saturday, precisely 25 days after Iran's ballistic missile attack, reports of explosions in Iran began to emerge at 2:00 AM, signaling the start of Israel's counterattack. For over three intense hours, across three separate waves, dozens of Israeli Air Force fighter jets and aircraft targeted military complexes, air defense systems, missile production facilities, and surface-to-surface missile launchers in Tehran, as well as in the Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in western Iran. According to the New York Times, 20 different targets were hit, though Tehran downplayed the situation in the morning, given warnings they received from the U.S. against a possible response. The Home Front Command instructions have not changed for now. The first wave began, as mentioned, at 2:00 AM (Israeli time) with reports of explosions in Tehran, as well as in Syria and Iraq, leading to the closure of their airspace. Reports indicated that this wave primarily targeted air defense systems in all three countries, likely to allow Israeli Air Force aircraft the freedom to proceed with their strikes. However, at the time, the situation was unclear: with the sound of explosions, frightened residents in Iran took to the streets, fearing that airports in the Iranian capital might have been hit. Shortly afterward, around 2:30 AM, the IDF spokesperson officially confirmed: 'The IDF is carrying out precise military strikes in Iran, in response to the ongoing attacks by the Iranian regime against the State of Israel in recent months, in accordance with the directive of the political echelon.' IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated in an English-language declaration to the foreign media that Israel 'has the right and obligation to respond' to Iran, 'like any other sovereign country in the world.' He noted the strike is a response to months of Iranian actions against Israel since October 7, including those by its proxies. At this stage, the Iranians focused on downplaying the events, with reports from the country stating that the source of the explosion sounds was the air defense systems intercepting the IDF attack. BBC noted shortly afterward that it was unclear which sites were hit in Iran, as Tehran claimed that routine life continued, and Israel did not disclose what it was targeting other than 'military targets.' Around 3:00 AM, it was reported that President Joe Biden was 'closely updated' on the developments. About half an hour later, the Pentagon clarified that the U.S. was not involved in the strike in Iran, although it was informed about it. Israel, in fact, shared with the U.S. what it planned to do and did not surprise it despite Pentagon document leaks. At 4:15 AM, further reports indicated that President Biden and Vice President Harris were updated on the attack. Despite this, until almost 4:00 AM, global media continued to report it was still unclear what was hit and where, also noting Syria reported Israeli airstrikes hitting military sites in its center and south. Then, reports of another wave of attacks in Iran surfaced, along with footage of interception attempts in the skies. In this wave, Israel hit Iranian surface-to-surface missile production facilities, with an informed Israeli source stating, 'The intelligence provided by the Military Intelligence Directorate in this event is science fiction beyond all imagination. The hit on factories producing surface-to-surface missiles was precise, to ensure significant impact. This is 16-digit precise intelligence (full coordinates) on an irreplaceable factory, with a precise Air Force strike, neither near nor approximate.' Meanwhile, as pilots were still in enemy territory, offices of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant began releasing photos of them in the Operations Directorate's command bunker. The New York Times reported that the strikes in the additional wave concluded about half an hour after they began, around 5:00 AM, targeting air defense systems, missile production facilities, UAVs, and launch sites. 'If Iran makes a mistake - we will respond.' At 6:00 AM, IDF announced that the Air Force jets had returned safely to the country after striking air defense systems and surface-to-surface missiles in Iran, stating that the operation was named 'Days of Repentance.' According to the official IDF statement, 'Air Force jets attacked, with intelligence guidance, missile production means that Iran launched toward the State of Israel in the past year. Simultaneously, surface-to-air missile arrays and additional aerial capabilities of Iran were attacked, which were intended to limit Israel's aerial freedom of action in Iran. IDF has many offensive operational capabilities, some of which were carried out today in striking strategic arrays deep within Iran. The State of Israel reserves the right and duty to protect its citizens if the Iranian regime continues its attacks against Israel and its citizens.' 'The extent of the damages and results will be revealed later, but already there is broader freedom of action for the IDF,' they said. 'We are focused on the objectives of the war in Lebanon and Gaza, and Iran is pushing for regional escalation. We are at peak readiness in defense and offense, with no change in the Home Front Command instructions at the moment. We are in ongoing intelligence and operational assessment. We have proven that we can strike at any point in the Middle East.' About 20 minutes after the IDF's announcement, in a conversation with reporters, a senior White House official stated the U.S. fully backs Israel and warns Iran of 'consequences' if it responds to the IDF strike — which was defined as 'self-defense.' According to the official, 'We deployed a missile battery and acted to strengthen Israel's air defense systems in anticipation of tonight's response. President Biden and Vice President Harris have clearly demonstrated that we will always help protect Israel from Iran and its terrorist organizations.' However, in Israel, it is estimated that Iran will respond. After attempting throughout the night to downplay the results of the strikes, at 6:30 AM, it admitted for the first time that 'minimal damage' was caused at several sites, but emphasized that its air defense systems successfully confronted 'Israeli aggression.'

Bereaved families left to cope with immense loss after 13 IDF tro...	Ground incursions into southern Lebanon have began taking an immense toll, as no less than 13 troops have lost in their lives in less than two days, leaving shattered families behind, left to pick up the pieces; 'How do you process something like this? I need you more than ever,' said the daughter of a fallen soldier During the Simchat Torah holiday, while many celebrated across the country, 20 children were left fatherless, all perishing in battles in southern Lebanon. These children, aged between 4 and 17, faced the profound loss of a parent at an early stage in their lives. In the clashes in southern Lebanon during Simchat Torah, 10 soldiers were killed, six of whom were parents. Shlomo Aviad Naiman, 31, left behind four children: Haggai (12), Tzuriya (9), Carmi (8), and Rafael (4). Mordechai Chaim Amoyal, 42, left behind six children. Shmuel Harari, 35, left behind three children. Guy Idan left behind two daughters, Libi (17) and Avishag (13). Dan Maury, 43, left behind two sons. Omri Lotan, 47, left behind two daughters and a son, Mika, Gaya, and Amit. Aside from the tragic addition of many orphans to the circle of bereavement in just one day, October 2024 has been the most challenging month in the conflict since December 2023, when 114 people were killed. In fact, this month has been the deadliest in the war since the beginning of the year, with 69 fatalities from operational activities, rocket, and UAV attacks, and terrorist incidents. Since the start of the ground maneuver in Lebanon about a month ago, on September 30, 27 soldiers have been killed, 5 of them in the last 24 hours. Guy Idan was laid to rest: 'You are the salt of the earth, my beloved son' On Friday, in the military section of the cemetery at Kibbutz Shomrat, Sgt. Major (Res.) Guy Idan, a 51-year-old resident of the kibbutz, was laid to rest. He was killed on Thursday by a projectile explosion near a structure in the central sector of southern Lebanon. 'If there is a definition for the term ‘salt of the earth,’ it’s you, my beloved son,' eulogized his father, Yigal. His 17-year-old daughter, Libi Idan, added, 'How do you process something like this? I need you more than ever.' Guy’s father described him as someone who was 'always giving and doing for everyone,' and recounted how he refused to forgo volunteering for reserve duty. Guy’s mother, Rachel Sela, eulogized him as well, describing him as 'a great man with an even greater heart, always volunteering and giving of himself.' She recalled the moment he left for reserves and how she asked him 'not to be a hero,' adding, 'I never thought something would happen to you. I can’t and don’t want to believe it. I am in a nightmare.' Guy Idan was the cousin of Tzachi Idan, who was abducted from his home in Nahal Oz on October 7. 'He will no longer see him return from captivity in Gaza,' wrote a family member. The family said that Guy did everything he could to bring back the abductees, both as a civilian and in the army. Amir, Guy’s brother and Tzachi’s cousin, told Ynet that 'Guy was a very special person, a redhead as a redhead should be. He always loved the army and security. In Kibbutz Shomrat, he established the standby squad to perfection, instilling a sense of security for all the residents. They called him for everything, even when it wasn’t his role because they knew they could rely on him. As a younger brother, I knew I had someone to rely on for everything; he always protected me and always delivered.' 'The world has lost one of its best sons': Mordechai Amoyal was laid to rest On Friday, Sgt. Major (Res.) Mordechai Haim Amoyal (42), a resident of Lod who fell in the battles in southern Lebanon during Simchat Torah, was laid to rest on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Mordechai is survived by his wife Rina and six children. 'How I dreaded being in this place. Since the beginning of the war, I have watched in awe as courageous women eulogized their husbands, what strength and power,' Rina said. 'The world has lost one of its best sons today. What a man you were, what presence, always at the forefront.' She described how 'you were always preoccupied with living a meaningful life. You always aspired higher, and since October 7, you didn’t have time to beat yourself up for not going south. You were a person full of depth, aspiring to the most meaningful life possible, never settling in one place. You were the best partner I could have asked for, the most attentive, the most loving, the closest. You were an amazing and diligent father to our children, a prankster, and a child at heart.' She addressed her children, who were left without their father, saying, 'It’s important for me that you know, kids, that Dad was proud of you, and there is so much of him in each of you. Everywhere you went, you were loved and significant. I want to say thank you for all the good we had together, for making me feel like a queen, for who you are.' His daughter Shira spoke over her father’s fresh grave, saying, 'You always tried to give more and more, asking what would make me come to more classes, trying to think of creative ideas to ignite our passion for Torah. You always said I didn’t have to study at school but to do something with my time—because that was you. You used every minute, listened to lessons on headphones every moment, never wasted a minute, maybe you understood even then that you need to make the most of every minute? Your connection to us as a family was important to you; you wanted to play, travel—because that was you.' His daughter Ayana also eulogized, saying, 'My dad, I remember he was always there for me. He was loved and beloved, he was always there for us. I already miss you, Dad.' His young son added, 'I remember your last visit home, how proud you were of us for building the sukkah by ourselves, just as you were proud last year when we dismantled it ourselves. Thank you for everything, Dad.' Shlomo was laid to rest: 'It’s hard to imagine life without you' On Friday, Sgt. 1st Class (Res.) Shlomo Aviad Naiman (31) from Mitzpe Yeriho was laid to rest on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, 12 siblings, his wife Shir, and four children. 'I can’t believe this really happened to us. We have so many dreams yet to fulfill together. A man of dreams, a man of vision. Our home, which you worked so hard to build and still haven’t finished,' eulogized his wife. 'Our beloved children who need you so much. And I, who don’t know what life is without you. We’ve been together since I was 16. I knew from the start you were mine and I was yours.' His brother Amichai added, 'It’s hard to imagine life without you. You always jumped to volunteer for every task, and everything was always done with joy. In the office, he was defined as the COO, but in practice, he was everything no one else would do, no matter what the task was. For him, the motto was to do what was needed, quietly.' He said, 'We promise to continue your kindness, desires, aspirations, and dreams—with lots of positive activity, charity, and kindness. We will take care of your heroic wife Shir and the children.' Yehudit, his sister, eulogized, saying, 'On the eve of the holiday, I sat in the sukkah and felt something bad. I thought it was a feeling you get after what we all went through last year. I wrote about it on my phone, and today I saw it was exactly at five, when we parted from you. I realized that’s what it feels like to lose a brother. How will the world go on without you? I know you did it because you are invincible. We are an unbeatable nation, thanks to you and all the heroes.'

Explosions in Lebanon prompt false earthquake alerts in northern ...	Shortly after IAF jets return from Iran, residents all over the north receive a series of alerts on their phones, warning of an impending earthquake; IDF Spokesperson clarifies it was brought on by a series of controlled explosions in southern Lebanon In the early hours of Saturday, shortly after a sequence of strikes in Iran by the Israeli Air Force, an unusual flurry of earthquake warnings jolted residents across dozens of locales in the Golan Heights, Haifa, and surrounding communities. People recounted receiving urgent messages on their mobile devices, with some in Haifa noting alerts instructing them to reach safety within a mere minute. This wave of alerts wasn't due to natural tectonic shifts but rather the result of a significant, controlled blast in Lebanon. The Geological Survey of Israel clarified, 'The earthquake warnings were set off by a considerable, controlled explosion that took place this morning in the north. Our alert system mistook the explosion for seismic activity, hence the widespread notifications.' IDF spokesperson reassured the public, stating unequivocally that this was not a security breach. 'In recent minutes, explosive sounds have echoed across northern Israel, a byproduct of IDF operations in southern Lebanon. There is no cause for security concerns,' the statement read. Golan Regional Council informed its residents, 'Israeli forces neutralized an enemy compound, and following the detonation of a vast amount of explosives in Lebanon, earthquake alerts were activated across wide areas of the country. No changes in safety guidelines are necessary.' A Haifa local shared with Ynet, 'My phone warned of an earthquake, but nothing happened. We all went outside as instructed, yet no quake occurred.' Another resident remarked, 'We've grown accustomed to waking up at 7 AM to missile alerts. Suddenly, an earthquake alert blared from the app. It was terrifying.' The alerts sparked anxiety among residents, given the longstanding belief that a major earthquake is due in Israel. It is generally thought that Israel experiences a significant quake roughly every century, with the last one striking 96 years ago. In 2012, Israel felt one of its strongest earthquakes in two decades. With a magnitude of 5.3, its epicenter lay southeast of Cyprus, and tremors were felt across northern, central, and eastern parts of Israel. Only two instances have seen stronger quakes in the vicinity, both with epicenters further away from Israel. In 1995, a 6.2 magnitude quake shook the Red Sea, about 90 miles south of Eilat, causing road cracks in the city. Last year, a 5.9 magnitude tremor originating from Crete was felt in Israel and neighboring countries. A somewhat less powerful quake occurred in 2008, registering at 5.3 magnitude. Its epicenter was near Tyre in Lebanon, yet it was distinctly felt throughout most of Israel. The last earthquake to cause tangible damage in Israel struck eight years ago. In February 2004, a 5.1 magnitude quake shook the Dead Sea region, leading to partial collapses of several buildings and an evacuation of the government complex. These moderate-intensity tremors have so far spared the population from casualties, but a slightly stronger quake could alter this reality dramatically. In 1956, around 150 people perished in a quake in Mount Shouf, Lebanon. The 1927 quake, with a magnitude of 6.2, wreaked havoc and claimed numerous lives in what was then a sparsely populated region. More than 300 people were killed in what was then Palestine, and about a thousand homes were destroyed. Cities like Nablus, Tiberias, Ramla, and Lod faced prolonged rehabilitation. In the 19th century, the most devastating earthquake struck in 1837. Thousands perished in Safed alone, Tiberias’s city walls crumbled, and massive waves battered the shores of the Sea of Galilee. The tremors also impacted Jericho and Jaffa, not sparing the northern regions alone. The belief that a significant quake hits Israel approximately every 100 years is supported by historical events. Nearly a century prior, in 1759, a colossal quake struck, killing thousands in Lebanon and affecting Tiberias and Acre. Estimates from that time suggest around 200 fatalities occurred in Safed.

Iran: Claim that 100 Israeli jets attacked us is false, refinery ...	A source claimed in a report by the Iranian news agency 'Tasnim' that the Israeli attack in Iran was conducted from outside the country's borders and caused limited damage. The source stated, 'The Israeli claim that 20 sites were attacked is unrealistic and is part of psychological warfare.' The source reiterated that no Revolutionary Guard military facility was targeted and that the report of 100 aircraft participating in the attack is 'false and intended to exaggerate the weak strike.' The agency also quoted the Tehran refinery: 'We deny that the refinery was a target in the attack. It is operating as usual.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjf9uw5ekx	2024-10-25T23:06:10-07:00	
U.S. satisfied after Israeli Iran strike, warns Tehran of consequ...	A White House official speaking to reporters after the strike says the administration urged Israel to carry out a precise, targeted strike that would deter Iran from further attacks and avoid regional escalation A senior White House official on Saturday said that the Biden administration worked with Israeli leaders in recent weeks to encourage them to carry out a precise and proportionate strike on Iran with minimum risk to civilian casualties, in retaliation for the Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier this month. The Israeli strike 'was extensive, it was targeted, it was precise,' he said. Israel launched a three-hour strike on Iranian military targets around the country, outside populated areas. According to the IDF, the military targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities.' The official who spoke to reporters after the Israeli strike ended, said U.S. President Joe Biden discussed the situation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week and encouraged him to plan an attack that would deter further Iranian strikes against Israel while reducing the chance for further escalation. He said that was the goal of both the U.S. and Israel. The official mentioned the U.S. deployment of the THAAD missile defense system to Israel, to protect against Iranian missiles and said that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have proven that they would always come to the defense of Israel against Iran and its terrorist proxies. He said that if Iran chose to respond once again, 'We will be ready and there will be consequences on Iran.' However, he added, the administration does not want to see that happen.

Mission accomplished IDF says after attack on Iran	Military says all planes return safely after three-hour-long strike reportedly targeting missile production sites, surface-to-air missile arrays, other Iranian aerial capabilities; IDF warns Iran not to respond Israel on Saturday completed a three-hour-long strike on Iran, 25 days after an Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1. The military said all Israeli aircraft returned safely to their base after the mission was completed and its objectives reached. Some 20 sites were attacked, according to a report in the New York Times. 'The strike was conducted in response to the attacks by the Iranian regime against the State of Israel and its citizens in recent months. The retaliatory strike has been completed and the mission was fulfilled,' the IDF said. Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel demonstrated the capabilities and the resolve to act in defense of the country and warned that if Iran were to continue its attacks and the escalation of violence in the region Israel would respond. In a written statement the military said that based on intelligence, IAF aircraft struck missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles. 'These missiles posed a direct and immediate threat to the citizens of the State of Israel. Simultaneously, the IDF struck surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel's aerial freedom of operation in Iran. Israel avoided attacking targets that could drag the region into an all-out war including Iran's oil production and nuclear sites. Dozens of aircraft participated in the attack that was carried out at a distance of 1,600 kilometers (994 miles) from Israel's borders and in several areas of Iran. 'The extend of the damage and the results of the strikes will become known later but as of now, the IDF has a wider range of freedom to operate,' military sources said adding that Israel still has targets it can strike in the future. 'We are now focused on the war in Gaza and Lebanon and Iran has been pushing for regional escalation,' the sources said. 'We are on full alert in our defensive and offensive capabilities and there are no changes to Homefront instructions to the public. We are continuing our intelligence and operational assessments. We've proven we can attack anywhere in the Middle East.' Iran confirmed that damage was caused by the Israeli attacks but claimed it was limited. Iran's air defenses said Israel attacked military sites in Tehran Province as well as in the provinces of Khuzestan and Ilam in the west of the country. A White House official expressed home that Iran would not retaliate for the Israeli strike and threatened 'consequences' if it does. This should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between the two countries, the official said, adding that the U.S. has multiple direct and indirect channels of communication with Iran where it has made its position clear.

Iran threatens retaliation for Israel's strike	Iranian news agency sites sources saying there is no doubt Israel will face a proportional reaction to the strikes; earlier Khamenei reportedly instructed his military to prepare for war against Israel Iran is prepared to respond to any Israeli 'aggression', Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency said on Saturday, citing sources. 'There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes,' Tasnim quoted the sources as saying. Israel launched strikes on Iran early on Saturday targeting military bases including ballistic missile sites, weapons storage facilities and air defenses according to reports in waves of attacks estimated to continue for hours. According to a report in the New York times late on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ai Khamenei instructed his military to prepare for war against Israel but the paper added that if the Israeli attack would be limited, Iran may not respond. Israel's attacks came in retaliation for an Iranian ballistic missile attack on October 1. Israel was expected to launch attacks on Iran and was considering its targets in coordination with the United States. The U.S. urged Israel to avoid leading to a regional war by refraining from attack son Iran's nuclear facilities or its oil production. Sources, two of them identified as members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) told the Times that an Israeli strike that would cause substantial damage could be responded to by a barrage of up to 1,000 ballistic missiles; escalated attacks by Iranian proxies in the region; and disrupting the flow of global energy supplies and maritime traffic through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.

Tehran downplays Israeli strike claiming not significant damage	This could be seen as an effort to avoid the need to retaliate; local TV network claims airports are operating normally and there have been no incidents that 'require intervention.' Iran claims explosions heard in its cities were caused by its own air defenses, while an Israeli strike was underway early on Saturday against Iranian military sites. 'This is a lie,' an Israeli official said. 'There have been no intercepts.' Iranian television reported that both its international airports were operating normally and showed images of Tehran's sky devoid of any smoke or sign of explosions. The network said there have been no incidents that 'require intervention.' A correspondent for the network said that there were Israeli attempts to attack three bases in the Tehran Province but the air defenses thwarted the attack. This can be seen as an Iranian effort to avoid the need to launch a retaliatory strike against Israel. According to a report in the New York Times late on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei instructed his military to prepare for war against Israel but added that if the strike is not a significant one, there may not be a response.

We thought we were the only ones developing drones, we weren't p...	UAVs have become Hezbollah's effective attack weapon in the war, causing deaths, injuries, heavy damage, and quite a bit of a headache for the Israeli Air Force; How did these simple drones manage to evade Israel’s sophisticated air defense systems? And how did Israel overlook this threat all these years? Before reporting to military reserve duty, Refael Kauders and his wife Judith went on a weekend to celebrate their wedding anniversary. They had a lot to celebrate: four lovely children, a house in Tzur Hadassah, great love. The 39-year-old Kauders, who served as religion and tradition coordinator of the 5030th Infantry Battalion, did not have to report to reserves duty, but he was determined to contribute his share. Upon his return from the weekend, Kauders set out for the Druze town of Hurfeish, where he and his fellow reservists in the infantry battalion were busy setting up the camp, near a soccer field. Some soldiers in the battalion thought it was dangerous to set up a camp in such an exposed area, near the Lebanon border, arguing that 'staying there endangers the lives of dozens of soldiers', but the location of the camp was not changed. On Wednesday, June 5, afternoon, Hezbollah experimented with a new method of attack, launching two suicide drones toward the Horfeish area in the upper Galilee. It is not clear yet whether Hezbollah had advance information on the whereabouts of the soldiers, or if the drone operators were simply looking for targets and found them. Either way, the crossing of the drones was not identified, and no warning alarm was triggered. One drone exploded on the soccer field, and the second continued to hover in the air for a few more minutes, waiting for rescue forces to rush to the scene of the first explosion, and then it exploded as well. Staff Sergeant (res.) Kauders was killed, and 12 were injured, including a female soldier who was seriously injured. 'We felt like ducks on a shooting range,' said a reservist from the battalion who survived the attack. The UAVs again took a bloody toll. The IDF announced that a thorough investigation will be carried out and lessons will be learned, but Hizki Bezalel, the brother-in-law of the late Kauders is troubled. Since the disaster, he began to explore UAVs, trying to understand why Israel was not able to deal with them. 'It upsets me that a device that costs about $2,000 causes us more trouble than all the expensive weapons, and we continue to get equipped with F-35 and the Air Force refuses to listen,' he said this week. 'The army is reluctant to consider a cheap solution. Instead, they prefer to develop expensive and sophisticated weapons. The problem is that senior military officials are unwilling to consider non-prestigious solutions. After all, no F-35 can handle a strike of a hundred UAVs launched simultaneously. We are not angry, we just want them to learn a lesson. They should conclude and understand that reality has changed. They just need to understand how the UAVs work, and whether there are solutions available. To this day our case has not been investigated.' Since October 7, Hezbollah alone has launched about 2,000 unmanned aerial vehicles into Israeli territory. Iran, the Houthis, and the Shiite militias in both Syria and Iraq are also trying to send UAVs. There are no official figures on how many of them hit their targets, but at least eight Israelis were killed in drone attacks and many dozens were injured. The property damage cannot yet be estimated, and it is certainly impossible to set a price tag for all the times that drones urged Israelis to run for shelter or disrupted the course of their life. The late Mikhail Samara from Kafr Yasif was the last person killed (until the publication of this article) by a Hezbollah drone, as he was hit by an IDF intercepting rocket that missed the drone in the Nahariya area. In the same Hezbollah drone attack, 19 people were injured, including six soldiers. Before Samara, drones also claimed the lives of the late Yevgeny Ferder, who was killed by a Houthi drone strike that hit his apartment in Tel Aviv; the late Major Dor Zimel, who was killed by a drone strike on a building in Arab al-Aramshe, where his department stayed; Command Sergeant Major (Res.) Yehezkel Azaria, who was killed by a hit near Margaliot community in the north; Major (Res.) Dan Kamhaji, and Staff-Sergeant-Major (Res.) Nachman Nathan Hertz who was killed by a hit near Metula; and Master Sergeant (Res.) Valeri Chefonov, who was killed by a drone attack on Kibbutz Kabri. While the Iron Dome systems, David's Sling, and the Arrow missiles provide broad protection - although it is not airtight - a small, slow, often unsophisticated vehicle has become a major threat, especially in the north. Indications that UAVs were becoming a weapon that must be addressed were here long before the October 7 massacre. Why didn't it happen? As usual, it depends on who you ask. The bottom line, Israel's security system is trying while under fire to find solutions for that threat. 'The professional challenge is great, but it had to be prioritized' UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) is a general name for all aircraft that do not include a human pilot onboard. Some drones can be purchased cheaply online and armed, and there are larger drones, such as Hermes and Eitan, operated by the Israeli Air Force or the Americans. The benefits of the UAVs are clear: they are usually smaller, cheaper, and simpler to operate than a fighter aircraft; they can be easily adapted to a variety of purposes, and the simpler models do not require a complicated operation, or complex technical setup, airports, or pilots. Having a good and advanced air force is complicated and can be maintained by wealthy countries that have technological capabilities. In contrast, UAVs have also allowed terrorist organizations to establish their aerial threats. Hezbollah began using Iranian-made UAVs in the early 2000s. Their first attack was modest: almost 20 years ago, in November 2004, Hezbollah's first UAV entered Israel's airspace without being detected, hovered for several minutes above Nahariya in the north, turned to the sea, and then fell. Over the years, there were more infiltrations by Hezbollah drones, also in the Second Lebanon War in 2006, but they were usually intercepted. In the meantime, Hezbollah accumulated more and more Iranian drones of various types and established a special drone division, called Unit 127, which engaged in developing their flying capabilities. Israel followed these developments closely, sand sometimes reacted - in December 2022 Israel bombed Uthe nit 127 facility in Lebanon, for example - but somehow, Israel underestimated the potential of the threat. Among the mass of urgent tasks in the north, such as combating Hezbollah's missile precision project and preventing Iranian entrenchment in Syria, the UAVs were not Israel's top priority. This was, of course, a mistake. The war that is taking place in Ukraine, almost 2,000 km from here, should have been a warning signal. At the beginning of last year, Russia and Iran signed a huge deal for the purchase of UAVs. Iran has supplied Russia with drones 'Shahed 131' and 'Shahed 136', both suicide drones, which are a cheap alternative to the expensive Russian missiles, which have been running out. These are relatively 'dumb' aircraft, but the Ukrainians learned very quickly how deadly they were. Hezbollah is also equipped with these two types of 'Shahed', in addition to several other types of drones. The terrorist organization currently uses mainly suicide drones and intelligence-gathering drones and recently released videos documenting drone flights over Haifa port and onsite security facility in Haifa Bay. Moreover, Hezbollah also has Iranian attack drones of the 'Karar' type ', which can carry bombs or missiles, launch them, and return to their base, or launch them and then crash themselves on the target. The Iranian attacking drones do not have the sophistication and accuracy of Israel's UAVs, and still, if Hezbollah decides to use them, it could cause great damage. 'The fact that we reached October 7 without an adequate response to the threat of UAVs is a failure of the Ministry of Defense along with the air defense system,' says a source familiar with the UAV world. 'They should have seen what was happening in Ukraine and adapted it to the Israeli reality. We did not react quickly enough to the threat. One could have realized that once the Russians used it in Ukraine, bearing in mind that the Iranians are their allies, at some point, it will reach us - and we should have created a response to it. Unfortunately, it did not happen.' Why not? 'Officials I talk to claim that budgetary constraints forced them to equip with less good systems, especially radar systems. The sooner UAVs are identified, the chances are to intercept them. Currently, IAI's radar production time is long. The second problem is that some of the existing radars are positioned at high altitudes aimed to detect missiles, but UAVs fly at a different angle relative to the radar system. The Iron Dome, for example, underwent adjustments for UAVs and improved its detection capabilities, but it does not provide an airtight solution. The third point is that Israel is currently facing many fronts, about seven. And still, this is not the security system's biggest nightmare.' What is its biggest nightmare? 'A 'swarm' drone attack. It could cause damage to air force bases and strategic facilities.' Brigadier General Ran Kochav, former commander of the air defense system between 2018-2021, admits that 'the Israeli Air Force has determined that UAVs were not an existential threat, and therefore was a second priority,' but he also states that 'I'm not sorry about that.' Why? 'Because it was necessary to prioritize. The aerial defense is not perfect, but on April 14 (the night of the first Iranian attack) and in October, the defense was excellent. UAVs pose a great challenge. There are many types of drones: fuel-powered, electric-powered, remotely controlled, one-way drones, such as suicide UAVs, attacking drones, and drones used for taking pictures. A UAV that flies from Iran is not similar to a drone that flies from Marjayoun in south Lebanon to Metula in the north of Israel. UAVs are not characterized only by their variety but also by their quantity. They are inexpensive and therefore replaced the rockets. Our enemy realized that the air defense system can cope well with rockets and missiles, so it began sending swarms of drones.' Quite a few claim that the problem, as seen in the war in Ukraine, was right in front of us, but we failed to realize it was coming our way, and we didn't prepare ourselves 'It's not true that we didn't look at the Russians in Ukraine. Operations teams that studied the war there concluded that it was a challenging threat but not an existential one and that it did a lot of psychological damage, and we had to deal with it. Technologically speaking it's difficult to handle it because the UAV is very simple. It causes great damage, but it's not scientifically complicated. We were not prepared for UAVs in the Iron Sword war because it wasn't a top priority. We needed to buy another tank, a submarine, and an iron dome, so we prioritized. Imagine what would have happened if we had set a different priority, and instead of thousands of rocket interceptors we had thousands of UAV interceptors - rockets would have killed more. We need both. It generated a perception of the 'absurdity of success'.' What does 'absurdity of success' mean? 'Since the success of the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow 2 and 3 systems is so great, an 'absurdity of success' perception is generated. The public praises us for our achievements, but he does not forgive us in terms of the drone attacks, where the success rate was 'only' 75% and not 95%. I hear terms like 'failure', 'scandal' or 'how could this happen?', which do not reflect reality.' Can you talk to me in numbers? 'In this war, the number of rocket and missile interceptions was of 4-digits, and by the time this article is published there will be another 200, these are huge amounts. In terms of UAVs and other flying objects, the interceptions are 3-digits.' 'Things keep changing' The main problem, as mentioned, is that UAVs are difficult to detect. The Israeli radar systems are very advanced, but they know how to detect planes, missiles, and even rockets of a certain size. That's what they were designed for, as this was the main threat. But UAVs, especially the smallest ones, are slow speed, flying at low altitudes deep inside valleys in the Galilee, and since Hezbollah launches them near the border, there is not enough time left to detect them, while they dive toward their targets. Their size is very confusing, and they are also made of a variety of materials. In the first months of the war, there were cases where the Iron Dome radar detected a UAV threat in the north which turned out to be innocent migrating cranes, says an officer involved in the production of radars. 'It happened that we shot at flocks of cranes mistakenly identified as aircraft infiltration, and we launched Iron Domes and David's sling interceptors.' 'Our main problem is detection because when we don't see, we don't shoot', says Brigadier General (res.) Kochav. 'It is difficult to detect UAVs because they fly below the radar and leave a low radar signature. They do not have much metal, so a radar designed to detect an aircraft by its metal, fails to identify the drone, and if you lower the sensitivity of the radar, then many false alarms are triggered. Therefore, the main challenge is detection. It is possible to detect them by observation, or by acoustic radars, as was done in World War II, or using electronic warfare by receiving GPS signals, but it's very difficult', he adds. 'Furthermore, we may detect the drone, but it will be hard to follow it because it flies slowly compared to a rocket or an airplane. And if we've already managed to track it, it's not certain that we'll be able to launch a fighter plane to intercept it, bearing in mind that air defense systems are not deployed everywhere. Besides, we might not even know whose drone it is.' What do you mean? 'If a rocket is launched at you, for example, it must be the enemy's. But how can you tell whom a drone or another flying device belongs to? It might belong to Metula's standby security squad. Moreover, regulation issues also pose a problem. Any child can buy a drone and equip it with explosives. I'm not trying to make excuses. The result is not good enough. We need 100 percent success, but because Iron Dome's success rate is 95% or more, then 75% is not acceptable.' It's maybe 75% now. But what will happen in the event of a swarm attack of dozens, maybe hundreds of UAVs simultaneously launched toward a certain target? Does this sound like an extreme scenario? 'In my view, an extreme scenario would involve a simultaneous attack, by Hezbollah, Syria, Iran, and Yemen, launching both cruise and surface-to-surface missiles and flying devices, using different methods, some electric, some motorized, some armed, some precise. This may sound like a far-fetched scenario, but I can't say 'This will never happen'. There is no perfect airtight defense, and there is no solution available for every scenario. However, our air defense system is one of the best in the world, and if citizens are under attack, they'd better be here than in Beirut, Damascus, or Tehran. Is this an existential threat? No. Also, dozens of drones do not pose an existential threat. It's not good when such an aircraft crashes in Tel Aviv. But let's calm down.' Prof. Daniel Weihs, Head of the Autonomous Systems and Robotics Program at the Technion, has been eating, breathing, and planning drones for 50 years. And yet, he admits that he too only recently realized the potential of the threat. 'No one, including me, thought they could use it against us. Only in the last few months did I realize it, as it started to become real and not just an episode.' So, what do we do? 'I know that now they are working frantically to find solutions, including those that I can't disclose. We are a country that has developed drones and UAVs more than any other country, the problem is that we thought we were the only ones doing it, and we did not prepare ourselves for an attack.' In the meantime, the security system does not have a complete solution for UAVs, certainly not at the level of the Iron Dome system. Dr. Liran Antebi, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies INSS, believes that it's not just the IDF's responsibility. 'After all, the IDF does not budget itself,' she says. 'There is a great deal of blame on Israel's decision-makers. There were several years when Israel lacked an approved state budget, which made it impossible to build military strength. Today there are excellent systems, but they are not suitable for UAVs.' And meanwhile, time passes. 'The time that has passed between the war in Ukraine, the October 7 massacre, and today, was preparing ourselves better for such a challenge, and we are closing the gap today, while under fire when it could have been done when we were not at war.' The Directorate of Defense, Research, & Development (DDR&D) at the Ministry of Defense, is not worried about looking for 'solutions under fire'. We work better when we're under pressure. That's the Israeli nature', says an official in DDR&D. However, it would have been better to find solutions for UAV threats beforehand. 'Over the years, the security system has faced multiple and diverse threats. But things keep changing. The Iron Dome system is constantly improving, because the UAV is also changing in terms of communication, color, and power source; today it runs on fuel and tomorrow it's electric. We have to adjust to these changes. But we have some solutions in store, and we believe we are headed in the right direction.' The quick solution and the open hole The need for quick solutions to handle UAV threats led the defense establishment to re-use the old Vulcan cannon which had been in service with the Israel Air Force in the past and received modifications as the 'Racquet' variant. It is a six-barrel rotary cannon able to fire 22mm 6,000 rounds per minute. This cannon was stationed on top of an armored personnel carrier (APC), originally designed to shoot down aircraft, mainly slow ones, and surfboards. As the planes became faster, and the threats became missiles and rockets, its use decreased, until it was retired in 2006 after the Second Lebanon War. Now the security establishment is considering reusing the Vulcan. The UAVs fly slowly enough, and this is a relatively cheap solution, although the problem of detection remains. It will probably be designated to protect military facilities. In May, for example, a Hezbollah UAV hit the large Sky Dew observation balloon located near the Golani junction in the north. It's possible that some Vulcans could have protected it. 'The Vulcan was very useful in the Yom Kippur War, it was a fantastic weapon,' recalls Brigadier General (Res.) Kochav. Is this the solution? Vulcan from a generation ago? 'Even the Vulcan will not perform 100 percent. It will add 5-10%. But eventually, the drone is made up of an engine and a propeller. It's a very simple engine. In terms of the aviation world, a UAV is going backward, so the anti-aircraft missile is also going backward. But make no mistake, there are also other methods, some are classified.' The official in the DDR&D also assures that Israel is developing interception solutions for UAVs. 'There are technologies in Israel's arsenal that have not yet been deployed. We have already spent hundreds of millions of shekels on solutions to the threats of drones and UAVs. Besides, Iron Dome, Barak (a defense system against naval missiles), and also pilots, know how to intercept these threats, as they resemble military UAVs. The challenge is posed by radio-controlled planes, kites, and products that one can buy on AliExpress. In that case, we take measures that are more suitable for drones.' Prof. Weihs from the Technion emphasizes that the solution for UAVs involves money. If a UAV costs a few thousand dollars, but intercepting it costs ten times as much, this is a problem. 'So, one of the challenges is not how to take down drones, but rather to take them down cheaply,' he explains. 'You use fighter jets or Iron Dome, which cost a lot of money, against a small, cheap aircraft. If something costs ten thousand dollars and you use a hundred thousand dollars to shoot it down, it won't last long. And there's another problem. Once you launch interceptors above a populated area, pieces of the interceptors can fall and injure people.' So, what can be both cheap, effective and safe? 'Disruptions, for example. But to disrupt drones, one has to be familiar with the system. The disruption should focus specifically on the direction of the UAV. Too much disruption might act against you as well. This is one of the problems. On the other hand, if you try to disrupt at a great distance, the power is lessened.' Can this also help us in the event of a swarm drone attack? 'It's difficult, but possible. A swarm is centralized, so you can transmit the disruption to focus only on it.' In the end, everyone hopes that the 'Magen Or' laser system will be operational soon and could provide a solution to the UAV threat. The system, which will be Israel's first air defense layer, will launch a powerful laser beam toward the UAV during its flight. The laser is supposed to produce a high temperature, thus causing the drone to explode in the air or it will be taken down. It's a relatively cheap solution (each laser launch will cost about a thousand dollars, compared to about $50,000 interceptor of the Iron Dome). However, the system is still in experimental phases, and the best-case scenario will be operational next year. 'The goal of the Ministry of Defense is to deploy a powerful laser system as part of the Iron Dome architecture,' explains an official from the Ministry of Defense. How will it work? 'The 'brain' will make an automatic decision whether to launch a laser beam or an interceptor that hits the target. The British have the DragonFire laser which is under development; the South Koreans introduced it a month ago a small laser, and of course, the Americans, have a mobile laser system. But we are developing a ground laser for air defense purposes. By the way, there are other variations of a powerful laser, which will eventually be able to intercept high-altitude threats, but this will take a decade to develop.' Not everyone is convinced that laser is the magic solution. Lior Segal is CEO at Third Eye Systems. Shortly before October 7, his company developed 'Meduza' an electro-optical scanning system dedicated to drone recognition. 'The arsenal developed by the big industries doesn't know how to respond to small objects (like UAVs),' he says. 'The use of laser, for example, in my eyes is an amazing idea that was efficient ten years ago, but it does not offer a magic solution for UAVs, because it is a super-expensive system, and above all because the northern border is complex in terms of its topography. These are not the plainlands of Ukraine. The laser is 'Nice to have', but it will not solve all our problems. Rafael is unlikely to develop a drone that intercepts a drone; so this is where small companies like ours fit in and make the difference'. Still, the hole in Israel's sky is open. Prof. Weihs however believes, from his many years of experience, and as someone who was there when the first Tadiran-made UAVs went into the air, that 'every threat is eventually resolved,' he states. And then what? 'Then comes the next generation.'

Inside Lebanon with IDF reservists: 'We are here to do what we di...	The 646th Reserve Brigade uncovered Hezbollah's Radwan Force plan to invade the Galilee, dismantling extensive weapon stockpiles and infrastructure just hundreds of meters from the border; 'Even our emergency reserves don’t have vests fully loaded with magazines and grenades at this scale,' says one soldier A short drive separates Israel's western Galilee from a Lebanese village harboring terrorist strongholds, where the IDF’s 646th Battalion is gathering massive caches of weapons. A year after the reserve paratroopers defended Kibbutz Be’eri near Gaza, they now find themselves conducting offensive operations in Lebanese villages. 'Last year, on Simchat Torah, we were in defensive mode. Now we're on the offensive,' said Col. Elad Shoshan, who became battalion commander just a week before the war began in October 2023. In the past year, Shoshan and his troops fought in Gaza's border region, Jenin, Nur a-Shams, and Rafah. Most recently, they had been stationed in northern Israel, poised for this moment—to cross the border and restore the peace and security lost to tens of thousands of displaced Israelis. 'Just as we defeated the enemy in Gaza, we're here to do the same in the north,' Shoshan said. 'We're dismantling enormous terror infrastructure, weapons caches beyond comprehension.' Troops who left behind families, careers, and lives now cross into Lebanon to change the situation on the ground. Shoshan noted, 'Ultimately, civilians rely on us—this is our army. There's no other military, and they know they can depend on us.' Across the border, I saw soldiers deeply engaged and surprisingly upbeat. Their mission is difficult and high-risk, yet immensely rewarding. Many sent messages of appreciation to families who celebrated the recent holidays alone, awaiting their return. 'Our reservists are both the citizens calling for action and the soldiers executing it,' Shoshan said. 'They’re here, answering each call, leaving entire lives behind to do their part.' Shoshan, who grew up in the Gaza-adjacent Moshav Yated, has lost friends and comrades in battles over the past year. Among them was Col. Aliim Saad, deputy commander of Brigade 300, who died in an encounter with terrorists that infiltrated Israel from a village near Adamit on October 9, 2023, along with two members of his command team. 'We have unfinished business with Hezbollah,' Shoshan said. 'Today, we’ve taken back the village where that cell launched attacks last year. We’re uncovering weaponry stockpiles large enough to arm an entire battalion, stored just 500 meters from our border. Every street and home here was filled with equipment, ready for an attack on Israel. And this is just one of many positions Hezbollah prepared in its planned assault on the Galilee.' Driving through the village paths, soldiers march past houses, securing and neutralizing terror sites. The IDF, now operating with five brigades along Lebanon's border, aims to eliminate Hezbollah’s capabilities, enabling displaced residents in the north to return home only when the threat is eradicated. At a command post, soldiers unload large quantities of weapons and gear uncovered in homes and underground facilities nearby. In recent weeks, they discovered a vast underground complex meant for Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, complete with bunk beds, supplies, weapons, and launch sites abandoned during their retreat. 'Look at what we’ve found in just the past two hours,' Shoshan said, pointing to piles of combat vests packed with grenades and magazines, each labeled with a fighter’s name. 'Even in our own reserves, we don’t have vests this fully equipped,' he admitted. Next to the vests lay stacks of kneepads, uniforms, winter gear, tactical helmets, and advanced night vision devices. They also found rocket launchers, shells, anti-tank missiles, machine guns, explosives, and countless rounds of ammunition, some clearly marked as coming from Moscow, Russia. 'In these fortified combat zones Hezbollah built—some just 50 meters from our border—we found fighting trenches and mines ready to be deployed,' Shoshan added. 'Hezbollah operatives could have approached the border in civilian clothing, armed and ready within minutes.' 'I never expected this scale in a small Sunni village,' he said. In some houses, troops were laying explosives for detonation as I crossed back over the border, seeing a massive gray cloud appear in the distance. 'To the people of northern Israel, this is how we’re dismantling Hezbollah’s offensive network,' he stated. In the sky to our south, within Israeli territory, interceptor trails lit up as they countered another rocket barrage from deep inside Lebanon, severely injuring a Nahariya resident. More than 100 rockets had been launched just before the holiday. As I looked up in frustration, Shoshan explained, 'We're not here to occupy all of Lebanon. Our mission is to dismantle enemy infrastructure and remove any threat near the border. The IDF has nearly completed this task.' According to him, 'Thousands of Hezbollah fighters and leaders have been neutralized, and their long-range launch capabilities are diminished, but that alone won’t stop the fire from Lebanon. It will require a binding agreement to make clear the consequences of non-compliance. If that fails, the IDF will respond forcefully. We can no longer rely on external enforcement, as we did after 2006. We’ll take full responsibility this time.' Just before heading home, I met Maj. A, deputy commander of 420th Battalion and resident of Kiryat Shmona. A month ago, at the start of this ground maneuver in Lebanon, I interviewed him near his hometown. 'The people here aren’t interested in strategy or tactics; they just want the Hezbollah threat gone—an objective only achieved by pushing in and clearing out,' he had told me then. Now, with a look of relief, he’s beginning to envision a future where he can persuade his wife and six children to return home after the war. 'It’s unbelievable to think that we lived here on a powder keg,' he said. 'We thought we were in the safest place, but our home was actually one of the most dangerous in the world. Hezbollah made a grave miscalculation by joining Hamas's attack, pushing the army to intervene. Without this response, we would’ve faced another failed model like Resolution 1701, risking a future surprise attack. Compared to what they had prepared for us here, Hamas was a mere warm-up.'

Macron’s Dirty Game: The price of silence on Hezbollah	A report by journalist Georges Malbrunot claims that Rodolphe Saadé, owner of BFM TV and CMA-CGM, secured a billion-dollar contract to rebuild the Beirut port market after the 2020 blast in exchange for Macron's silence on Hezbollah’s weapons, avoiding French taxes France’s recent hostility towards the Jewish state may be motivated by an additional layer of corruption, a respected French journalist has revealed. Renowned journalist at Le Figaro and Middle East expert, Georges Malbrunot, made waves after he brought attention to the secret deal allegedly made in 2020 between French President Emmanuel Macron and Hezbollah in Lebanon — reported both in his book and in Le Figaro. Malbrunot reported that the deal allegedly ensured Rodolphe Saadé, owner of BFM TV and the French maritime transport company CMA-CGM, received the contract to rebuild the market of the port of Beirut after the deadly Beirut Blast in 2020, in exchange for Macron’s silence when it comes to Hezbollah’s weapons. This was a deal worth billions of dollars and one that also allowed Saadé to avoid French taxes on much of the deal. In his book, Malbrunot quotes Hezbollah’s Mohammed Raad who met with Macron during his visit to Lebanon in 2020 in a then unprecedented meeting between a Western democratic state and a terrorist organization: 'Emmanuel Macron recognizes the existence of Hezbollah in the region and its importance, which is very important to us…' Malbrunot further quotes a Lebanese source close to Hezbollah who stated, 'The French had told us that Emmanuel Macron would not address the issue of our weapons…' Malbrunot notes that Saadé, who traveled to Lebanon with Macron during that same time period, also offered to send his private plane to Hezbollah backed Lebanese Minister of Transportation Ali Hamieh, to bring him to Marseille to close the contract. In the end, CMA-CGM did win the contract, and according to Mabrunot citing Lebanese sources this week, Hamieh was indeed sent Saadé’s plane following the completion of the lucrative business deal. If confirmed, which appears likely given Malbrunot’s sources, the secret pact demonstrates profound corruption at the highest levels in France and can explain France’s recent hostility towards Israel’s actions in Lebanon — including the condemnation of Israel’s operations in Gaza and Lebanon, the call for of an arms embargo of Israel, accusations that Israel is 'intentionally' targeting UNIFIL troops, and the exclusion of Israel from the recent Euronaval defense show conference in France. This week France also pledged to provide $100 million in aid to Lebanon after Prime Minister Netanyahu and French President Macron exchanged tense words regarding Israeli military actions in Lebanon, in which Macron accused Israel of 'sowing barbarism.' Macron’s increased hostility to Israel was also met with harsh condemnation from Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant who wrote on X, 'Macron's actions are a disgrace to the French nation and the values of the free world, which he claims to uphold…' In response to the publication of the discrete pact back in 2020, Macron had a public altercation with Malbrunot in which he harshly criticized the journalist calling his report 'irresponsible for France, irresponsible for those concerned here, and serious from an ethical point of view.' However several years later, it seems Malbrunot’s report proved accurate based on the evidence thus far. It appears that the French President has put the corporate profits of CGM-CMA above the security of Lebanon and Israel alike — and in doing so has legitimized the Iranian backed terror group Hezbollah, despite their hijacking of the Lebanese government and terrorist activities. As such, it shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone to see Macron making the kind of biased and unfounded accusations he has made in recent months against Israel.

War in the north through camera lens of a mental health officer	Guy Shmueli serves as a reserve mental health officer at an IDF base, and in his spare time, he pulls out his camera to document small moments that, through his talent, transform into moving and inspiring images; 'Photography is a form of therapy for me amid the ongoing tension of this period' he says The war has entered its second year, and Guy Shmueli, a reserve mental health officer serving at an IDF base in northern Israel, continues to capture moments of humanity and normalcy amid a complex and tense reality through his camera lens. 'Photography is a form of therapy for me during this ongoing tension, helping me find the 'human,' the 'warm,' and the beautiful, alongside the complex emotions,' Guy said. 'I hope my photos convey at least part of my experience.' What does a mental health officer do during such a sensitive time? 'The role of a mental health officer in wartime consists of two main parts: one involves systemic work with groups of commanders and soldiers, providing mental preparation talks, tools to identify emotional difficulties, and guidance on initial mental health assistance and debriefing after significant events. The second part focuses on individual work with soldiers experiencing emotional challenges who require support. Amid all this, I move around and take pictures as a way to maintain my mental health—capturing human moments within the routine of war.'

Iran’s imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate sentenced to another...	Free Narges Coalition says Narges Mohammadi was sentenced on Oct. 19 to an additional 6 months in prison on the charge of 'disobeying and resisting orders' Iranian authorities have issued an additional six-month prison sentence against Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, a group campaigning for the activist said. The Free Narges Coalition said in a statement on Thursday that Mohammadi was sentenced on Oct. 19 to an additional six months in prison on the charge of 'disobeying and resisting orders.' According to the statement, the charge was brought after Mohammadi staged a protest against the execution of another political prisoner in the women’s ward of Evin Prison on Aug.6. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003. Mohammadi, 52, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and years behind bars. She is being held at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison, which houses political prisoners and those with Western ties. She already had been serving a 30-month sentence, to which 15 more months were added in January. Iran’s government has not acknowledged her additional sentencing. The latest order reflects the Iranian theocracy’s anger that she was awarded the Nobel prize in October 2023 for years of activism despite a decades-long government campaign targeting her. Mohammadi was a leading light for nationwide, women-led protests sparked by the death last year of a 22-year-old woman in police custody that have grown into one of the most intense challenges to Iran’s theocratic government. That woman, Mahsa Amini, had been detained for allegedly not wearing her headscarf to the liking of authorities. The statement demanded Mohammadi’s unconditional release, saying her health situation has deteriorated drastically during her long incarceration and she is suffering from heart disease.

Day by day for a year: Inside the spy ring’s surveillance operati...	From observation balloons to air force bases, Iron Dome batteries to the ports of Ashdod, Haifa and Eilat—22-page indictment details surveillance photos taken by northern residents charged with espionage for Iran, documenting their activities nearly daily A 22-page indictment filed Friday charges seven northern Israeli residents with espionage for Iran, detailing an alleged year-long surveillance operation during which they reportedly photographed sensitive military and strategic sites across Israel. The seven suspects allegedly operated as a cell recruited by an Iranian agent, collecting information and taking photos of key military bases and infrastructure. These included air force bases, Iron Dome defense batteries, ports and major highways, among other sensitive sites, prosecutors said. The group’s suspected leader, Aziz Nisanov, 43, from Haifa, allegedly maintained contact with two Iranian handlers, recruiting additional members for the cell. His deputy, Alexander Sadikov, 58, also from Haifa, was reportedly responsible for coordinating assignments and distributing payments. Other defendants include Nisanov’s son, Yigal Nisan, 20; Vyacheslav Gushchin, 46, of Haifa; Yevgeny Yoffe, 47, from Nof HaGalil; and two minors aged 16 and 17.

IDF names 3 fallen soldier in northern Gaza Strip battles	The tank in which Captain Barak Israel Sagan, Sergeant Ido Ben Zvi, and Sergeant Hillel Ovadia were in was hit by a powerful explosive device, and another soldier was injured in the incident The IDF reported Friday that Captain Barak Israel Sagan, aged 22, from Petah Tikva, Sergeant Ido Ben Zvi, aged 21, from Shomrat, and Sergeant Hillel Ovadia, aged 22, from Jerusalem, all soldiers from the 196th Battalion's Tank Commanders Course, 460th Brigade, fell during combat in the northern Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the war, 765 IDF soldiers have been killed in battle. The incident occurred around 5 am when a Merkava Mark 4 tank was heavily damaged, likely by a powerful explosive device, and in the incident another soldier was injured. The force had been operating against a renewed Hamas stronghold in a refugee camp at the city’s center, previously maneuvered by the 98th Division months ago. The 460th Brigade is one of three brigades operating in Jabaliya for roughly a month amid renewed Hamas activity in the northern Gaza Strip city. Though most Jabaliya residents have ultimately evacuated the area, which is encircled by the IDF, several thousand Gazans remain, and the raid is expected to continue for several weeks, according to estimates. Since the operation began about a month ago, the IDF reports that around 45,000 Gazans have been evacuated from the encircled area in Jabalia. The data also shows that IDF forces have detained 300 terror suspects through checkpoints set up around Jabalia. In the past 24 hours alone, the IDF says it has killed about 50 militants, part of hundreds killed in the area over the last month. Earlier on Friday, the military also reported that five troops were killed in South Lebanon fighting when a building they were in was bombed. The soldiers are Major (Res.) Dan Maori, Captain (Res.) Alon Safrai, Warrant Officer (Res.) Omri Lotan, Warrant Officer (Res.) Guy Idan, and Master Sergeant (Res.) Tom Segal.

2 critically hurt dozens wounded in rocket fire to Galilee	IDF says a barrage of 30 rockets targeted the town of Majd al-Kurum, some were intercepted but others landed causing the critical injuries; an 80-year-old man was in serious condition, MDA says At least eight people were hurt, two critically in a rocket attack on Friday.

Senior Hamas official rejects reported partial deal for Gaza	Osama Hamdan says Israel attempts to work around basic demands to withdraw its troops and end the war Osama Hamdan a senior member of the Hamas terror group on Friday rejected a proposal for a 'small deal,' that would see the release of some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Families of hostages said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told them during his visit to Israel earlier in the week that he was trying to secure an initial deal to 'test the waters' and see who can now speak for Hamas after the killing of its leader Yahya Sinwar. Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the first big U.S. push for a Middle East ceasefire since Israel killed the leader of Hamas last week - and the last attempt before a presidential election that could upend U.S. policy. The two men met for 2.5 hours before the secretary met with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Speaking to the Hezbollah-affiliated al-Mayadeen network, Hamdan said Israel was trying to work around the Hamas terms for a deal that would include a withdrawal of troops and an end to the war. 'Israel wants to get some hostages in exchange for a few days of calm without committing to ending the war and pulling out its troops. Hamas rejects the proposals that do not meet our basic demands,' he said.

Russia helps Houthis attack Western vessels in Red Sea, report	Russian satellite data given to the rebels in Yemen by IRGC members, allows a broader area to be attacked and serves Putin's strategic aim to destabilize the Middle East by prolonging the war Russia provided targeting data for Yemen’s Houthi rebels to target ships in the Red Sea, the Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday, as Russian President Vladimir Putin strengthened his ties with Iran and worked to further destabilize the Middle East. The Houthi rebels who have been targeting maritime traffic since the outbreak of the war, claiming to support Hamas in Gaza, were given satellite data from Moscow that enabled them to increase their attacks in a broader area, the Journal reported citing two senior European security sources and another person in the know. One of the sources said the data was provided to the Houthis by members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who were embedded with the rebel group. According to the paper, the assistance to the Houthis demonstrated how far Putin was willing to go to undermine the West's political and economic order and to destabilize the Middle East and Asia. According to analysts, by prolonging the war in the region, Moscow was forcing Washington to allocate resources and concentrate its attention away from Russia and China. 'For Russia, any flare-up anywhere is good news, because it takes the world’s attention further away from Ukraine and the U.S. needs to commit resources—Patriot systems or artillery shells—and with the Middle East in play, it’s clear where the U.S. will choose,' said Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a think tank based in Berlin. Russia has increased its cooperation with Iran and North Korea and has involved them in the war in Ukraine. Both countries have supplied the Russians with ammunition, drones and missiles and North Korea also sent some 3,000 of its soldiers to train in Russia. According to U.S. and South Korean officials, the assistance is vital for the Russians who are suffering a shortage of manpower and weapons and contributes to Russia's strategic aims in the Middle East.

Spy ring provides photos, intel, on orders from Iran	Seven members of the group are charged with aiding and abetting the enemy in time of war and could face life in prison; among missions they carried out are photographing military bases and strategic civilian infrastructure Members of an Iranian spy ring were indicted on Friday on charges of aiding the enemy in time of war, carrying a penalty of life in prison. The seven, including a father and his two sons, photographed military and strategic installations on orders from Iranian intelligence handlers for two years, before being caught. According to court filings, the five adults and two minors photographed the air bases at Nevatim, Ramat David, Tel Nof and Palmachim, as well as other bases around the country including the Glilot complex north of Tel Aviv. They also photographed Iron Dome missile defense system batteries in the Haifa area, government buildings in Haifa, the ports of Haifa, Ashdod and Eilat, the Hadera power plant, and the IDF observation balloon in the Golani Junction area. The suspected leader of the group is Aziz Nisanov, 43 from Haifa who was in contact with two Iranian handlers and enlisted the other members of the spy ring. His deputy was Alexander Sadikov, 58 also from Haifa who ran the group's operation and handed out assignments to its members. One of the minors indicted is charged with carrying out most photographing missions and sending the images to the Iranian handlers. Other members of the group are Yigal Nisan, 20 Nisanov's son, Vyacheslav Guschin, 46 from Haifa and Yevgeni Ioffe, 47 from Nof Hagalil, and another minor. They are charged by Haifa prosecutors of carrying out missions for two years, for Iranian intelligence for the purpose of gathering intelligence for Iran on military installations and civilian infrastructure and surveillance of Israelis. They were instructed to photograph the Nevatim airbase one day after Iran's April attack on Israel. They were sent exact locations of sites, maps and aerial photographs and on some occasions were told the exact locations from which to take the pictures. One of the underage defendants was the locations that would be required for future missions, including the Golani training base's dining room which was hit in a deadly drone strike earlier this month and a defense industry site in the north. Nisanov was also asked to gather information on a lecturer at Haifa University who was a gas engineer and an expert on the Caucasus, including her schedule, her family, what car she drove and more. According to the indictment, one of the Iranian handlers asked Nisanov to attend and photograph the opening of the Azerbaijan embassy in Tel Aviv in March 2023 after he disclosed that his mother had been invited to attend. The event was closed and Nisanov's mother took pictures of the opening, which he then sent to his handler. In September, before the ring was arrested, Nisanov was asked to rent a yacht and sail to Cyprus to film the port there and the maritime rout from Cyprus to Haifa. After enquiring about the rental of a boat or alternatively training as a captain, Nisanov relayed the estimated cost to his handler, who then scrapped the plan. The indictment described another mission the group was given in September which was to photograph a soccer match and training sessions for adults and children at the soccer stadium in Beer Sheva. They were also asked to take pictures of the city's museum and the nearby community of Lahav, including its streets, its fences and areas around it. Nisanov informed his handlers that he had been invited as a musician to play in an event honoring the Bukhara community, that was to be attended by President Issac Herzog and members of the government. He provided the list of attendees and a description of who they are and was asked to photograph them but was arrested before the event.

Iran prepares for war with Israel if strike significant, report	Khamenei instructs the military to prepare optional retaliation plans if IDF inflicts significant damage, including the launch of 1,000 ballistic missiles, disruption to the world's energy supplies in maritime traffic in Persian Gulf and Straits of Hormuz Iran was preparing for war with Israel, the New York Times reported overnight, claiming Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei gave the order to prepare to respond to any Israeli attack, proportionately. The report also claimed that if the Israeli attack on Iran is relatively contained, Tehran may not launch a counterattack. The Times said Khamenei instructed the military to prepare different plans to respond to an Israel strike on Iran. Four officials in the Islamic Republic told the paper that if an Israeli attack would cause substantial damage, Iran would respond but if the attack is limited to military installations and weapons stores, there may be no Iranian retaliation. The sources, two of them identified as members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that an Israeli strike that would cause substantial damage could be responded to by a barrage of up to 1,000 ballistic missiles; escalated attacks by Iranian proxies in the region; and disrupting the flow of global energy supplies and maritime traffic through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Officials in Israel denied reports in the London Times claiming an attack on Iran was postponed because of classified documents leaked from the Pentagon, outlining Israeli preparations for the strike. Intelligence sources told the Times that the leak required Israel to change parts of the attack plans. Israel planned a strike on IRGC and military installations and promised the Biden administration that it would not target Iran's nuclear program or its oil industry. Michael Allen, a partner at Beacon Global Strategies, a security advisory firm, and former National Security Council official in the George W. Bush administration told the Washington Post that Israel may choose to target military sites rather than oil installations because it may hamper future Iranian strikes. 'They’re not going to waste a bullet,' Allen said. 'I think it’s going to be very purposeful targeting.' He said adding that targeting Iran’s launch sites would be 'the most logical option for Israel if it wants to degrade Iran’s abilities to strike back.' The post said Iran has a handful of launch sites, including the Tabriz, Bakhtaran and Imam missile bases in the west and Bandar Abbas in the south, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a Washington think tank. The launch sites in western Iran are key, as they are closer to Israel.

Five IDF soldiers fall in South Lebanon	Soldiers killed when a building explodes in an attack while a convoy of supplies arrives; 19 others are hurt including four suffering serious injuries; IDF probing mass casualty incident The IDF said five of its soldiers were killed in South Lebanon fighting when a building they were in was bombed. The soldiers are Major (Res.) Dan Maori, Captain (Res.) Alon Safrai, Warrant Officer (Res.) Omri Lotan, Warrant Officer (Res.) Guy Idan, and Master Sergeant (Res.) Tom Segal. Nineteen others were hurt in the blast, four of them suffering serious injuries. The mass casualty incident occurred when a convoy carrying supplies arrived near the border with Israel at an area where the forces had been operating to clear the area from Radwan forces. The military was investigating whether a mortal or a heavy rocket was fired at the building housing a large number of troops despite the presence of forces on the ground to alert against attacks. The IDF said that anti-tank missile attacks have increased in the past week.

Hostages are important bargaining chips,' Sinwar writes	The documents published in East Jerusalem paper refer to scriptures from the Quran on how hostages are to be treated; Al Quds does not detail where they were found, or how the publication received them but claims they are in Yahya Sinwar's handwriting The Palestinian al Quds newspaper published in east Jerusalem revealed documents it described as instructions left by slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar written by his own hand in which he refers to the hostages abducted by Hamas, describes them and how they are to be treated. The paper published three such documents written over a year ago, before the only hostage release, last November. They include instructions to protect the hostages, details about them and the names of 11 women that have since been released. The first documents include scriptures from the Quran referring to how hostages are to be treated. 'They must be protected, they are an important bargaining chip,' he wrote. The second document lists hostages by gender and age and whether they are soldiers or civilians. It lists five men over the age of 60, ten men under 60, three soldiers, three women under 40 marked X, presumably dead, and four women over 40. 25 in total, 22 of them alive. According to the document, 25 hostages were being held in central Gaza including six soldiers, 12 reservists, the oldest being 53, and seven young people aged 21 to 27. In Rafah, two men over the age of 60, were held along with four Bedouins, one aged 55 and the others 18-22. In the Gaza City district – six soldiers, male and female and three reservists were held along with four young people and and a 66-year-old Bedouin. In total the document lists 71 hostages. The third document includes a list of female hostages, most elderly and all eventually released including their ages and if they had non-Israeli nationalities. Al Quds did not report where the documents were found or how they were received by the paper.

Over 13 airstrikes target Dahieh, Saudi media says while Lebanese outlets report three journalists working for the Hezbollah-affiliated al Mayadeen network are killed in an Israeli strike in South Lebanon Israeli air defenses intercepted a surface-to-surface missile launched from Lebanon on Friday, off the coast, south of Haifa. No injuries were reported. Hezbollah targeted the Upper Galilee region with rocket fire in the early morning hours. The IDF said in a statement that its forces killed a commander of Hezbollah's Radwan force in the fighting in South Lebanon. 'Abbas Adnan Moslem, the Commander of the Aitaroun area in Hezbollah’s Radwan unit was responsible for carrying out numerous terror attacks against communities in northern Israel and IDF troops,' the military said adding that over 200 Hezbollah targets were hit in the past day. Lebanese media reported on Friday that three journalists working for the Hezbollah-affiliated al-Mayadeen network were killed in an Israeli strike on a building in South Lebanon overnight. According to a report in Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel, the IDF conducted over 13 airstrikes on Beirut's Dahieh quarter, the Hezbollah stronghold in the Lebanese capital.

Hezbollah converted villages in southern Lebanon to command cente...	IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari says Hezbollah built underground command centers for the Radwan unit, with entrances intentionally placed beneath residential buildings The IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed Thursday that Hezbollah's Radwan Force turned civilian villages in southern Lebanon into fortified combat zones and military staging areas concealed beneath dense vegetation. 'For years, Hezbollah has been planning how it would launch an incursion into our territory on command, and now we are exposing their strategy,' said Hagari. 'For the past month, our forces have been operating in villages and areas near the border to push Hezbollah away from the front line,' he said. 'The terror group has built a system of underground combat facilities beneath thick vegetation, where they store various weapons.' Hagari explained that in these areas, Hezbollah has 'hidden' underground command centers for the Radwan unit, with entrances intentionally placed beneath residential buildings as part of their preparation for an attack. 'Over the past year, the Northern Command has carried out a series of strikes and special operations targeting these infrastructures in southern Lebanon to weaken Hezbollah's capabilities and eliminate the threat to northern residents,' he said. Hagari presented two examples to illustrate what Israeli forces have encountered, showing how Hezbollah has prepared the area in the Lavona region of southern Lebanon as a forward base for potential incursions. 'Hezbollah has constructed a network of underground combat facilities beneath dense vegetation. Our forces have operated in the area over the past month, clearing it of terrorist infrastructure, including the dense vegetation,' he noted. In adjacent areas, he mentioned, living quarters with beds and combat equipment were found concealed in dense foliage near the border. Another example highlighted was the IDF's activity in the rural areas of southern Lebanon, where villages have long become Hezbollah strongholds. 'In the village of Mhaibib in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah hid an underground command center for the Radwan unit. The entrances to the command center were deliberately located beneath residential homes. Along hundreds of meters of underground pathways, we discovered long-term living quarters that included bedrooms, kitchens, food supplies, showers, scooters, and a large cache of weapons—all part of their preparation for an attack.' He noted that the forces confiscated and destroyed the weapons found on-site and neutralized the 'main route' of the local tunnel network. 'Hezbollah has built all this over the years and invested substantial resources, and now we are denying them that capability,' Hagari said. 'The underground infrastructures I presented here do not cross into Israeli territory. These are underground staging areas that Hezbollah has built beyond the border as part of their strategy to launch incursions into Israel. So far, we have identified only one tunnel that crossed just a few meters into our territory—and we destroyed it.' He added, 'In the past month alone, we have attacked more than 3,200 targets in southern Lebanon, including around 350 weapons depots.'

Sapir feared suffocation; Staff Sergeant D. found bodies: People ...	Sapir Cohen, freed from Hamas captivity, describes a life devoid of light, plagued by moisture and mold; Staff Sergeant D. shares experiences of engaging terrorists in the tunnels; Prof. Kobi Michael warns that other enemies are focusing on underground warfare; Brigadier General (Res.) Ido Mizrahi evaluates both failures and successes regarding tunnel operations, while Prof. Silvana Fennig examines the long-term psychological effects of this underground existence For two decades the combination of the words 'Hamas Tunnels' has been considered a nightmare for Israelis. Such a tunnel exploded underneath the JVT outpost at the Philadelphi corridor in 2004, killing five soldiers. Such tunnels were used for the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit and the bodies of Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul. At Operation Protective Edge in 2014 Nukhba terrorists infiltrated Israel via such underground tunnel dug from Gaza into Israel, and they were recorded killing Israeli soldiers. On the morning of October 7, 2023, when hundreds of Israeli abductees were being dragged or marched into the Gaza Strip, all Israelis cringed at the thought that within minutes they would be led tens of feet underground. A year has passed, and the horror has not faded. In some respects, and certainly after presenting videos of the dark tunnel where Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat, and Alex Lobanov were murdered at the end of August, the fear has intensified. And yet, since the onset of the ground maneuver about 11 months ago, we know much more about the massive underground network that Palestinian terrorist organizations have dug under the Gaza Strip over the years. This was made possible due to the countless hours of IDF soldiers operating inside it, but tragically more so, thanks to firsthand stories of hostages who have returned, helping to shed light on the life, if you can call it that, inside the tunnels. Here are monologues by five people who summarize what Israel knows about the most significant strategic asset held by the Gazan enemy. I said to the terrorists: Maybe it's better to be down in the tunnel / Sapir Cohen After a long walk, during which I stepped with my bare feet on nails and other unfamiliar objects, I was brought to a place that looked like a shelter, with concrete and thick walls, and I was ordered to enter the elevator. The 'elevator' was a concrete block that somehow moved vertically. I didn't know I was in a tunnel because I entered straight into a space with porcelain paving, but I quickly learned that there are 'tunnels' and there are 'passages between the tunnels', through which one can cross from one space to another. A 'passage' is, for example, the narrow tunnel where the bodies of the six murdered hostages were found at the end of August. These are the narrow, low, and arched passageways that Israelis know from the pictures. After spending a few days in an underground tunnel, I climbed up using a ladder, and I was moved through the passages to houses located above the ground. All the houses I was held in were connected by tunnels. When I stayed in the houses I would hear terrible bombings and thought it would be better to be down, inside the tunnel; but when I told this to the terrorists, their answer was: 'No. If there is a bombing you will suffocate down there.' Still, after a short while, I returned to the underground tunnel. Inside the tunnel, there is no light at all. Sometimes a terrorist would turn on a flashlight, but still, I could see nothing. There is no air either. One of the terrorists had an oxygen cylinder; there was this time when I had trouble breathing so he let me use it. However, when in the tunnel no one can hear you, so you can speak loudly, unless it annoys the terrorist. There were some tunnels with electrical infrastructure, which sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. The senior terrorist who was guarding my group had some knowledge of electricity, so now and then he would fix it. Sometimes there were batteries available, and I also saw generators there, but it didn't help us. The tunnels are damp, and you constantly have to wipe the water that drips from the ceiling onto the walls and floor. The five thin mattresses we slept on were also soaked. The humidity caused mold, and the smell was so terrible that it was impossible to fall asleep. When I went from the houses back to the tunnel I took a Q-tip I found there, and a day later it turned green. People developed skin diseases, and wounds started appearing on their bodies. They scratched because there were lice and fleas, and you couldn't shower. We looked pale, with dark circles under the eyes. In the tunnel, there is nothing to do besides talking to the other hostages. Also, there is no sense of time. At first, I had no idea when it was morning or night because everything looked the same. But the terrorists prayed five times a day, so I was able to tell, roughly, what part of the day it was. The main food you get is pita bread. When there were no pitas, we would eat nothing. Since every tunnel with hostages is located adjacent to a house, one of the terrorists would climb the ladder, take food, and bring it down. There was this time when the house near us was bombed and the children there were seriously injured by shrapnel, so whoever lived there did not allow providing us with any food at all. There was a small refrigerator in the tunnel, but of course, it didn't work. There was also a tap with salted water, and it didn't always work either; so, if the terrorists didn't provide us water - we wouldn't drink. We tried to save food, but the pita would get dry and moldy after a day. Our tunnel had a gas unit, and when it had gas in it, we would heat the pita so it would be easier to bite. We would try to find ways to take food without the terrorists noticing, to hide it and remove the mold from it. The terrorists held daily 'meetings', they would go into a nearby room, so we managed to take pitas and hide them. Still, there were days when there was no light, no electricity, no gas, no water, and no food. We were lucky to have toilets in our tunnel, which was unusual because other groups of hostages didn't have any at all, or they had ones that wouldn't flush. I know that this was the case in the tunnel where they held the elders. There was no medical treatment either. There was a hostage with me whose leg was injured and swollen, and he was limping. There was nothing we could do about it. The tunnels in Gaza are so ramified that even terrorists had trouble finding their way around. You need to have someone who knows it well and can tell where to go and which turn to take. I heard from other hostages that they had to walk underground for hours because the terrorists who held them didn't know how and where to go. Each group of hostages had several terrorists who served as guards. Some terrorists carried their weapons in public and some hid their weapons. Now and then we would hear a weapon being cocked, which is petrifying. We were mostly afraid that Israeli soldiers would try to rescue us because we knew that in this case, the terrorists would shoot at us. All this time I knew I was underground in Gaza and was surrounded by terrorists, but I didn't internalize it. For a certain period, I lived in another world, disconnected, as if something happened to my body. But things change. I met hostages who didn't know what happened to their families, or those whose family members were murdered in front of their eyes, and I felt the need to put my problems aside and help them. I said to myself that no matter what, I would do everything in my power to help, bring them food, and talk to them. That's what kept me going. This has become my life's mission. Sapir Cohen, 30,was abducted on October 7 from her partner's house, Alex (Sasha) Trufanov, in Kibbutz Nir Oz. She was released with his mother Yelena and his grandmother Irena Tati in the final swap deal after spending 55 days in captivity. Her partner Trufanov is still in captivity. Other armies are already learning from us / Prof. Kobi Michael In the Iron Swords War, the IDF was exposed to a different reality in Gaza from the one it once knew, or thought it knew, because IDF's last maneuver in the field occurred a decade earlier, in Operation 'Protective Edge'. They knew that Gaza was networked with tunnels, but never imagined they would discover tunnels in such dimensions in terms of their scope, depth, system, and sophistication, including the connecting points between the various tunnels. They did not know that the underground network allowed Hamas terrorists to enter the tunnel in the Philadelphi corridor and end up above the ground in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. They did not realize that hostages could stay inside for a long period and did not know that they were connected to civilian infrastructures such as hospitals. The professional building of the tunnel network indicates that they used external help and expertise. The IDF needed quite a long learning time to deal with the tunnels that were gradually unfolding, since entering the tunnels is complex to begin with – usually via hidden, narrow, and sometimes very deep shafts. But over time they managed to deal with it, and could also tell the difference between tactical tunnels that were used for combat and attacks, and strategic tunnels that included equipped and advanced command and control rooms, which supported the tactical tunnels and were essential for Hamas activity. The next challenge the IDF had to face was how to destroy the tunnels. After various strategies were examined, such as flooding, which was proved unsuccessful, other methods were developed, apart from the use of explosives. The IDF continues to this day to uncover the underground infrastructure, but it is complex due to the enormous number of tunnels and their ramified structure. Moreover, the tunnels must first be discovered. The tunnel in Rafah where the bodies of the six hostages were found at the end of August, was unfolded almost by accident since its shaft was hidden inside a children's room in a residential building. Imagine how many more shafts are out there, especially in densely populated or ruined areas. However, the IDF has already learned about the close connection between the civilian infrastructure, the population, and the tunnels. Not only do they know that Gaza citizens participate in the digging, but they know also about the critical importance that Hamas attaches to the symbiosis between life above and below the ground: there may be a shaft in every school and a tunnel under every hospital. The connection between the upper construction and the lower construction adds to the complexity. As a result, the IDF has developed a new theory for underground warfare. There is no other army in the world that faces such a threat at such a level. And apparently, this is not over yet. Until the IDF leaves the Gaza Strip - if they ever will - they will continue to learn, improve, and develop capabilities and new fighting methods. Other armies worldwide are already learning from the IDF. The bad news is that Hamas tunnels are not an unusual phenomenon among our enemies. We discovered the giant tunnels penetrating from Lebanon already in 2018, and only recently, underground routes - albeit short ones - were located in Tulkarm and Jenin as well. This will have consequences on the IDF's forces, which will require more engineering forces, expanding units such as the Yahalom (Special Operations Engineering Unit), and investing in the development of combat measures and methods. Prof. Kobi Michael is a senior researcher at INSS and Misgav Institute I crawled between the crumbling walls / Staff Sergeant D. During the war I did everything in the tunnels - I scanned, destroyed, ran into combats, and even rescued bodies of hostages. On the one hand, fighting underground involves a greater risk, because if something happens you are in trouble: it is complex to get assistance from the outside, and the only ones who can help you are your comrades who are with you. On the other hand, it is a relatively quiet place, and if we reach it, it means that the odds of encountering the enemy there are not high. It wasn't discussed much in Israel, but some fighting in the tunnels of the Gaza Strip took place already a decade ago, in Operation 'Protective Edge'. Based on this experience, among other things, we trained for underground activity long before the 'Iron Swords' war began. Did we know what we were getting ourselves into? We didn't expect everything we saw there this time, but the truth is, there was nothing we encountered that we couldn't handle. Before entering the tunnels, there is excitement among the soldiers. I cannot define it as 'fear', but we feel we were trained for a unique mission and know that we are ready for it despite the dangers involved. Besides, we had time to prepare ourselves mentally, because, in the beginning, we were mostly busy destroying the tunnels that were found. It took a while until we engaged in rescuing and encountering terrorists. Before we enter the tunnels there is a preparation phase. We use technologies and intelligence to understand what is happening down there. Sometimes we know in advance where the rooms of senior officials are located. But still, we enter with caution. The danger is always there. You can always miss a booby trap or confront an ambush at any given moment. I can't remember how many tunnels I entered, but there were lots of them. The sense of danger hovers above you all the time. You feel the sand falling on you, and you see that the walls are shaking. Most tunnels are about 27 inches wide and 5.6 feet high. I have also seen lower ones or ones that are crumbling. Sometimes I would find myself crawling between half-ruined walls that had collapsed inward. On the other hand, there are also large tunnels with rooms, showers, and running water. Once we were surprised to discover a tunnel that had nice toilets, air conditioning, and lots of water. They didn't build it for a week's stay but planned it for years ahead. In the other tunnels the oxygen level is reasonable, and we were able to breathe during the activity, but it is impossible to stay there for a long time. They have mold, gases, and dust. We monitor the air quality when we are inside, and if the oxygen level is too low - we plan. In most tunnels, we don't expect to find hostages alive. We focus on scanning and task completion. But as mentioned, there were cases when we entered and found bodies. Some were in such bad shape that we didn't recognize they were corpses. Once, at a depth of 82 feet, we found corpses in an advanced state of decay inside white sacks. The sight of it doesn’t leave you, especially when it's the first time you have to handle it, but today we are trained. The only difference is the fighting inside a tunnel as compared to fighting outdoors, where you can see at a distance what's ahead of you and sometimes take cover. In the tunnel everything is limited. The terrorists can suddenly surface and strike. Therefore, the fighters who stand first in line know that they are at the greatest risk. If something happens - they get hit first. We mainly engaged in destroying tunnels, one tunnel after the other, either by using explosives that we placed manually, or by airstrikes. But beforehand we do everything in our power to make sure there are no hostages inside; this can take days and thus delay the operation, but there is no other choice. The fear that there might be Israelis inside never leaves you. We still ask ourselves if our operations destroy the tunnels completely or if Hamas can come after we're done, clear some rubble, and reuse them. As far as I can judge, considering my activity since the beginning of the war, we neutralize them completely. Whoever wishes to reuse these tunnels will have to dig and rebuild them. Yes, we discovered an elaborate underground tunnel network in the Gaza Strip, certainly more complex than we expected, but I think we can destroy it all. It's only a matter of time. Staff Sergeant D. is a fighter in an elite unit. Like running up a descending escalator / Brigadier General (res.) Ido Mizrahi Hamas is a sub-state terrorist organization that uses the underground to store its military and other assets. This is their only way to offset the absolute advantages of Israel and the IDF. As much as Israel enhanced its capabilities in technology and the air force - Hamas deepened its capabilities underground and expanded the 'underground infrastructure'. I use this term because it is important to clarify: These are not just tunnels. Many of the important assets and means of Hamas – military headquarters, production workshops, and storehouses - are underground. Handling this subterranean complex requires a continuous learning effort. It is equivalent to running up a descending escalator: you can't stand still. As you level up, the enemy also makes its next move - deeper and more hidden. In the Iron Swords war, we learned how wide and deep this underground network of Hamas is really like. At this stage we have very good control in the field - one should never say 'absolute' - and we use it for learning. This is one of the most beautiful processes I've seen until I finished serving as Commander of the military's Combat Engineering Corp in January 2024; since then I have continued watching it from the outside: a military unit encounters a certain challenge, deals with it, learns lessons from it, the knowledge is passed on to the neighboring units, then to the entire military and civilian system, and then relevant solutions are offered to handle the problem. Sometimes it involves the top of technology and sometimes it uses medieval low-tech. Since the main characteristic of the underground network in Gaza is concealment, it is very difficult to know what is under our feet; therefore, a great effort is invested in gathering intelligence, and technology and in locating and mapping the tunnels, long before the neutralization stage occurs. To neutralize the tunnels, we tried almost every possible solution, be it technological or other, and every idea that came up was granted legal approval by international law. One of the solutions, which was also published in the media, was the 'Atlantis' project, in which we channeled seawater into the tunnels. But the ground in the strip is too sandy and a large part of the water seeped through it. To make it work, you needed a substance that could move and not be absorbed. I will not go into details about how long we tried it and to what extent it eventually helped us. Fighting underground requires unique training. It is not suitable for every soldier. As in many fields in the IDF, here too there is a wide range of skills. That is: some units have undergone a few weeks of basic training in underground warfare, and there are units such as Yahalom (Special Operations Engineering Unit), whose soldiers train for months for tunnel warfare. The training is carried out in special training facilities that simulate an underground infrastructure. In the field, one of the most significant challenges in underground warfare is that once you send a force into the tunnel, it is very difficult to communicate and know what's happening. Fortunately, we are the army of the 'Startup Nation', and after presenting this problem to the defense industry, they came up with a solution, in an impressively short time. This is not a case of 'fire and forget'. Still, this is a very risky fighting, compared to a classic ground operation, but everyone who enters the tunnel is provided with communication devices that enable them to portray a situational picture and also keep the troops safe. We are still using all the knowledge we have accumulated until October 7, 2023, but there have been developments and changes in tactics since then. Every team that has operated underground since then has learned lessons of do's and don'ts. Some of them are tactical, and some are at a higher level, which requires building a new capability, a new technology, to gather new intelligence on a scenario we haven't encountered before. Learning lessons during a war is not obvious. The IDF does it impressively. Brigadier General (res.) Ido Mizrahi is the former Commander of IDF Combat Engineering Corp. No one can tell if the damages caused by the tunnels are reversible / Prof. Silvana Fennig. Many of the returned hostages that were treated by us spent most of their captivity time in houses of families, and they went underground only when bombings were taking place. The time spent in the tunnels must have been terrible for them, partly due to a lack of stimuli and light. The sense of claustrophobia and the lack of air make it difficult not only physically but mainly psychologically. The long-term damages are also mainly mental. Despite the deficiencies and the weight loss, the children did not experience anything physical that might be irreversible, however, the psychological damage is not always reversible. I cannot tell what the future holds for them, but generally speaking, children who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder might experience anxiety and depression even years later. The terrible fear of death may affect one's personality fundamentally. They suffer a complex trauma because they were taken to captivity after experiencing a previous trauma. They were hiding for hours in terrible fear, and after they were pulled out of their hiding place they witnessed murder and horrible sights; with these images in mind, they were taken to Gaza. Everything adds up. Their coping depends on how they spend their time in captivity. If they were with a family there, then the situation is completely different than being alone. The children who were there with their parents experienced a certain sense of security, and this is also true for the adults who went through it along with someone close. This is very helpful for survival; we know it for a fact from both research on the Holocaust and the experience of Yom Kippur War captive soldiers. When the hostages returned, after the celebration and all the excitement around them, they returned to a shattered community, as evacuees, without a home. The gap between the collective joy of millions of Israelis and their individual story is not simple. They continue their life routine while they are no longer in the news headlines, and they are no longer the heroes. We took this into account when we decided to reduce stimuli - including limiting the number of visitors, even the happy ones - because transitions are not easy. We usually operate by evidence-based study rules and techniques with worldwide supporting scientific evidence, but there are no guidelines available for treating children who returned from captivity during a war because it is extremely rare. We knew that we would have to 'learn on the go'. Professionals base their treatment on past studies and professional literature, and here we had nothing to base our work on. In total we received 26 people, 19 of them were children. We built an inpatient care ward for both young and adults, away from the media, to reduce damage. It was a quiet, sterile, and remote area, with as little stimulation and noise as possible. We had to act at their pace, follow them step by step, respect their routines and rituals, and hear and listen, without pre-built formulas. Beyond the obvious physical medical needs, it was important, psychologically speaking, that they return to a place that can provide professional help. But we knew that our help was only temporary. We were debating whether it was right to bring them back home directly from captivity. Unfortunately, most of them didn't have a home to return to, anyway. They were evacuated from their homes.

Smotrich and Ben Gvir criticize Netanyahu over Qatar delegation: ...	Smotrich says Qatar is an enemy state that supports Hamas and backs its positions in negotiations; Ben-Gvir adds Israel must not give Hamas any breathing space, particularly after the elimination of Sinwar Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir voiced Thursday opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's directive to send Mossad head David Barnea to Qatar to advance a possible hostage deal. 'The continued involvement of Qatar in negotiations for the release of hostages is a serious mistake,' Smotrich said. Ben Gvir, who also opposed the previous deal that saw the release of 80 Israeli women and children from captivity, added: 'The dispatch of the negotiation team was not done with the consent of all Cabinet members, and therefore I oppose it. 'I deeply regret the prime minister’s decision to approve the Mossad chief's trip for negotiations with Qatar, ' Smotrich continued. 'Qatar is an enemy state that supports Hamas and backs its positions in negotiations. Its goal is to prevent us from destroying Hamas. Qatar owns Al Jazeera, which severely damages Israel's global image and undermines our existential fight. Nothing good can come from its involvement, and we should reject it outright. The only way to bring the hostages home is through Hamas' surrender, achieved by continuing the military pressure our heroic soldiers are currently applying in northern Gaza.' 'At this critical point in Israel's confrontation with Hamas, particularly after the elimination of Sinwar, we must not give Hamas any breathing space,' Ben-Gvir added. 'We should continue working toward its defeat. That is the surest and safest way to achieve victory and bring the hostages home, not through deals that will allow Hamas to regroup, rebuild its military capabilities, and harm our soldiers again.' He concluded by praising Netanyahu, the IDF, and Israel's security forces for their positive trend over the past two months. 'Israel is acting aggressively and engaging the enemy on multiple fronts, and I urge them to continue this path until total victory.'

IDF eliminates Hamas terrorist, employee of UNRWA involved in Oct...	IDF says Mohammad Abu Itiwi and the terrorists under his command threw grenades into the shelter where partygoers from the Nova music festival were hiding; also directed multiple terror operations against IDF forces operating in Gaza The IDF reported Thursday that the Israeli Air Force, in cooperation with the Shin Bet, eliminated Mohammad Abu Itiwi, a Hamas commander who led the massacre at the Re’im shelter and was also an employee of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. On the day of the October 7 massacre, Abu Itiwi and the terrorists under his command threw grenades into the shelter where partygoers from the Nova music festival were hiding. In one of the most memorable moments from that day, Nahal Brigade soldier Aner Shapira was seen in footage deflecting seven grenades with his hands. The eighth grenade exploded before he could throw it back. Of the 27 people inside the shelter, 16 were murdered, four were kidnapped, and only seven survived. One of those kidnapped, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was later murdered in a tunnel in Rafah. In a statement delivered Thursday, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said, 'We will continue to pursue and reach all those involved in this brutal massacre. We must remember the 101 hostages still held in inhumane conditions in Gaza. We are committed to bringing them home.' A joint statement from the IDF and Shin Bet explained that Abu Itiwi, a commander in Hamas’s Nuhba unit in the Bureij Battalion of the Central Camps Brigade, was targeted and killed on Wednesday in an airstrike by the Israeli Air Force, coordinated with the Gaza Division's fire center. It was noted that Abu Itiwi, who had worked for UNRWA since July 2022, was involved in the murder and kidnapping of Israeli civilians on October 7. During the war, he also directed multiple terror operations against IDF forces operating in Gaza. Following this incident, representatives from the Israeli Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) demanded clarifications from senior international and UN officials regarding the involvement of UNRWA employees in the October 7 massacre and other terror activities against Israel.

Possibility to achieve a decisive outcome in the north' IDF chie...	Halevi adds elimination of Sinwar was not planned, but it wasn't random either, its a result of a methodical approach and pressure on Rafah IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi held a situation assessment at the Jabaliya area in the Gaza Strip, stating that 'in the north, there's a possibility of achieving a decisive outcome. We have thoroughly dismantled Hezbollah’s senior command structure.' Halevi added 'The elimination of Sinwar was not planned, nor were the troops from the 450th Brigade or the tank commander course; they didn’t know who they were targeting. While it wasn’t planned, it was not random either.' 'This methodical approach results from the pressure on Rafah and the dismantling of the Rafah Brigade,' he continued. 'It reflects the regional command's insistence on deploying more troops during this holiday month, pushing forward, maintaining operational control, and confronting the problem directly. It’s a systematic effort, not a coincidence. Determination and persistence are key.' 'They are determined too, but we are much more so. We are better, more justified, and stronger. Another achievement is that Jabaliya is falling, marking a significant psychological blow—both physically and mentally. If we eliminate the Northern Gaza Brigade commander, it will be another significant collapse. I cannot predict what we will encounter tomorrow, but this pressure brings us closer to further achievements.' Meanwhile, U.S. and Israeli negotiators will gather in Doha in the coming days to try to restart talks toward a deal for a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza, officials said on Thursday. Mossad head David Barnea will travel to Doha on Sunday, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, adding that CIA director William Burns would be present for the talks.

Our troops are more reservists than civilians': A year inside Ga...	Photographer Ziv Koren spent the past year documenting the reservists of the 8119th Reserve Battalion, part of the 16th Infantry Brigade, who completed 180 days of duty in three rotations—each time leaving everything behind to defend their homeland 'On that black Saturday, everyone was looking for a way to contribute. But the real challenge is showing up for reserve duty during routine times—in the peak of summer heat or pouring rain, while balancing school deadlines, career, or when your kids are on summer break. The true heroism is being there all the time, and that’s our pride as a brigade—we were ready for the mission,' said Lt. Col. (Res.) Lotem Paran Farah, 45, commander of the 8119th Reserve Battalion, part of the 16th Infantry Brigade, whose soldiers completed 180 days of reserve duty in the past year across three rotations. The 16th Infantry Brigade, also known as the Jerusalem Brigade, was established during Israel’s War of Independence and has participated in every war since. It operates under the Southern Command’s Sinai Division and consists of four infantry battalions and one logistical support battalion. Over the years, its soldiers have fought in key battles, including the liberation of Jerusalem in the Six-Day War and the defensive battles against the Egyptian army along the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur War. On October 7, 2023, its soldiers were called up for a 75-day mission in Gaza. In February, they were summoned for another 45-day reserve stint, with their battalions deployed to the West Bank and the Golan Heights. In July, they embarked on a third deployment—60 days in Gaza. 'The Jerusalem Brigade has been part of many historic moments in Israel’s history,' said Col. Nir Ifergan, 39, who took command of the brigade in June. 'Now, we’re fortunate to be part of writing another chapter.' 'On October 7,' recalled Lt. Col. (Res.) Paran Farah, 'Soldiers arrived even before they were officially called with emergency orders. We faced equipment shortages and maintenance issues, but we knew we had to head south as quickly as possible with whatever we had. People were determined—they grabbed their weapons, helmets, and rushed to the mission.' One of those soldiers was Capt. (Res.) Michal Fadler, 27, a technology and maintenance officer in Battalion 8119. 'I had friends at the Nova festival, and a close friend was killed in the fighting in the south—it was a Saturday filled with fear,' Fadler said. 'But I couldn’t stay away. I knew I had a responsibility.' Fadler, a student from Tel Aviv, is currently hospitalized at Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva, undergoing rehabilitation after being moderately injured during the brigade’s third deployment in August. 'The Humvee in front of me hit a roadside bomb and exploded. I heard a massive blast, and at the same time, a terrorist squad appeared and started shooting at us,' she recounted. 'Leonid, the soldier with me, returned fire. Luckily, he wasn’t hit, but Maj. (res.) Yotam Itzhak Peled and Mordi and Sgt. Maj. (res.) Mordechai Yosef Ben Shoam were killed. Yotam was a beloved and admired commander, and Mordi was a skilled and humble fighter. Their families are a source of strength for us. I hope they never know more sorrow and that they take pride in their heroic sons.' Speaking about her injury, Capt. Fadler said, 'I was hit by shrapnel in the face. My mouth filled with blood, and I could barely speak. I radioed, ‘We’ve been hit, we’ve been ambushed, we’re injured.’ I arrived at Soroka conscious but in moderate condition. I underwent emergency surgery to remove the shrapnel. The injuries to my head affected my jaw, tongue, and neck. I was incredibly lucky that the nerves and spinal cord weren’t damaged. I understand firsthand the danger we’re facing. I’m still in the recovery process, but it’s hard to be in the hospital while our forces are out there. I hope that once I’m rehabilitated, I can return to the brigade.' 'That’s the spirit of our brigade,' Lt. Col. (Res.) Paran Farah said. 'I personally knew and commanded four of the soldiers we’ve lost. They understood the mission and responsibility, even though the cost was difficult and painful. We’re at war, and we know no one else can do this for us. That sense of duty to their comrades and the country is what drives our people.' It isn’t easy to serve 180 days a year and leave your personal life behind at a moment’s notice. 'The balance is broken,' said the brigade’s commander, Col. Ifergan. 'Our soldiers are now more reservists than civilians, and they grapple with feeling like ‘invisible citizens.’ The personal sacrifices we make must always be recognized by Israeli society. But alongside the difficulties—and there are many—my wife and I believe in the message we’re passing on to our children, in the values they’re growing up with. Even at a young age, they understand the need.' Lt. Col. (Res.) Paran Farah added, 'My parents have been evacuated from Rosh HaNikra for a year. How will they ever go home if we don’t show up and carry out our tasks?' Brigade Commander Col. Ifergan emphasized: 'We currently have the upper hand in Gaza, but the war’s objectives have not yet been achieved—the return of all hostages and the dismantling of Hamas’s capabilities. The work isn’t finished.'

IDF unveils new evidence of Hamas-Al Jazeera collaboration	Documents detail instructions from Hamas to Al Jazeera, including prohibiting criticism of Hamas, hiding information about failed rocket launches, and setting up a secure communication line between the two sides After revealing the affiliation of six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza with Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the IDF on Thursday presented additional documents pointing to close collaboration between the terror organization and the Qatari news channel. The documents outline directives from Hamas to Al Jazeera, including barring criticism of Hamas, concealing failed rocket launches, and establishing a secure communication line between the two parties. One of the documents, from 2022, describes how Hamas gave Al Jazeera clear instructions on covering a failed Islamic Jihad rocket launch in Jabaliya that killed several Palestinians. Among the directives was a prohibition on using the word 'massacre' to describe the incident, along with advice to minimize the number of images shown and to prevent panelists from criticizing Hamas. 'We recommend you contact the Islamic Jihad leadership to understand the organization’s guidelines and highlight its efforts in manufacturing and developing capabilities,' Hamas wrote to the Qatari network. Another document from the same year reveals the instructions Hamas gave to journalist Tamer Almisshall regarding his coverage of the Islamic Jihad during Operation 'Breaking Dawn' on his program 'More Hidden than Revealed'. The instructions were to support the 'resistance' in Gaza and to prevent any criticism of the Islamic Jihad’s rocket capabilities, in light of the high number of failed launches. Additionally, a 2023 document shows Hamas decided to establish a 'Jazeera Phone'—a secure line for classified communication with the channel, particularly for emergencies. 'The documents reveal how Hamas directs Al Jazeera's media coverage to serve its own interests, preventing the public in Gaza and around the world from discovering the truth about its crimes against Gazan civilians,' an IDF statement said. Meanwhile, Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani was asked about the IDF’s allegations concerning Al Jazeera journalists’ involvement in terrorism. He responded, 'Al Jazeera must take action if there is any truth to Israel’s claims against its journalists.' At a press conference following his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, he added, 'These allegations should be treated with skepticism.' 'We are very proud of the Al Jazeera institution and its war coverage,' the Qatari prime minister continued. 'Al Jazeera operates according to the highest international standards of journalism. There is no justification for attacking journalists in conflict zones, and the excuses for doing so are unacceptable.' Blinken was also asked about the matter and said he could not verify the Israeli claims.

Antony Blinken says options to capitalize on this moment and the next steps to move the process forward were discussed; Qatari PM says Doha reached out to Hamas representatives U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that negotiators will meet in the coming days to work on reaching a truce in Gaza as he again urged Israel and Hamas to strike a deal. 'We talked about options to capitalize on this moment and next steps to move the process forward, and I anticipate that our negotiators will be getting together in the coming days,' Blinken told reporters after talks with key mediator Qatar. Blinken’s visit to Doha follows earlier talks with leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia. It marks his 11th visit to the region since the start of the war in Gaza after Hamas’s deadly October 7 attack last year. Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said American and Israeli teams would travel to Qatar, without providing a specific timeline. 'A negotiating team from the United States will visit Doha alongside the negotiating team from the Israeli side to discuss the means by which a breakthrough can be achieved,' he said. Asked if Qatar had communicated with Hamas following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the prime minister said: 'We re-engaged with them. There has been an engagement with the representatives from the political office in Doha.' 'We had some meetings with them in the last couple of days. I believe that until now, there is no clarity what will be the way forward.' Qatar, along with the U.S. and Egypt, has been leading mediation efforts between Israel and Palestinian terrorists, aiming to secure a Gaza truce and facilitate a hostage and prisoner exchange.

Macron rejects Netanyahu’s ‘civilization vs. barbarism’ framing i...	Speaking at international conference aimed at supporting Lebanon’s population, French president reiterates call for arms embargo on Israel, takes swipe at PM’s ‘war of civilizations’ narrative French President Emmanuel Macron took a swing at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, dismissing the Israeli leader's portrayal of the Israel-Hezbollah hostilities as a 'war between civilization and barbarism.' Responding to Netanyahu’s remarks in a French TV interview, Macron countered, 'I’ve heard recent talk of a ‘war of civilizations,’ but I believe there is a possibility for culture and civilization in the region.' Macron made the remark during an international conference in Paris to support Lebanon’s population and sovereignty amid ongoing hostilities. The French president reiterated his call for an immediate cease-fire and criticized Israel's continued operations in southern Lebanon and Beirut. He outlined four key goals for the conference: strengthening Lebanon’s sovereignty, providing humanitarian aid, reinforcing UN peacekeepers (UNIFIL) and supporting Lebanon's security forces. The conference saw participation from 54 countries, including EU members, Gulf states, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Japan and Australia. The U.S. was represented by deputy secretary of state after Secretary Antony Blinken and Special Envoy Amos Hochstein were unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts. Macron called for an end to hostilities, saying, 'The war must end quickly.' He condemned Hezbollah’s drone attack on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea and criticized Israel’s military operations in Lebanon, warning that a military offensive alone 'will not solve the problem.' Macron, who recently suggested an arms embargo on Israel, stressed the need to separate the Gaza war from hostilities in Lebanon. 'We must not export a war from another region to Lebanon,' Macron said. France pledged €100 million in aid to Lebanon, as part of the €426 million in needs assessed by the UN. Macron called for a return to UN Resolution 1701, which calls for the disarmament of militias in Lebanon and the deployment of Lebanese and UNIFIL troops along the Israel-Lebanon border, to restore peace and security. Macron expressed full support for UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, and condemned attacks on its personnel, saying, 'Nothing justifies the shelling of UNIFIL soldiers.' Regarding Lebanon’s military, Macron pledged France’s assistance in training and equipping 6,000 new soldiers at Lebanon’s request. He praised Lebanese security forces for their role in maintaining order and fighting ISIS, and called for political stability in Lebanon. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the international community to expand its support, stressing that a cease-fire is essential for stability and the rebuilding of the nation. He reaffirmed Lebanon’s commitment to implementing UN Resolution 1701 and supporting the U.S.-French proposal for a 21-day cease-fire.

Israeli forces uncover Hezbollah underground base in southern Leb...	Israeli paratrooper reservists from the 646th Brigade uncovered an underground Hezbollah facility in southern Lebanon, intended to be used by the terrorist group's elite Radwan Force in its plan to 'conquer the Galilee,' the IDF said Thursday. The site contained bunk beds, storage cabinets, food supplies and infrastructure for long-term stays, as well as a significant cache of equipment, weapons and rocket launch pads left behind by the terrorists. In recent days, Israeli forces also discovered four weapons depots, some located in civilian homes, the military added. Among the seized arms were AK-47 rifles, ammunition, rockets, mortars, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs and advanced anti-tank missiles.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1r11qnvxyl	2024-10-24T04:45:35-07:00	
Report: Warrants for Israeli leaders a smokescreen for ICC prosec...	The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday published new details regarding sexual harassment allegations against International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, which he links to what he calls a 'smear campaign' against his efforts to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to the report, Khan’s aggressive push for these arrest warrants is seen as an attempt to divert attention from the accusations against him. The Journal has called for an investigation into the matter, citing troubling details. The report describes growing concerns within the Hague-based court over Khan's handling of the Israeli cases. The Journal claims that Khan's intense efforts to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders may serve to distract from internal allegations of harassment. It warns that before the ICC's judges consider issuing such warrants, an internal investigation into the prosecutor himself should be conducted.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bysagndxjl	2024-10-24T04:43:33-07:00	
Report: Warrants for Israeli leaders a smokescreen for ICC prosec...	Wall Street Journal report says Karim Khan, when confronted with sexual harassment allegations, initially said he'd 'have to resign' but instead allegedly threatened victim and witnesses; days later, he announced warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday published new details regarding sexual harassment allegations against International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, which he links to what he calls a 'smear campaign' against his efforts to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to the report, Khan’s aggressive push for these arrest warrants is seen as an attempt to divert attention from the accusations against him. The Journal has called for an investigation into the matter, citing troubling details. The report describes growing concerns within the Hague-based court over Khan's handling of the Israeli cases. The Journal claims that Khan's intense efforts to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders may serve to distract from internal allegations of harassment. It warns that before the ICC's judges consider issuing such warrants, an internal investigation into the prosecutor himself should be conducted. According to the article, Khan's focus on Netanyahu and Gallant, while excluding political rival Benny Gantz—who was also a member of Israel's wartime cabinet—raises suspicions of bias. The Journal suggests that anti-Israel bias may explain the prosecutor's actions. The investigation also reveals that Khan had promised Western leaders a thorough probe into the Israel-Gaza conflict. He reportedly assured a group of U.S. senators that he would not rush to judgment before hearing Israel’s side, even scheduling meetings in Israel for May 20. However, instead of visiting Israel, Khan appeared on CNN to announce his intent to pursue arrest warrants. The Journal attributes Khan's sudden shift to allegations of sexual harassment that surfaced weeks before his announcement. According to the report, the ICC remained silent on these claims for over five months, until an anonymous social media account brought them to light last week. The alleged victim, a junior staff member in Khan’s office, reported repeated harassment, including being locked in his office and subjected to inappropriate physical contact. A report submitted to the ICC’s independent oversight body, obtained by the newspaper, includes disturbing details of Khan’s behavior, such as entering the woman’s hotel room late at night and lying on her bed under the pretense of checking on her well-being. The report was filed by a colleague of the alleged victim, who worked directly under Khan. When confronted with the allegations, Khan reportedly appeared shocked and confused. According to a witness, the prosecutor expressed surprise and remarked that he would 'have to resign.' However, instead of stepping down, Khan and his wife allegedly began applying pressure on the whistleblower, including demanding that he leave for Uganda. The Journal also highlights that the ICC’s oversight mechanism acknowledged the reported incident in its annual report on October 18 but determined that no investigation was necessary, as the alleged victim had refused to pursue a formal complaint. The article questions this decision, suggesting that fear of retaliation may have prevented the victim from proceeding with the case. It calls for an investigation, arguing that if the allegations are proven true, they would cast serious doubt on Khan’s integrity and the ICC’s commitment to impartial justice. An unnamed Israeli official responded to the report, stating: 'The picture is becoming clearer. The entire issue of war crimes and the ICC’s decision to pursue arrest warrants against the prime minister and defense minister is an attempt to cover up sexual harassment accusations against Karim Khan. 'He misled U.S. senators when he said he would not act against Israel before visiting and hearing its side. He canceled his visit in May and rushed to announce his decision instead. By targeting Israel and its leaders, Khan is trying to gain favor with the global progressive left and shield himself from the accusations.' Khan has denied the harassment allegations, telling the Daily Mail last week, 'I absolutely can confirm there is no truth to suggestions of misconduct.'

Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran delayed due to Pentagon docum...	According to British daily The Times, leak forced Israel to revise plans and develop alternative strategy; 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take,' intelligence source says Israel’s planned retaliatory strike on Iran has been delayed due to the leak of classified Pentagon documents detailing the specifics of the operation, British daily The Times reported on Thursday, citing an intelligence source familiar with Israel’s preparations. The leak, initially shared on a pro-Iran Telegram channel and later on X (formerly Twitter), included details about Israel’s plans to use ballistic missiles against Iran, helping Tehran anticipate the attack patterns. The report indicates that the leak forced Israel to revise its plans and develop an alternative strategy. 'The leak of the American documents delayed the attack due to the need to change certain strategies and components,' the source said. 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take.' Israel had been preparing to target Iranian Revolutionary Guard military installations but had assured the U.S. that its response would not involve Iran's nuclear or oil infrastructure. The planned strike would be a retaliation for Tehran’s October 1 attack, which saw over 180 ballistic missiles fired at Israel. The leaked documents, classified as 'top secret' and dated October 15 and 16, were verified by U.S. officials. They detail Israeli military preparations, including a large-scale air force deployment exercise and an aerial refueling drill. The documents also refer to Israeli handling of air-launched ballistic missiles, with at least 16 missiles, codenamed 'Golden Horizon,' and 40 others called 'ISO2' or 'Rocks,' being prepared for use, the latter a surface-to-air missile developed by Israeli defense contractor Rafael. According to Rafael’s website, the Rocks missile is designed to hit targets from long distances, traveling at supersonic speeds, and is capable of penetrating well-protected underground sites. The documents were compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) and detailed Israeli military movements, including missile exercises and air force maneuvers in preparation for a potential strike on Iran. The absence of accompanying satellite images in the leaked files has led to speculation about how the information was obtained and disseminated. The Pentagon has denied reports that Ariane Tabatabai, a U.S. Defense Department official of Iranian heritage, was behind the leak, as had been suggested in an earlier Sky News Arabia report. Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder confirmed that Tabatabai was not under investigation, while emphasizing that the department is fully cooperating with the inquiry into the classified documents. The leak has heightened tensions between Israel and the U.S., with former Israeli intelligence officials warning of the broader implications. 'The real harm is that it shows the U.S. is struggling to keep secrets,' a former Israeli official told CNN. As part of the ongoing investigation, U.S. authorities are examining who had access to the leaked documents, which were circulated on social media and picked up by major news outlets like CNN. The leak comes amid growing concerns about Iran’s activities in the region, including its support for Hezbollah and proxy militias in Iraq and Syria. Israel has been preparing for potential military action, particularly following reports earlier this year of a similar Israeli strike that allegedly destroyed an air defense radar near Isfahan after an Iranian attack in April.

The machine that saved Pablo's life on October 7	At 6 a.m., Rafi Litwak finished his shift at the Microgil quarry, leaving Pablo Dulitzky alone to take over; shortly after, sirens blared, and Pablo recalls seeing dozens of terrorists pouring into their kibbutz; his quick thinking saved his life Pablo Dulitzky had long planned where he would hide if terrorists ever attacked. Since a previous warning about an infiltration, he had a spot in mind, much like his colleague, Rafi Litwak. 'I planned to hide in the electrical closet,' Rafi, 38, from Be’er Sheva, shared. The two men work at Microgil, a quarry plant adjacent to Kibbutz Nir Oz. On the morning of the attack, Pablo, 61, the only worker at the plant that day, found himself hiding for hours. Rafi, who had just finished his shift, had left five minutes before the terrorists arrived. 'My shift started at 6 p.m. on Friday,' Rafi recalled from the control room, where security camera feeds monitor the plant. 'At 4 a.m., I felt tired and went up to the roof to get some air. It was a quiet night, peaceful and even a bit boring. Pablo arrived at 5 a.m., as usual, for coffee and a chat. We hugged, exchanged shifts and I said, 'See you tomorrow.' 'Then, just minutes later, I heard explosions and interceptors in the sky, like fireworks. Normally, I’d pull over and lie down, but this time there was an alarm in Be’er Sheva, so I decided to drive straight home to my wife and kids. That saved my life. Just minutes later, at the Meon Junction, terrorists killed a family driving there. By 7 a.m., I reached home, only to hear that terrorists had breached Nir Oz. I called Pablo, but he didn’t answer. I feared the worst.' 'When Rafi left,' Pablo described, 'I sat in the control room, preparing for the day. Suddenly, 'Boom-boom-boom,' and a Red Alert siren. I ran outside, and bullets rained down on me like it was pouring rain,' he said in his thick Argentine accent. 'I ran back to the control room and saw through the cameras that dozens of terrorists were entering Nir Oz. I called Yossi Vahav, the plant manager, and said, 'Yossi, there are terrorists in the kibbutz.' He thought I was joking. I sent him a video.' Moments later, Pablo watched in horror as four terrorists breached the plant's gate. 'One of them stole my motorcycle. I shut off all the machines to keep quiet and watched as they brutally killed people at the gate of Nir Oz. I saw my death right in front of me. But I didn’t feel fear. My adrenaline kicked in, and I was laser-focused. I just stared at the stone crusher machine.' Between iron chains and conveyor belts Lying between iron chains and conveyor belts that moved stones, Dulitzky listened as terrorists looted the plant and shouted 'Allahu Akbar,' knowing that stepping out would mean death. 'I climbed inside the machine, and for hours I saw the terrorists and heard everything, but they didn’t see me,' he recalled. 'They stole everything that wasn’t bolted down, even throwing a forklift against the gate. I knew I couldn’t leave.' As the attack unfolded, Dulitzky texted his daughter, an IDF officer, who was on her way to her base when the alarms sounded. Plant managers had contacted the military, and friends spoke to the police, all telling him to wait. Dulitzky, without food or water, took refuge inside the machine. Twice, when the terrorists weren’t nearby, he ventured out to grab two cucumbers and a small bottle of water, which he refilled from a toilet tank and drank sparingly. By 6 p.m., terrorists reentered the plant, looting and firing their weapons calmly, as Dulitzky's phone battery miraculously held on. 'I just kept thinking about getting out to my family,' he said. Rescue finally came around midnight, after nearly 12 hours in hiding. 'One of the managers told me the forces were on their way,' Dulitzky said. 'I told him, ‘If they don’t say exactly, 'Pablo, IDF, come out now' in that order, I’m not coming out.’ They called and said it just like that, and I knew they were at the gate.' When asked if he was injured, Dulitzky replied, 'No, just get me out of here.' Though safe, he continued to hear gunfire in his head for days after the ordeal. Back to work From the rooftop of their plant, Pablo and Rafi stood silently, gazing toward Gaza. Two months after the October 7 terrorist attack, the longtime colleagues reunited for the first time, following Dulitzky’s trip to Argentina. 'When I returned, I felt the weight of everything on me,' said Dulitzky. 'I realized I needed help because I wasn’t feeling well. Talking to someone helps a lot.' Litwak had resumed work earlier. 'We met again during a shift change,' Litwak recalled. 'We made coffee, just like we did the morning of October 7. But this time, we talked, each sharing our story, and couldn’t believe we survived. I think about how I made it out by minutes, and how he was stuck here but made it through.'

Germany will provide a further 96 million euros ($103.57 million) in humanitarian and development aid to Lebanon, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday ahead of a meeting of some 70 delegations in Paris focused on helping the country. 'We are making it clear that we not only see the suffering in Lebanon these days, we are taking action; we are supporting the people on the ground who, for the most part, want only one thing: to live in safety and peace in the future, just like so many people in Israel,' added Baerbock. France is hoping that the meeting will raise about 500 million euros ($540 million) in humanitarian aid, according to a French foreign ministry framework document for the conference.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyn00otwl1x	2024-10-24T01:56:00-07:00

France will provide a 100-million euro ($108-million) aid package to support Lebanon, French President Emmanuel Macron told an international conference Thursday in Paris. Macron said, 'in the immediate term, massive aid is needed for the Lebanese population, both for the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war and for the communities hosting them.' The war between Hezbollah terrorists and Israel has displaced a million people in the country, killed over 2,500 and deepened an economic crisis. French organizers hope participants' financial pledges of humanitarian aid will meet the $426 million the United Nations says is urgently needed. Paris also seeks to help restore Lebanon's sovereignty and strengthen its institutions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjnmiywx1e	2024-10-24T01:54:57-07:00

Suspects, including one from Iraq, allegedly paid 50,000 Sri Lankan rupees to execute attack; arrest made based on intelligence received from India's spy agency Sri Lankan authorities arrested two individuals overnight Thursday on suspicion of planning a terror attack targeting Israeli tourists in the Arugam Bay area, following a severe travel warning issued by Israel’s National Security Council the day before. According to local reports, the Sri Lankan defense forces received intelligence from India's spy agency about a planned attack on Israelis between October 19-23 in Arugam Bay. One of the suspects is believed to have traveled from Iraq, and investigators discovered that one of the two detainees had previously been imprisoned on international drug trafficking charges. Authorities also revealed that the suspects were allegedly paid 50,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($170) to carry out the attack. The travel warning issued by Israel on Wednesday urged all Israelis to immediately leave the Arugam Bay area and coastal regions in southern and western Sri Lanka due to 'updated information on a specific terror threat targeting tourist areas and beaches.' Officials said the intelligence indicated an imminent attack, describing it as a 'hot alert' similar to a foiled Iranian plot to target Israelis in Turkey during the summer of 2022.

Alan Yazbek was photographed at the Oct. 6 rally in Sydney's central business district holding a sign that replaced the Star of David on the Israeli flag with a blue swastika, accompanied by the words 'Stop Nazi Israel.' The 56-year-old Yazbek was also photographed holding another sign in the green and yellow colors associated with Hezbollah — a designated terrorist organization in Australia — with the words 'our boys in green and gold will win.' The rally took place a day before the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, carried out by Hamas. Yazbek — the co-founder of the Nomad Group, which owns three high-end restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne — was the only person charged following the rally, which saw an estimated 10,000 people in attendance. Police initially tried to prevent the rally but later reached an agreement with organizers, allowing it to proceed peacefully. Yazbek faces a potential sentence of up to 12 months in jail or a fine of 11,000 Australian dollars ($7,300). He is due to be sentenced on Dec. 10.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjqfwivgje	2024-10-23T22:15:54-07:00

IDF targets Beirut's Dahieh after rocket volley to central Israel	Lebanese media reports wave of airstrikes in Hezbollah's stronghold in the country after terror group fired four rockets toward Tel Aviv and surrounding area Lebanese reports on Wednesday reported significant airstrikes were seen in Beirut’s Dahieh district, considered to be Hezbollah’s stronghold in Lebanon, following the terror group’s targeting of central Israel with four rockets fired at the area earlier. The strikes come after the IDF’s Arabic Spokesperson Col. Avichay Adraee called on residents of the area to evacuate prior to the military’s actions. Footage from the scene showed massive explosions and smoke plumes. Following Hezbollah’s firing toward central Israel, Palestinian sources reported late Wednesday one rocket fell in the West Bank town of Qalqilya, resulting in one man receiving minor injuries. The two sides continue to escalate the conflict in the area amid the war in Gaza. Hezbollah said in an earlier statement, published via its operations room, that it used 'precision missiles' and new types of drones for the first time in their clashes against IDF troops. The terror group said it had been able to push back Israeli troops in clashes in several border villages in southern Lebanon. However, the organization had made several such claims in the past that were proven inaccurate. Meanwhile, Saudi news outlet Al-Hadath reported that an earlier IDF strike in Beirut was aimed at the offices of Hezbollah-affiliated network Al-Mayadeen. According to a Lebanese source talking to Reuters, the strike destroyed an office used by the pro-Iran Al-Mayadeen broadcaster. Two other security sources confirmed the office had been hit in an IDF strike on a multi-story building.

The world is watching, do not fail us': Former Israeli hostage s...	Amit Soussana addresses ambassadors in special event on sexual violence in conflict, recalling her assault by a Hamas terrorist while in captivity Former Israeli hostage Amit Soussana, who was released in the first hostage deal with Hamas after 55 days in captivity, addressed UN ambassadors in a special event held at the international body’s New York headquarters. 'I was held captive alone, chained by my ankle with a metal chain, unable to move, and had to ask for permission to use the bathroom,' Soussana recounted. 'In that house, I was sexually assaulted by the Hamas terrorist who guarded me. He forced me to go to the shower and entered the room, pointed his gun at me. He was breathing heavily and had a monstrous, beast-like face.' 'I knew exactly what he was planning to do, and yet I couldn’t do anything to prevent it. I was utterly helpless. When the assault was over, I wasn’t even allowed to cry or to be sad. I had no one to comfort me and was forced to act nice to the person who had just sexually assaulted me in the most horrifying way,' she added. 'Not a day goes by that I don't think about what that terrible man did to me. We were held in such inhumane conditions. No person should ever be subjected such brutal and ruthless treatment.' 'Now, I speak before the UN Security Council pleading with you to fulfill your duty. Take immediate action to secure the release of those still held captive. Every day that passes steals another piece of their soul and endangers their life. Act now before it's too late, I urge you: do not turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed against innocent civilians,' she said. 'It is your responsibility to protect human rights, to combat terrorism and to bring those responsible for these heinous crimes to justice. The world is watching, waiting for the UN Security Council to live up to its mandate. I beg you, do not fail us. Secure the freedom of the hostages and ensure that no one else would suffer the same fate,' she called on the international body. 'Remember, it is our collective duty to combat terrorism and protect human rights. The time to act is now.' Soussana spoke at a special event held at the UN to mark 15 years of the mandate on sexual violence in conflicts, organized by the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten. Patten was behind the report released earlier this year by the UN regarding the horrific rapes and sexual violence committed by Hamas terrorists during the October 7 massacre. In her speech, Patten reiterated her report’s recommendations published last April, which also called for the unconditional release of all hostages, an immediate cease-fire and the facilitation of an independent investigation of sexual violence by Hamas in order to bring the guilty to justice. 'Amit Soussana bravely shared the horrors, the violence, the sexual violence and the sheer evil she experienced from the moment she was abducted from her apartment in Kibbutz Kfar Aza until her release from Hamas captivity,' Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said during the event. 'Amit, you're strong, powerful and inspiring. Thank you for sharing your story with the world and exposing once again the true face of the Hamas terror organization. It's important to remember that the IDF’s stretched arm will reach anyone associated with Hamas and eliminate them. We won't stop until the release of all 101 hostages held by Hamas.'

Caught between sympathy and fear: Egypt’s Christians confront the...	Egypt’s Coptic Orthodox Christians are torn between support for Palestinian civilians and fear of Hamas, complicating their response to the ongoing war A year after Hamas’s October 2023 assault on Israel, Egypt’s Coptic Orthodox Christians remain divided over how to respond to the ongoing war in Gaza. As the Middle East’s largest Christian community, Copts are caught between sympathy for Palestinian civilians and deep fears of Hamas, the Islamist group linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, whose rule in Egypt was marked by violence against Christians. Coptic Christians make up Egypt’s largest Christian minority and the largest Christian population in the Middle East. Most belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church, which traces its roots to the early days of Christianity in Egypt. Egypt is also home to a significant population of Evangelical Christians, whose church, founded as a mission in the 19th century, is the largest Protestant denomination in the Arab world. Despite their numbers, both Copts and Evangelicals face ongoing sectarian violence. On August 31, 2024, a fire at the Coptic Diocese of Beni Suef destroyed the building and injured several people, though no lives were lost. While authorities blamed faulty wiring, many in the Christian community remain skeptical, citing a history of arson attacks on churches. 'My friend from the supermarket downstairs asked me about the Christian position on what he called Israeli aggression in Gaza,' said Isaac Ibrahim, a Copt writer in Cairo. 'He wanted to know if our solidarity with Palestine had shifted since the death of Pope Shenouda.' The late Pope Shenouda III, head of the Coptic Church from 1971 until his death in 2012, forbade Copts from visiting Israel, reflecting the pan-Arab stance of the time. His successor, Pope Tawadros II, has taken a more cautious approach, aligning the Church’s position with Egypt’s official diplomatic policies. 'Pope Tawadros doesn’t want to provoke conflict,' said John Gabriel, an Egyptian Dominican priest, speaking to The Media Line from a Franciscan monastery in Leuven, Belgium. 'He follows the government’s line, condemning violence on both sides but avoiding the hardline rhetoric of the past.' This shift has created a more muted stance within the Coptic Church, but divisions remain. While older Copts hold onto anti-Israel sentiments from Shenouda’s era, younger Copts are more skeptical of Hamas and other Islamist groups. For many Christians, Hamas’ role as a leader in the global 'Palestine solidarity' movement complicates support for the Palestinian cause. 'Because of the Brotherhood’s treatment of us, some Copts see Jews as similarly persecuted by Islamic extremists,' Gabriel told The Media Line. 'They ask, ‘Why defend Palestinians when groups like Hamas, who terrorized us, are leading the fight?’' Makarios Lahzy, a Cairo-based human rights lawyer, says the complex dynamics of the Arab-Israeli conflict put Christians in a difficult position. 'Christians in the East are weakened and exhausted,' Lahzy told The Media Line. 'For centuries, we’ve been blackmailed and accused of disloyalty, leading most to become confused and hide. Some Christians exaggerate their hostility towards Israel to avoid such accusations, while others align with Israel as a defense against Islamic domination.' Lahzy warns that rising support for Hamas in Egypt, especially after the killing of Hamas political leader Yahya Sinwar, could embolden Islamist factions within Egypt. 'The backing Sinwar receives from the Arab street reflects a deep-rooted anti-Jewish sentiment in the Islamic mindset,' he told The Media Line. 'What worries us is that glorifying Hamas could turn Islamist factions in Egypt back toward Christians.' Tensions are heightened by official statements from Al-Azhar, Egypt’s top Islamic authority, which has framed the conflict in religious terms. After Sinwar’s assassination, Al-Azhar mourned him as a 'martyr of the Palestinian resistance.' 'When Al-Azhar talks about Jerusalem in terms of jihad and resistance, it taps into old fears of Islamist violence,' Gabriel said. 'It’s not just about foreign policy—it raises fears of a revival of sectarian violence in Egypt itself.' The ongoing war in Gaza has reignited theological debates within Egypt’s Christian community. 'Palestinian Theology,' a Christian liberation theology that ties the Palestinian struggle to biblical themes of freedom, has been met with strong opposition from many Copts. 'It’s not theology—it’s a political movement with an antisemitic agenda,' said Bassem Al-Janoubie, a liberal Coptic commentator, speaking to The Media Line. 'It’s driven by the fusion of progressive European and North American Lutheran evangelical ideology and political Islam.' One of the most contentious aspects of this theology is the portrayal of Jesus as a Palestinian. 'Jesus was a Jewish king, born of royal blood,' Al-Janoubie told The Media Line. 'To suggest he was Palestinian is to deny his role as the Messiah, as depicted in the Gospels.' This theological friction adds to the wider tensions within Egypt’s Christian community. 'Yes, Jesus was in Palestine, but it was the land of Israel,' Gabriel said. 'For many Christians here, there’s no distinction between biblical Israel and the modern state.' These theological and political divisions are mirrored by practical concerns about security and sectarian violence. The fire at the Coptic Diocese of Beni Suef, though officially attributed to an electrical fault, has sparked fears of a return to the days when attacks on Christian churches were more frequent. Muslim arson attacks on Coptic churches have a long history, with nearly 1,000 churches attacked or torched since the 1970s. The war in Gaza, meanwhile, has only deepened these anxieties. 'If Hamas wins, many of us fear that Islamists here will turn their attention back to us,' Gabriel warned. 'It’s like a nightmare scenario: what if the flames spread to Egypt?' A year after the October 7 attacks, Egypt’s Coptic Christians remain divided. While many sympathize with Palestinian civilians, fears of Hamas and political Islam make it difficult to take a clear stance. 'We share the Arab world’s sympathy for the Palestinian people,' Gabriel told The Media Line, 'but we’re also fearful of what groups like Hamas represent for us as Christians.'

Iranian president threatens Israel on BRICS sideline	Masoud Pezeshkian in Russia visit swears damage to Israel would be 'unimaginable' should it attack Tehran in response to its ballistic missile attack; Gallant visits airbase hinting at close retaliation Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the BRICS international summit in Russia on Wednesday, warned Israel against a powerful response against Tehran following its missile attack on the country on October 1. 'If Israel makes a mistake, Iran will respond with force. Israel might cause us some damage, but the response it will suffer and the scale of damage inflicted will be unimaginable,' Pezeshkian said. His remarks came shortly after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reiterated Israel would strike Iran in response to its ballistic missile attack earlier this month. He made his statement during a meeting with pilots and technical staff at the Israel Air Force’s Hatzor Airbase. 'After we strike in Iran, people in Israel and elsewhere will understand what your preparation, readiness and capabilities entail. We have very high confidence in your abilities, both individually and as a team, as well as complete confidence in the IDF,' Gallant said against the backdrop of leaked U.S. intelligence documents detailing some of Israel's preparations for an attack on Tehran. Gallant's office added that the minister received a briefing on operational activities across all combat zones at Hatzor Airbase from the base’s commander, Brig. Gen. Amichai Levin and squadron commanders, including 'increased readiness for potential offensive actions in other fronts.' It was also reported Gallant spoke with air and ground crews, expressing his appreciation for their wartime activities over the past year. 'You have the privilege of participating in the seven-front war, and the IDF and the Air Force are present in all these fronts — Gaza, Lebanon, the West Bank, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran,' Gallant told the pilots. 'They've paid a heavy price wherever they've tried to harm us. Those who had dreams of defeating us and striking us in Gaza a year ago are no longer living after (Yahya) Sinwar and a long line of leaders have been eliminated, thanks the IDF’s actions,' he added. Meanwhile, U.S. efforts are ongoing to moderate Israel's response to Iran, aiming to prevent a dramatic escalation just before the November presidential elections. Secretary of State Antony Blinken requested that Israel further temper its response to Iran during a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. According to reports, the attack is already expected to focus on military assets in Tehran rather than Iran's nuclear or oil facilities. Blinken also urged an end to the IDF’s ground operation in Lebanon, advising Israel to leverage its military gains and turn them into strategic achievements. 'The campaign’s management is in Israel's hands,' an Israeli official said in response.

IDF exposes six Al Jazeera journalist as Gazan terrorists	Military reveals documents detailing names of reporters belonging to Qatari network affiliated with Hamas and Islamic Jihad activity in the Strip before and during October 7 The IDF reported on Wednesday that military intelligence and documents located in the Gaza Strip confirmed the affiliation of six Al Jazeera network journalists in Gaza with Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The reporters include Anas Jamal Mahmoud Al-Sharif, Alaa Abdul Aziz Muhammad Salama, Hossam Basel Abdul Karim Shabat, Ashraf Sami Ashour Saraj, Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar and Talal Mahmoud Abdul Rahman Aruki. 'The terrorist-journalist Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar was struck and injured a few months ago in Gaza. The documents once again confirm his involvement in terrorist activities. The Al Jazeera network has attempted to disassociate itself from Omar's terror activities,' the military said in a statement. In a 2021 list of Hamas operatives, Abu Omar was described as a platoon commander in Hamas’ Khan Yunis Brigade. He is known for accompanying the terrorists on October 7 and documenting the massacre at Kibbutz Nir Oz in real-time. After being injured, he was transferred for treatment in Qatar. The documents include personnel tables, lists of terror training courses, phone directories and salary records for terrorists, clearly proving their roles as military operatives in Gazan terror groups. For example, Alaa Salama's name appears in a 2022 salary document for Islamic Jihad operatives, and Talal Aruki is mentioned in a 2019 injury tracking document describing he suffered a fracture in his right leg bone, which was treated with a splint. 'These documents serve as proof of the integration of Hamas terrorists within the Qatari Al Jazeera media network,' The military added. 'Most of the journalists that the IDF has exposed as operatives in Hamas's military wing spearhead the propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera, especially in the northern Gaza Strip.'

Three killed in attack on Turkish aerospace industries headquarte...	Footage broadcast on local media shows several armed assailants entering TUSAS complex, where gunfire and loud explosion reported; interior minister describes incident as 'terrorist attack'; sources indicate hostage situation An attack on the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS) headquarters near Ankara on Wednesday left three people dead and five others wounded, officials confirmed on Wednesday. The assault, which occurred in the Kahramankazan district, targeted one of Turkey's most critical defense and aviation facilities. Selim Cirpanoglu, the mayor of Kahramankazan, reported the casualties during an interview with Turkish TV channel Tele1. Footage broadcast on local media showed several armed assailants entering the TUSAS complex, where gunfire and a loud explosion were reported. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya described the incident on social media platform X, calling it a 'terrorist attack' and expressing condolences for the 'martyrs and injured.' He provided no details about the perpetrators, and the motive behind the attack remains unclear. Initial media reports suggested a suicide bomber may have been involved, and some sources indicated that hostages could have been taken. However, these details have not been confirmed by officials. Witnesses at the scene told Reuters that employees were escorted to shelters, and exits were sealed off amid reports that explosions had occurred near multiple building exits as workers were leaving for the day. Private broadcaster NTV reported that the attackers arrived in a taxi during a shift change, detonating a bomb at the entrance before entering the facility armed with assault rifles. At least one woman was among the assailants, according to security camera footage, which showed attackers in plain clothes carrying backpacks and rifles. State-owned Anadolu Agency reported that emergency services, including security forces, ambulances, and firefighters, were quickly dispatched to the site. Helicopters were seen circling above the premises, and a gunfight was reported in the complex’s parking lot. TUSAS, a state-run company that produces both civilian and military aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other defense systems, employs more than 10,000 people. It is responsible for key projects such as KAAN, Turkey's first national combat aircraft. Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the attack, and authorities are working to determine whether Kurdish militants, the Islamic State group or leftist extremists, all of which have previously carried out attacks in Turkey, may have been involved.

The secret Hezbollah tried to bury: Unmasking the Golan File	Established in 2018, unit attempted to operate covertly in Golan Heights while evading Israeli intelligence; however, military ultimately delivered crushing blow to group's activities Although Hezbollah spent the last few years focusing on its 'plan to conquer the Galilee,' the terror organization had also been planning a similar attack on the eastern sector of Israel's northern border. While fighting continues in southern Lebanon, the IDF is also operating in Syria to neutralize the threat in the Golan Heights, known as the Golan File. On October 9, the IDF eliminated Golan File member Adham Jahata in an airstrike. This terrorist operative had passed intelligence from the Syrian regime and Syrian frontlines to Hezbollah, enabling the Lebanese terror group to act against Israel through the Golan. His assassination adds to a series of countermeasures carried out by the IDF since the unit was first exposed in the winter of 2019, shortly after its formation. How is a terrorist organization created? Like most terror groups, the Golan File began as an idea: to establish an elite force that would plan and execute terror activities against Israeli civilians through the Syrian border. The unit was intended to serve as an intelligence-gathering branch, avoiding detection by the IDF, and launching attacks when ready. The current leader of the Golan File is Ali Musa Abbas Daqduq, also known by the call sign Abu Hussein Sajed. He was chosen due to his extensive history with Hezbollah. In addition to supporting attacks from Lebanon on Israel in the 2000s, he trained Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force. Later, he was sent to Iraq by the organization to build a terror network targeting U.S. forces. In the summer of 2018, Hezbollah noticeably shifted its operations in the Golan Heights, turning the idea into reality. A covert unit was established, with constant operational readiness to strike Israel at a moment’s notice. Hezbollah accomplished this using existing terror cells in southern Syria, undetected by the Syrian regime. However, the unit’s secrecy did not last long. Israeli intelligence quickly identified the threat and revealed its existence to the Israeli public and the wider world in March 2019. A look inside the operation Over the years, the IDF continued to gather intelligence, closely monitoring and combating the threat in secret. The Golan File resurfaced in the headlines in January 2023 when IDF forces captured Ghaith Abdullah, a Syrian resident and operative of the unit, while he crossed into Israel. During interrogation, Abdullah confessed to his involvement and identified three other operatives: Maan Al-Hamad, Abu Jud and Abu Hassan Al-Asha, the unit's Syrian recruiter known by the call sign Abu Ali. He detailed his recruitment process and the mechanics of how Syrian collaborators were activated. Hezbollah’s recruitment of local supporters relies on two main strategies: identifying Syrians with a history of anti-Israel terrorism and exploiting the poor living conditions in Syria by offering financial incentives in exchange for intelligence on IDF activities. Operation Cash Cab 'At the start of the war in October, we received reports that the Golan File had begun to mobilize,' recalled one IDF intelligence officer. 'Prior to October, they had been preparing. That day, they received the order to act.' In those first hours of uncertainty, the IDF quickly recognized the gravity of the situation and began formulating plans to foil the terrorist plot. For months, they conducted close surveillance on suspects, culminating in a decisive operation in December. 'We identified a Syrian man suspected of collaborating with Hezbollah in Quneitra, southern Syria,' the officer recalled. 'When we learned Lebanese operatives were joining him at the Syrian front, we knew this was no innocent meeting and acted to thwart the threat.' IDF surveillance tracked the Syrian collaborator's yellow taxi, and once all four terrorists—three Lebanese operatives and one Syrian—were confirmed to be inside, the vehicle was struck from the air. The operation, which killed Abu Al-Julan, a Syrian operative, and three Lebanese operatives—Abu Tarab, Abbas and Jawad Daqduq, the son of the unit's commander—was dubbed Operation Cash Cab. Intelligence officials described the strike as 'the hardest blow to the Golan File since its inception.' According to sources, the message remains clear: any enemy threatening Israel’s security, whether in Lebanon, Syria or elsewhere, will be eliminated by the IDF.

Hezbollah fires 25 rockets toward Nahariya, man seriously injured	IDF reports dozens of rockets were seen crossing into the country in fresh salvo fired from Lebanon; Israeli seriously injured after being hit by interceptor shrapnel A 50-year-old Israeli man was seriously injured on Wednesday after an interceptor shrapnel hit his head in Nahariya, located in northern Israel. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit also reported that 25 rockets were launched toward the city, Golan Heights and Western Galilee regions from Lebanon. Sirens also sounded in Hadera, located further south. The military added two launches were located targeting Tiberias and Afula and were both intercepted with no injuries reported. Magen David Adom (MDA) paramedics who arrived at the scene provided the man with preliminary medical care before evacuating him to the Galilee Medical Center in the city. 'We saw the man lying on the edge of the pier, unconscious and suffering from a severe head injury,' Magen David Adom paramedic Nir Dayai recounted. 'A passerby had bandaged the injured man with the guidance of the MDA's hotline and managed to stop the significant bleeding from his head.' 'He told us that the injury was caused by shrapnel from the latest rocket barrage interception. We transferred him to the MDA intensive care unit while providing him with medical treatment and evacuated him to the hospital. His condition is serious but stable,' he added.

Hundreds of people were running in every direction, and every fe...	Nova music festival massacre survivor Danielle Gelbaum vividly recalls the terrifying moments as thousands desperately fled while rockets and gunfire rained down around them Of all the October 7 horrors, the massacre at the Nova music festival stands out in its scale, cruelty and its perpetrators’ inhumanity. That morning’s music festival site and its surrounding areas through which the partygoers tried to flee endured one of history’s most deadly terrorist attacks. Three hundred and eighty-three people were murdered, 44 were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip and hundreds were wounded. This is Nova survivor, 23-year-old Danielle Gelbaum’s story. 'I’d returned from my big trip to South America three weeks before Nova. I traveled to the festival with my elder sister Lior and friends. We started feeling tired at 5:30, so we went to where the tent was and my sister went to sleep in the tent. The music stopped at 6:29 and Red Alert sirens went off.' 'A few minutes later, we were all told to pack up and leave, so we got into the car and started driving toward the exit. We got onto Route 232 and were about to turn left to Kibbutz Be’eri. We had no idea there were terrorists around. After driving for a few minutes, we saw cars turning back but didn’t understand what was going on. We also turned around. 'A few minutes later, we saw cars just stopping in the middle of the road and people running out. When we got out of the car, I heard the first gunshots. My sister looked at me and asked, 'Dani, is that what gunfire sounds like?' 'We saw people running and we started running with them. Someone, presumably from the security detail, was standing on a mound shouting to everyone, 'Run east, run toward the sun.' This is one of the things that saved us. We saw a big black vehicle driving toward us, so we stopped it and asked to get in. It was two guys from the rave. I’ve no idea how they survived. We drove for a few minutes and again reached a dead end: the fields were all plowed up and cars just couldn't get through.' 'I clearly remember seeing a girl standing outside the truck signaling us to help her, and we just couldn’t. The gunfire wasn’t letting up and we knew that if we were to stop now, that would be the end for everyone in the truck. To this day, I don’t know what happened to her. I eat myself away inside over this. It will be with me forever.' 'When we got out of the car, I realized the scale of what was going on. Nearby, I saw hundreds of people running in every direction, and every few seconds, someone would fall. I looked the other way and saw a terrorist in a green shirt walking calmly and two meters in front of him, I saw someone in a black T-shirt run and fall to the ground. He managed to get up, took another couple of steps and then just collapsed to the ground again. I’ll never forget that scene. This was when we realized how close it was. We saw the terrorists with our own eyes. They were here.' 'In the distance, I saw a pickup truck driving toward us. It was the couple we’d come to the festival with. They saved our lives. There were around 16 of us there, lying on top of each other in the back of the pickup truck. We drove through an orchard with shots being fired behind us, and dozens of people were running into the orchard. I clearly remember seeing a girl standing outside the truck signaling us to help her, and we just couldn’t. The gunfire wasn’t letting up and we knew that if we were to stop now, that would be the end for everyone in the truck. To this day, I don’t know what happened to her. I eat myself away inside over this. It will be with me forever.' 'We got to the police station in Netivot where we stayed until nightfall. On our way home, I texted my officer and told her I was on my way back and that I needed to be in the army right now. Throughout my two months of reserve duty, I didn’t understand what I’d been through. I remember my first panic attack after reserve duty: I was in a traffic jam on my way back from Tel Aviv with two friends when my whole body started shaking. 'My heart was pounding. I thought about how this was how it started last time around, and that the massacre was happening again. It was very hard. I then started having nightmares about terrorists, and images started resurfacing along with survivor guilt. What could I have done differently? I realized I needed to start taking care of myself.' 'Yes, it’s been hard, but I’ve started dancing again. Every time I take to the dancefloor, I’m overcome by a range of emotions: Joy that I’m here, along with the pain for those who aren't. I get triggers at every rave. Each and every party means dealing with it again. By we won’t stop dancing. If we stop dancing, they'll have won. They’ve beaten us in so many ways and this isn’t going to be one of them.'

IDF targets Hezbollah command centers in southern Lebanon	The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported on Wednesday that Israeli Air Force fighter jets targeted several Hezbollah command posts in southern Lebanon.

One bomb, one building: Inside IDF’s high-impact strategy in Beir...	After rocket fire targeting northern Israel, IDF strikes terror sites in Tyre and Lebanese capital's Dahieh where building seen leveled with single bomb; Israeli forces uncover Hezbollah weapons cache in southern Lebanon mosque Another day of intense fighting in northern Israel unfolded as rockets were fired from Lebanon, and the IDF responded with airstrikes on multiple targets, including villages along the border and sites in Beirut's Shia-majority Dahieh district and Tyre. The military reported that a building in Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold, was demolished using a single precision bomb after intelligence confirmed it housed terrorist infrastructure. Overnight, Israeli Air Force jets, guided by military intelligence, targeted weapons production and storage sites, as well as Hezbollah command centers hidden within civilian buildings in Dahieh. Following an IDF warning of imminent strikes in Tyre, Lebanese civil defense teams evacuated an entire neighborhood. Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar reported that Lebanese authorities closed roads leading to the city after receiving Israel’s warning. Reports later confirmed a drone strike in central Tyre, and additional targets were hit throughout southern Lebanon, including in the villages of Khiam, Wadi Barghaz, Taybeh, Siriane, Qasmiyeh, Qana, Baflay and Al-Jbour. On Tuesday, the IDF destroyed a building in Dahieh believed to contain Hezbollah terror infrastructure on all floors. Footage of the operation showed the building collapsing with no damage to neighboring structures or harm to bystanders. The strike was carried out using a single JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) bomb, following recent improvements made by the Air Force's performance analysis unit to optimize munitions use. As military operations against Hezbollah continue, the IDF appears to be adopting a scaled-down version of the 'Dahieh Doctrine' from the 2006 Lebanon War, using disproportionate air and artillery firepower against civilian infrastructure utilized by terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee posted on social media details about the alleged location of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's bunker beneath Al-Sahel Hospital, which the military claimed housed over $500 million. 'For Lebanese journalists struggling to find Nasrallah's hideout, the entrance is in the eastern of the two buildings north of the hospital, where half a billion dollars is reportedly stored,' Adraee said, claiming Hezbollah has been blocking access to conceal the money. Simultaneously, IDF ground forces continued operations in southern Lebanon. The 205th 'Iron Fist' Reserve Brigade reported destroying dozens of tunnels and other terror sites, eliminating dozens of terrorists and seizing large quantities of weapons. During their mission, soldiers uncovered a weapons cache hidden in a mosque in a civilian neighborhood, containing grenade launchers, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs, Kornet missiles and combat vests. All weapons were confiscated and destroyed.

Israel issues urgent travel warning for Sri Lanka amid terror thr...	National Security Council instructs Israelis to leave Arugam Bay area and other coastal regions or return home due to 'credible alert about terrorist cell already in motion' The National Security Council (NSC) issued an urgent travel advisory on Wednesday, urging Israeli nationals in Sri Lanka to immediately leave the Arugam Bay area and coastal regions in the south and west of the island. The warning follows incoming intelligence regarding a potential terrorist threat targeting tourist areas and beaches. In recent days, the NSC received intelligence about plans for an attack specifically aimed at Israelis, with Arugam Bay being a primary focus. According to officials, there is a 'credible alert about a terrorist cell already in motion.' This is reminiscent of similar threats against Israelis in Turkey in the summer of 2022, officials added. 'There may be more than one cell involved,' said a senior security official. 'We are dealing with an immediate threat, and the highest level of alert has been raised in the beach and tourist areas. There is ongoing intelligence and counterterrorism activity, with local authorities cooperating fully. Until the situation is neutralized, this remains a very hot issue.' The Mossad is leading the operation, warning of an 'escalating level of threats and intent to attack Israelis worldwide' since the outbreak of the war in October last year. The scope of the threats has required a vast global deployment of Mossad operatives. Sri Lankan police have acknowledged the risk to Israelis in the region, setting up roadblocks and conducting vehicle checks. The U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka also issued a travel advisory, citing 'credible information about an imminent attack targeting popular tourist areas in Arugam Bay.' Security officials estimate there are hundreds of Israelis currently on the island. 'We are not calling for an immediate airlift,' the senior official added. 'We are trying to reduce the threat by advising those on the beaches to relocate to Colombo or other cities, depending on availability, and to avoid staying near the beaches. Those who can book flights and conclude their vacations are encouraged to do so, but there is no airlift planned at the moment.' The NSC has called for Israelis to leave the Arugam Bay area and beaches in the south and west of Sri Lanka, including in Ahangama, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama, immediately. The threat level has been raised to level 4 in these regions. 'Those leaving these areas should either exit the country or at least relocate to Colombo, where there is a stronger security presence,' the advisory said. In the rest of Sri Lanka, the threat level has been raised to level 3, with Israelis advised to postpone non-essential travel to the country. The NSC also urged Israelis in Sri Lanka to take precautions: avoid displaying Israeli identity markers in public, including wearing shirts with Hebrew or any symbols revealing nationality and religion, and to avoid gatherings of Israelis in unsecured public areas. In the event of suspicious activity, they are advised to contact local security forces.

North Gaza polio campaign postponed due to violence, says WHO	A polio vaccination campaign in north Gaza has been postponed due to Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. This final phase, that was due to begin on Wednesday, aimed to vaccinate more than 119,000 children in the Palestinian enclave under siege for over a year in response to militant group Hamas' attacks on Israel. 'The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure, continue to jeopardize people's safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate,' the U.N. agency said in a statement, reiterating its call for a cease-fire. The polio campaign began on Sept. 1 after the WHO confirmed in August that a baby was partially paralyzed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years. Delays in a second dose for children could jeopardise efforts to halt transmission.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1oqe8iljl	2024-10-23T03:49:56-07:00

Time stood still': Gaza hostages' last holiday at home	Idan saw his mother, who flew in from US, before being abducted on Simchat Torah; Chaim shared his Yom Kippur War story day before massacre; Guy promised to help dismantle sukkah after Nova festival; hostage families recount final moments with loved ones before being taken to Gaza A year ago, on the eve of Simchat Torah, 101 Israelis were spending time with their families and friends. The following morning, their lives were upended—they became the 101 hostages whose return the entire nation still longs for. Families of eight of the hostages shared with Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth the last moments they remember with their loved ones before the nightmare began. Idan Alexander One of the hostages is Idan Alexander, 20. His mother, Yael, flew in from the United States to visit him during Sukkot. 'When the kids were younger, we used to build a sukkah in the U.S.,' she recalled. 'Now that they’re older, we usually visit friends during the holiday.' At 18, Idan made the decision to move to Israel and enlist in the Golani Brigade. He had been home for Rosh Hashanah and part of Sukkot last year, but spent Yom Kippur on base, where he chose to fast despite being on guard duty. 'I arrived in Israel on the Saturday before the abduction, and Idan came to pick me up,' Yael recounted. 'On Sunday and Monday, we were at my parents’ sukkah in Tel Aviv. My mother invited the extended family, and she always hosts a big Bukharan meal in the sukkah on the roof. But Idan insisted on taking me to get the best burger in town, even though I told him we had a huge meal coming up in a few hours. He devoured that burger. 'On Tuesday morning, he left for the base. I was supposed to fly back to the U.S. on October 7, and he knew that. We talked about it on October 6. Of course, everything was canceled.' Idan was abducted from his base and taken to Gaza. He had managed to tell his mother that he’d been hit by shrapnel in his helmet but was safe and in a secure location. During his time in captivity, his family received several signs of life from him. Itay Chen The last full family gathering for the Chen family took place during Rosh Hashanah. Nineteen-year-old Itay Chen, a tank crew member, didn’t come home for Sukkot. Instead, he returned to his battalion's mission along the Gaza border, tasked with securing the area during the holiday. On the morning of October 7, Itay and his fellow tank crew fought to fend off waves of terrorists heading toward Israeli communities near Gaza. Itay was killed in the battle, and his body was taken by the terrorists. Since then, his family has had no peace, as time seems to have stood still. 'Our family has no holidays,' said his father, Ruby. 'Every holiday, we have an empty chair, and it’s unbearable. The last time we were a complete family was in that Rosh Hashanah photo, and since then, we haven’t been able to come together physically because we don’t have a grave for Itay. He’s still in Gaza, and we can’t find closure.' Liri Albag Liri Albag, 19, had just begun her service as a proud lookout soldier at the Nahal Oz base when she was home for the start of Sukkot. Though disappointed to be stationed on base for the second holiday, she resolved to make the most of it. On the morning of October 7, as rocket sirens blared, Liri managed to send a photo to her boyfriend from the shelter and briefly speak with her family. Shortly after, she and six other female soldiers were abducted from the Nahal Oz post. One, Ori Magidish, has since been rescued, and another, Noa Marciano, was killed in captivity, with her body later recovered. Liri remains in captivity, along with four others: Daniella Gilboa, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger and Naama Levy. Tal Chaimi In a Sukkot holiday photo, Tal Chaimi, 41, stands alongside his brother-in-law, Rani Oren Goldin, and their children in a sukkah at the home of Tal’s sister, Or, in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. 'We always had a family sukkah,' said Or. 'Tal stored the wood and netting for it, and every holiday we’d pull it out, pick a spot and set it up. We’d have meals and family gatherings, sometimes even sleep in it.' Before they could take down the sukkah, both Tal and Oren, members of the kibbutz’s emergency response team, were killed or abducted while defending its borders on October 7. Goldin’s body was recovered and buried in Israel in July, but Tal remains in Gaza. Seven months after the attack, Tal’s wife, Ella, gave birth to their fourth child, Lotan. Chaim Peri On the eve of Simchat Torah, the extended Peri family gathered at the home of their patriarch and matriarch, Chaim, 80, and Osnat, in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The family reunion came as Israel marked 50 years since the Yom Kippur War, where Chaim had fought in the Sinai. Chaim proudly shared his wartime memories with the entire family, presenting a well-prepared slideshow recounting his experiences. 'We were all sitting in the living room, and I couldn’t believe all the grandkids were paying attention with us,' said Chaim’s daughter, Ofri Peri. She recalled her five-and-a-half-year-old daughter asking, 'What would have happened to our people if the army hadn’t won?' Her sister Reut responded, 'That’s impossible—our army is the strongest in the world, and it always wins.' Ofri reflected, 'The next morning, I thought about how my daughter went to bed with those words. In hindsight, she asked very profound questions.' The following day, on October 7, Chaim was abducted from his home and taken to Gaza. He survived months in captivity before the IDF announced his death in June. In August, his body was recovered and returned to Israel for burial. 'There are still 101 hostages in Gaza with whom we have had no communication for over a year,' Ofri said, reflecting on the loss of her father and the ongoing uncertainty for many families. Guy Gilboa-Dalal Last Sukkot, Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 23, wasn’t able to help his father, Ilan, build their family’s sukkah as he did every year. Throughout the holiday, the family hosted friends and relatives in the sukkah each evening. Before leaving for the Nova music festival on October 6, Guy promised his father that he would help dismantle the sukkah upon his return. Tragically, Guy was abducted from the Nova festival alongside his friend Evyatar David. His older brother, Gal, managed to escape the attack, but two of his close friends, Ron Tzarfati and Idan Harmati, were killed. Omer Shem Tov On Friday, October 6, the family of Omer Shem Tov, 21, celebrated the birthday of his mother, Shelly. The family spent the holiday evening with friends in Even Yehuda. 'We had such a great day,' said Omer’s father, Malki. 'We were in Jerusalem in the morning and stopped for burgers in Tel Aviv on the way back after Omer convinced us. It was a holiday evening full of laughter. We got home around midnight, and then Omer went out.' Later that night, Omer attended the Nova music festival, where he met up with Itay and Maya Regev. The three were abducted together. Itay and Maya were returned in a deal nearly a year ago, but Omer remains in captivity. 'Holidays are a breaking point for us, as are Friday night dinners,' said Malki. 'There’s no motivation to celebrate anything. Omer asked us not to worry, but I hope he knows we’re moving heaven and earth for him. He’s not alone, and we’ll do everything to bring him back.' Tamir Adar For the past decade, Tamir Adar, 38, spent Rosh Hashanah with his wife’s family at the Sea of Galilee, and the second night of the holiday was always reserved for his mother, Yael. 'It was also my birthday, and everyone came—the kids, the grandkids, my father. No one was missing. It was the last time we were all togetherr like that,' Yael recalled. 'We had a barbecue, which Tamir loved to do. He even taught his son how to handle it all,' she added. 'A year has passed, and now 8-year-old Assaf proudly takes over the barbecue, just like his father taught him. I last saw Tamir on October 6. We chatted for a few minutes and planned to meet the next day, but we never did. Since then, another Rosh Hashanah has come and gone, and I turned 60, but we didn’t celebrate anything. Nothing feels festive, my throat tightens. We sit at the table mainly for the kids—they are our strength.' Tamir was wounded and abducted from Nir Oz and died from his injuries in Gaza on October 7. His grandmother, Yaffa Adar, was also abducted that day but was released in a hostage exchange in November.

Steak, sushi and pizza: IDF steps up its food game for front line...	Culinary innovations meet military logistics as IDF troops in southern Lebanon enjoy gourmet meals like pulled asado and entrecôte steaks, boosting morale with upgraded, diverse and carefully prepared food options, far surpassing traditional combat rations As IDF soldiers engage in battles in southern Lebanon, their culinary experience has seen a significant upgrade. Commando Brigade fighters, along with paratroopers and tank crews, are now receiving far better meals than those provided in the past. Instead of the traditional rations of canned corn and tuna, soldiers were treated to pulled asado and entrecôte steaks from a smoker set up in the Galilee during the High Holy Days. 'Those fighting in Lebanese territory received these delicacies in special trays, with carefully prepared side dishes. Troops on the front lines enjoyed these gourmet meals packed in baguettes,' said logistics officers from the 98th Division’s elite Commando Brigade. Their philosophy is simple: every ammunition shipment should also include quality food for the troops, especially after the lessons learned from operations in Gaza. Combat rations have also been upgraded, now featuring protein bars, beef jerky and vacuum-sealed meat dishes in various sauces that can be heated in the field. Over the holidays, soldiers in enemy territory even received festive treats, including dates, pomegranates and olives. The experience of creating a supply network under the more difficult conditions of Gaza has been crucial. 'In Gaza, we reached a point where we had ice cream freezers powered by generators, pizzerias for the troops, mobile sushi bars, shawarma stations and more,' the logistics officers recounted. 'There’s no reason why soldiers in Lebanon shouldn’t enjoy good food as well. Our rule is that no soldier should receive the same meal two days in a row. We hold daily brainstorming sessions, learn from our experiences and constantly seek new ways to improve, paying attention to every detail.' Recently, the IDF has begun testing airborne supply drops in the northern sector, causing some alarm in the Upper Galilee earlier this month. However, the supply drops were primarily an operational test, similar to the equipment drops in Gaza earlier this year, and aimed at ensuring readiness for potential ground operations deep in Lebanon. Additionally, Commando Brigade troops have used special robots to transport food and equipment in recent weeks, minimizing risk to soldiers. These machines have successfully navigated Lebanon’s rugged terrain, though troops are also prepared for 'logistical independence,' remaining far from supply lines if necessary. While operations along the northern border are expected to conclude within weeks, soldiers have been fully equipped with winter gear, including thermal shirts and storm suits, as temperatures in the region continue to drop. Another logistical development has been the establishment of military police stations along the border to handle the large amounts of weapons seized from Hezbollah, ensuring proper evaluation before they are investigated or destroyed.

Indictment: Iran-linked cell planned to kill Israeli nuclear scie...	The Jerusalem District Court filed an indictment on Wednesday against seven young men, aged 19 to 23, from the Beit Safafa neighborhood in East Jerusalem, for serious security offenses, including aiding the enemy during wartime and providing intelligence to an enemy. The charges come after the group, allegedly directed by Iranian operatives, plotted to assassinate an Israeli nuclear scientist and his family. According to the indictment, the cell planned to murder the scientist, burn down his home, and had attempted to enter the Weizmann Institute of Science, a prestigious research university in Rehovot, where the scientist worked and lived. After being denied entry, two of the suspects photographed the entrance to the institute and later surveilled the scientist's home. The seven suspects—Rami Alyan, Abd al-Rahman Alyan, Muhammad Khatib, Mamdouh Khader, Omri Abu Hamida, Mahmoud Khader and Muhammad Taha—face multiple charges, including aiding the enemy during wartime, contact with a foreign agent, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act and arson.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyklh78gyg	2024-10-23T00:57:43-07:00	
Indictment: Iran-linked cell planned to kill Israeli nuclear scie...	7 East Jerusalem men, arrested last month for allegedly carrying out missions for payment, charged with attempting to assassinate nuclear scientist, directed by Iranian agent; one suspect purchased weapon but arrested before completing plot The Jerusalem District Court filed an indictment on Wednesday against seven young men, aged 19 to 23, from the Beit Safafa neighborhood in East Jerusalem, for serious security offenses, including aiding the enemy during wartime and providing intelligence to an enemy. The charges come after the group, allegedly directed by Iranian operatives, plotted to assassinate an Israeli nuclear scientist and his family. According to the indictment, the cell planned to murder the scientist, burn down his home, and had attempted to enter the Weizmann Institute of Science, a prestigious research university in Rehovot, where the scientist worked and lived. After being denied entry, two of the suspects photographed the entrance to the institute and later surveilled the scientist's home. The seven suspects—Rami Alyan, Abd al-Rahman Alyan, Muhammad Khatib, Mamdouh Khader, Omri Abu Hamida, Mahmoud Khader and Muhammad Taha—face multiple charges, including aiding the enemy during wartime, contact with a foreign agent, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act and arson. A joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem Police's Central Unit uncovered an Iranian intelligence network working to recruit and activate Israeli citizens for missions within Israel. The lead suspect, Rami Alyan, reportedly acted under the direction of an Iranian agent via the instant messaging app Telegram and recruited the other suspects to assist with various tasks. The group also attempted to procure firearms and explosives for the assassination. The group allegedly received payments for their activities, ranging from 500 shekels ($130) for photographing locations such as the Weizmann Institute, 1,500 shekels ($390) for surveillance of specific targets and 2,000 shekels ($520) for setting a vehicle on fire. They were also paid between 13,000 and 15,000 shekels ($3,380-$3,900) to procure weapons, including a handgun and potentially a Carlo submachine gun, though the transaction was not completed. The suspects were paid in cryptocurrency, which was later converted into approximately 26,000 shekels ($6,760) in cash. The arrests, which occurred last month in a central Israeli city, were made after an urgent tip-off to Shin Bet’s elite Tequila rapid intervention unit and the Israel Police's Yamam counterterrorism team, following long-term intelligence monitoring. Authorities acted quickly after receiving intelligence that the cell was on the verge of carrying out an assassination. In addition to the plot targeting the scientist, the suspects also allegedly planned to assassinate a central Israeli mayor and carried out other activities, including setting vehicles on fire in Jerusalem's Ein Kerem neighborhood, spraying anti-Israel graffiti, attempting to acquire weapons such as guns and grenades, and planning attacks on security forces. After some cell members were arrested, Alyan fled, destroyed his operational phone and discarded the pieces in an open field to avoid detection. Police searches of the suspects' homes uncovered 50,000 shekels ($13,000), a forged police license plate and numerous credit cards. This case is the fifth recent instance of Israeli citizens being exposed as operatives working for Iranian interests. Earlier this week, it was revealed that seven Israelis from northern Israel, originally from Azerbaijan, were arrested for spying on military bases on behalf of Iran, with plans to assassinate a senior Israeli official and his son. Israel has noted an increase in Iran’s efforts to recruit Israelis to gather intelligence, though these plots have not yet resulted in a major operational success. Iranian activity has shifted focus from targeting high-ranking officials to scientists and academics, posing an ongoing challenge for Israeli counterintelligence. A senior Border Police official emphasized the urgency of the operation, stating that the cell had reached an advanced stage of planning the assassination. Experts warn that while Israeli efforts have successfully thwarted these plots, Iran’s attempts should not be dismissed. 'It's like a goalkeeper during penalty shots—you’re bound to block many, but eventually, one will get through,' said one source. The Shin Bet’s counter-espionage division has increased its operations over the past two years, with financial gain emerging as a common motivation for the Israeli recruits, most of whom were aware they were working for Iran.

IDF confirms Nasrallah's designated successor dead	Hashem Safieddine targeted in IDF strike earlier this month found dead with 25 others from Hezbollah's intelligence HQ, in the ruins of a bunker in the Dahieh, three weeks after the attack The IDF confirmed late on Tuesday that senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine was killed in a targeted strike early in October after reports that his body was found in the destroyed Hezbollah bunker three weeks after the attack. The IDF confirmation came after a report in Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel claiming the Safieddine's body was identified. 'The IDF can now confirm that Hashem Safieddine, Head of the Hezbollah Executive Council, and Ali Hussein Hazima, Commander of Hezbollah's Intelligence Headquarters, were eliminated by the IDF, along with additional Hezbollah commanders. The terrorists were eliminated in a strike carried out approximately three weeks ago in the area of Dahieh, a key Hezbollah terrorist stronghold in Beirut,' the military said in a statement. Safieddine, Nasrallah's cousin was considered to be his successor as Hezbollah's leader. 'Due to his familial and personal ties with Nasrallah, he had a significant influence on decision-making within the terrorist organization. During times when Nasrallah was absent from Lebanon, Safieddine filled in as the Secretary-General,' the IDF said. 'Throughout the years, he directed terrorist attacks against the State of Israel and took part in Hezbollah's central decision-making processes.' The Al Arabiya network in Saudi Arabia said his body was found along with 23 others, who according to the IDF were members of the terror group's intelligence command including Bilal Saib Aish, who was in charge of aerial intelligence gathering in Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Syria and Ali Hussein Hazima, the Commander of Hezbollah's Intelligence Headquarters. Safieddine, on the U.S. terror list since 2017, has managed Hezbollah’s education system, finances and foreign investments, leaving military and strategic matters to Nasrallah. He has maintained close ties with Tehran and supports the Iranian regime, with his brother Abdullah serving as Hezbollah’s envoy to Iran. Born in 1964 in a village near the southern city of Tyre, Safieddine hails from a prominent family of clerics. Throughout the current war, he has represented Nasrallah at public events, including the funerals of senior Hezbollah members killed in what was believed to be an Israeli attack. 'The wounded will return to their Jihad,' Safieddine said at a recent event, adding, 'If the enemy's goal is to halt support for Gaza, it must know that it will only grow.'

Pentagon denies senior staffer investigated for document leak	Press secretary says Ariane Tabatabai is 'not a subject of interest' in the ongoing investigation into how classified documents on Israel's planned attack on Iran, appeared online; says Pentagon is in contact with Israel regarding details of the investigation Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder on Tuesday denied the reports that Ariane Tabatabai, a Senior staffer at the Pentagon, of Iranian origin was suspected of being behind the leak of Israeli plans to strike Iran. Earlier Sky News Arabic named Tabatabai A senior staffer in the office of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was as the person who leaked the documents, quoting a senior Pentagon Source. Fox News reported from their sources that the report is false and that the staffer was at work and retains her security clearance. Ryder said the Pentagon was in contact with Israel regarding details of the investigation. 'it is important to let the investigation run its course,' Ryder said in a briefing. 'To my knowledge, this official is not a subject of interest and the department remains fully committed to supporting the investigation.' Fox News reported from their sources that the report is false and that the staffer was at work and retains her security clearance. The Washington Post on Tuesday said the FBI was investigating the leak of the two highly classified intelligence documents. 'The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,' the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement cited by the Post. An investigation into the leak of the documents that appeared on a telegram channel was launched and the incident made headlines in major news outlets. Officials in Washington expressed their deep concern over the leak. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency (GNA) and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. One of the documents states that, according to the analysis of various images, the Air Force conducted exercises with air-launched ballistic missiles (ALBM), including at least 16 'Golden Horizon' missiles and 40 'Rocks' or ISO2 missiles. The documents also discuss 'covert drone activity' and extensive deployment drills. It also reports on 'secret UAV activity,' and claims that the Air Force conducted a 'second large-scale deployment exercise' between October 15 and 16. The report also states that, during those days, activity related to air-to-surface missiles (ASM) was observed at the Ramat David and Ramon Air Force Bases. Another leaked document, which allegedly contains an analysis by the NGA, reports that the IDF 'probably' also conducted an aerial refueling exercise on October 16, and contained a side note stating Israel's apparent ability to use UAVs in order to gather intelligence in Iran and 'across the region.' Israeli officials said the leak was an embarrassment for the Pentagon just one year after dozens of classified documents about the Russian war on Ukraine, were leaked by a U.S. Air Force IT technician. The leak shows how closely the Americans are watching Israel, despite the close alliance between the two nations and its revelation was the source of some discomfort and damage to the credibility of the American security and intelligence agencies. Israeli officials said they expected the leaker to be found and prosecuted so that such events do not occur but added that the leak would not prompt Israelis to hide information from their American counterparts although, it may increase some mistrust already felt against Washington.

US charges IRGC official, others in Iran-backed plot to assassina...	Prosecutors say that the defendants had plotted to lure Alinejad out of her house by asking her for flowers from her garden and then gun her down. The United States issued fresh charges over the attempted Tehran plot to kidnap and assassinate an Iranian-American journalist in New York, indicating an Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) official among others in the case, according to a court document on Tuesday. U.S. prosecutors have previously charged other suspects in the case, including one man in 2022 and two more in January 2023. Tuesday's filing did not name the alleged victim, but one of the previously charged suspects in the case was arrested for having a rifle outside the Brooklyn home of journalist and activist Masih Alinejad. 'Today's indictment exposes the full extent of Iran's plot to silence an American journalist for criticizing the Iranian regime,' said U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray The IRGC official, Ruhollah Bazghandi, was a brigadier general who previously served as chief of the corps' counterintelligence department, according to an indictment unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn. Bazghandi was previously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department. Prosecutors said that Bazghandi's internet activity, as well as that of three other individuals whose names were unsealed on Tuesday, pointed to their involvement in multiple assassination plots. Bazghandi and the other newly charged defendants are based in Iran and remain at large, prosecutors said. The man arrested outside Alinejad's home, Khalid Mehdiyev, and another man allegedly involved in the plot, Rafat Amirov, are in U.S. custody and have pleaded not guilty to murder-for-hire charges.

Far-right lawmaker threatens to block PA from high court	Religious Zionism's Simcha Rothman introduces a bill to curb Palestinian rights to appeal to Israel's Supreme Court: 'Correct a distortion in which hostile elements have rights in court' The Knesset's Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee is expected to approve a bill proposed by its chairman, Simcha Rothman's that would deny the Palestinian Authority's (PA)right of standing in the Israeli Supreme Court. The PA would be unable to appeal to the Supreme Court or file lawsuits in Israeli courts, according to the proposed legislation that would be an amendment to one of Israel's basic laws, has support from members of the far-right and religious coalition and from some members of the opposition as well. 'The purpose of the bill is to correct a distortion in which hostile elements to the State of Israel, including those who work directly to harm its citizens through acts of terrorism, are considered to have the right of standing before the Supreme Court when they come to petition against the policies of the Israeli government,' Rothman wrote in his explanation of the proposed bill. He added that the PA was currently seeking the court's ruling on proposed legislation that would allow Israel to pay compensation to victims of terror or their families, from taxes collected by Israel for the PA. Rothman claimed that the Supreme Court cannot serve the PA while it pays salaries to terrorists. His claim is that the PA, which pays stipends to the families of terrorists who were killed or were serving Prison terms for their attacks, can not seek the protection of Israeli court. Rothman was also promoting legislation to begin prosecuting Nukhba members who participated in the Hamas atrocities on October 7 last year, while the government delayed such prosecution to avoid complicating negotiations on a hostage release deal The committee chair wants to establish a special court that will deal with extraordinary crimes such as genocide which the massacre would be considered. Rothman was one of the architects of the current coalition's legislative push to alter the judicial system in Israel and weaken the standing of its courts. That prompted mass protests in the year leading up to the October massacre and was seen by some as a reflection of Israel's weakness that encouraged Hamas to attack.

Blinken asks Netanyahu to downscale Israel's retaliation against ...

Israel considers its response to the surge in Iran spies	Following Iran's attempts to assassinate Israeli scientists and mayors through proxies, Shin Bet official warns Israelis their citizenship may be revoked if they agree to work for the enemy Israeli security agencies were considering how to deal with the surge of spies working for Iran. A senior official in the Shin Bet said that there is a systematic Iranian effort to target senior Israelis. On Tuesday, a new cell of operatives working for Iran, this time in East Jerusalem, was uncovered. They are suspected of planning the assassination of a nuclear scientist and the mayor of a city in central Israel. On Monday, the Shin Bet said it arrested seven others, all members of a family who immigrated from Azerbaijan. According to the police, they had been carrying out missions for Iran for two years, before they were captured. 'According to the information gathered in the defense establishment, scientists, mayors, defense establishment senior officials, and other Israeli officials were the targets of Iranian operatives,' the Shin Bet official said. 'The key to dealing with this is, first of all, a severe punishment that will deter collaborators. People will understand that this is treason, a violation of state security, serving the enemy during wartime.' He said law enforcement and the prosecution should consider financial penalties such as the freezing of assets in addition to denial of citizenship. A number of Israelis were arrested after they agreed to carry out missions on behalf of Iranian intelligence operatives in recent months. The security officials said security services were aware and had increased their efforts to uncover such plots. 'Public awareness on the subject can help people understand more, suspect more and be more vigilant when contacted over social media,' he said. warning people not to click on unknown links, not to engage with suspicious strangers, and to avoid answering unknown emails. Meanwhile, the mayor who was targeted for assassination was notified of the threat against him. 'Threats are not new to us, even from criminal elements. I, as mayor, do not shy away from it. There have been mayors who have bolstered the security around themselves, and that is how I will continue to act. I have dedicated my life to the public from a very young age, nothing deters me, I am focused purely on promoting the city and caring for every resident,' he said. The arrest of the east Jerusalem cell, made up of men between the ages of 19 and 23, led interrogators to Iranian intelligence agents who were recruiting Israelis to carry out missions. One of the detainees, a 23-year-old Israeli citizen, was suspected of contacting a foreign agent and recruited to perform various tasks in Israel. The investigation revealed that the suspect recruited the other members of the cell to carry out the missions they received from the Iranian regime. Those involved sprayed graffiti in various places throughout the country, setting vehicles on fire in ​​Jerusalem, and gathering intelligence. 'For every reported arrest, there are 10 more' According to a source in the police, for every arrest of operatives working for Iran, there are 10 more cases being investigated. He said the police often stop the suspects before they carry out Iranian instructions that they would never be able to walk back from. But revealing the spy ring of Israelis working for Iran for years, sending photos of military bases and pinpointing sensitive sites, was an eye opener and a clear sign of escalation. The suspects told their interrogators that their motive for working for Iran was financial. Some had been in debt and the Iranians were willing to pay them well. They also said that although they loved the people in Israel, they did not feel like they belong.

Former Ynet reported injured on reserve duty in southern Lebanon	Haim Goldich is called up to serve at the start of the war fighting in Gaza until his unit is transferred to the north to battle Hezbollah across the border Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation's (Kan) correspondent, Haim Goldich, was injured during an in Southern Lebanon fighting where he was deployed in the IDF reserves.

Just last week, Goldich posted on Facebook about the end of his first round in Lebanon: 'The task is clear even if it is very difficult, it probably won't work like magic and not be over in a second.

Blinken meets PM urging cease-fire after Sinwar killing	U.S. Secretary of State hold 2.5-hour meeting with Netanyahu discussing the war in Gaza and Lebanon and the threat posed by Iran; families of hostages protest outside the secretary's Tel Aviv hotel calling for their release Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday in the first big U.S. push for a Middle East ceasefire since Israel killed the leader of Hamas last week - and the last attempt before a presidential election that could upend U.S. policy. The two men met for 2.5 hours before the secretary met with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said Netanyahu told Blinken that there was a need for a security and political change in Lebanon that would allow displaced Israelis to return safely to their homes. 'The meeting was friendly and productive,' the PMO said. According to Netanyahu's office the men discussed the threat from Iran and the need of Israel and the United States to unite forces to confront it. the PMO also said that Blinken 'expressed the US's deep shock over the Iranian attempt, via Hezbollah, to eliminate the Prime Minister of Israel, and made it clear that this was an exceptionally extreme incident.' Families of hostages demonstrated outside Blinken's Tel Aviv hotel in the evening hours blocking roads and calling for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza for over a year, to be released. Blinken began his meetings in Israel as Hezbollah launched rockets into Tel Aviv and Haifa and Israeli air strikes targeted parts of Beirut's southern suburbs, including an air strike that caused a multi-story building to entirely collapse and sent a fresh wave of panicked residents fleeing. This was the secretary's 11th trip to the region since the Hamas massacre last October 7 and the start of the ensuing war. Washington hopes the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar - Israel's most wanted man, blamed for triggering the year of warfare by planning the deadly attack on Oct. 7 last year on Israeli territory - will provide a new opportunity for peace. But Israel has so far shown no sign of relenting in its military campaigns even after assassinating several leaders of Iran's allies Hamas and Hezbollah, which lost its powerful secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah in a Sept. 27 airstrike. Blinken was meeting Netanyahu and other officials at the start of a week-long trip that will also take him to Jordan and Qatar. U.S. officials say he is exploring plans for rebuilding and governing Gaza after the war, key to reaching a ceasefire. Iran and its allies - Lebanon's Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis, armed groups in Iraq and Hamas in Gaza - have said that their 'Axis of Resistance' against Israeli and U.S. interests will emerge victorious. The Houthis said on Tuesday they had targeted an Israeli military base in Tel Aviv using ballistic missiles in solidarity with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkypiubgyx	2024-10-22T10:11:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/22/H111bbFfHe1l/H111bbFfHe1l_1_259_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Close call: Dramatic footage captures rocket hit near northern Is...	Lebanon rocket explodes near gas station in Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael, caught on both dashboard and security camera; no injuries were reported, with residents crediting defensive guidelines for their safety A rocket fired from Lebanon exploded near a gas station in Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael on Tuesday morning, just north of Zikhron Ya’akov. Captured on both a dashboard and security camera, the blast caused significant property damage but no physical injuries. One man suffered from shock, and the explosion damaged homes and parked cars in the area. Leah Cohen, a local whose home was hit by shrapnel, recounted, 'I was working in the garden when the alarm went off. I quickly entered the safe room, and then there was a loud boom. I'm just thankful I followed the guidelines.' Baruch Fein, another kibbutz resident, said the rocket exploded only several hundred feet from his home: 'There’s extensive damage, but thanks to the safe room, everyone is safe. It was a miracle.' Tami Engel, whose home was also damaged, echoed the sentiment: 'We entered the safe room, which saved us. You must follow the guidelines. The house is in ruins, demolished and destroyed. We're alive because we adhered to the defensive guidelines. Entering the safe room is essential; it saves lives.' Modi Bracha, head of the kibbutz’s alert squad, expressed relief: 'Fortunately, we have no casualties, just damage. The explosion was enormous. Property tax officials will come to assess the damage caused by the rocket's fall. People adhered to the guidelines, and it was truly fortunate.' Asif Izik, head of the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council, credited the outcome to adherence to safety measures. 'We woke up to a morning of alarms, but thanks to proper conduct and adherence to defensive guidelines, the incident concluded without casualties and with minor damage. Our defensive guidelines remain unchanged, and we conduct ongoing assessments with the Home Front Command.' From early Tuesday, rocket barrages launched from Lebanon hit various regions across Israel, including the West Bank. There were no reported injuries in all cases. The IDF intercepted several rockets, while others landed in unpopulated areas. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attacks, claiming that some rockets targeted the base of Unit 8200, the IDF's top cyber intelligence unit, in Glilot near Tel Aviv, and another aimed at an Iron Dome missile defense system battery in Nirit. Meanwhile, the IDF launched a series of nighttime airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Beirut, focusing on the group's naval unit. According to the military, the strikes, carried out by Israeli fighter jets, were directed by intelligence from the Navy and the military's Intelligence Directorate. The airstrikes reportedly hit weapons depots, command centers and underground infrastructure, including facilities storing equipment for maritime attacks. One key target was Hezbollah's naval base in Beirut, which is used to store high-speed vessels and train naval forces. These vessels are reportedly designed to attack Israeli naval ships and other strategic targets in Israeli waters. The IDF emphasized that these strikes were crucial in disrupting Hezbollah's ability to plan and execute maritime terror operations against Israel.

Senior Pentagon staffer leaked Israel's Iran strike plans, report	Sky News Arabic quotes a Pentagon source claiming a senior member of staff in the office of U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's aid for special operations is behind the leak A senior staffer in the office of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was identified as the leaker of the classified documents dealing with the Israeli preparations for an attack on Iran, Sky News Arabic reported on Tuesday, quoting a senior Pentagon Source. The suspected staffer is Bureau Chief Austin's aid for special operations and was authorized to have access to very secret information. A report in the Washington Post on Tuesday said the FBI was investigating the leak of the two highly classified intelligence documents. 'The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,' the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement cited by the Post. An investigation into the leak of the documents that appeared on a telegram channel was launched and the incident made headlines in major news outlets. Officials in Washington expressed their deep concern over the leak. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency (GNA) and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. One of the documents states that, according to the analysis of various images, the Air Force conducted exercises with air-launched ballistic missiles (ALBM), including at least 16 'Golden Horizon' missiles and 40 'Rocks' or ISO2 missiles. The documents also discuss 'covert drone activity' and extensive deployment drills. It also reports on 'secret UAV activity,' and claims that the Air Force conducted a 'second large-scale deployment exercise' between October 15 and 16. The report also states that, during those days, activity related to air-to-surface missiles (ASM) was observed at the Ramat David and Ramon Air Force Bases. Another leaked document, which allegedly contains an analysis by the NGA, reports that the IDF 'probably' also conducted an aerial refueling exercise on October 16, and contained a side note stating Israel's apparent ability to use UAVs in order to gather intelligence in Iran and 'across the region.' Israeli officials said the leak was an embarrassment for the Pentagon just one year after dozens of classified documents about the Russian war on Ukraine, were leaked by a U.S. Air Force IT technician. The leak shows how closely the Americans are watching Israel, despite the close alliance between the two nations and its revelation was the source of some discomfort and damage to the credibility of the American security and intelligence agencies. Israeli officials said they expected the leaker to be found and prosecuted so that such events do not occur but added that the leak would not prompt Israelis to hide information from their American counterparts although, it may increase some mistrust already felt against Washington.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjmfxergjx	2024-10-22T07:27:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/19/ryDaczZlyx/ryDaczZlyx_0_0_854_479_0_small.jpg
UAE emerges as key diplomatic player in Russia-Ukraine conflict, ...	Growing strategic ties between Moscow and Abu Dhabi hold significant implications, especially with Middle East embroiled in conflict, particularly involving Israel in Gaza and southern Lebanon On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, hailing the 'strategic partnership' between their countries and expressing gratitude for the UAE’s role in mediating prisoner exchanges in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The two leaders discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine as well as escalating violence in the Middle East. Formal talks continued on Monday. Putin specifically praised the UAE for its efforts in facilitating multiple prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine, the most recent of which occurred last Friday, with each side repatriating 95 prisoners. The UAE confirmed that this marked its ninth successful mediation in such exchanges since the war began, reflecting the Gulf nation's increasingly prominent diplomatic role. The growing strategic ties between Russia and the UAE hold significant implications for the region, especially with the Middle East embroiled in conflict, particularly involving Israel in Gaza and southern Lebanon. What does this growing partnership mean, and why has the UAE emerged as a key mediator in international conflicts? Experts shared the following insights with The Media Line: According to Dr. Nikolai Topornin, a Russian expert in international relations and geopolitics, there is no single factor driving the relationship between the two countries. 'For Russia, the UAE has become a very important outpost in the Middle East. But above all, since 2022, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Dubai has turned into a financial capital for Russia’s international settlements,' he noted. 'We know that many financial sanctions were introduced, restrictions on the use of SWIFT, on the use of dollars and euros in settlements. As a result, Dubai became a financial lifeline for Russia. For a time, all settlements with third countries, especially those involving dollars or euros, went through Dubai,' Topornin shared. Although secondary U.S. sanctions have complicated these transactions, Topornin explained that 'Russia and the Emirates now settle either in dirhams or rubles, so financial channels continue to exist.' Dr. Nikolay Kozhanov, research associate professor at Qatar University’s Gulf Studies Center, emphasized that the term 'partnership' might not be the most accurate to describe the two countries’ ties; instead, he suggested 'pragmatic interaction.' He said that the UAE’s relationship with Russia is part of the country’s broader strategy to diversify its foreign policy. 'It’s just more falling in the attempt of the Emirates to diversify its foreign policies, to make it more reliant on different players, and to gain more profit from this diversity of international contacts. Definitely, Russia turned to Asia as a result of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which provided the Emirates with a certain profit.' Kozhanov pointed to the UAE's role in helping Russia circumvent international sanctions: 'The Emirates is a kind of a springboard for Russian petrochemicals and oil to Asia and Africa. It’s definitely a source of a loophole in the sanctions regime against Russia, and by serving as a kind of a way for parallel imports to Russia, the UAE is getting additional profit.' Topornin also underscored the significance of the oil market in shaping the two countries’ relationship. 'The UAE and Saudi Arabia are key oil producers in the Middle East, forming the world oil market, and Russia is part of OPEC+. For Russia, stability in the oil market is crucial because much of the country’s budget depends on oil and gas revenues,' he explained. 'It’s vital for Russia to have stability to understand what future income they can expect, so avoiding any crisis scenarios in oil prices is a top priority,' Topornin emphasized. Despite this pragmatic interaction, Kozhanov noted that it does not mean the two nations are building an unbreakable alliance. 'There is a clear understanding in the Emirates that this interaction is not an attempt to build up a kind of ironclad block. It’s just a very pragmatic approach to use those opportunities that are provided by the international situation,' he said. 'In the region, for instance, we definitely see them cooperating in Libya, but at the same time, they have quite different views on Sudan. Russia supports the official government, while the UAE is supporting the opposing force. Their interests, despite cooperation, are not 100% overlapping,' Kozhanov added. Addressing the UAE’s surprising role in mediating prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine, Topornin remarked: 'Who would have thought that the UAE would play such a role? European intermediaries, Chinese or Indian mediators, and even countries like Britain and Brazil haven’t managed to achieve much in practical terms here. But the UAE, alongside Saudi Arabia, has filled this important mediating function.' Topornin also hinted at rumors of discreet meetings between Russian and Ukrainian representatives in Dubai: 'We can’t say these are regular or formal, but we understand that even prisoner exchanges require some form of interaction. So, it’s likely that in Dubai, behind closed doors, such contacts are taking place.' According to Kozhanov, it’s clear that such mediation efforts serve to enhance the UAE’s global standing. 'It’s more to show on the international arena the political weight of the Emirates themselves. It’s not about helping Russia or helping Ukraine,' he said. 'It should also be considered within the framework of a greater competition between the UAE and Saudi Arabia. While the Saudis are holding this peace conference, the UAE is trying to compete with them by playing the role of the mediator,' Kozhanov added. Kozhanov also mentioned that Russia’s military ties with Iran, while important, have not shifted the balance of power in the region. 'We don’t see any serious supplies of sophisticated weapons coming from Russia due to the war, and I don’t think we’ll see them anytime soon,' he said. 'The Gulf countries, including the UAE, are trying to navigate very carefully. On the one hand, they need to pay attention to the demands of their own populations, which are no doubt supporting Palestine and the Palestinians. But on the other hand, they are extremely pragmatic, and they are trying to stick to their interests that are naturally bringing them closer to Israel,' Kozhanov explained.

Metal giants: Driving the IDF's D9 bulldozer in Gaza	The veteran bulldozer has been standing at the top of the military's armored vehicle pyramids for years and shines in complex missions across the Gaza Strip in the ongoing war In Gaza’s Philadelphi Corridor, I met a man who's in love with a D9 bulldozer, and believe me, there's no other way to describe the relationship between Warrant Officer R. and the massive metal beast standing beside us. R. takes care of his D9 like a classic car collector, maybe with a bit more tolerance for dust. And when he talks about the monstrous steel bulldozers, he reminds me of a teenager describing his first kiss. And this isn't just the excitement of a novice. R. is a career soldier in the IDF Combat Engineering Corps’ Yahalom unit. He's been operating this colossal machine for over 20 years, witnessing all the battlefronts where the IDF has been present firsthand. This time, he says, it's a completely different story. 'This isn't just another war,' says the man who was in Lebanon, the West Bank and on the Philadelphi Corridor during the days leading up to Israel’s disengagement from Gaza in 2005. 'This war is far more intense,' he admits. But despite participating in countless operations, some of which are still classified and despite having been targeted by anti-tank missiles multiple times, the real challenge in this war isn't dealing with Hamas terrorists for him. 'Taking care of the equipment is of utmost importance to me,' R. says as we cross the border into the Gaza Strip. In short, some people fear explosives, while others are more concerned about the D9’s air filter and oil changes. Charging ahead of forces The Caterpillar D9 (or 'Doobi' in IDF slang) has been manufactured by the American company Caterpillar since the 1950s. It underwent armor modifications in the IDF during the 1980s and has since served in two Lebanon wars, two intifadas in the West Bank and countless operations in the Gaza Strip. Thanks to 8 tons of steel armor — an insignificant addition to the machine's total weight of 57 tons — it can handle almost any explosive waiting for it in the alleys of Rafah and Khan Younis. Anti-tank missiles are countered by slat armor, thick mesh that surrounds the driver's cabin and the bent and charred remnants found in maintenance depots testify to the heavy fire these machines have endured. Small arms fire is as routine as brushing teeth and isn’t even discussed. In the ongoing war, the D9 is at the forefront of every maneuvering force in the Gaza Strip, whether it's an armored battalion, a Givati company or elite units. Every advance into new territory is preceded by a bulldozer reconnaissance to clear land, detect explosives, pave routes, 'shake' buildings to trigger booby traps before the troops move in, build dirt embankments for protective positions and, of course, demolish structures. Since the beginning of the war, the IDF has destroyed tens of thousands of structures in the Strip, those used for terror activities or posing a threat to its forces. Some were taken down via costly airstrikes, while others were demolished using explosives — a cheaper but riskier method for the troops. Then there’s the D9. With a skilled operator at the controls, it can demolish a residential building within an hour, flattening it to a rubble pile no higher than a meter. This debris blocks any possibility of escape from tunnel shafts and can no longer serve as cover for Hamas terrorists. A winning duo Just before R. and I climb into the towering D9 cabin, I catch Lt. Col. Ran, the 162nd Division’s engineering officer, for a quick talk. This division is the only one that operated across all the areas where the IDF was active in the Gaza Strip and hasn’t left the territory even once since the start of the ground operation. Lt. Col. Ran is less excited about the engineering machine itself and prefers to talk about the people operating it — those with the understated image of tractor drivers, who are almost never credited after yet another successful operation. 'D9 operators are tough guys with distinct characters, without exception. Think about it: it’s a duo — a driver and a vehicle commander — who work detached from their home unit and are attached to a different force that needs them each time. It takes them time to build a rapport with the unit they've joined, to trust the people and to gain confidence,' he says. There are only a few dozen engineering equipment operators serving all the maneuvering forces in the division. It’s a small group that must meet a wide array of demands from various units. 'The engineering equipment operator, like any combatant, needs a commander to say, 'follow me,'' Lt. Col. Ran explains. 'But there’s no 'follow me' here — it’s 'after them.' They drive at the front of the force with the D9 and everyone else follows. It’s a tough mental challenge, entering an alley that no one has been in before, being the first to go in. But these people are heroes, every single one of them.' One of the heroes Ran talks about is Warrant Officer R., the one with a concern for filters and a gleam in his eye, who has been on operational duty in the Gaza Strip for nearly a year, leaving behind a worried wife and three kids. 'It’s really hard on the family, but they understand the need. Since I’m a career soldier, I can’t take breaks between rotations like the reservists. My wife is a brave woman— they're the real heroes.' Over the past few weeks, the anxiety level in R.'s home has doubled as his son enlisted in the Combat Engineering Corps and will also serve as a D9 operator. For now, he’s in basic training, but he might find himself meeting his father on the front line before long. 8 km/h in third gear R. shares all of this with me as we slowly make our way from the gathering areas to Gaza’s gates, heading toward the Philadelphi Corridor. And we’ve got plenty of time to chat — the D9 moves at a painfully slow pace of 4-5 km/h at most. 'In third gear, you can get up to 8 km/h. But if you want to take care of the machine, it's best not to do that,' R. explains. It turns out that 460 horsepower is quite a lot, but you still need a bit more than that to move over 60 tons of metal on tracks at a faster pace. After crossing the border, we switch places — R. takes the commander's position and I settle into the operator's seat. That's the official title for those who maneuver the D9 and anyone who dares call them a 'driver' will, at best, get a disapproving look. The operating mechanism of this massive bulldozer is different from any other tracked vehicle I’ve driven during my compulsory and reserve service: steering is done using two levers, but only with the left hand; the right-hand controls the enormous front blade; the gas pedal provides maximum acceleration when you release it and the machine stops when you press the pedal to the floor. There's also a brake pedal, operated by the left foot — a technique more commonly seen on racetracks. But here, instead of seeking the apex with a distant gaze, you need to focus on the ground, looking at the grooves behind the blade to find the line of movement. And despite the D9's towering height, it’s not easy to see what’s happening outside. The D9 lacks a suspension system, so every bump or terrain fold is felt acutely in your back and seat. The helmet is essential for anyone who doesn’t want to accidentally headbutt the turret’s iron handle. R., having decades of experience, uses the weight of the blade, lifting and lowering it according to the terrain to stabilize the vehicle and reduce the bouncing during travel. And with a weight of 5 tons, nearly four times that of an average family car, the blade plays a critical role in balancing the bulldozer. After a few minutes of driving along the route, R. decides to up the challenge and asks me to build a defensive dirt berm. The first step goes smoothly as I gather a decent pile of sand, but then I must reverse and continue the task. However, since the reverse camera quickly gets covered in dust and loses its usefulness within the first few meters, reversing must be done the old-fashioned way — by turning around and looking over your shoulder. Once we’ve had our fill of playing in the massive sandbox along the Philadelphi Corridor, I continue forward, seizing a moment when R.’s attention wanes to shift into third gear and try to 'push the speed limit.' But a convoy passing nearby, with tanks that look like small toys next to the D9, kicks up massive clouds of red dust, forcing us to pull over. By this point, it’s easy to grade the D9's performance test: it fails entirely in categories like speed, features, driving comfort, and noise isolation and with an 18,000-cc engine, it won’t win any awards for fuel efficiency either. But the cabin is relatively spacious, with a storage cabinet for drinks and snacks behind the operator’s seat (not the driver’s). The air conditioning system also scores high and no D9 would start a workday without it. A rescue takes hours Like any vehicle we routinely test, the D9 has gone through several generations. The first was called the N, delivering 380 horsepower; the second, the L, was larger and produced 500 horsepower. The R model, which I drove, was introduced during the Second Intifada and delivers 460 horsepower. The T is the most advanced model, with improvements focusing less on engine power and more on technological aspects. These include a hydrostatic operating system that allows for faster power transfer to the tracks, along with a GPS interface with sensors attached to the blade, enabling pre-set ground height data — meaning the D9 will dig until it reaches the target on its own. There's also the Panda, the autonomous sibling of the familiar 'Doobi.' This is a development by the Israel Aerospace Industries’ Elta Division, equipped with cameras and sensors that replace the operator, with remote control capabilities that reduce risks to human lives. But during routine missions, Division 162’s combat engineering teams face challenges no less complex than those of the autonomous systems — like irrigation pipes and barbed wire from the agricultural areas around Rafah that get tangled in the D9's tracks, sometimes requiring professional aid from the fire department to untangle the metal mess. At times, they’re tasked with complicated rescues that take long hours in the mud, rain or under the blazing sun. This happens when tanks or APCs get stuck on side slopes, in massive mud puddles, with broken tracks, or after hitting an explosive. In such cases, there’s only one machine capable of rescuing them — the D9. That same trusty bulldozer, which can’t fire a single shot, has stood at the top of the IDF’s armored vehicle pyramid for decades. Alongside it, a handful of skilled operators, utterly devoted to their vehicles, wouldn't trade it for any other machine in the world.

Watch press flee Hezbollah official speech as IDF warns of attack	Journalists hurry to grab their equipment while terror group's spokesperson still speaks into rapidly disappearing microphones as Arab Language IDF spokesperson issues a warning of an imminent attack on the Dahieh Journalists covering a press event given by Hezbollah's chief spokesperson Mohammad Afif on Tuesday quickly gathered their equipment and left after an Israeli warning of an imminent attack on the Dahieh in Beirut. Afif was still speaking as television crews collected their microphones and camera gear in response to the IDF's Arabic language spokesperson, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee's warning that identified two nearby buildings as the targets of the IDF attack. Afif insisted the journalists were not leaving because of the IDF warning. 'the attack doesn't scare them,' he said. Moments later, images from the attack began to emerge including of a building collapsing and plums of smoke rising from another. Before the rapid exit of the press corps, Afif accused the U.S. of complicity in the aggressions against Lebanon. 'The arrival of its envoy [Amos Hochstein, in Beirut] doesn't change our view that the U.S. is the mother of terrorism. We renew our trust in the Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and affirm that there will be no negotiations under fire.' He added that Israel had no justification for attacking branches of the Qard Al-Hassan Association, referred to as 'Hezbollah's bank.' 'The goal is to undermine the Lebanese people's trust. Hezbollah doesn't receive its salaries or fund its arms from this institution. Qard Al-Hassan was prepared for this day and will fulfill its obligations to those who have entrusted it with their money,' he said. 'The enemy is responsible for ensuring the safety of the hostages and we call on the International Red Cross to guarantee this. What's extracted from the prisoners under pressure is worthless. It won't be long before we have enemy captives and we'll negotiate over them,' he added before he too hurried to leave amid the warnings. 'The resistance and the command and coordination system are intact and the pace of operations is increasing,' he said before declaring that Hezbollah 'takes full and exclusive responsibility' for launching a drone toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea.

Israel confirms Netanyahu home target of drone strike	Minor damage is sustained in Saturday's attack targeting the prime minister's private residence in Caesarea; security around Israeli senior leaders and officials is bolstered since the attack Israel confirmed on Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence was hit by an attack drone on Saturday. The house sustained minor damage. Netanyahu and his family were not home at the time of the attack. 'Iran tried to assassinate Israel's prime minister and will not escape responsibility,' a spokesperson for the government said 72 hours after Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack. Security measures around Israeli leaders and senior officials have been increased since the strike. Earlier this morning, the Saudi Al Hadath channel reported quoting sources, that Israel confirmed Iranian involvement in the launching of an attack drone on Netanyahu's home. 'Officials in Iran's embassy in Beirut are involved in an attempted assassination of Netanyahu,' the channel said. On Saturday, Netanyahu posted a clip where he was seen walking in Jerusalem. 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me and my wife today made a grave mistake,' Netanyahu said. He vowed that the incident would not deter Israel from its mission. 'This will not stop me or Israel from continuing our fight for security,' he said. 'I say to Iran and its partners in the axis of evil: anyone who harms Israeli citizens will pay a heavy price.' A preliminary investigation revealed that the helicopter that detected the drone failed to identify it, leading to sirens being activated only in military areas and not in Caesarea. Following the strike, security forces, bomb squads and emergency teams rushed to the scene, including property damage assessors from the Israel Tax Authority.

Netanyahu's confidant and shadow emissary: Meet Ron Dermer	Ron Dermer, Israel's quite secretive government minister, remains disconnected from the public while forging deep ties with JINSA, a Washington-based think tank; His appearances before Knesset committees have been rare and cloaked in confidentiality, leaving no public record of his attendance; His efforts advocating for a controversial US-Israel mutual defense pac could significantly alter Israel's security strategy Since the start of the war in Gaza, Ron Dermer, Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs, has been conspicuously absent from the public eye and has not briefed the Knesset on his activities. Yet, he plays a critical role in shaping the nation’s war strategy. In recent months, especially following the departure of former IDF Chiefs of Staff Benny Gantz and Gadi Eizenkot from the government, Dermer has emerged as one of the top three war decision-makers, alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. He has been instrumental in key decisions, such as retaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor, even at the expense of a potential hostage deal, and has been involved in high-level discussions about targeting Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Dermer has also accompanied Netanyahu to the United Nations and assumed responsibility for proposing mechanisms to conclude the conflict in Lebanon. Despite his significant influence on national policy, Dermer's actions suggest a lack of engagement with the Israeli public. An investigation by Telem magazine, assisted by Uri Tuval from the Berl Katznelson Foundation, reveals that Dermer has scarcely communicated with the Israeli populace. Since becoming a minister, his appearances before Knesset committees, particularly the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, have been rare and cloaked in confidentiality, leaving no public record of his attendance. Dermer, who advocates for transparent hearings for Supreme Court nominees in line with American constitutional practices, does not apply these standards to himself and refrains from openly reporting his actions to the public or its representatives. He also avoids using social media or other communication channels to update the public on his activities. His Twitter posts are predominantly in English, and since October 7, only three tweets about Israeli holidays like Holocaust Remembrance Day and Purim have been in Hebrew. Unlike other ministers and politicians, Dermer does not produce video updates for the public or respond to daily events. Furthermore, Dermer does not grant interviews to Israeli media. Although he has held public roles for about 12 years, such as Israel's ambassador and economic attaché in the U.S., Telem could find only one interview with an Israeli media outlet since October 7. In that interview, Dermer explained his boycott of Israeli media dating back to 2009, due to a journalist allegedly not seeking his comment on a story about Netanyahu. While ignoring the Israeli public, Dermer frequently appears on foreign television networks, international podcasts, and gives personal interviews. The investigation struggled to find even a brief statement from him in an Israeli newspaper (Israel Hayom) since October 7. It seems Dermer has little interest in engaging with the Israeli public. On the other hand, Dermer's schedules from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024, reveal that Netanyahu is Dermer's sole authority figure. Dermer has been closely aligned with Netanyahu since 2000, when Netanyahu was on a hiatus from public life. Upon Netanyahu’s return to politics in 2002, Dermer began receiving roles from him: advisor in his office when he was finance minister, economic attaché in Washington, political advisor in his office when elected prime minister in 2009, and from 2013 to 2021, ambassador to the United States. Dermer also authored Netanyahu’s speeches in English. Even after becoming a minister, Dermer appears to view himself more as Netanyahu's personal advisor than a public decision-maker. Telem magazine's investigation discovered that in the 15 months covered by the diaries, Dermer held 570 meetings, sessions and discussions with Netanyahu, alongside dozens of government and cabinet meetings, averaging nearly two meetings per working day. Interestingly, when they converse privately, they speak in English. In contrast, during July-September 2023, amid the start of the school year and before the war broke out, Education Minister Yoav Kish had only three personal meetings with Netanyahu, averaging 0.04 meetings per working day. A hawkish stance on US-Israel relations While he remains elusive and uncommunicative with the Israeli public, a recent revelation has uncovered his deep ties with the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA). This Washington-based think tank, known for its Republican and hawkish stance, could potentially reshape Israel's security doctrine. JINSA is deeply entrenched in Republican circles and often criticizes President Joe Biden. Notable figures within JINSA include Elliott Abrams, a former deputy national security advisor under the envoy on Iran to presidents Bush and Trump, who also chairs the Tikvah Fund, a financial backer of the Kohelet Policy Forum. Another prominent figure is Major General Yaakov Amidror, a former head of Israel's National Security Council. In July 2021, Dermer joined JINSA as a research fellow. The organization primarily advocates for a mutual defense pact between Israel and the United States, which would obligate the U.S. to respond militarily if Israel were attacked. Historically, Israel's defense establishment has resisted such agreements, fearing that they might restrict Israel's military independence and necessitate U.S. approval for major actions like striking Iran, effectively making Israel a client state. JINSA argues such an agreement would bolster Israeli deterrence, though it is largely motivated by American interests, as it would require Israel to purchase more American arms. Since moving from JINSA to the Israeli government, Dermer has been a forceful advocate for this agreement. Reports suggest that in August 2023, Netanyahu dispatched him to Washington to engage with senior U.S. officials to advance this agreement, as part of broader normalization efforts with Saudi Arabia. Dermer's diaries reveal that during these discussions he maintained a close relationship with JINSA officials, especially its President and CEO, Michael Makovsky. In the first 15 months of his ministerial tenure, Dermer met or communicated with JINSA representatives 23 times. In the summer of 2023, as he pushed the defense agreement agenda with Netanyahu, the IDF chief of staff, the White House, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Dermer's interactions with JINSA intensified, with 13 meetings or conversations, including visits from JINSA leaders to his office in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, JINSA drafted a comprehensive mutual defense agreement and organized events aimed at swaying American public opinion, particularly among decision-makers. Thus, Dermer, who remains silent toward Israeli citizens, is deeply engaged with an American organization funded by private money, working behind the scenes to orchestrate a significant shift in Israel's security approach and policy.

It's the greatest pain there is': 3 parents talk about losing an...	Hundreds of families suffered the death of loved ones in the Hamas' massacre on October 7; 3 parents say the void left by the loss of their only child is dark and engulfing The pain of losing a child is unbearable, and studies show it's the most difficult loss to recover from. It becomes exponentially more intense when it involves an only child, leaving the parents alone. According to data from Israel’s National Insurance Institute, 121 parents lost their loved ones and were left without any other children since October 7. This is the story of three of them. David Levy, father of Lidor Since the murder of Lidor Levy, 27, and his girlfriend, Nitzan Rachum near the site of the Nova Music Festival, his parents have been living in the couple's home. 'I can't explain it,' David, Lidor's father, says. 'Everything in life feels strange since then. Lidor's motorcycle is still in the living room, his wardrobe is still neatly arranged. Everything is just as it was. I went to our house once or twice to get a few things and I couldn't even go inside.' 'Nitzan was pregnant, in her fourth month,' he says. 'We were going to have a grandchild. The whole extended family gathered on the evening of Simchat Torah and that's when they shared the news about the pregnancy. Everyone jumped on me, calling me grandpa; it was such an exciting moment. Lidor was everything we had and now we have nothing.' When the massacre at the Nova festival began, Lidor and Nitzan fled and managed to reach a shelter near Re'im. 'We didn't get to speak to him that morning,' David says. 'We know Nitzan spoke to her mother and said they were being shot at.' 'We searched for any clue for days, trying to get information. We already knew what had happened in our hearts, but we kept hoping it wasn't true, thinking maybe he was taken hostage. Everything was racing through our minds. We got the news on Monday,' he added. 'The days are incredibly difficult,' he describes. 'We're doing everything on autopilot. There's no desire to do anything, not even eat food. I don't want anything. My wife, who has cancer, has lost at least 10 kilograms. I feel as if we're still living on October 7 even now.' 'Lidor was our only son and I think it's the greatest pain there is. Everything I did in life was for him. Now, I feel half alive. I fight to change my thoughts all day long, to keep from falling into an abyss.' Polina Dov, mother of Racheli When reports of the massacre near the Gaza border began coming in on the morning of October 7, Polina Dov, the mother of Racheli, decided to drive from her home near Haifa to Kibbutz Re'im to look for her. 'I didn't know she'd gone to the Nova festival until that morning,' she says. 'I woke up around 8:30 a.m. and saw a message from her that had come in at 6:51 a.m.: 'Mom, there's shooting. We were at the party, we're running home.' I tried calling her, sent messages and she didn't answer. I decided to go and save my daughter.' Polina set out with her husband and their friend. 'During the drive, I spoke with her friends to try to figure out where she was,' she recalls. 'Around 11:00 a.m., my brother sent me a message with a photo he found on Telegram with Arabic writing on it. It showed Racheli in a car, injured.' 'I'm a nurse by profession, so I had to understand the situation, but my brain wasn’t working at that moment. I only wanted to save her. Now I can say that it was clear she wouldn’t survive from the first glance of the photo.' It was only by the afternoon that Polina managed to get the phone number of one of the two friends who were with Racheli. 'They told me that Racheli was injured and that they were losing her,' she says. 'I didn’t know she was already gone by then. One of her friends was also injured. I begged them to keep her warm, to put something on the wound. As we got closer to the area, we encountered a police blockade trying to stop us. I remember screaming and kicking them, saying my daughter was there and they just let us go. It looked like a battlefield. We drove past bodies, missiles and gunfire everywhere.' Polina later learned that Racheli tried to escape with her two friends when the attack started. They encountered terrorists dressed in IDF uniforms and their car was shot at. Racheli, who was sitting in the back, ducked to hide and a bullet that entered through the door struck her below the armpit. They managed to get off the road, drive to a forest near Kisufim and hide there, but Racheli succumbed to her wounds shortly after. 'We met a Maglan unit on the way to Kisufim,' Polina says. 'I convinced them to send a rescue team, and I got a message at 19:08 p.m. saying they had picked them up in a jeep. I believed she was alive until the very last moment. I went from hospital to hospital looking for my daughter until Tuesday.' 'That day, I went to the police to give a DNA sample and then returned home. In the afternoon, there was a knock on the door and they said she had been identified. I couldn’t save Racheli, but we managed to save her two friends.' Racheli was 25 years old. 'Racheli was a joyful, charismatic child, a true freedom fighter,' Polina describes. 'Everyone talked about her unique laughter. When she was 14, her father was murdered by someone who was mentally ill.' 'It was tough for her as an only child, but she grew from it, from the pain. She was strong, unbeatable. I miss her but I feel her presence all the time. I know she's watching over us and she gives me strength despite the hardship.' Rachel Vaknin, mother of Osher and Michael Since the murder of her twin sons, Osher and Michael Vaknin, 35, it's been hard for their mother, Rachel, to stay at home. 'I’m overwhelmed with grief,' she explains. 'They lived here with me and we were very close. I can’t be here since they died. It’s too hard to be alone.' They were each other's best friends. Born together, raised together, worked together and met their end together. 'They were one in two bodies,' Rachel describes, 'one couldn’t live without the other. They argued, they fought, they loved, they hugged.' 'They did everything together. They organized the Nova festival with Elkana Bohbot, who’s still being held captive in Gaza. They knew how to bring joy to people and they did it in the best way possible.' She has one regret: 'I’m so sorry I didn’t hug and kiss them tightly when they left the house for the party on Friday. I only told them to take care of themselves and that was it. They answered, ‘Everything will be fine, Mom,’ and left with their friends. Some managed to escape and return, and some were murdered along with them.' 'That morning, after I saw the chaos on television, I called them and sent so many messages. I asked Michael to look after Osher and Osher to look after Michael. Osher didn’t answer me. Michael did and he just said, ‘Mom.’ He was probably hiding somewhere.' Now she’s alone. 'It hurts so much,' Rachel says. 'They were angels who spread joy, love and peace at home. Everyone loved them. I miss their laughter, their hugs and their kisses. I pray they send me strength and health to keep living and continue remembering them until I’ll see them again one day.' ‘A vast void’ 'Of all experiences of grief, the loss of a child is the most difficult and there's research to back this up,' explains clinical social worker and psychotherapist Dina Dror from Elah Center NGO which provides psychological support in cases of loss and trauma. 'Parents aren't supposed to outlive their children by nature. A loss that leaves parents without any children creates a vast void in their lives, leaving them with a profound sense of emptiness, sadness, anger, the physical pain of absence, and an emotional pain that’s incredibly hard to bear. Coping with grief is especially difficult and complex in such cases,' according to Dror. 'From our experience in treating and supporting bereaved families, I can say that parents say the pain and longing persist and don’t go away, but they stop confronting it every day over time. Even if it seems impossible now, there’s life in a different reality within this sea of pain.'

These are the 12 fallen Druze heroes who gave their life to defen...	The Druze community have always been a major pillar of Israeli society, and their commitment to the safety of the Israeli people have been well documented; This is a list of the dozen Druze warriors who made the ultimate sacrifice Since the start of the Gaza war, 12 Druze soldiers have fallen. The highest-ranking among them fell this week: Colonel Ehsan Daxa, commander of the 401st Brigade, who died in battle in Jabaliya at the age of 41. He was laid to rest on Monday in his hometown of Daliyat al-Karmel, accompanied by thousands, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, other officers, and community leaders who paid their respects. The first Druze soldier to fall was Staff Sergeant Daniel Rashed, who died fighting Hamas terrorists on October 7. At 19, he is survived by his parents and three siblings. Rashed, initially declared missing for two weeks after the massacre, dreamed of joining the Golani Brigade, inspired by former Golani commander Ghassan Alian, a figure many young people from Shefa-'Amr admire and wish to emulate. Just weeks before completing the combat course with the 13th Battalion, Daniel stumbled and broke his leg. However, he persevered, remained with the battalion, and joined the fighting on that fateful Saturday. Lt. Col. Alim Saad, deputy commander of the 300th Brigade, was killed in a clash with infiltrators from Lebanon on the war's second day. Saad was 41 and is survived by a wife and three children. He had planned to retire for studies but decided to continue serving after the war broke out. He was killed in Adamit, near the Israel-Lebanon border. Sergeant First Class Jawad Amer, 23, from the village of Hurfeish, a live-fire zone manager, also died in the encounter with infiltrators from the Lebanese border, in the same incident as Lt. Col. Saad. Many members of the Amer family from the Druze village of Hurfeish have been killed in Israel's battles. Jawad, who aspired to follow his brother's path into electrical and software engineering in the high-tech sector, was scheduled for release a week before he was killed. Lt. Col. Salman Habaka, from Yanuh-Jat, commander of the 53rd Battalion of the 188th Armored Brigade, fell in battle in northern Gaza. At 33, he he is survivied by his wife and a two-year-old child. Habaka was one of the heroes of the Kibbutz Be'eri battle, leaving his family on October 7 to head south. In chilling footage, Salman recounted that Saturday morning and the battle he fought in Be'eri: 'I am proud of my fighters; they are true heroes. They quickly reached the tanks, acted swiftly, decisively and fought with the determination I expect from them. The 53rd Battalion is meant to lead to victory and will continue to lead to victory – big and small. Our hand will remain on top at all times, and we will not let inhumane and cowardly behavior crush our spirit. We will rise stronger in unity and strength and strike back,' he said. Major Jamal Abbas from Peki'in, a company commander in the 101st Battalion of the Paratroopers Brigade, fell in battle in Gaza at 23. He hailed from a family of fighters with a combat tradition stretching from his grandfather Gideon to the youngest grandchildren. Before Jamal was killed in Gaza, his father and brother managed to reach him on the Israeli military communication network. His father, Anan, who serves as a reserve colonel, said: 'You are the spearhead of the fighters, take care of yourselves.' Staff Sergeant Adi Harb, 19, from Beit Jann, who fought in the Nahal Brigade's reconnaissance unit, was killed in battle in Gaza. He enlisted about a year ago to become a combat soldier, fulfilling a lifelong aspiration. He was killed in combat in the Gaza Strip, leaving behind parents, four sisters, and a brother. Adi was supposed to celebrate his 20th birthday the week he died, and his family mourned: 'We hadn't seen you, Adi, for 43 days, and we were all eagerly waiting for Thursday, November 23, to celebrate your 20th birthday with you. How could we not wait? We already envisioned you in our minds, rising above our shoulders in endless joy for another birthday,' they said with pain. Staff Sergeant Sofian Dagesh, 21, from Mag har, a soldier in the 601st Engineering Battalion of the 'Iron Trails' Brigade (401), fell in battle in northern Gaza. On the 70th day of the war, he wrote: 'After months of not seeing home, I miss everyone. I've seen everything in this war and also grown and learned a lot. All this comes at a very high price – I lost friends, lost partners, and witnessed difficult scenes.' Master Sergeant Anwar Sarhan, 26, from Hurfeish, was involved in an accident between a military jeep and a truck near Gush Etzion, a cluster of Israeli settlements located in the Judaean Mountains. The vehicle overturned, and the ammunition inside began to burn and explode. Medics attempted to rescue the wounded but pronounced Sarhan dead at the scene. The spiritual leader of the Druze community eulogized him: 'Anwar's 100 days of reserve duty encapsulate his life's essence. He was the first to help, friendly, volunteering for every task, a young man who loved life and helping others.' Captain Wassem Mahmoud, 23, from Beit Jann, deputy company commander in the 601st Battalion, died in battle in southern Gaza. Wassem was killed in a severe incident in Rafah. He commanded an armored personnel carrier with soldiers inside that was hit by an explosive device. His acquaintances said he was expected to be discharged from the IDF and start studying, but he was killed on the night of Eid al-Adha. All events in his village were canceled in solidarity and appreciation. Wasim's grandfather was the first Druze casualty in Beit Jann. On April 1, he was supposed to go on a three-month leave before studying, but instead, he stayed in the army to fight with his soldiers. Captain Jalaa Ibrahem from Sajur, 25, a company commander in the 601st Engineering Battalion, fell in battle in southern Gaza. He is survived by a mother and 12 siblings, many in significant security roles. Jalaa was the fourth sibling in his family to serve in the Engineering Corps. Jaza Ibrahem, Jalaa's brother serving as an officer in the 91st Division, said, 'The last time he was home was on June 15th, on the night of Eid al-Adha. On that day, Captain Wassem Mahmoud from Beit Jann was killed. He went there because he knew him. After that, he came home, said goodbye to everyone, and went to Gaza.' He added: 'We urged him to stay, but he wanted to return so badly. Unfortunately, I didn't get to say goodbye to him. We are four officers in the Engineering Corps and two more in the police and Border Police, living through the war daily. In the army, we mentally prepare ourselves for the worst, and in the end, statistics touch everyone. We're six siblings, so unfortunately, it doesn't skip us. I was personally ready for it, but the pain still hits hard.' Major (res.) Nail Fawarsa, 43, from Maghar in the Lower Galilee, commander of the headquarters company in the Haruv Battalion, was killed about a month ago by a drone strike in the Yaara area. Nail married two years ago and left behind a wife and a five-month-old baby. 'His son will never see his father again,' said his widow in a choked voice. 'He loved the country so much – and died for it.' The Druze community in Israel makes up 1.6% of the total population, with over 85% enlisting, most in combat units, despite severe hardships in their alliance with the State of Israel. Druze localities have suffered from years of discriminatory policies, housing shortages, and hundreds of demolition orders, even for soldiers currently on the front lines. Some 10,000 homes of Druze citizens are connected to illegal electricity due to unregulated construction in all Druze localities, and so far, the government does not seem interested in improving the situation for the community, which has forged a blood pact with Israel.

The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency called on Tuesday for a temporary truce to allow people to leave areas of northern Gaza as health officials said they were running out of supplies to treat patients hurt in a three-week-old Israeli offensive. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UNRWA relief agency, said the humanitarian situation had reached a dire point, with bodies abandoned by roadsides or buried under rubble The call came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel looking for ways of reviving attempts to reach a cease-fire in Gaza, following the death of former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar almost a week ago.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1asj11sgkg	2024-10-22T03:34:12-07:00

European Union lawmakers on Tuesday approved the bloc's plan to use frozen Russian central bank assets to loan up to 35 billion euros ($38 billion) to its ally Ukraine. The European Parliament voted by 518 in favour to 56 against, with 61 abstentions, for the planned loan to Kyiv in the last legislative step after EU governments agreed the plan earlier in October. The G7 plans to provide an overall loan of $50 billion to help Ukraine, serviced by profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West. These assets were frozen shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. More than two-thirds of the assets, some 210 billion euros, are stuck in the 27-nation European Union, mostly with Belgium's asset safekeeping and servicing company Euroclear. Britain announced on Monday it would lend Ukraine 2.26 billion pounds ($2.9 billion).

War knocked human development in Gaza back to 1955, UNDP says	The war in Gaza has devastated the Palestinian economy, which is now 35% smaller than it was at the start of Israel's operation a year ago, while development levels in Gaza itself have collapsed to the level of the 1950s, the UN's development agency said. Launching a new study on the socioeconomic impacts of the war, the UNDP's Chitose Noguchi said that by some measures the region's poverty level was now approaching 100% as a result of the disruption, with unemployment now at 80%.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by09wlbx1l	2024-10-22T03:00:32-07:00	
The Jewish anti-Israel candidate that could hand Trump the presid...	Green Party leader Jill Stein has renewed her independent campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and Democrats fear siphoning of votes could win Trump the presidency as it did back in 2016 Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 elections had many reasons, but if you ask Democratic Party activists, they'll point first and foremost to one woman: Jill Stein. The 74-year-old Jewish activist ran in 2016 as the Green Party's candidate, clearly targeting left-leaning voters. When the votes were counted, it turned out that in the three states considered the 'blue wall' supporting Democratic candidates – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — Stein received several tens of thousands more votes than the total margin by which Donald Trump won those states at the time. This trauma haunts the Democrats now as well, deep into the 2024 election. In a race that's expected to be even tighter than 2016, Jill Stein could once again hand Trump the victory. National polls give her around 1% of the vote, and that could be enough to tip the scale. 'I like her very much,' Trump said of Stein at a rally in June. 'You know why? She takes 100% from them.' Independent candidates can't win elections in the U.S., but in a deeply polarized reality where every vote in a small number of states carries disproportionate importance, a third-party candidate can change the game. Democrats have felt this twice in the 21st century. In 2000, independent candidate Ralph Nader, Stein's predecessor as Green Party leader, won 95,000 votes in Florida — and George Bush defeated Al Gore in Florida by a margin of 600 votes following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, winning the entire race. This time, Democrats are running an aggressive campaign against Stein, including financial investments in television ads saying, 'Jill Stein helped Trump once. Don't let her do it again.' Stein, a physician, is considered far-left, but partly because of her isolationist agenda — including support for Russia and opposition to U.S. support for Israel — she attracts voters who embody the famous horseshoe theory: the far left and far right are very close to each other. Things reached the point where Stein received an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke last week and her campaign had to publicly distance itself from him. Stein insists there's no chance she'll withdraw from the race, no matter who pressures her, including her own children. 'For her political activities, she does not have the support of the family. When she told us she was going to run again back in October 2023, we asked her not to,' one of her sons told The New York Times.

IDF at height of Lebanon operation to remove Galilee invasion thr...	Four divisions and hundreds of troops are operating in southern Lebanon to dismantle Hezbollah's capabilities as terrorists retreat further north; IDF estimates a third of terror group's arsenal destroyed The IDF reached the height of its ground operation in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, with four divisions operating in the region for the last three weeks, effectively covering all Hezbollah sectors in the area. The IDF is also deploying new brigades, mainly of reserve soldiers, to eliminate the threat of Hezbollah's plan to invade the Galilee. The IDF has also in recent days advanced to larger towns near the border and the deepest points of the ground operation, which remains confined to areas close to the border. The forces have observed that hundreds of Hezbollah operatives left in the region are retreating to hide in their terror tunnels, trying to survive until the situation eases. They only emerge from the tunnels in small groups to engage IDF forces if they see an opportunity to set off an explosive device or fire at close range. Soldiers are injured almost daily in these skirmishes, but the numbers are relatively low compared to the war’s scale. According to IDF estimates, dozens of Hezbollah terrorists are killed for each wounded soldier. A key objective for the troops, as was reported by Ynet, is to capture as many Hezbollah operatives as possible for intelligence extraction during interrogations. Dozens of operatives have already been captured alive and delivered to detention centers in Israel. Some forces, particularly those from the 98th Division, which were the first to enter southern Lebanon, have moved on to the phase of clearing and flattening munition launch and firing infrastructure targeting the Galilee. This involves hundreds of structures along the border that oversee Israeli settlements and military outposts, now being destroyed using engineering equipment like D9 bulldozers or via controlled detonations. The forces have also managed to identify and ascertain the number of launches carried out from each house over the past year toward Israeli towns such as Margaliot, Manara or Metula from each individual building. Rows of destroyed buildings can be clearly seen in videos captured by drones – these structures had been used by Hezbollah to fire directly or indirectly at Israel over the past few months. In the final stage of the ground operation in Lebanon, which is expected to conclude within a few weeks according to the IDF Northern Command's plan, the military aims to destroy thousands of dunams of fortified wooded areas, mainly in the western sector, through unique combat engineering efforts. Some of these methods will be innovative, even compared to similar clearing operations carried out in the buffer zone the IDF has been establishing along the Gaza border over the past year. The IDF Northern Command is already formulating a plan to enforce and maintain these achievements following the ground operation, as well as in the event of a political agreement or cease-fire, if reached. This will primarily involve kinetic responses to any violation or renewal of terror infrastructure near the border. However, the implementation of this plan during routine times will depend on lawmaker approval, as any such strike could escalate into a day or two of fighting in the north, similar to the 'rounds' of conflict southern residents have experienced since the early 2010s. According to Northern Command estimates, the IDF has so far neutralized about one-third of Hezbollah's arsenal, including rockets, missiles and drones. The military said its forces have overpowered the Radwan Force’s front-line attack zones as part of the ground operation, though several more weeks will be required to complete these missions. IDF data indicates that seven Hezbollah battalion commanders, 21 company commanders and over 25 platoon leaders or deputy company commanders responsible for villages in southern Lebanon have been eliminated during the ground operation and the weeks leading up to it. 'Most of Hezbollah's commanders, from the top leadership down to the tactical level, have been hit or killed,' the military estimated. 'Overall, about 1,200 operatives have been killed in the ground operation, with over 2,000 in total. A diplomatic effort will be needed to complement the military action, and the IDF believes Hezbollah won't be allowed to return to southern Lebanon.'

U.S. proposal for northern cease-fire revealed, criticized for vi...	Following discussions between U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, and Lebanon's PM and parliament speaker, Hezbollah news service Al-Akhbar reveals the specifics of a fresh proposal aimed at resolving northern tensions; Plan involves extending international forces' jurisdiction north of Litani River, but Prime Minister Najib Mikati rejects Western oversight The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, aligned with Hezbollah, reported Tuesday morning that Amos Hochstein, the special Mideast envoy for President Joe Biden, introduced a new proposal during his visit to Beirut. The proposal aims for a political resolution on the northern front by amending UN Security Council Resolution 1701. According to the Al-Akhbar report, Hochstein seeks to revise the preamble to transform it into a resolution targeting peace along the Lebanon-Israel border and to prevent an armed presence in Lebanese areas near the border. Hochstein discussed these details in a meeting on Monday in Beirut with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri. 'The U.S. wants to end the conflict entirely, and we must devise a formula to put a definitive end to it,' Hochstein said. 'We need to ensure all parties understand that Resolution 1701 must be implemented. We are committed to resolving the conflict based on this resolution.' The report pointed out that Hochstein's proposal includes extending the geographical scope of international decision-making authority north of the Litani River, increasing the number of international forces operating within the peacekeeping forces, and boosting the number of military forces intended to be deployed in this region. The proposal reportedly also suggests expanding the missions of the international forces (UNIFIL) to grant them the right to inspect any location, vehicle or house suspected of containing weapons, and to conduct surprise patrols in any area without needing approval from Lebanese authorities (except in cases of intrusion into private property). Hochstein’s proposal further includes broadening the operations of international forces along the Lebanese coasts, including monitoring Lebanese seaports and inspecting ships, deploying monitoring teams at active or closed civilian airports, and establishing watchtowers and checkpoints along the Lebanon-Syria border. The report noted that Berri told Hochstein that Resolution 1701 is clear and requires no amendment. The report also indicates that the U.S. envoy was effectively trying to entice Lebanon with his proposals. Sources from the newspaper reported that any new mechanism must provide similar measures on both sides of the border and ensure there are no 'Israeli violations on land, sea or air.' Furthermore, according to Hezbollah, any discussion will not address the organization's weapons outside the geographical scope of Resolution 1701. Additionally, Hezbollah rejects the deployment of international or foreign forces along the border with Syria, as it contradicts Lebanese sovereignty. Hezbollah also claims the UN Security Council cannot add a new country to the states operating in the international forces without obtaining full Lebanese consent. The organization further rejects American and British oversight of the international forces' operational mechanism.

These are the 5 men that will lead Hamas in place of Sinwar	Five instead of one: A senior council based in Qatar will lead the terrorist organization in place of Yahya Sinwar, killed last week in Gaza A senior council will replace Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli troops last week in Rafah, as head of the Gaza terror group Hamas, two Hamas officials told the French news agency, AFP. 'The Hamas leadership’s approach is not to appoint a successor to the late chief, the martyr Yahya Sinwar, until their next elections' scheduled for March 'if conditions permit,' a well-informed source from the Palestinian group told AFP. The council, which includes five members, was established after the assassination in August of the head of the Hamas Political Bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, following the difficulty in communicating with Sinwar in Gaza. The council, based in Doha, Qatar, includes the representative of Hamas in Gaza, Khalil al-Haya; the representative of Hamas in the West Bank, Zaher Jabarin; the Hamas representative of Palestinians abroad, Khaled Mashaal; as well as the head of the Shura Council of Hamas, Mohammed Darwish. The name of the fifth member, the secretary of the Political Bureau, was not published since he is never identified 'for security reasons.' Another source in Hamas said that the leadership of the terrorist organization discussed the question of appointing a new leader without announcing him by name - but this possibility was dropped. These are the members of the council that will replace Sinwar to lead Hamas: Khaled Mashaal Mashaal is considered one of the most powerful people in the political bureau of Hamas, but his views differed from those of Sinwar - also, including when it comes to the relationship with Iran. Mashaal is currently the leader of Hamas abroad. He headed the political bureau of Hamas for 21 years, from 1996 to 2017, when he decided to end his position, and was replaced by Haniyeh. In 2021, he was elected again as the leader of Hamas abroad in an attempt to return to the arena Palestinian politics. In 1997, he was saved from an assassination attempt on his life in a failed Mossad operation in Jordan. Mashaal was indicted last month in the U.S. for involvement in the October 7 massacre. He lives a luxurious life in Qatar, and in the past his fortune was estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion. In recent days there has been a round of interviews to mark the anniversary of the October 7 massacre. In one of the interviews Mashaal caused a stir when he claimed that Hamas' losses are 'tactical,' while Israel's losses are 'strategic,' especially in the international arena. He was criticized by residents of Gaza and also by the members of the Fatah leadership, who appeared to grow closer to Mashaal after the elimination of Haniyeh. Regarding that assassination, Mashaal said - probably by mistake - that 'Iran killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.' Khalil al-Haya Khalil al-Haya, Sinwar's deputy, left the Gaza Strip before October 7 - and since then he is considered one of the senior leaders conducting the negotiations for a cease-fire and a hostage deal on behalf of the terrorist organization. Al-Haya also has a good relationship with Iran - where he arrived after the elimination of Haniyeh to participate in his funeral. The New York Times reported that Al-Haya was part of the 'limited military council' that Sinwar convened for two years to plan the October 7 attack, and was also the special envoy for the secret talks that took place on the subject with Iran and Hezbollah. Six months ago Al-Haya signaled that Hamas would not agree to a deal until the end of the war. 'If we are not promised that the war will end, why would I agree to hand over the hostages?' he said. In the same interview with the AP news agency, al-Haya claimed that the IDF had not destroyed even 20% of Hamas' capabilities at the time. 'The solution is to reach agreements,' he said. When asked if he regrets the October 7 massacre, he replied that he does not - despite the destruction in the Gaza Strip. He asked rhetorically: 'Suppose they destroy Hamas. Will the Palestinian people disappear?' Zaher Jabarin Jabarin, 55, is considered the 'economic brain' of Hamas. He served as the holder of the prisoner file in Hamas and was the deputy leader of the terrorist organization in the West Bank until the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut. A comprehensive article in the Wall Street Journal after that assassination reported that in recent years Jabarin has become the de facto supervisor of an economic empire that the United States estimates is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, an empire that finances the terrorist activities of Hamas. Jabarin is the one who manages Hamas' financial ties with Iran on behalf of Hamas and, according to U.S. and Israeli sources, takes care of the transfer of funds from Tehran to the Gaza Strip. He is also responsible for a series of companies that transfer regular income to Hamas, and operates a network of private supporters and businessmen who transfer funds to the terrorist organization. Mohamed Ismail Darwish The relatively unknown among the members of the council is Mohamed Ismail Darwish, also known as Abu Omar Hassan, who heads the Shura Council of Hamas. A week after Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran, it was reported that he had been chosen to replace him as head of the Political Bureau - but then Hamas announced that Sinwar had been appointed as his successor.

IDF destroys central base of Hezbollah's Naval Unit	Overnight, under the direction of the IDF Intelligence Directorate and the Israeli Navy, the Israeli Air Force struck Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, command centers and additional terror targets in Beirut. Some of the targets were located underground and included aerial and naval equipment used by Hezbollah to carry out terror attacks against the State of Israel. Among the targets in Beirut was a central base of Hezbollah's Naval Unit, where Hezbollah stored military speed boats, a training center, and an area to conduct experiments. The Naval Unit's speed boats were intended to be used in attacks on Israeli Navy vessels and against naval and strategic targets within Israel's territorial waters, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h11mhrvlyx	2024-10-22T01:13:20-07:00

7 East Jerusalem residents arrested for plotting assassinations	Arrests made after joint investigation by Shin Bet and the Jerusalem Metropolitan Police; They admitted that the main motive was nationalistic; Comes a day after a serious espionage case was announced, in which seven northern residents suspected of carrying out missions for the Islamic Republic were arrested Seven young men between the ages of 19 and 23, residents of Beit Hanina in East Jerusalem, were arrested on suspicion of planning to eliminate a nuclear scientist and the mayor of a city in the center of the country. This is a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem police. The arrests first announced on Tuesday morning follow a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem police. The investigation revealed that an Iranian official contacted the main suspect, named Rami Aliyan, who recruited him and gave him tasks in exchange for money. The suspect managed to recruit six more people from his neighborhood to carry out the tasks, including setting fire to vehicles in Ein Kerem, spray painting graffiti and throwing a grenade at the house of a security forces member. In addition, they received instructions to purchase weapons and grenades. The main task that the Iranian handler asked them to carry out included gathering intelligence on the mayors a city in the center of the country and assassinating one of the country's top nuclear scientists. The young men prepared the required intelligence and even made contacts to purchase weapons, but were arrested before they could complete the moves. Each of those involved has incriminated himself, and they were arrested in September. An indictment is expected to be filed against them Wednesday, after a prosecutor's statement has been submitted. Aliyan acted under the instructions of Iran, which provided him with precise details regarding the target of the assassination, and the young men were supposed to carry out preparation in the field. Although they failed to purchase the required weapons, the Iranians transferred funds to them to carry out the operations. The investigation revealed that the young men received different payments for different tasks: • 500 shekels for photographing various places, including the Weizmann Institute. • 1,500 shekels for photographing a certain destination. • 2,000 shekels for burning a car. • $100 for spraying graffiti against the state, and 'return the hostages now.' • Between 13,000 and 15,000 shekels were allocated for the purchase of guns and rifles , but they did not have enough time to complete the transaction. During the investigation, some of the suspects admitted to being in contact with the Iranians and carrying out the operations, and said that the main motive was nationalistic. The arrests come a day after a serious espionage case was revealed, also involving Iran, in which seven Israelis who immigrated from Azerbaijan, including a father and son, are suspected of having maintained contact for two years with elements in the Islamic Republic - as part of which they photographed military bases, which were also the targets of the ballistic missile attack from Iran earlier this month. Some of the seven were caught when they were following an Israeli senior official and his son, whom they allegedly planned to assassinate. It is described as one of the most severe security breaches in Israel's history. The Rishon Letzion Magistrate's Court revealed on Monday that the seven, all residents of Haifa and northern Israel, will be indicted on Friday. Among the suspects are a soldier who deserted from duty and two minors. The suspects—Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nisan, Vyacheslav Guschin, Yevgeni Ioffe and the two minors—were arrested on September 19 on suspicion of espionage. The indictment will include charges of collaborating with enemies of the state, which carries a potential life sentence. The suspects allegedly worked under the direction of Iranian operatives in exchange for hundreds of thousands of shekels paid in cash and cryptocurrency.

There are 1.2 million displaced people in Lebanon and the fear of...	Lebanon is unable to cope with the masses of displaced people who left their homes because of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, and many of them are staying in tents; In a poor country unprepared for such a crisis, a full-blown sectarian conflict could rip the country apart The Lebanese government estimates that over 1.2 million people have been displaced due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The country, already struggling economically, was unprepared for the massive influx of refugees from various regions and for such an extended period of time. This inability to provide adequate living conditions to everyone has only heightened existing tensions on Lebanon's streets. On Monday, Lebanese security forces clashed with refugees on Al-Hamra Street in Beirut, who were asked to vacate the Hamra Star building. Protesters responded by blocking the road with burning tires, leading the Lebanese army to intervene to restore order. The dispute over the building has been brewing for some time. Property owners have been trying to relocate displaced families, who have settled there, to alternative shelter centers, but the families are resisting eviction. The building's owners claimed days ago they 'have been cooperating with displaced families who forcibly entered the building on September 27,' and said the families were treated well. Interactions between the displaced and the local communities hosting them across Lebanon are fraught with challenges. While some found refuge with friends or relatives in safer towns and villages during the war, many did not. Numerous refugees are now sleeping in tents on the streets of Beirut, as evidenced by recent videos and photos from the city. On October 9, reports emerged of clashes between those displaced and security forces in Beirut's Ain Al Mraiseh, a coastal neighborhood in the city's north, when authorities attempted to dismantle the tents of those displaced. Addressing the war and the displacement crisis, Prime Minister Najib Mikati told Al Arabiya network, 'I hope that sectarian conflict does not arise as a consequence of the displacement.'

Harvey Weinstein has chronic myeloid leukemia	Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), NBC News reported on Monday, citing sources. Weinstein is currently undergoing treatment for CML, a type of bone marrow cancer, while in prison at Rikers Island in New York to face trial on rape charges, according to the NBC report. Craig Rothfeld, Weinstein's legal health care representative, declined comment when asked by Reuters on the status of his health, citing respect for Weinstein's privacy. Weinstein, 72, has been beset with health problems, his lawyers had earlier said. He was rushed to the hospital from Rikers Island jail in September to undergo heart surgery. Weinstein, who has denied having any non-consensual sexual encounters with anyone, was found guilty on rape charges in February 2020 in a case that provided impetus for the #MeToo movement. The New York Court of Appeals threw out the conviction in April, finding Weinstein did not get a fair trial because a judge improperly allowed testimony by accusers he was not formally charged with assaulting. He is in prison awaiting a retrial. Weinstein suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure, spinal stenosis, fluid in his heart and lungs, his representatives have previously said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdbjsvgyl	2024-10-21T21:34:26-07:00

Death penalty for spying? A look at how Israel deals with traitor...	The uncovering of a serious espionage case linked to Iran has sparked debates over the appropriate punishment for spies, with some lawmakers urging the consideration of capital punishment The expected indictment against the Israelis at the center of the serious espionage case for Iran that was revealed on Monday could be severe according to the police, mainly due to the long period during which the seven suspects allegedly operated on behalf of Tehran, reaching two years. The indictment is set to be filed on Friday, though charges against the suspects have already been determined. In the past, the most serious espionage charges were brought against Israeli atomic technician Mordechai Vanunu, who leaked information and photos from the nuclear reactor in Dimona. He was charged with severe espionage charges and even treason, convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Israel's Penal Code divides espionage charges into five different crimes, each with distinct characteristics, severity and penalties. The serious crimes of espionage and passing information to the enemy can lead to prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. For instance, former Israeli minister Gonen Segev was charged with espionage for Iran and convicted of espionage, but not treason, resulting in an 11-year prison sentence. Amir Makhoul, who spied for Hezbollah, was similarly sentenced to nine years in prison in 2011. Journalist Anat Kamm was convicted of espionage and unauthorized disclosure of classified information, receiving a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence. The significant differences in sentencing stem from the law's clear distinction between someone who spied and gathered security information and someone who did so without passing the information to the enemy. In Kamm's case, she provided the information to Haaretz journalist Uri Blau. The treason offense, which could be linked to this case as it was for Vanunu, comprises seven serious charges, with the most severe ones carrying the possibility of the death penalty. However, these offenses are not expected to be included in the current indictment. Meanwhile, lawmakers have started calling for harsh punitive measures against the suspects, including the death penalty. 'The phenomenon of traitors who harm Israel's security for monetary gain, while we're fighting for our future, requires the use of the harshest measures, including a death penalty law,' Culture and Sports Miki Zohar wrote on his X account (formerly Twitter). 'This is the only way we can create a clear deterrent to prevent similar cases.' Interior Minister Moshe Arbel instructed the advisory committee to consider revoking the citizenship of the Israelis suspected of espionage for Iran. 'The State of Israel, as a nation that values life, will act alongside stricter enforcement against breaches of trust, to expel and denounce those who act against it,' he said. 'This is how we should act, and God willing, this is how we will proceed.'

The last person I'd suspect,' shocked neighbors say after Irania...	Haifa residents in shock after 2 neighbors, including alleged spy ring leader, arrested; officials call for revoking citizenship and imposing financial sanctions on those involved Residents of Haifa expressed disbelief upon learning that seven Azerbaijani immigrants living among them have been accused of espionage, allegedly working for Iranian intelligence. Three of the suspects, who reportedly photographed Israeli military bases targeted in Iran's ballistic missile attack earlier this month, were reportedly caught in southern Israel trailing a senior Israeli official and his son, whom they allegedly planned to assassinate. One of the suspects, Vyacheslav (Slava) Gushchin, had lived on a quiet street in Carmel. 'He lived here alone for about two years. He drank a lot of beer, smoked and worked at car wash centers. He barely had money for food,' said a neighbor from the floor above. 'He told us his wife lived in Belarus. He said she came for a short visit and was deported, and he spent a lot on lawyers to bring her back. He barely had money to live on; it's inconceivable he was involved in espionage. He didn't always pay rent on time either. 'About a month ago, he was arrested for getting into a fight with a local business owner. We haven’t seen him since, and now this affair has become known. It's unbelievable our neighbor for the past two years was involved in espionage against the state.' The convenience store owner who clashed with him said, 'About a month ago, he came here drunk. I told him to go home because he was scaring the customers. There was a scuffle, and then the police arrested him. He was spying? God, he’s the last person I'd suspect to be a spy. I'm shocked.' Another suspect, Aziz Nisanov, believed to be the cell leader, lived on the third floor of a low-income housing apartment with his son Yigal Nisan, who is also in custody for his alleged involvement with the spy ring. 'About two weeks ago, the police came here, broke into the apartment, there was a big mess, they searched all the rooms. I didn’t understand what was happening, and since then I haven’t seen Aziz and his son,' a neighbor told Ynet. Israeli security agency Shin Bet revealed the severity of the case, highlighting how the suspects had carried out intelligence missions for over two years. The information they gathered allegedly posed a significant risk to national security, with the possibility of facilitating missile attacks on Israel. 'The key to confronting this is first and foremost severe punishment that will deter. People need to understand this is treason, a breach of national security, serving the enemy during wartime,' Shin Bet officials said, suggesting administrative and economic sanctions against Israeli citizens cooperating with Iran—including revoking citizenship, confiscating funds and property. Interior Minister Moshe Arbel directed his ministry’s advisory committee to examine the possibility of revoking the citizenship of the seven suspects. 'The State of Israel, as a nation that cherishes life, will intensify enforcement against acts of treason and will also expel and condemn those who act against it,' Arbel said. 'This is the proper course of action, and with God's help, we will follow through.' Security officials noted that public awareness of Iran's intelligence-gathering efforts has grown recently following a series of much-publicized arrests of suspects linked to Tehran. 'Publications on the subject help. People understand more, suspect and report,' they said. Authorities urged the public to follow safety guidelines, including avoiding suspicious links, not corresponding with unknown individuals and ignoring unfamiliar emails. The suspects, all residents of Haifa and northern Israel, include Aziz Nisanov, his son Yigal Nisan, Vyacheslav (Slava) Gushchin, Alexander Sidikov, Yevgeny Ioffe, and two minors whose names cannot be disclosed. Prosecutors are expected to file indictments against them in Haifa District Court on Friday, charging them with serious security offenses. The group is accused of photographing and collecting intelligence on sensitive military sites, including Air Force bases in Nevatim and Ramat David, the government bunker in Tel Aviv, Iron Dome installations, the Hadera power station and other critical infrastructure. They allegedly passed this information to Iranian handlers, who provided them with maps of strategic sites, including the Golani Brigade training base, where four soldiers were killed in a Hezbollah drone strike last week. According to Shin Bet, the suspects conducted espionage missions for over two years under the guidance of two Iranian agents, known as 'Alkhan' and 'Orkhan.' They were aware that the intelligence they provided could aid Iran in targeting Israel, potentially through missile attacks. The suspects were arrested during a photography mission in southern Israel, where three of them were apprehended in the act. Police Chief Superintendent Yaron Binyamin said that the suspects carried out approximately 600 missions over two years. These included gathering intelligence on sensitive sites, military bases and potential human targets, all in service of Iran’s objectives. The suspects’ contact with Iran was through a Turkish national, who acted as a mediator. 'He received the materials from the Iranians and delivered them to Israel. He was involved in espionage cases made public in recent months,' Binyamin said. Additional arrests related to this case have been made in Turkey and Azerbaijan. This intermediary is also linked to Moti Maman, a 72-year-old man from Ashkelon, who was charged last month with contacting a foreign agent. Maman had been recruited by Iran to assist in planning the assassination of senior Israeli officials, including the prime minister, defense minister and Shin Bet chief.

Following airstrikes targeting terror group's financial network, army unveils secret money bunker, located underneath Al-Sahel Hospital in heart of Lebanese capital; 'Funds stored here could have been used to rebuild Lebanon, but instead, they are used to rebuild Hezbollah' Following a night of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah's financial network, the IDF unveiled Monday evening a massive underground bunker located beneath a main Beirut hospital, which serves as a key financial facility for the terrorist group. In a press briefing, chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari presented a 3D illustration of the underground bunker, located beneath the Al-Sahel Hospital in Beirut, which serves as a central storage site for Hezbollah’s finances. The facility, reportedly used by the group's leader Hassan Nasrallah who had been assassinated in an Israeli airstrike in late September, is alleged to contain more than half a billion dollars in cash and gold. 'Lebanon has been mired in an economic crisis in recent years, and Hezbollah has exploited this to strengthen its grip on the country,' Hagari said. 'The facilities we targeted belong to Hezbollah and are disguised as civilian sites, but their sole purpose is to bolster the organization’s terror capabilities. Hezbollah has effectively created a state within a state.' Hagari revealed that the bunker, located at 7 Daram Street in Beirut, had been under Israeli surveillance for years. 'This bunker, deliberately constructed beneath a hospital, houses at least $500 million in cash and gold. The funds stored here could have been used to rebuild Lebanon, but instead, they are used to rebuild Hezbollah,' he said. He also issued a warning: 'Our aircraft continue to monitor the site, and we will keep tracking it. We call on Lebanese citizens, the Lebanese government and international organizations—do not allow Hezbollah to store money beneath hospitals.' Hagari also reported that the Israeli Air Force struck over 20 targets overnight, most of them in Beirut's Dahieh district, a Hezbollah stronghold. One of the key targets was an underground financial warehouse used by the Al-Qard al-Hassan association, a financial institution affiliated with Hezbollah. Hagari confirmed that the facility held tens of millions of dollars in cash and gold, earmarked to fund the group's operations. Hagari further outlined how Iran funds Hezbollah through three primary channels. First, oil and money are transferred from Iran to Syria, where the oil is sold, and the proceeds are funneled to Hezbollah through Unit 4400, a Hezbollah financial transfer unit. This method generates tens of millions of dollars. Second, Iran flies cash to Lebanon under diplomatic cover, with proceeds from its Quds Force’s independent oil sales delivered directly to the Iranian Embassy in Beirut and then to Hezbollah. The third method, according to Hagari, involves promoting economic ventures backed by Iran, including gas exports to Syria and the establishment of factories in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Turkey. 'This network was managed by Mohammad Jaafar Kassir, the commander of Hezbollah's Unit 4400, who we eliminated in Beirut earlier this month. A few hours ago, we also neutralized his successor in Syria,' Hagari confirmed, referencing recent reports of a drone strike on a vehicle near a Damascus hotel.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a bid by Michael Cohen to revive a lawsuit accusing his former boss Donald Trump and various former federal officials of returning him to prison in 2020 in retaliation for penning a book critical of Trump, who was president at the time. Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer, had appealed a lower court's dismissal of his suit, which sought monetary damages from Trump, former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, federal prison officials and the federal government. Cohen's suit accused them of violating his rights under the U.S. Constitution by restricting his free speech and subjecting him to an illegal seizure and cruel and unusual punishment. Cohen's lawyer Jon-Michael Dougherty said the Supreme Court's decision 'signals a dangerous moment in American democracy.' 'In denying Michael Cohen's petition, the Supreme Court has stated that the courts will not provide any deterrent for an executive intent on incarcerating its critics in retaliation for their speech,' Dougherty said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1n0szvxkg	2024-10-21T09:48:51-07:00	
Inside Hezbollah's financial network: Iran, banks and smuggling o...	While Tehran continues to supply its main proxy with funds, the terror group has turned to criminal and civilian bodies to continue to finance its fight against Israel The Hezbollah terrorist organization receives funding in various ways, both overt and covert. Iran, Hezbollah's main patron, plays a significant role in financing the terror group. According to reports, Iran delivers hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hezbollah annually and also supplies it with weapons. Hezbollah, however, doesn't rely solely on Tehran. The organization has realized the need to diversify its funding sources for various reasons, including U.S. sanctions on Iran. It has done so successfully, mainly via money laundering, arms trading, drugs and tobacco. Hezbollah's Qard Al-Hassan banking chain, whose branches were attacked on Sunday, is considered a central financial tool for the organization — but not an exclusive one. Therefore, targeting it won't necessarily eliminate Hezbollah's funding sources. Hezbollah has over the years extended its reach into various sectors in Lebanon, learning from Iran, including finance, energy and construction. It has established connections, increasing both its influence and wealth in the country. Among Hezbollah's financial entities is Bayt al-Mal (House of Money), a financial body functioning like a bank with branches across the country. Another financial body is Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance Support Authority, responsible for fundraising for the organization. Unlike entities that indirectly raise funds and present themselves as 'innocent institutions,' this authority openly promotes campaigns to arm Hezbollah on social media. 'Raise your head to the sky and see what your support has become — a drone,' one of the authority's videos circulated online during the war read. According to Israel’s Alma Research and Education Center head Tal Beeri, Hezbollah also has a financial unit responsible for salaries, money transfers and budgets, with all its financial activities routed via the financial institutions established by the terror group. Hezbollah also profits from drug smuggling operations across the Middle East, mainly involving the drug Captagon, an amphetamine-type stimulant. A few days ago, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions against Hezbollah’s financial network involved in oil and drug smuggling. Hezbollah collaborates with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to produce and distribute drugs. The Syrian army manufactures Captagon in factories across the country. The Syrian army's Fourth Division, commanded by the president's brother Maher al-Assad, plays a central role in drug production and has even been dubbed the 'Captagon Division.' Iran established a Captagon production line for Hezbollah in the Beqaa Valley region along the Lebanon-Syria border. Hezbollah has tried over the years to deny its connection to the drug's production and smuggling, being careful to ensure that its partners don't take on central roles in transportation and smuggling. Jordan is one of the key countries facing this drug challenge, with ongoing attempts to smuggle drugs into its territory including via drones. Over the years, Hezbollah has also extended its reach into the energy and fuel sectors. Hezbollah's opponents in Lebanon are aware of the organization's pervasive influence and many blame it for the current energy crisis in the country. According to Beeri, Iran’s fuel smuggling pipeline is another way for the organization to earn funds. 'They receive fuel from Iran, it’s smuggled to Hezbollah via Syria and Hezbollah starts trading or selling it.' He added that the terror group also profits from construction companies. 'There are many construction companies that appear to be civilian but are under Jihad al-Bina (Hezbollah’s socio-economic institution). There are construction, engineering and other companies belonging to Hezbollah. You can find something linked to Hezbollah in almost every field, presented as legitimate.' Many companies operating with or under Hezbollah are regularly subject to international sanctions aimed at stopping the delivery of funds to the terrorist organization. Numerous other companies in Lebanon and abroad are part of Hezbollah's financial network, across various sectors. It's hard to tell if Hezbollah could survive economically without Iran's support, relying solely on the complex financial network it has developed over the years. The organization also receives donations from communities abroad, with charity funds found in mosques around the world designated for donations to Hezbollah. 'Hezbollah is involved in almost every criminal activity worldwide, even luxury car smuggling. They have connections with criminal syndicates across the work, wherever a Shia community is found. Crime serves them not only for terrorism but also economically. It's a global operation.,' he added.

Ex-UN soldier exposes Hezbollah dominance in southern Lebanon, hi...	Michael, a Danish soldier who served in Lebanon a decade ago, describes UN's inability to act against Hezbollah, says 'reported daily violations of Resolution 1701, but nothing happened' A former Danish UN soldier revealed in an interview that Hezbollah maintained tight control over areas in southern Lebanon where UN personnel operated, further substantiating Israeli claims that the UN has failed to prevent Hezbollah's military buildup and enforce Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Lebanon War. Michael, a retired Danish soldier who served with the UN in southern Lebanon, told the Danish newspaper BT that UN personnel were 'completely dependent on Hezbollah' and had limited freedom of movement. 'In some areas, we couldn’t even take photos,' Michael said, referring to restrictions imposed by Hezbollah on UN forces. Michael, who served with the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) a decade ago, said Hezbollah's influence over UN activities was already pervasive at that time. He recounted that UN personnel were often blocked by Hezbollah operatives when they attempted to access suspected areas of terrorist activity. 'They simply blocked the road. They weren’t openly armed, but it was clear they were Hezbollah fighters,' he said. He also noted that UN peacekeepers were prohibited from documenting what they observed. 'It wasn’t allowed to take videos or pictures. If we did, locals could confiscate our cameras. This happened to some of my colleagues,' Michael added. When patrolling near the Israel-Lebanon border, Michael said UN forces were instructed to maintain a distance from Hezbollah operatives and avoid confrontation. 'We often saw 'civilians' near Israeli military facilities taking pictures. When that happened, we pulled back and watched from a distance, as we were instructed to do,' he explained. 'I once threw an interpreter out of my car for praising Nasrallah' Michael told the Danish newspaper that fear of the terrorist group was widespread. 'Civilians who didn’t support Hezbollah, especially Christians, were afraid to speak against it,' he said. He noted, however, that there was some cooperation between Shiite Muslims and UN personnel, with some interpreters affiliated with Hezbollah. 'I once threw one out of my car for praising Hassan Nasrallah. I refused to listen to that,' he said. The ex-soldier described a 'complete lack' of enforcement against repeated violations of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which prohibits armed groups south of the Litani River except for the Lebanese army. He expressed frustration over the lack of consequences for Hezbollah’s actions. 'We reported daily violations of Resolution 1701, especially restrictions on our movement. We were instructed to report every violation, but nothing happened. We never heard back, and no action was taken. It was incredibly frustrating,' Michael explained, adding that this confirmed his experiences in other UN deployments. 'The UN is ineffective.' Despite this, Michael emphasized that he and his fellow UN personnel believed in their mission. 'We had a reason to be there, even if some of us had to come to terms with the fact that we couldn’t do anything,' he said. He also noted that some UN observers in southern Lebanon held strong anti-Israel views. 'I remember one in particular, an Irishman,' he added. Michael expressed surprise at recent Israeli discoveries of Hezbollah tunnels and underground infrastructure, which are now being destroyed by the IDF near the border villages. According to the BT report, these tunnels are located near UNIFIL bases. 'We never saw or heard any digging while we were there—I would never have hidden that. But there were several civilian homes and even so-called 'chicken farms' near the Blue Line when I was there, and of course, we weren’t allowed to inspect them,' he said, referring to a demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel. Hezbollah's hostages The former soldier revealed that during his service, Israeli forces had shown a precise understanding of Hezbollah's positions along the border. 'We often visited the Israeli side of the border to get their perspective, and they could accurately pinpoint Hezbollah's locations on the other side,' Michael said. Michael's testimony comes amid growing tensions between Israel and UNIFIL. Israel has requested that UNIFIL withdraw its positions five kilometers (three miles) north of the border, citing ongoing clashes with Hezbollah. Despite the escalating violence, UNIFIL has refused to relocate, a stance Israel argues puts the peacekeepers at risk and makes them 'human shields' for Hezbollah, which operates near their bases. The UN peacekeepers have been caught in the crossfire in recent weeks, leading to international condemnation and concern from Israel’s allies, including Italy. Israel is worried about the potential loss of international support for its military operations. Foreign Minister Israel Katz clarified Israel's position last week, saying, 'Israel places great importance on UNIFIL's mission and has no intention of harming the organization or its personnel. We view UNIFIL as crucial in the 'day after' scenario following the war with Hezbollah.' Katz accused Hezbollah of using UNIFIL as cover, saying, 'The terrorist group deliberately fires at Israeli forces near UNIFIL positions to provoke conflict. We will continue to make every effort to avoid harming UNIFIL, in full coordination with its commanders and in accordance with international law.' Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts continue to reach a political solution to the northern front, as Hezbollah signals readiness for a cease-fire, separate from the ongoing war in Gaza. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut for talks, with Western diplomats urging Israel to seize the opportunity for a settlement, including a possible expansion of UNIFIL's mandate. 'We now understand that UNIFIL's mandate was flawed, and we need to explore either an expanded or a different mandate,' a senior Western diplomat told Ynet.

Putin, vote scandal and the Israeli link: Moldova's EU referendum...	President Maia Sandu’s push for Moldova to join EU sparks accusations of vote-buying linked to Israeli businessman allegedly backing Russia; despite controversy, initial results show narrow victory for country's EU membership bid Moldova is swaying between Russia and the EU on Monday following the announcement of the results of a referendum held on Sunday, where citizens were asked to vote for or against President Maia Sandu's plan to join the European Union. Overnight results initially indicated a sensational lead for the anti-EU camp, with 57% of the vote. By midday, however, after 99.41% of the votes had been counted, authorities announced that the pro-EU camp had narrowly won with 50.39% in favor compared to 49.61% against. Regardless, the result was disappointing for Sandu. The vote in Moldova — a country of 2.6 million people that was once part of the Soviet Union but has been increasingly looking to Western Europe, especially since Russia's invasion of Ukraine — was marked by significant tension. The pro-European President Sandu accused Russia of 'unprecedented' interference in Moldova's internal affairs, claiming an attempt to disrupt the vote, distance Chisinau from the West and keep it within Russia's sphere of influence. Moldovan police conducted around 350 raids in recent months, arresting hundreds suspected of intending to interfere in the vote on Russia's behalf. The allegations included not only spreading misinformation and pro-Russian propaganda but also 'buying' approximately 300,000 votes — a quarter of the expected total electorate — in a bid to sway the results in favor of the anti-EU camp. The pro-Russian campaign was reportedly led by Israeli businessman Ilan Shor, who fled to Moscow after being accused in Moldova of attempting to destabilize the country on behalf of the Kremlin and was convicted on corruption charges. Shor headed a pro-Russian party in Moldova that was declared unconstitutional after supporting protests against Sandu's government last year, allegedly aiming to overthrow her and install a pro-Russian administration. The 37-year-old Shor is also subject to U.S. sanctions. Shor mocked Sandu on social media over her supposed 'defeat' and 'miserable failure,' when initial results of the referendum were reported on. Even as Sandu has narrowly secured victory in the referendum, it's hard to view it as a success. The 52-year-old president, a former World Bank economist who strongly supports joining the European Union, initiated the referendum to gain public credit for her policy and hoped for a resounding win. Not only was the victory achieved by a very slim margin but it was carried via an unusually high voter turnout among Moldovan citizens living abroad, a population that largely supports EU membership. This fact is likely to undermine Sandu's leadership within Moldova and the pro-European image she and her supporters have tried to project internationally. Moldova began its EU accession process this past June and according to Sandu's plan aims to complete it by 2030. The emerging results are a major disappointment not only for Sandu but also for Brussels, which, amid what appears to be Georgia's return to closer ties with Russia, hoped at least to draw Moldova into its sphere of influence in the geopolitical struggle against Russia. In a speech delivered early on Monday, Sandu said there was 'clear evidence' that criminal organizations collaborated with foreign entities hostile to Moldova's interests, channeling tens of millions of euros into the process in an attempt to distort the vote and buy hundreds of thousands of votes. She also claimed it was an unprecedented scale of fraud and vowed not to back down. 'Their objective was to undermine a democratic process. Their intention was to spread fear and panic in society... We are waiting for the final results, and we will respond with firm decisions.' The referendum took place alongside Moldova's presidential elections and the results published overnight indicate Sandu is also facing challenges in her political career. While she garnered 42% of the votes, she didn't secure the 50% needed to win in the first round, forcing her into a second round on November 3 where she will face former Attorney General Alexandr Stoianoglo who won 26% of voters. Stoianoglo, who has the backing of pro-Russian socialists, could rally support from other candidates' supporters, posing a threat to Sandu's presidency. He claims that if he comes to power, he'll pursue a 'balanced' policy, maintaining ties with all parties — the European Union, the U.S. and Russia.

Military shoots down 5 Hezbollah drones over Mediterranean in largest drone attack in weeks, briefly disrupting flights at Ben Gurion Airport; interception follows heavy rocket fire on northern Israel, with no reported casualties In the largest drone attack in weeks, the IDF announced on Monday afternoon that Air Force helicopters and fighter jets intercepted five drones over the Mediterranean Sea. According to the military, the drones were intercepted before entering Israeli airspace. Following the launch of Hezbollah's drone swarm from Lebanon, departures from Ben Gurion Airport were briefly halted but resumed within 15 minutes. The IDF confirmed there was 'no security threat at the airport.' Around 50,000 passengers are expected to pass through the airport on Monday, including 24,200 on departing flights. Hezbollah has launched multiple drone swarms since the start of the war, though incidents involving five or more aircraft have been rare. This latest drone barrage followed a heavy rocket attack on Kiryat Shmona and the Galilee Panhandle, during which 25 rockets were fired. Sirens also sounded in Beit She’an, Tiberias, Nof HaGalil and dozens of other communities. Tiberias officials reported the interception of two rockets, with no casualties or property damage. A crater was discovered near the Gilboa region’s Moshav Moledet following a rocket strike.

Gaza settlements will happen, sooner or later, Smotrich declares	Finance minister makes remarks during event near Gaza border, titled 'Practical Preparations for Settling Gaza,' attended by Likud Knesset members and ministers Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Monday that Jewish settlements in Gaza are 'inevitable' and that he has believed since the 2005 disengagement from the Palestinian enclave that Israel would eventually need to retake the territory. 'It's clear to me that there will eventually be Jewish settlements in Gaza,' Smotrich remarked at a Nachal' movement event, held on the Gaza border under the title 'Practical Preparations for Settling Gaza.' The event, which featured workshops on 'settlement preparation' near the border, was attended by several coalition members, including Knesset members from the ruling Likud Party and ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir, May Golan and Smotrich himself. Nachala movement leader Daniella Weiss announced that the movement had 'ordered and paid for 40 buildings' intended for future settlements in Gaza. 'Representatives from 700 families are here, all committed to settling Gaza,' She said. 'The only solution is to eliminate Hamas, and those wishing for a normal life should move abroad.' Opposition leader Yair Lapid condemned the event, accusing Smotrich's Religious Zionist Party of hijacking Likud and pushing for endless conflict. 'This event endangers the IDF and Israel's foreign policy, and there’s no prime minister to stop it,' he said. The event invitation, issued with the Likud logo, read: 'Preparing for settlement in Gaza with Likud's settlement cores,' and attendees were expected to declare, 'Gaza is ours. Forever!'

Mass exodus from Jabaliya: Thousands of Gazans flee for 3rd strai...	Civilians evacuate as Israeli forces escalate operations, targeting Hamas infrastructure and surrounding key shelters; military actions, aimed at separating terrorists from civilians, heighten humanitarian concerns and draw growing international scrutiny For the third consecutive day, images surfaced on Monday showing civilians evacuating en masse from Jabaliya, a northern Gaza Strip area where the IDF has been conducting intensive raids for the past three weeks. Following the elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who imposed a reign of terror in the area, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee said, 'The fear barrier of [Yahya] Sinwar has cracked,' attributing the civilian exodus to the breakdown of Hamas' control. In the last 24 hours, the IDF’s 162nd Division reported destroying key terrorist infrastructure and tunnel shafts in Jabaliya. Soldiers from the 401st Brigade, whose commander Col. Ehsan Daxa was killed in Jabaliya on Sunday, neutralized several terrorists through tank fire, close combat and air force strikes. Gazans have claimed that IDF forces intensified their operations, surrounding schools that had been sheltering displaced civilians. Residents also reported that Israeli forces ordered the evacuation of civilians from Jabaliya, including areas around hospitals, which medical teams say are struggling under the pressure of the ongoing raids. Now in its third week, the 162nd Division's incursion into Jabaliya continues. Previous IDF operations in the area occurred in November, December and May, but unlike earlier efforts, the current offensive faces the challenge of evacuating civilians from a densely populated city where Hamas operatives have rebuilt significant military capabilities. According to IDF assessments, the Jabaliya raid is expected to last several more weeks, if not months. Hundreds of terrorists have been eliminated since the operation began, and large weapons caches and re-dug tunnels used by Hamas have been discovered. Raed, a resident of Jabaliya, expressed his anguish to Reuters, saying, 'We face death from bombs, hunger and thirst. Jabaliya is being erased, and there are no witnesses to the crime here. The world averts its gaze.' Israeli officials, however, emphasized that the evacuations are aimed at separating Hamas terrorists from civilians and rejected claims that the operation is part of a broader plan to displace residents from Jabaliya or the northern Gaza Strip.

Israel strikes Hezbollah's banking arm, IDF says attacks will con...	Air Force including branches of Hezbollah's financial arm, the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association; terror group vows the depositors won't lose any money despite Israeli strikes Israeli Air Force jets launched a series of overnight and early morning strikes in Lebanon, targeting dozens of Hezbollah command posts and locations where funds used for terror operations were stored. These funds were funneled through Hezbollah's financial arm, the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, according to the military. The strikes, which began Sunday night, are expected to continue throughout Monday. The Lebanese outlet Al-Jadeed reported that Israeli strikes hit western Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, while Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen claimed three people were killed in a drone strike on a residential building in Baalbek. Additional strikes were reported in areas including Baddnayel and southern Lebanon. Hezbollah vowed that depositors with Al-Qard Al-Hassan would not lose any money despite the Israeli strikes. Rocket fire from Lebanon also persisted, with sirens sounding in the towns of Carmiel and the Ma'alot area in Israel's Western Galilee. In his statement, the IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari warned civilians to avoid Hezbollah-affiliated sites. 'Anyone near locations used to fund Hezbollah’s terror operations should distance themselves immediately,'he said shortly before stikes on the Dahieh began. According to Saudi-based Al-Hadath, there was a noticeable movement of people fleeing the area following the Israeli warning. Sky News Arabia reported that a hospital in Baalbek was evacuated due to its proximity to an Al-Qard Al-Hassan facility. The IDF was escalating airstrikes against Hezbollah's financial networks, particularly in Dahieh, aiming to disrupt the terror group’s cash flow. According to the IDF, Hezbollah uses millions of dollars funneled from Iran to pay its members and purchase weapons. The cash, often converted from Iranian rials to U.S. dollars in Syria, enters Lebanon in suitcases, with as much as $1 billion circulating each year. The IDF said that Hezbollah has become Lebanon’s wealthiest employer amidst the country's ongoing economic crisis. The average Hezbollah operative earns around $500 a month, and the group operates 31 branches of its financial institution, Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which holds assets in cash and gold across Lebanon. The IDF indicated that Hezbollah’s financial power structure is also a prime target of the strikes. 'This will shake Hezbollah’s financial foundation, making it harder for the group to maintain stability for its members and workers,' the IDF said. 'Hezbollah has embedded its financial operations within schools and clinics, but many of these buildings will be destroyed as part of our broader strategy to cripple the organization.'

They didn't want us to see what they were doing.' He also testified that they were instructed to keep their distance from Hezbollah terrorists, and added that there was a 'total lack' of the ability to act against many violations of Resolution 1701.

7 Israelis face charges of spying for Iran	Suspects all immigrants to Israel from Azerbaijan to be indicted on Friday for espionage and cooperating with enemies of the state; the 5 men and two minors said to photograph military bases that were then struck by Iranian ballistic missiles in Iran's October attack In one of Israel's most serious security crimes, seven Israelis, all of whom immigrated from Azerbaijan, have been spying for Iran for the past two years. They are suspected of photographing military bases some of which were then targeted by Iran's ballistic missiles in the strike on Israel on October 1. The Rishon Letzion Magistrate Court revealed on Monday that the seven, all residents of Haifa and northern Israel, will be indicted on Friday. Among them is a soldier who deserted from duty and two minors. 'This is one of the most serious security cases investigated in recent years,' the state prosecution said. The Shin Bet began investigating the matter and was joined by the Police Serious Crimes Unit, 433. The suspects: Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nissan, Vyacheslav Goshchin and Yevgeni Yoffe, and the two minors, were arrested on September 19, on suspicion of espionage. The indictment will include charges of cooperating with enemies of the state, which carries a penalty of life in prison.

Ministers demand strong response to Iran	In an hours-long meeting, cabinet members accuse the military of a lax response to the drone strike on Netanyahu's home; security officials say the IDF can only take action instructed by the government Ministers in Israel's security cabinet voiced criticism over Israel's lack of response to Iran's aggressions including the drone attack that targeted the private residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday. In an hours-long cabinet meeting on Sunday, the ministers accused the military of failing to take appropriate action in response to the attack. Security officials said in response that the IDF can only take action after the government decides what Israel's response should be. The question of when and how Israel should respond to Iran's ballistic missile attack has not been brought before the security cabinet until now and would likely only be discussed after Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and senior security officials finalize the plan. Gallant was supposed to travel to Washington last week, to discuss and coordinate an Israeli strike on Iran with his counterpart but was prevented from leaving by Netanyahu who said that his trip can only take place after there was a cabinet vote authorizing the prime minister and the defense minister to decide on a plan. During Sunday's meeting, ministers discussed the consequences of the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and if it could be leveraged to reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal. The ministers expressed their hope that Qatar, a mediator in talks with Hamas could pressure the terror group to agree to Israel's terms. they also heard a briefing about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the American threat of withholding arms to Israel if aid is not delivered in sufficient amounts. In a letter sent earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin threatened to invoke a national security memorandum issued in March which set conditions for continued U.S. military support to Israel, including allowing unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid. Despite recent claims by Israel that it was not preventing aid, including the entry of 30 trucks of food into northern Gaza on Monday, the U.S. remains concerned about restrictions.

I shouted I know who it is,'' the doctor who identified Yahya Si...	Warning, this article contains graphic content: Dr. Assi Sharon-Sagi, an oral and facial reconstruction specialist at Hadassah Medical Center and a volunteer with the police forensic identification unit, says she was preparing for the day she would identify the terrorist leader Dr. Assi Sharon-Sagi’s phone rang while she was at home. In addition to her regular role as an oral and facial reconstruction specialist at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, she has volunteered for years with the dental forensic identification unit. Since the start of the war, Dr. Sharon has been tasked with identifying victims of the Hamas atrocities and fallen soldiers. That urgent call brought monumental news—Dr. Sharon was the first to confirm with a high degree of certainty that the terrorist who was killed by IDF forces in Gaza last week, was the notorious Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. His body was examined and identified at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir before being stored at a secret location. 'Every so often, they send me a photo and ask if I have anything to say about it or if there’s something important to note. It happens quite often,' Dr. Sharon says. 'That’s exactly what happened on Thursday last week. I was at home, received a call and some pictures, and the second I saw them, I knew who I was looking at.' Did you recognize him right away? 'Yes. While it does require sitting down, checking, and going over every detail to write an official report, I knew immediately from the first glance. I was thrilled. I hopped up and shouted, 'I know who this is!'' Dr. Sharon had been preparing for this moment for months. 'In recent months, I decided I wanted to gather information in case we received Sinwar for identification,' she shared. 'With the help of the police forensic unit and the Israel Prison Service (from Sinwar’s time as a prisoner), we collected data. At first, it was general information, numbers, and so on, but then we moved on to building a detailed file by gathering images from social media.' 'We call this an 'anti-mortem' file—a file built before death, containing all relevant information, whether it’s photos, CT scans, or other features not directly related to teeth but visible in the face and ears. Dr. Ayala Groswald-Meiri put it all together.' 'Fortunately, in Sinwar’s case, his teeth are extremely distinctive, and they appear in all the pictures. Later, we obtained information from Soroka Medical Center, where Sinwar underwent brain surgery in 2005. We retrieved three of his CT scans from the hospital. We kept this file, and every expert in the unit was familiar with its details and images. So, when I first saw the picture, I knew immediately what I was looking at.' According to Dr. Sharon, dental identification is one of three scientific methods used by the forensic unit to identify bodies. 'We rely on one of three things—or a combination of them: dental X-rays, dental treatments, or morphology—the shape of the teeth, jaw structure, and sinuses,' she explained. 'In Sinwar’s case, his front and side morphology are very distinctive—he has missing teeth and gaps between them. The moment I saw the picture, I could make the comparison. After that, we sat down and wrote up all the details to complete the identification report.' Dr. Sharon has been volunteering with the unit since 2010 and has been involved in many tragic events that claimed the lives of Israelis. 'The first one I worked on was the Carmel fire disaster. Another was the Nahal Tzafit flood disaster, which was the first time I had to identify such young and beautiful people,' she recalled. 'Over the years, there have been major car accidents and other events, but the biggest tragedy came on October 7, with the massacre of the young people at the Nova music festival.' 'We arrived on the night of October 7, and we started identification on October 8, working around the clock—24 hours a day, seven days a week. It went on like that for a long time, and later it became more focused operations. Throughout all these months, we’ve been receiving either information or bodies, conducting examinations, and working to identify or rule out victims, all in the effort to locate the hostages.' Does identifying Sinwar bring any sense of closure? 'I’m not sure yet if I feel a sense of closure because I’m waiting for something else—something happy. I’m waiting for the hostages. But I can say that it’s satisfying to have identified the man who murdered so many of the people I’ve identified during this time. It’s important for me to say that identification work is a team effort. Everyone contributes, building one layer on top of another, so we can create organized files and complete the identification process. That’s what allowed us to make this quick identification.' 'I wasn’t alone in this identification,' she added. 'Two other specialists were with me: Dr. Revital Hebert, who led the unit for ten years, and Dr. Tzipi Kahana, a forensic anthropologist. She also contributed additional details that weren’t included in the official report, which is based on dental identification, but they added to the certainty of our forensic findings.' This kind of work over such a long period must take a mental toll. 'I can’t fully describe the psychological difficulties that this role demands of us. But I can say that the best places for me to be, and the people who are easiest for me to talk to, are those who work alongside me in the unit. When I’m with them, I feel calm, and everything is fine. But when I’m in my regular job at hospitals and clinics, it’s much harder for me. It feels like such a stark contrast to the identification work. I always feel like I’m in the wrong place, like I should be helping with the identification work. But my real life is my job as a dentist and a mentor to residents.' Meanwhile, as the war in Gaza and the north continues, there’s only one thing she’s hoping for. 'I just hope as many hostages as possible return alive, so I can take them off my lists because they’ll come back on their own two feet. I’ll stay in this role and do this work as long as it’s needed from me and the unit. We’ll do everything we can to bring the murdered hostages back to their families.'

Rabbi sues Hamas, PA after wife, daughters murdered in attack	Leo Dee demands NIS 50 million in compensation after the shooting attack claiming the Palestinian Authority supports terrorism and the murder was committed by members of the Hamas terror group Rabbi Leo Dee and his family filed a lawsuit in the Jerusalem District Court against the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas terror organization, for the murder Rabbi Leo Dee's wife, Lucy, 48, and their two daughters, the late Maia-Esther, 20, and the late Rina-Miriam, 15, in a shooting attack about 18 months ago in the Jordan Valley. The lawsuit, which was filed a few days ago through the lawyers of the Shurat Hadin advocacy group organization, amounts to NIS 50 million. According to the Shurat Hadin organization, in accordance with the recent Compensation for Victims of Hostile Action Act, the court may award compensation five times as much as previously given. The lawsuit claims the Palestinian Authority 'supports terrorism' because the PA pays imprisoned terrorists, and therefore bears responsibility for the triple murder, carried out by Hamas terrorists. 'On Passover a year and a half ago, my wife Lucy and my daughters Rina and Maia were murdered by despicable terrorists. Since then our lives have changed beyond recognition,' said Rabbi Dee. 'It is unbelievable that to this day the Palestinian Authority pays rewards to the families of the terrorists, in support of the perpetrators of the damned attack.' 'This lawsuit is our attempt to do some justice, on behalf of Lucy, Maia, and Rina. The lawsuit does nothing to heal our pain or sorrow, but we continue to fight evil wherever he is. We are working at the legal level and hope to be able to damage the rewards and incentives that the terrorists have been receiving from the Palestinian Authority for decades as much as possible.' The new law to compensate victims of terrorism sets a minimum threshold of ten million shekels for the victim's next of kin, and five million shekels for each family member. 'This lawsuit joins a series of lawsuits that we are conducting these days against the Palestinian Authority and the terrorist organizations that it finances, but this time, in light of the new compensation law, we estimate that these will give some peace of mind to the victims of terrorism this time, in light of the amount of funds that will be taken,' said President Shurat Hadin organization, attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, who represents the Dee family. 'This is the time for the victims of terrorism to fight back with all their strength and bring about the economic collapse of the terrorist organizations.'

Turkish cleric accused of staging coup against Erdogan, dies in U...	Fethullah Gulen built a powerful Islamic movement; once an alley of Turkey's president before being branded a traitor he lived in exile; after the failed coup Erdogan arrested at least 77,000 people in a purge and closed down institutions linked to him The U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who built a powerful Islamic movement in Turkey and beyond but spent his later years mired in accusations of orchestrating an attempted coup against Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan, has died. He was 83. Herkul, a website that publishes Gulen's sermons, said on its X account that Gulen had died on Sunday evening in the U.S. hospital where he was being treated. Gulen was a one-time ally of Erdogan but they fell out spectacularly, and Erdogan held him responsible for the 2016 attempted coup in which rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, tanks and helicopters. Some 250 people were killed in the bid to seize power. Gulen, who had lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, denied involvement in the putsch. According to its followers, Gulen's movement - known as 'Hizmet' which means 'service' in Turkish - seeks to spread a moderate brand of Islam that promotes Western-style education, free markets and interfaith communication. Since the failed coup, his movement has been systematically dismantled in Turkey and its influence has declined internationally. Known to his supporters as Hodjaefendi, or respected teacher, Gulen was born in a village in the eastern Turkish province of Erzurum in 1941. The son of an imam, or Islamic preacher, he studied the Koran from infancy. In 1959, Gulen was appointed as a mosque imam in the northwestern city of Edirne and began to come to prominence as a preacher in the 1960s in the western province of Izmir, where he set up student dormitories and would go to tea houses to preach. These student houses marked the start of an informal network that would spread over the following decades through education, business, media and state institutions, giving his supporters extensive influence. This influence also spread beyond Turkey's borders to the Turkic republics of Central Asia, the Balkans, Africa and the West through a network of schools. Former Erdogan Ally Gulen had been a close ally of Erdogan and his AK Party, but growing tensions in their relationship exploded in December 2013 when corruption investigations targeting ministers and officials close to Erdogan came to light. Prosecutors and police from Gulen's Hizmet movement were widely believed to be behind the investigations and an arrest warrant was issued for Gulen in 2014, with his movement designated as a terrorist group two years later. Soon after the 2016 coup, Erdogan described Gulen's network as traitors and 'like a cancer', vowing to root them out wherever they are. Hundreds of schools, companies, media outlets and associations linked to him were shut down and assets seized. Gulen condemned the coup attempt. 'As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt,' he said in a statement. In a crackdown after the failed putsch, which the government said targeted Gulen's followers, at least 77,000 people were arrested and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers suspended under emergency rule. Companies and media outlets regarded as linked to Gulen were seized by the state or closed down. The Turkish government said its actions were justified by the gravity of the threat posed to the state by the coup. Gulen also became an isolated figure within Turkey, reviled by Erdogan's supporters and shunned by the opposition which saw his network as having conspired over decades to undermine the secular foundations of the republic. Ankara long sought to have him extradited from the United States. Speaking in his gated compound in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, Gulen said in a 2017 Reuters interview he had no plans to flee the United States to avoid extradition. Even then, he appeared frail, walking with a shuffle and keeping his longtime doctor close at hand. Gulen had traveled to the United States for medical treatment but remained there as he faced a criminal investigation in Turkey.

Sinwar turned down offer of safe passage out of Gaza, report	Hamas leader prepared for his death since Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's assassination; told mediators 'I’m not under siege, I’m on Palestinian soil' Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas who was killed last week by IDF soldiers in the Tel a-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah, received an offer from Egypt during the war to leave the Gaza Strip and in return allow Cairo to conduct the negotiations for the release of the hostages, but he refused, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. According to the report Sinwar began to prepare for his assassination after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli attack in Dahieh in Beirut. He informed his people that Israel would probably offer concessions after his death to end the war, but said that Hamas in negotiations is in a stronger position. Apart from that, he also advised Hamas to appoint a council to govern and manage the organization after his death. Ynet reported there is not a single definite replacement for Sinwar so far. It is possible that a council will determine Hamas' stance on a hostage deal and facilitate one in the future. On Monday, the political-security cabinet convened for a discussion regarding a hostage deal after Sinwar's death. A senior Israeli official said recently that no substantial progress or dramatic breakthrough is expected in the talks, at least until the possible Israeli attack on Iran and the potential response is not over. Sinwar's replacements are also not expected to make much progress with a deal until they see a development in the regional war. Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, traveled to Cairo on Sunday to meet the new head of Egyptian intelligence, Major General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad who replaced long-serving Abbas Kamel. The two met in an attempt to advance a deal and get the negotiations back on track. Israel and the U.S. were in discussions with the Egyptian and Qatari mediators, trying to understand if it was possible to reach a breakthrough with Hamas. Israel fears Hamas will exact revenge on the hostages, and relayed threats through the intermediaries not harm them. Israel offered free passage and a financial reward to anyone holding hostages, dead or alive, to release them or provide information about their whereabouts. Last Friday, Sinwar's deputy Khalil al-Haya confirmed that Sinwar was killed, in a recorded speech. He said the terror group would not compromise on its demands for the IDF to withdraw from Gaza and the war to end.

Turkish U.S.-based cleric Gulen has died, media says	Turkish Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara says was behind a 2016 failed coup, has died in the United States where he was based, Turkish media and a website associated with Gulen said on Monday. He was 83. Gulen built a powerful Islamic movement in Turkey and beyond but spent his later years accused of orchestrating an attempted coup against Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan, accusations which he denied.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj11x6dxlyx	2024-10-21T00:04:56-07:00	
US says THAAD anti-missile system is 'in place' in Israel	The U.S. military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now 'in place', Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is a critical part of the U.S. military's layered air defense systems and adds to Israel's already formidable anti-missile defenses. 'The THAAD system is in place,' Austin said, speaking to reporters before his arrival in Ukraine on Monday. He declined to say whether it was operational, but added: 'We have the ability to put it into operation very quickly and we're on pace with our expectations.' President Joe Biden said the THAAD's deployment, along with about 100 U.S. soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel, which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct 1. The United States has been urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear sites and his concerns about a strike on its energy infrastructure. Responding to questions from reporters, Biden said last week he had a good understanding of when and how Israel would attack Iran. But he also said he saw an opportunity to end the two enemies' back-and-forth strikes. Austin was cautious. 'It's hard to say exactly what that (Israel's) strike will look like,' Austin told reporters. 'At the end of the day, that's an Israeli decision, and whether or not the Israelis believe it's proportional and how the Iranians perceive it, I mean those may be two different things,' he said 'We're going to do - continue to do - everything we can ... to dial down the tensions and hopefully get both parties to begin to de-escalate. So, we'll see what happens,' he added.

ICC prosecutor accused of sexual harassment, report	Woman working as a secretary in the International Criminal Court said to be brought to tears by Karim Khan's conduct but refuses to file official complaint; internal probe recommends undisclosed measures; Khan denies allegations International Criminal Court (ICC) special prosecutor Karim Khan was accused of sexual harassment by a woman working as his secretary, the Daily Mail reported on Sunday. The ICC launched an internal investigation into the claims after another employee reported to her superiors that the woman 'was so upset she was in tears.' The allegations surfaced two weeks before Khan announced he was seeking arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over their conduct in the war in Gaza. Khan also sought warrants against no slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hamas military wing chief Mohammed Deif. The ICC investigation was conducted by the Independent Oversight Mechanism (IOM) authorized to investigate claims of misconduct in the court but after the accuser refused to confirm or deny the alleged harassment or lodge a formal complaint, the IOM recommended a series of undisclosed measures 'to safeguard everyone's rights,' the Daily Mail said. Khan denied any wrongdoing and said he was a victim of a deliberate smear campaign, adding he and the court were being subjected to a wide range of attacks and threats. 'I absolutely can confirm there is no truth to suggestions of misconduct,' he said. In the IOM annual report that was published on Friday, Kahn's name was not mentioned although the accusations against him were included. According to the report, allegations of his misconduct were made on May 3 and the woman who made them was told she can bring her accusations to an outside body. 'She still refused to file an official complaint,' the report said.

Israel states demands for Lebann cease-fire, report	U. S. special Mideast envoy Amos Hochstein due to visit Beirut to discuss cease-fire; Israeli demands include IDF forces being able to operate against Hezbollah along the Lebanon-Israel border and use its airspace for attacks Israel gave the United States a document last week with its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the war in Lebanon, Axios reported on Sunday, citing two U.S. officials and two Israeli officials. Israel has demanded its IDF forces be allowed to engage in 'active enforcement' to make sure Hezbollah doesn't rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure close to the border, Axios reported, citing an Israeli official. Israel also demanded its air force have freedom of operation in Lebanese air space, the report added. On Sunday the military said it was targeting the Al-Qard al-Hassan association, Hezbollah's banks and most valued financial asset and warned civilians to move away from its branches and avoid harm. The Air Force conducted raids on the bank in Beirut's Dahieh sector, a Hezbollah stronghold on Monday after overnight strikes there, in the Bekaa Valley area and in other parts of Lebanon. The Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, which directly funds Hezbollah's terror activities, including the purchase weapons and payments to operatives in Hezbollah's military wing,' the IDF said. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization stores billions of dollars in the association's branches, including money that was directly held under the name of the terrorist organization.' U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein was due in Beirut on Monday for talks on ending Israel's war against Hezbollah. According to reports, Israel presented its demands for a cease-fire agreement that would stop the IDF offensive on the terror group. A U.S. official told Axios it was 'highly unlikely' that Lebanon and the international community would agree to Israel's conditions. The White House could not be immediately reached outside regular business hours. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The embassies of Israel and Lebanon in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Nova massacre survivor takes own life	Shirel Golan, is found dead on her 22nd birthday; Her brother blames inadequate state support for post-trauma, calls for government action to prevent similar tragedies amid grief and mourning Shirel Golan was found dead on Sunday after taking her own life. She survived the horrific massacre at the Nova Festival on October 7 and was set to celebrate her 22nd birthday with her parents, with a plan to visit to the Western Wall and the Cave of the Patriarchs. Many well-wishers sent her birthday messages, but she did not respond. Later, she was found in the yard of her home. 'Since she survived, I noticed symptoms of post-trauma. The state did not provide her with the care she needed,' her brother Eyal said. 'On the morning of October 7, after the sirens subsided, I texted our family group, and she replied that everything was okay. My brother and I set up a command center to guide her on where to go. Initially, she got into a car with friends, but at some point, she switched to a police officer's vehicle that rescued her to Kfar Maimon.' He added, 'It later emerged that everyone in the original car was killed, 11 people. It was a ride of death.' Eyal described Shirel's struggles: 'After she survived, I saw signs of post-trauma like avoidance and withdrawal from social interactions. I urged her to seek help, but she said she only received support from the Nova association, not from the state.' He shared that she fell into depression and was hospitalized twice in a psychiatric facility in the town of Pardes Hanna because no official recognized her as a victim of post-trauma from the Nova events. 'The state failed Shirel,' he lamented. He recalled spending time with her during the Sukkot holiday, where she seemed okay. 'I asked how she was, and she said she was fine. I gave her a hug and a kiss, not realizing it would be the last.' Eyal said Shirel left no note. 'We are five siblings, and she was the youngest. The government needs to wake up. If it doesn't, there will be more cases like this. If the state had provided proper care, this wouldn't have happened. I've lost my sister, but I want to raise an outcry so others don't lose their loved ones.' 'The ministry expresses deep sorrow over the untimely death of the Nova survivor and shares the family's and community’s grief,' the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry said. 'Survivors face many complex challenges in their recovery and healing processes. Together with the National Insurance Funds and partners like the 'Nova' association, we offer support and assistance to survivors.'

After drone targets PM residence, security overhaul coming	Despite an investment of over NIS 1 million in fortifying Benjamin Netanyahu's private home in Caesarea Shin Bet to review all , residence used by his family; 'Had he been home, he would have been in danger' Following the drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, the Shin Bet is conducting a threat assessment of all government facilities, as the current security measures do not align with the growing threat posed by Iranian drones, according to a report on Sunday. A senior source commented, 'You protect one part of the body, but the blow comes somewhere else. This is a significant escalation and more effort is needed not only in interception but also in revising our fortifications.' As a result of this attempted strike, defense officials are expected to reevaluate renovation plans for the Prime Minister’s residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem, currently undergoing a NIS 45 million upgrade. These adjustments could add at least another NIS 10 million to the project. Yossi Shelley, Director-General of the Prime Minister's Office, visited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea on Sunday, accompanied by Israel Tax Authority head, Shai Aharonovich, to assess the damage caused by a Hezbollah-launched drone strike from Lebanon. Aharonovich, who replaced the director of the Compensation Fund due to personal reasons, was joined by professional teams who evaluated and documented the damages. Contrary to earlier reports, most of the damage was to the structure itself. Sources familiar with the situation stated that if Netanyahu had been home during the attack, he could have been in real danger. The villa, which underwent over NIS 1 million in fortifications in recent years, will likely undergo further security evaluations. A senior figure familiar with the situation stated, 'The narrative that Netanyahu's homes are constantly being renovated to drain public funds is false. Netanyahu is arguably the most threatened leader in the world by hostile forces. If he had been in Caesarea on Saturday, we might not have a prime minister today. Relevant security decisions will need to be made.' Netanyahu stated last night that the drone launched from Lebanon toward his private residence in Caesarea was a failed assassination attempt on him and his wife, Sara. 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me made a grave mistake,' he said.

What is Al-Qard al-Hassan association, now a target of IDF?	Bank provides Hezbollah with money laundering services and is one of the terror group's main financial assets; A 2021 data breach shows how it violated sanctions imposed in 2016, through ties with other financial institutions Al-Qard al-Hassan association that came under attack on Sunday is Hezbollah's alternative to Lebanon's banking system and was complicit in building Hezbollah's mini-state inside the country. Although it was founded as an association to aid families in need, it had become a bank in every sense of the word. The IDF said it was targeting the bank's branches to prevent funding to the Iran-backed terror group for its war. Founded in 1982, al-Qard al Hassan claimed its mission was to provide loans to all, regardless of religion or ethnicity to 'improve social cohesiveness and cooperation,' with branches spread around the country 'to save travel time.' According to the Alma Research and Education Center, it is one of Hezbollah's central financial assets. It has been under sanctions since 2016 and has more than 200,000 customers. It holds gold estimated to be in the tons, much in from jewelry given as collateral for loans and has loaned over half a billion dollars a year. Over time it became Hezbollah's main money laundering service. In 2021, the bank's data was breached and information on accounts, including those of sanctioned Hezbollah members, became public and included the bank's dealings with other financial institutions in violation of the sanctions imposed on it. Hezbollah runs infrastructure parallel to the government institutions, including in education, health, social, communication, energy and construction. These organizations provide support for the terror group's military and support its political position.

IDF targets Hezbollah's financial institutions	The Military spokesperson says Israel will reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah and its terror activities; IDF planes strike banks in Beirut's Dahieh and elsewhere around the country The IDF launched strikes on Hezbollah's financial institutions on Sunday after the military warned civilians to stay away in Beirut's Dahieh district and in the Bekaa Valley region. Panicked crowds clogged the streets and caused traffic jams in some parts of Beirut as they tried to get to neighborhoods thought to be safer, witnesses said. 'Anyone near sites used for Hezbollah's terrorist financing must evacuate immediately,' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said and the Arabic Language spokesperson posted a similar warning on social media, shortly before the strikes began. 'In the coming days, we will reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah's terrorist activities using civilian institutions, associations, and charities as covers. We will strike these targets tonight and update on the results in the coming days,' Hagari said. The military said that infrastructure belonging to the Al-Qard al-Hassan association, linked to Hezbollah will be targeted. It has more than 30 branches across Lebanon including 15 in densely populated parts of central Beirut and its suburbs. 'A significant portion of Hezbollah's activities, funded by Iranian state budgets, is conducted through these funds, intended for terrorist activities, including armament, weapons storage facilities, launch sites, member salaries, and other operations,' the IDF said. 'We urge those inside Hezbollah-used structures to evacuate at least 500 meters away in the coming hours.' These banks, which IDF plans to attack, hold Iranian currency converted into dollars in Syria, arriving in Lebanon in suitcases—hundreds of millions to a billion dollars in cash annually, primarily for salaries and military infrastructure, according to military intelligence. The IDF said Hezbollah has become Lebanon's strongest and wealthiest employer amid an ongoing economic crisis that began in 2019. The average Hezbollah operative earns a monthly salary of $500. The economic association serving as Hezbollah's bank is subject to heavy sanctions and therefore not connected to international clearing systems. It operates 35 branches across Lebanon with ATMs. According to IDF, all of Hezbollah's financial reserves are held in cash and gold at these branches. Hezbollah's financial power centers will also be targeted. 'This will destabilize Hezbollah, preventing it from providing stability and security to its operatives and employees,' the military said. 'Hezbollah structured this as an association and system from which it financially benefits, including schools and clinics. Many buildings will fall, and assets will be targeted. The operation is part of the strategic plan against Hezbollah.'

Shin Bet chief meets new Egyptian intelligence chief to advance h...	Ronen Bar held an introductory meeting with Egypt's Hassan Rashad, while the families of hostages urge the government to push for a deal in light of Sinwar's assassination Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar traveled to Cairo on Sunday for an introductory meeting with Egypt's new intelligence chief, Hassan Rashad, to advance negotiations and move forward on discussions for a deal after the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Ahead of Sunday's security cabinet meeting, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant held a discussion on efforts to bring back hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The meeting was attended by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and other security officials. After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week, families of hostages called on the government to push for a cease-fire and hostage release deal. Several families gathered at the Hostage Families' Headquarters in Tel Aviv on Sunday, demanding progress on a deal under the banner: 'Enough excuses—it's time to bring the hostages home.' Sharon Sharabi, brother of Yossi (murdered) and Eli, said: 'Recent developments have created a real opportunity to bring the hostages back.' He said Sinwar had been the obstacle to an agreement. 'Now that obstacle has been removed, it’s time to fulfill the will of the Israeli public and act according to the moral compass that’s been ignored for a whole year. People are celebrating the impressive achievements of the IDF and security forces, but let’s not forget—the main goal has yet to be achieved. The prime minister promised to bring everyone back. It’s time to deliver.' Gilad Korngold, the father of hostage Tal Shoham, echoed this sentiment. 'There will be no victory until the last hostage returns.' He recounted that it has been '380 days since my Tal was kidnapped to Gaza from Kibbutz Be'eri, along with his whole family—my grandchildren, my daughter-in-law, her mother, her aunt, and her cousin. Victory will be measured by the supreme moral test of bringing them back. Prime Minister, it is your duty, both Jewish and state, to bring them all home.' Korngold then directly addressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: 'After the assassination, you said the main mission is to bring them back. We demand to know what you are concretely planning to do to make this happen. Their time is up. If you can’t bring the hostages back, have the courage to tell the public. If that’s not the case, use your majority to bring them home. We demand answers and action. Their time has run out, and so have your excuses.'

House speaker says is investigating leak of Israel's Iran attack ...	We are following it closely,' Mike Jonson says adding he is to be briefed on the matter; Israeli officials say incident could increase mistrust in Washington; they say they hope the leaker is found and prosecuted to prevent similar incidents The United States is investigating the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel's preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday. The documents appear to have been prepared by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, describing U.S. interpretations of Israeli Air Force and Navy planning based on satellite imagery from Oct. 15-16. They began circulating last week on the Telegram messaging app. Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic missile barrage carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, its second direct attack on Israel in six months. Israel has intensified its offensive in Gaza and Lebanon, days after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Asked about the leak of the documents during an interview with CNN, Johnson, the U.S. House of Representatives' top lawmaker, said an 'investigation (is) underway and I'll get a briefing on that in a couple of hours,' he said adding, 'We are following it closely,' Johnson added. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Pentagon said it was looking into the leak reports. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. The Pentagon did not officially confirm an investigation into the leak was underway but said they were aware of the reports. The documents appeared on a pro-Iranian Telegram channel called Middle East Spectator which had posted support for Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the regime, in the past. Israeli officials said the leak was an embarrassment for the Pentagon just one year after dozens of classified documents about the Russian war on Ukraine, were leaked by a U.S. Air Force IT technician. The leak shows how closely the Americans are watching Israel, despite the close alliance between the two nations and its revelation was the source of some discomfort and damage to the credibility of the American security and intelligence agencies. Israeli officials said they expected the leaker to be found and prosecuted so that such events do not occur but added that the leak would not prompt Israelis to hide information from their American counterparts although, it may increase some mistrust already felt against Washington.

We thank Allah for this honor,' owner of house where Nasrallah w...	I lived in this house for 15 years', says Ayman Abu Taha who left his Rafah home last May says he is proud the arch-terrorist 'achieved martyrdom' in his apartment Ayman Abu Taha, the proprietor of the apartment where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar made his last stand, recounted his departure from his Rafah home to Khan Younis on May 6. Since then, he has been in the dark about his home's condition. In a BBC interview, he stated, 'I lived in this house for 15 years with my family. We never had to leave it, not even during previous wars. Nothing forced me to leave the house except for the approaching Israeli bombings and the evacuation and displacement orders issued to all my neighbors in Rafah.' Abu Taha went on to describe how his daughter first showed him photos circulating on social media, allegedly capturing Sinwar's final moments in their home. Initially skeptical, he only believed it when his brother confirmed the house in the images was indeed his. Reflecting on this revelation, Abu Taha shared, 'I was taken aback when I saw it. I couldn’t believe my eyes. But my brother called and confirmed it was our house, and that’s when the reality hit me. I received the news in disbelief. It's still hard to undestand.' On Instagram, under the account 'gaza_sweet,' Abu Taha expressed his family's pride in what they considered the 'honor' of Sinwar dying in their home. The house, situated on Ibn Sena Street in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood of western Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, became a symbol of defiance. In his post, he shared before-and-after images of the house from the war, highlighting the sofa where Sinwar sat when a drone captured him just moments before his death. 'The purest and most respected sofa and chair in the world are in our home. May Allah have mercy on you and grant you paradise, Abu Ibrahim (Sinwar),' Abu Taha wrote. In another post, he noted, 'Our home has been elevated in honor and pride with Abu Ibrahim. We thank Allah for this bestowed honor.' In a third post, Abu Taha continued, 'On behalf of myself and the Abu Taha family, we are all proud that Abu Ibrahim achieved martyrdom in our home.' Adding his voice, his cousin Muhammad Sami Abu Taha commented on Sinwar’s demise in the apartment, writing that he 'perished there as a fighter until his last breath. We hold immense pride in him and all who have walked this path of redemption.'

Israel has no ambassador in the UAE, despite importance of post	Amir Hayek, the only Israeli ambassador to an Arab country who did not return to Israel following the outbreak of the war, completed his term last Friday, leaving one of Israel's most friendly allies in the Gulf without an ambassador Since last Friday, Israel has been left without an ambassador to the United Arab Emirates after Amir Hayek, a political appointee of the previous government, completed his term and returned to Israel. Hayek was the only Israeli ambassador posted to an Arab country who did not return home following the outbreak of the war, remaining in Abu Dhabi all year. Yossi Shelley, the director-general of the Prime Minister's Office, is expected to replace Hayek. In July, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the posting. However, Shelley has yet to assume the role, and the Foreign Ministry has not yet taken the steps to approve Shelley in the ministry. The delay is due to the government's earlier political appointments in the foreign service and the next time such a posting becomes available will be in February 2025.

Col. Ehsan Daqsa, brigade commander, falls in northern Gaza	The 41-year-old officer was killed by an explosive in Jabaliya; 'A hero of Israel, a courageous, humble, and principled warrior,' President Issac Herzog says 41-year-old Colonel Ehsan Daqsa from the Druze city of Daliyat al-Karmel, commander of the 401st Brigade within the 162nd Division, fell on Sunday when an IED exploded in Jabaliya, in the northern Gaza Strip. Another officer was seriously hurt in the incident and two others sustained light injuries. Ehsan took up his command in June. 'I am filled with pride to receive the privilege of commanding you, a special and courageous generation of fighters and commanders who have been fighting non-stop for many months and continue to fight even at this moment as we speak,' he said when he was appointed. 'We all bear a very great responsibility: first, the clear need to perform our missions as fighters to the best of our ability, seeking engagement and decisively defeating Hamas wherever it may be found, and against any enemy required to face in other arenas and second that we be worthy of you, the brave fighters and commanders, and our heroic wounded who fight to recover, some of whom have even returned to the battlefield. And, of course, that we be worthy of the fallen and the dear bereaved families.' Ehsan is the highest-ranking officer to have fallen since the ground operation began in the Strip, alongside Colonel Yitzhak Ben-Bashat, following the loss of three other battalion commanders on October 7. During the fatal incident, Ehsan entered Jabaliya with two tanks—his own and that of the 52nd Battalion commander—reaching the forefront of the raid. From this point, four soldiers, including Ehsan, the battalion commander, and two additional officers, went on to conduct reconnaissance just 25 yards away from their tanks. At this observation point, they encountered an explosive device wired for detonation. The blast fatally wounded Ehsan, and the battalion's doctor declared him dead at the scene. The three other injured were airlifted to a hospital, with the 52nd Battalion commander seriously wounded, while the other two officers sustained lighter injuries. Investigations are ongoing to determine if they were also subjected to gunfire. According to military intelligence, Hamas, which has resumed operations in Jabaliya, was struggling to cope with the IDF operations after some 5,000 additional Gazans left the area for the south, over the weekend. In Daliyat al-Karmel, Ehsan's hometown, his death was met with profound grief. 'Daliyat al-Karmel is in mourning,' Mayor Rafiq Halabi said in a post. 'How the mighty have fallen. With sorrow, pain, and much mourning, Daliyat al-Karmel, the military, the Druze community, and the State of Israel bid farewell to one of their heroes. Today, Colonel Ehsan Daqsa fell in Gaza—a hero, brave, a warrior who became a legend, humble, and who fought since the war's onset.' President Issac Herzog called Ehsan a hero. 'Alongside all of Israel, I received with sorrow and pain the bitter news of the fall of the 401st Brigade commander, Colonel Ehsan Daqsa, who fell today in the battles in Jabaliya. Ehsan—a hero of Israel, a courageous, humble, and principled warrior—his fall is a loss to the State of Israel and all of Israeli society. I salute him and embrace his family, the community of Daliyat al-Karmel, and our brothers and sisters from the Druze community who have lost many dear sons since the beginning of the fighting, with dedication, a sense of mission, and a shared destiny.' Sheikh Muwaffak Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community, said the IDF lost one of its finest. 'This is a very difficult and painful loss for the State of Israel, the military, and the Druze community. It is unfathomable that the hero destined for greatness is no longer with us. Our hearts and feelings are with the family in these unbearable moments, as their world turns upside down with the receipt of the harsh and bitter news. The Druze community continues to pay the ultimate and most precious price in the war—losing the finest sons and officers.' Forces from the 162nd Division entered the third week of their operation in Jabaliya, after previous maneuvers in November and December, and a raid by the 98th Division on its refugee camp in May. Unlike prior raids in the ongoing Phase C of the battle against Hamas, which will extend into the coming years, the military faced challenges evacuating the city's population, allowing hundreds of Hamas militants to regroup under its cover. As reported first by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, military assessments suggest this operation may last for many weeks, possibly months, despite recent reports of significant departures of Gazans from the encircled area. Forces from the 460th and 401st Armored Brigades, recently joined by the Givati Brigade, have, according to military sources, eliminated hundreds of terrorists and located numerous weapons caches, as well as combat tunnels that were destroyed and later re-dug by Hamas. Following the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Ehsan received a commendation for assisting paratroopers who called for help in southern Lebanon. 'One of the soldiers shouted over the radio that they were under heavy fire,' Ehsan recalled the battle in the village of Aita al-Shaab about a year after the incident. At that time, Ehsan, then the commander of the 'Kfir' Armored Company, went out to help the soldiers with his team. Hezbollah militants tried to hit him and his soldiers with anti-tank missiles but missed. When they reached the area of the house where the paratroopers were staying, they fired a shell at another house where Hezbollah operatives were located, and the enemy fire ceased. He then managed to make eye contact with the paratrooper company commander, who reported over the radio that one of his soldiers was killed, and four others were wounded. Then came the most challenging part of the event—Ehsan and another soldier from his tank crew rescued the paratroopers and brought them to the tank, which carried a total of nine soldiers to the border fence. 'I have no doubt I would do the same today,' he said about a year after the war. The commendation justification noted that Ehsan demonstrated 'boldness, bravery, resourcefulness, and professionalism.'

Western diplomats voice concern Israel prolonging war	Former Jordanian Foreign Minister claims Netanyahu does not want to give Harris a win by agreeing to a cease-fire; others say IDF military achievements should be leveraged to end the fighting and complain that Israel is acting alone Western diplomats expressed concern that Israel will prolong the war despite its recent military accomplishments in the combat zones of Gaza and Lebanon, and not use them to reach a cease-fire. In briefings, the diplomats praised successes —such as the elimination of Yahya Sinwar and Hassan Nasrallah, and the coordinated pager attack in Lebanon, but urged that the momentum achieved —diplomats around the globe are urging the use of this momentum to forge diplomatic agreements. 'At this stage, diplomacy alone isn't sufficient,' an Israeli official said. Several diplomats have suggested that Prime Minister Netanyahu was also factoring in how a ceasefire might influence the upcoming U.S. elections. They believe that any breakthrough in negotiations would benefit Vice President Kamala Harris and that Netanyahu prefers to engage with Donald Trump. 'There’s no reason for Netanyahu to halt his conflicts before the U.S. elections,' said Marwan al-Muasher, a former Jordanian foreign minister. 'He doesn’t intend to hand Harris any credit or gift before the elections.' President Joe Biden said on Sunday that a ceasefire in Lebanon is achievable, though it would be more challenging in Gaza. Trump on the other hand said Netanyahu was doing a good job. 'Biden is trying to hold him back when he should be doing the opposite.' the Republican candidate said adding that the Sinwar's killing will make it easier to reach peace. 'I am pleased that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to do what was necessary,' he said. A senior Western diplomat claimed that after Israel 'managed to unsettle Hezbollah and surprise them and the entire world,' it should 'seize the opportunity and pursue a settlement in Lebanon,' adding 'We were astonished by Israel’s achievements in Lebanon. These are significant intelligence and military accomplishments.' Nevertheless, discussions with this senior diplomat, along with others, reveal a deeply worrying picture—a lack of trust in Israel's plans for Lebanon. This skepticism helps explain UNIFIL's strong opposition to complying with the IDF's demand to withdraw 3 miles northward. 'There is substantial concern in the international community that Israel's ground operation will deepen, leading to casualties among Lebanese civilians and UNIFIL forces,' explained the senior diplomat. 'There is significant apprehension about getting embroiled in Lebanon. Israel spoke of an operation lasting a few days—yet it has already extended beyond two weeks and is intensifying. We fear waking up in six months to find you still entrenched in Lebanon and fighting.' He went on to say that there was a willingness within the international community to expand UNIFIL’s mandate, but negotiations were necessary for that to happen. 'Any occupation of Lebanon would be a grave mistake and would provide Hezbollah with justification to continue its activities,' he said adding he was disappointed with Israel’s approach. 'Unfortunately, they aren’t communicating with anyone, which is why UNIFIL refuses to relocate—it contradicts their mandate and would also be humiliating.' He said that despite the severe blows Hezbollah has sustained, the terrorist organization still has leadership capable of making decisions if needed. 'There is an understanding in the international community about the seriousness of the Hezbollah threat. We are at risk of entanglement, and an operation initially intended for a few days could drag on for months. 'Today, we understand that UNIFIL's mandate was flawed, and it needs to be reconsidered or replaced with another mandate,' he said. 'The international community is open to this idea. It is clear to everyone that a different solution for southern Lebanon is necessary—because the problem must not be allowed to resurface. The West needs to consider how it will contribute to the solution. Negotiations will make this possible.' He also added, 'Many Lebanese would like to see Hezbollah vanish. But an Israeli occupation in Lebanon would be a mistake, as it would give Hezbollah a pretext to act. Do not provide Hezbollah with excuses. Israel needs a mechanism to oversee and enforce an agreement. This will require forces on the ground.' He reiterated that 'Israel's lack of communication with anyone is a mistake,' asserting, 'Israel will not achieve all its objectives in Lebanon. It had success against Hezbollah, and this should be leveraged to reach an agreement.'

Jewish-American billionaire hell-bent on Trump losing presidentia...	Mark Cuban, the successful businessman and co-star of TV's Shark Tank is a one-man army against Elon Musk and other billionaires who support Trump's race for the White House by propping up his opponent VP Harris The American presidential elections will be held in 16 days, but the seven most important states that will determine the country's next four years are already voting. As of Saturday, about 12 million Americans have already voted, with the most impressive figure coming from Georgia, where more than a million people, about 9% of the southern state's population, voted. Both campaigns are recruiting all the help they can get for the final stretch. As far as Donald Trump is concerned, this is mainly a very long line of billionaires, who continue to pour huge sums into organizations that are not subjected to laws concerning donations. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, is using mainly popular names, starting with the Obamas and ending with the singers Lizo and Usher. Recently, a new and intriguing name was added to the list: Mark Cuban, a billionaire and a celebrity. Cuban who is Jewish, is a household name for his plethora of projects, assets and television appearances over the years. At one point he was the owner of the Dallas Mavericks from the NBA, and in recent years has starred on the popular reality show Shark Tank. His fortune is estimated at more than six billion dollars, and he became a multi-millionaire mainly thanks to his early technological investments. However, his best investment was the Dallas Mavericks. In 2000, he became the main shareholder in the group for $285 million, and a quarter of a century later the Mavericks are worth between four and a half billion dollars and five and a half billion. Cuban sold most of his shares in the group last year, but still holds a professional-managerial position. Shortly after Harris replaced Joe Biden as the presidential candidate, Cuban announced his support for her, as an almost one-man army, trying to debunk Trump's narrative that the Republican candidate is a successful businessman with superior economic policies. It started with a Twitter fight with Trump supporters, but last week Cuban decided to take it a step further and get on stage. On Thursday, he appeared at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, where he said Trump's trade and tariff policies would bring back inflation and crush the dreams of entrepreneurs, by making their costs impossible. Cuban was in Arizona on Saturday and is expected to appear in Michigan alongside Harris' husband, Doug Amhoff on Sunday. So far, Cuban's support for Harris does not include financial contributions, but he does coordinate with the campaign, which has moved to a very aggressive line of attack against the 78-year-old Trump's ability to function. Over the weekend, sources within Trump's campaign leaked to Politico that he cut back on appearances and canceled four consecutive interviews because he was 'exhausted.' The news quickly made headlines and Harris campaign ads. Harris' campaigns focuses on the question whether Trump to fit to serve the toughest job in the world in his condition.

Enslaved by ISIS, liberated by IDF: The story of Fawzia Amin Sido	Fawzia captured and treated as a sex slave by the Islamic State in Syria, routinely beaten, raped and forced to devour human flesh to survive, and upon arriving in Gaza, witnessed the cruelty of Hamas, eventually liberated by Israeli forces Fawzia Amin Sido, a young Yazidi woman who was abducted by ISIS as a child in 2014 and ended up in Gaza said she had endured starvation, abuse and rape. She was rescued by Israeli forces and returned to her family. In an interview with Britain's The Sun, Sido recounted the chilling events from a decade ago when she, along with other Yazidi women and girls, was forcibly taken to Tal Afar. There, they were deprived of food for four excruciating days until their captors finally fed them upon reaching northwestern Iraq. Some of the details ahead are painfully graphic. 'They cooked rice and meat and gave it to us to eat. We were so hungry that we immediately ate everything on the table,' Sido recalled. 'We knew something was wrong because the taste was strange, but we were starving. After we finished, we all had stomach aches and felt unwell. Then they told us that the meat we ate was from babies.' She described how one woman succumbed to a heart attack and died instantly. They showed us pictures of babies whose heads were decapitated and said, 'These are the children you ate.' It was very difficult, but it's not our fault. They forced it on us. It wasn't in our hands,' she said. In a chilling description, Sido added that mothers of babies cried and screamed at that moment because they understood why they were separated from their babies. 'One of them even recognized her son in the pictures they showed her.' In early 2015, Fawzia was transferred to al-Raqqa, where she was held underground for nine months in degrading conditions alongside roughly 200 other women. 'We were in darkness all the time, we didn't see sunlight,' she said. 'We did nothing, we couldn't go outside. We drank dirty water, some girls died. It was a very difficult time.' She said men occasionally entered their holding area, 'choosing a girl they fancied and taking her with them.' Fawzia herself was bought and sold five times by ISIS militants during her years in Syria. The fifth man to purchase her was a Palestinian ISIS fighter, ten years her senior. He used drugs to rape her when she was just 14, and he was 24. 'At first, I hid in the bathroom while he slept because I didn't know what he wanted from me,' she said. 'I was scared and didn't want him to do anything. When he noticed I was hiding, he gave me drugs and put me to sleep, and then he raped me.' He abused her until she was 15, and she bore him a son and a daughter. By 2018, as the Islamic State was pushed out from Syria, she lost contact with her captor. She was subsequently sent to the notorious Al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, home to ruthless ISIS militants and their families, including Western Muslims who joined them. 'ISIS women were very mean to me and forced me to work for them,' she said. 'I always did what they told me because I was so young and scared. They also tried to force me to be Muslim.' Eight months later, she learned her Palestinian captor was imprisoned in Idlib, Syria. Fearing for her children's future, she traveled to Gaza to live with his family. She was taken there via Turkey and Egypt with a forged passport, finally arriving in 2020. Along the way, she traversed an underground tunnel in Idlib, where some people died from lack of oxygen, before walking 31 hours to her next stop in Turkey. Fawzia hoped her husband's family in Gaza would respect her as the mother of his children, yet she faced humiliation there too. Regularly beaten, she was effectively imprisoned in her home under Hamas rule. Meanwhile, she was informed that her husband had been killed. Contrary to reports, she did not remarry his brother. 'I was never free to do what I wanted in Gaza. Had I been, I would have left much sooner. I couldn’t leave; I was constantly under their control. Once, Hamas members held a gun to my head when I went outside with a friend. They told me I wasn’t allowed to.' She said that, in reality, Hamas treated her like a slave. After the massacre on October 7, she was sent to work as a slave in a hospital, saying that 'all hospitals served as Hamas bases. Everyone was armed. Weapons were everywhere.' Only on October 1 this year was she finally released from Gaza after months of diplomatic efforts between the U.S., Iraq, and Israel, risking her life in the process. Following her release, Hamas claimed she lived in Gaza willingly and only wanted to leave because of the war. 'That is an outright lie,' she said. 'I was never free there. I was compelled to stay at home. When I was in Israel and knew there was no more Hamas, I was overjoyed. I could breathe again. They are very evil; they killed people and forced me to stay there. Why would I want to stay there? They claim the experiences I describe didn’t happen to me; they should have been there instead of me. There’s no difference between Hamas and ISIS. I didn’t believe I would be saved until it actually happened.' Fawzia is reluctant to discuss her children, now aged five and six, whom she hasn't seen for several months. Her lawyer mentioned, 'We don’t discuss her children much; they were taken from her long before she left Gaza. Not taking them with her wasn’t her choice. She had no option to reunite with them. She hopes to build a new life, but she doesn’t want to do it in Iraq, where she still fears. What she describes is only 15%-20% of all she endured. She needs a lot more time.'

Man arrested after spreading rumors of hostages freed on TikTok	The 33-year-old suspect posted video claiming that 30 families of hostages were informed their loved ones were rescued from Hamas captivity; suspect is accused of disturbing the peace by knowingly spreading false rumors meant to incite fear and panic The Israel Police arrested a 33-year-old man for spreading false rumors of hostage rescue from Hamas captivity in Gaza. During his interrogation, the suspect apologized multiple times, claiming he heard the news from friends and was unaware it was false. He is accused of disturbing the peace by knowingly spreading false rumors meant to incite fear and panic. 'We will not tolerate actions that harm the feelings of hostage families,' a source in the police said. The suspect was placed on house arrest for five days. Rumers of a rescue of hostages spread quickly around the country, causing false hopes and distress to the families of the captives. The IDF spokesperson made three public statements saying there was no rescue and asking the pubic not to spread unreliable news. Meanwhile, TikTok blocked the suspect's accounts. 'Spreading misinformation is prohibited on our platform,' the company said after it had faced criticism throughout the war for amplifying pro-Palestinian content while suppressing pro-Israeli material. The suspect's account called 'The Shadow 7000,' has more than 52,000 followers. On Saturday he posted a video to his followers, claiming that 30 families had been informed that their loved ones had been rescued from Hamas captivity—some alive, some dead. 'There was a very emotional rescue operation that lasted nearly three hours,' he said in the video, making him one of the main sources of the false rumors that the IDF had to publicly deny three times within 24 hours. 'Unfortunately, there are both good and less good news. This was a significant operation, and it will be remembered in history. Please, for those of you waiting anxiously for updates, continue to be patient.' Ironically, in his posts, the suspect urged his followers to refrain from spreading false information, saying it harmed the families of the hostages: 'Please don’t spread fake news or rumors. Everyone keeps sending me guesses—stop it. There are families waiting for news about their loved ones. Please be considerate.' Later, the suspect posted another video, giving false details about hostages allegedly rescued alive, even naming them. One of the hostages he falsely claimed had been freed was lookout soldier Liri Albag, whose name was also spread in WhatsApp messages. 'At around 11 pm on Saturday, there was a surge of rumors about the rescue of hostages, Liri's mother Shira said. 'We got messages from people and heard reports of something happening in Jabaliya and Rafah. There were rumors about helicopters at hospitals. We didn’t sleep all night. Things calmed down in the morning, but by noon, another wave of rumors started. People were sending us texts asking us what was going on,' she said. 'It causes unbearable anxiety, making you wait for a knock on the door. Many times when rumors spread, there was some truth to them. We called the IDF officers we are in contact with, who said they didn’t know anything, but we didn’t know if we should believe them. There were so many specific rumors at the same time. We all took calming pills just to try to breathe. We posted on Liri’s Instagram, asking people to stop doing this. 'The names were specific, but then again, they were of families already prominent in the media. We wondered if maybe it was an Iranian bot spreading these rumors as psychological warfare. We thought, 'With so much talk, something must have happened. Maybe there was a terrible event with soldiers killed?' It’s just awful.' Gal Hirsch, Israel's coordinator for POWs and MIAs, has requested that police and the Shin Bet open a criminal investigation into the source of the rumors.

France says Israeli companies welcome at Euronaval if not involve...	After deciding to ban Israeli companies from the world's largest naval weapons exhibition, organizers seemingly amend ban but in practice leave Israelis out Following the decision to ban Israeli companies from exhibiting at Euronaval, the world's largest naval weapons exhibition set to take place in Paris, the organizing body announced the companies would be allowed to participate — on the condition that they were not involved in the IDF's efforts in Gaza and Lebanon. In practice, however, there isn't an Israeli company that wasn't part of the war effort, which makes the apparent amendment irrelevant. 'The exhibition organizers acknowledge the decision of the National Defense and Security Council dated October 1, 2024, as clarified by the decision of October 18, 2024, which stipulates that Israeli companies wishing to participate in the Euronaval exhibition may do so. They may have an exhibition stand, provided that their products are not used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon,' the organizers wrote in a statement on the event’s website. The annual exhibition features hundreds of international companies that develop naval vessels and weapons and has always included numerous representatives of Israel's defense industries. Israel Shipyards is set to petition a French court in the coming days. The company was planning to showcase its Mini Shaldag vessel, a fast boat designed for patrol and interception suitable for shallow waters; the OPV45 ship, developed at the Haifa shipyard in recent years and the Reshef S80 ship, a similar model of which is set to join the Israeli Navy in the coming years. 'The boycott on Israel forces the country to rely on itself and develop a strategic, local and independent military industry,' said Israel Shipyards CEO Eitan Zucker. This marks the second time France has decided to ban Israeli companies from prestigious weapons exhibitions. In June, Israeli companies were barred from exhibiting at the Eurosatory 2024 event, with Israeli individuals being denied entry to the event. The French government appealed the decision in court following a public uproar, leading to it being overturned, though much of the damage had already been done. Twelve Israeli companies were interested in exhibiting at the naval fair, and local participation will almost certainly be blocked from the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, the crown jewel of such exhibitions should this negative trend continue. Although the event is scheduled for June, preparations start many months in advance. An Israeli source said that France has become a symbol of left-wing embargoes on Israel, noting that French companies had asked President Emmanuel Macron to ban Israeli companies for commercial reasons behind the scenes.

IDF to outsource maintenance of tanks, APCs amid increased load	Military for the first time in history will offer tenders to security industries aiming to restore and maintain armored vehicles damaged in the war The IDF, for the first time in its history, will outsource the repair and maintenance of its various armored vehicles including tanks and APCs to companies in the Israeli defense industry due to the urgent need seen in the year-long war against Hezbollah and Hamas. The repairs were previously carried out exclusively by the IDF’s Technology and Maintenance Corps. Ynet learned on Sunday that the Defense Ministry will issue the first tender on the matter in the coming months via its Department of Production and Procurement. Additionally, the department, in consultation with the IDF, will decide on whether to transfer part of the armored vehicle production, currently performed by the Technology and Maintenance Corps, to local industries. Armored combat vehicles have seen substantial wear due to the ongoing war and require maintenance and repairs to ensure continuous operational activity. The load on the IDF on this matter is extremely high. To manage routine tasks, the Technology and Maintenance Corps has even employed retirees — former professionals volunteering to assist the army. Moreover, the IDF will need to restore all its armored vehicles to full readiness once the war concludes. According to the Defense Ministry, this will require a years-long process given the vast number of vehicles and the need for a large quantity of spare parts. The IDF and the Defense Ministry have concluded that the scope of this task necessitates, for the first time, collaboration with external entities — Israeli industries that will take part in the mission. Another conclusion drawn from the war is the need to significantly expand the IDF’s fleet of armored vehicles. The relevant industries for the tender are heavy industries involved in metalwork, such as large-scale welding and machining. Among the candidates are companies like Israel Shipyards, Ahot Ashkelon Industries, Elta Systems, Nidec and others. It was also reported that the Defense Ministry has already held preliminary talks with these companies, which have shown a willingness to participate in the tender and invest in the necessary equipment to integrate into the military’s system. 'So far, we haven't had an industry for restoration and assembly,' A Defense Ministry source told Ynet. 'The increased procurement needs of the IDF and the necessity to restore existing equipment required us to think differently.' The war highlighted the critical need for Israel’s independence in all supply aspects for the IDF and strengthening local industries, partly due to difficulties in acquiring ammunition and equipment from abroad, as some countries don’t allow certain components to be exported to Israel. The Israeli munitions industry (including Israel Aerospace Industries, Israel Military Industries, Elbit Systems, etc.) has doubled and even tripled its production capacity, based on the IDF's promise to maintain a steady stream of orders even after the war, making the investment worthwhile.

Former Sodastream CEO offers Gazans $100K for living hostages	Daniel Birnbaum offers to reward Gazans for taking 'responsibility for their lives and guarantee a better future for them and their families' by October 24; He gave the names of the respondents to the IDF for authentication After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the residents of Gaza to return hostages to Israel in the wake of the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, and promised that Israel would allow those who do so to leave the Gaza Strip safely, the former CEO of Sodastream is also joining the effort to bring them home. In a video published on Saturday, Daniel Birnbaum offered a cash reward of $100,000 to whoever returns Israeli living hostages. 'This is a message for the good people in Gaza. I have an offer for you. My name is Daniel Birnbaum, and I was CEO and chairman of Sodastream International, a Nasdaq-traded company acquired by PepsiCo,' Birnbaum said in the video. 'This year was a terrible year. It's time to wrap things up. It's time to move on.' 'A few days ago, Benjamin Netanyahu promised free passage and immunity to anyone who delivers an Israeli hostage to Israel. I would like to add to that a financial reward. Anyone in Gaza who returns a living Israeli hostage , will receive $100,000. That would be paid either by cash or by Bitcoin, as you prefer,' he offered. 'Don't wait. This offer is valid until Wednesday midnight, October 24, just a few days. Reach out to this number by Telegram or Whatsapp in confidence and I will make the appropriate connections to assure your free passage and reward money so don't wait. It's time for you to take control of your life, to build a future for yourself, for your family, and for your community,' he added. Birnbaum told Ynet he is receiving a flood of calls, including calls from Gaza, but their reliability is still unclear. He is passing the calls to an IDF official who will verify their authenticity. In the video, he chose to speak in English because he thought that maybe an American would be believed more than an Israeli. Birnbaum is ready to pay the required amount from his pocket even if reliable information about dozens of hostages arrives. He said that the payment is his contribution to the release of the hostages. In his years as CEO of Sodastream, Birnbaum empowered and promoted Palestinian workers in the company as a long-term goal. He believed in cooperation and cared for their well-being in a way that was hardly seen elsewhere. On several occasions, Birnbaum held communal Ramadan Iftar meals (meals for breaking the daily fasts) for Jewish and Muslim employees, promoting friendship and peace. Birnbaum said in response to the question of whether he still believes in coexistence, for which he worked with all his might, that he is holding on to twigs of hope and optimism to continue believing in coexistence. It is very difficult for him, he says, because the world proves otherwise, but according to him we don't have a choice. Right now, Birnbaum says there is a time to love and a time to hate and a time to fight and a time for peace and now, in the last year, it is the time for war. He said that In times of war, you have to fight and at some point, you have to change the track, but we don't change the track until we return the hostages. He knows Israel will not heal as a people and will not be able to move on unless the hostages return. Birnbaum, who served as CEO and chairman of the Sodastream company before it was sold to PepsiCo, is said to be an 'expert in aligning global trends and values ​​with business interests.' During his successful tenure, Sodastream went public and was sold to PepsiCo in 2018 for $3.2 billion. For the sale, he was promised a $34 million bonus in exchange for staying with the company for another three years. He later was accused of giving inside information to a company employee, and was sentenced to a month in prison as part of a plea deal. Finally, he spent 22 days in prison after being pardoned by President Isaac Herzog.

Nova survivor and rescued hostage return to the festival	A year after the Nova festival massacre, Yannai Eliyahu and his cousin Shlomi, who was rescued from Hamas captivity, achieve closure on Yannai's 24th birthday: 'It took me back but it was important to me' On October 6, 2023, right before the October 7 massacre, Shlomi Ziv, his wife's cousins Aviv Eliyahu and his younger brother Yannai went south to the Nova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Shlomi, who worked in security for the party, went to work together with Aviv, the security director for Nova. Aviv was murdered, Shlomi was kidnapped and Yannai survived. A year later the two men returned to the field of horrors. Yannai came to the festivalhang out with friends. All three relatives who grew up together were in daily contact and involved in each other's lives. The Hamas attack on the Western Negev that began on October 7 at 6:29 a.m. brutally separated the three. Aviv was killed by Hamas terrorists. Shlomi was kidnapped to Gaza and was rescued in August in Operation Arnon. Yannai managed to hide and escape from the carnage. Friday marked Yannai's 24th birthday and, for the first time since the October 7 massacre, the two surviving relatives managed to put the past behind them. Yannai asked Shlomi to join him at the party to celebrate with him. Despite the difficult scenery and the accompanying memories, this time they celebrated life and the fact that they returned safely home. 'On Thursday and Friday before the party, it was difficult for me,' Shlomi, 40, told Ynet. 'The whole situation took me back there. To travel to the south again, to return to the party again. But it was important to get closure. Both for me personally and for Yannai, to be truly happy with him, so he would enjoy himself, and also to commemorate Aviv with dance and joy. It was amazing.' Did you manage to dance and feel happy? 'Yes, very much. There were other freed people there and more survivors from that horrible Saturday. Maybe they also wanted to achieve closure. I kept looking at the clock. I wanted to pass 6:29 a.m. without sirens and without all the bad things that happened. The original producers of the Nova festival organized the party. They are doing amazing things as part of the commemoration efforts.' Miran, Shlomi's wife, added, 'Yannai is like our little brother. He is my favorite. He was in the third grade when we got married and I always told him that I would bring down the moon for him. He came to the Nova party last year on Friday night, a day after Shlomi and Aviv. Amid all the unfolding events, he hid and took care of the wounded. He tried to contact Aviv who told him to go to a trailer.' 'In retrospect, Yannai was already on the escape route so it's a good thing because the whole area was attacked and he might not have survived. At some point, Aviv stopped answering him and he passed out. He realized that something very bad had happened. He jumped into a car together with friends and they drove toward a base. When they shot at them, they changed direction and managed to reach Netivot,' she added. How did you feel when they went to the party, again? 'I was worried, it set me back. But I took a breath and calmed down. I said to myself, let them go, have fun, let them get it out of their system. I trust Shlomi completely. I understood him and supported him. The photo of Shlomi and Yannai is one of our great victory photos. They passed 6:29 a.m. and saw the sunrise that they couldn't see a year ago,' Miran said.

Trump: 'Bibi wouldn't listen to Biden', Harris doesn't deny Gaza ...	U.S. presidential candidates make outlandish and appeasing statements two week prior to elections in final bid to grow voter base Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. president Donald Trump said during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania overnight between Saturday and Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him he 'wouldn’t listen' to U.S. President Joe Biden in a phone call that took place close to the event. 'Bibi called me today and he said, it's pretty incredible, but he wouldn't listen to Biden because if he did, they wouldn't be in this position,' Trump said, using the prime minister's nickname. Talking about U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, Trump said at the rally: 'She’s worse than him [Biden], she’s not as smart as him. And I’m not saying he’s the smartest — but she’s not as smart as him.' Meanwhile, Harris was filmed agreeing with a pro-Palestinian protester who accused Israel of committing 'genocide' in Gaza during an event with students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. This marked the first time Harris referred to the situation in Gaza by using the term. During the event, which took place last Thursday, Harris said, 'I am so invested in all of you, in every way' – at which point the pro-Palestinian student interrupted, asking, 'And in genocide, right? Billions of dollars in genocide. Billions of dollars in genocide.' ' I respect your right to speak. I’m speaking right now. I know what you’re speaking of. I want the cease-fire,' Harris said in response. The keffiyeh-wearing protester proceeded to shout: 'But what about the genocide?' and added as he was escorted out, '19,000 children are dead, and you won’t call it a genocide. Israel is committing genocide.' 'What he’s talking about, it’s real,' Harris told the audience after the man was escorted out. 'That’s not the subject that I came to discuss today but it’s real, and I respect his voice.' 'The statements made don’t reflect the position of the Biden-Harris administration or the vice president’s stance,' Harris’ representative later told Ynet. Her campaign sources added that Harris didn’t agree with the protester, and 'when security escorted him out, she made a general statement about the need to end the war, and expressed empathy for the genuine feelings that the issue evokes in many people after he left.' 'However, she didn’t agree with defining the war as a genocide, and she has not expressed such a stance in the past, as this is not her position,' the statement added. The statements of both Harris and Trump come a little over two weeks before the U.S. election on November 5, against the backdrop of the Biden administration's threats of a weapons embargo on Israel if it continues to block the transfer of American humanitarian aid to Gaza. Harris faced a setback last week after the American-Arab political lobby AAPAC announced it wouldn’t endorse any presidential candidate for the first time since its establishment in 1998, citing that 'both candidates blindly support Israel.'

Still functioning like an army': IDF turns Hezbollah's strength ...	The IDF Military Intelligence Directorate begins implementing new tool gathering real-time intelligence on organized Hezbollah cells in Lebanon, leading to fast and safe eliminations The IDF’s fighting in southern Lebanon highlights one of Hezbollah’s new key strengths, which it developed alongside the Russian military during the war in Syria over the last decade and a half. The IDF is now starting to exploit this strength, turning it into a vulnerability for the Shiite terror army. As daily clashes with IDF soldiers increase, the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate has observed just how disciplined Hezbollah is, maintaining a strict military hierarchy even in areas where only small terror cells remain. Two and a half weeks into the ground operation, the military identified two main trends in the daily combat patterns of the IDF divisions operating along the border to combat the terror group. Hezbollah hasn’t launched significant company or platoon-level attacks against Israeli forces. Instead, it operates with small cells remaining in the frontline villages where the IDF is present, alongside anti-tank, rocket and mortar fire. Hundreds of Hezbollah operatives near the border are doing so under a structured operational pattern. They haven’t yet resorted to independent guerrilla warfare, as Hamas did in Gaza when the ground maneuver against it was bolstered. This means Hezbollah has, in some ways, given up on its frontline villages as launch points for a possible invasion of Israel. It keeps most of its tactical manpower – tens of thousands of armed operatives – in areas safe from a ground invasion in southern and central Lebanon, following the heavy blows delivered by the IDF during the opening strikes of Operation Northern Arrows. By doing so, Hezbollah is acting similarly to Hamas by conserving forces and capabilities for a protracted war, with a limited scale and varying pace. Former IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi described the evolution of Hamas and Hezbollah from terrorist organizations to 'terror armies,' with battalions, brigades, special units, operational headquarters and force-building. Now, the signs of this evolution are clear: The IDF has observed that even small terror cells, composed of three to six armed operatives remaining in the border area, operate under a command hierarchy, even after most of the local company and battalion commanders have been eliminated. 'When they become completely disconnected, we'll see phenomena similar to the one in Gaza, where cells organize on their own and independently carry out attacks against IDF forces,' military sources said. 'It’s harder to operate against that, both from an intelligence and operational standpoint. For now, the fact they're still functioning like a military is beneficial for us.' Now, a new IDF operational intelligence tool is being used for the first time in Lebanon – FIU (Field Intelligence Units), which focuses on real-time, hourly intelligence tracking, targeting terror cells and organizations to support the forces on the ground. The intelligence officers and soldiers in these FIUs, most of them reservists, are stationed at a home front IDF Military Intelligence Directorate base but maintain an open line with battalion commanders, brigade commanders and their intelligence officers fighting on the Lebanese front. Each FIU unit, such as the one assigned to the Golani Brigade currently operating in Lebanon, has representatives from all areas of military intelligence: signals intelligence and eavesdropping, visual intelligence, human intelligence and other sources. They receive round-the-clock information from thousands of IDF sensors covering the village where the Golani Brigade is active. They rapidly process this information using advanced technologies and intelligence analysts, quickly generating alerts for the troops on the ground. According to the Military Intelligence Directorate, these real-time operational and intelligence mechanisms streaming from FIUs to the soldiers have led to the daily elimination of dozens of Hezbollah operatives, mainly airstrikes. 'We can now identify an ambush against an IDF force in southern Lebanon, which includes an anti-tank cell preparing to fire from 5 km away, followed by a barrage of rockets being set up 12 km away and possibly even an explosive they’ll try to detonate remotely,' military sources explained. 'The FIU teams immediately report this to the force on the ground, allowing the troops to prepare, protect themselves and counterattack the threat. These events have been happening daily in southern Lebanon over the past two weeks,' they added.

Sinwar's wife enters tunnel with luxury bag worth thousands of do...	IDF spokesperson in Arabic publishes online post showing Samar Abu Zamar with her husband, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, on the night before October 7 carrying $32,000 handbag IDF spokesperson in Arabic, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, published a post on his X account on Saturday targeting Samar Abu Zamar, the wife of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The tweet claimed she was seen alongside her husband a day before the October 7 massacre carrying a Birkin bag from Hermes worth thousands of dollars. 'Did Sinwar's wife enter the tunnel with him on October 6 carrying a bag estimated to cost around $32,000?! I'll leave the answer to you,' Adraee wrote in the caption of a picture showing Abu Zamar holding the bag inside the tunnel where she and her husband took refuge the night before the massacre, alongside an image of the luxury bag from the company's website. 'While the residents of Gaza lack enough money for tents or basic supplies, we see many examples of Yahya Sinwar and his wife's unique love for money,' he added. To purchase the bag named after actress Jane Birkin, one must contact Hermes, which sells the coveted bags, in order to join a long waiting list. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed on Saturday footage of Sinwar and his family entering a Gaza tunnel before the start of the October 7 attack. 'On the night before the massacre, Sinwar was focused on his own survival and that of his family. In the video, you can see him and his family slipping into an underground bunker beneath their home on October 6, just hours before the attack,' he said. 'For hours, Sinwar and his son are seen moving supplies – food, a flat-screen television, mattresses –keeping the operation secret to minimize exposure,' Hagari added. Abu Zamar was born in Gaza in 1980 and holds a master's degree in religious studies from the Islamic University in the city, where she also worked as a lecturer until her marriage. Sinwar's wife belongs to a well-known and respected tribe among the Palestinians. Her family, the Abu Zamar family, is a religious family known for supporting 'popular resistance' (the Palestinian term for terrorist organizations) and actions against Israel. The family's roots are deeply embedded in the struggle against Israel. According to estimates, all of her family members have been recruited to Hamas, some of them to the terror group’s elite Nukhba unit. Abu Zamar and Sinwar got married on November 21, 2011, less than a month after he was released from Israeli prison as part of the deal to free kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011. Samar was 31 at the time of their wedding, an age considered quite old for marriage among women in Gaza, where the average marriage age for women is 20. Sinwar was 49 at the time, but the 18-year age gap didn’t seem to bother his intended. She understood it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to marry a significant and influential man in Gaza. Sinwar himself mentioned in a previous interview that he wasn't really involved in choosing his wife. 'While I was in the Holy Land (Saudi Arabia) performing the Hajj, my four sisters managed to find me a bride,' he said.

Libyan ISIS supporter planned attack on Israeli embassy in Berlin	Libyan asylum seeker, 28, arrested at his home in Berlin following information from a foreign intelligence service; Israeli ambassador to Germany: 'Further proof that we are on the frontline of the political battlefield' The German newspaper 'Bild' reported Saturday night that a Libyan national was arrested on suspicion of planning an attack on the Israeli embassy in Berlin. Special police forces stormed the house where the suspect lives in the city of Bernau north of Berlin in the state of Brandenburg. Security sources told the newspaper that the suspect, a 28-year-old Libyan national who is identified as an ISIS supporter, allegedly wanted to attack Israel's main diplomatic mission in Germany. It is still unclear if he was armed, and if he had access to weapons or explosives. A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office said information about the planned attack was received from a foreign intelligence service. 'A suspect of membership in a foreign terrorist organization was arrested in Bernau. At the same time, witnesses were questioned in the city of St. Augustine near Bonn,' he said. Israel's ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, said following the young man's arrest: 'Muslim antisemitism has long been not only hateful rhetoric, but has led and encouraged terrorist activities around the world.

Israel cool to US renewed push for cease-fire after Sinwar's deat...	Biden and other US officials meet to discuss possible efforts to complete a hostage deal, taking advantage of the window of opportunity following the killing of Sinwar; Senior Israeli official: 'No substantial progress in talks until we finish with Iran' U.S. President Joe Biden held a meeting over the weekend on the issue of the Israeli hostages in Gaza and efforts to renew a deal following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The meeting was attended by U.S. officials including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, CIA Director William Burns, Biden's envoy to the Middle East Brett McGurk and others. McGurk spoke with the families of the hostages with U.S. citizenship following the meeting and informed them of the administration's strong determination to reach a 'breakthrough' and make progress in negotiations for a deal to free the hostages. The U.S. sees the elimination of Hamas’ leader as a golden opportunity to renew cease-fire talks and the Biden administration is committed to doing everything possible on this matter despite the political timetable of the November presidential elections. Both the U.S. and Israel are engaging in talks with mediators from Egypt and Qatar, trying to determine if negotiations with Hamas for a deal can continue at this time. Israel has expressed serious concerns about Hamas retaliating against the hostages for Sinwar’s death and has sent strong messages to the terror organization, warning them not to harm the captives. Despite the U.S.’s determination, however, it seems nothing significant will take place until Hamas is clear on its plans for Sinwar’s appointed successor. One option is that a committee of senior officials, rather than a single person, might take over, which could make negotiations for a deal easier. U.S. officials have said an agreement won't be reached if both sides remain firm on their conditions. However, a senior Israeli official claimed there won't be any significant progress or dramatic breakthrough in the hostage deal negotiations until the Israeli retaliation against Iran and its possible fallouts are through, as Sinwar's successors are unlikely to push for a deal before they’re sure a regional war won’t break out. Moving forward, actions could lead to a larger regional arrangement that would also consider the issue of the hostages. Mossad chief David Barnea is leading a proposal that calls for a cease-fire and a political resolution on the northern border to include the hostage issue as a term. Sinwar’s replacement does present an opportunity, as the mediators have openly said his elimination could provide a chance for positive change and facilitate a deal. However, an agreement won't happen until the situation between Israel and Iran is resolved.

US investigates leak of Pentagon documents on Israel’s plans to a...	Pentagon's classified documents were posted publicly online over the weekend and deal with Israel's preparations for an attack against Iran; 'The leak is very worrying,' an American official told CNN, which confirmed the documents are authentic The U.S. has opened an investigation into the leak of the Pentagon's classified documents that deal with Israel's preparations for an attack against Iran, three sources familiar with the details told CNN. One of them also confirmed to the network that the leaked documents are authentic. 'The leak is very worrying,' an American source told CNN. The documents were first published on Telegram, and at the end of the week they were posted online. According to the documents, dated October 15 and October 16, the Israeli Air Force recently conducted exercises and 'rehearsals' in preparation for an attack against Iran. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency (GNA) and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. One of the documents states that, according to the analysis of various images, the Air Force conducted exercises with with air-launched ballistic missiles (ALBM), including at least 16 'Golden Horizon' missiles and 40 'Rocks' or ISO2 missiles. The documents also discuss 'covert drone activity' and extensive deployment drills. It also reports on 'secret UAV activity,' and claims that the Air Force conducted a 'second large-scale deployment exercise' between October 15 and 16. The report also states that, during those days, activity related to air-to-surface missiles (ASM) was observed at the Ramat David and Ramon Air Force Bases. Another leaked document, which allegedly contains an analysis by the NGA, reports that the IDF 'probably' also conducted an aerial refueling exercise on October 16, and contained a side note stating Israel's apparent ability to use UAVs in order to gather intelligence in Iran and 'across the region.' A U.S. official said that the investigation will examine who had access to the documents. CNN noted that the procedures state that any such leak immediately leads to an investigation by the FBI, along with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies. This could be a deliberate leak from the Pentagon, perhaps with the aim of fending off criticism from the progressive camp in the Democratic Party of the Biden administration for having no influence on Israel, and to show the American public - and also Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - that the U.S. actually has good control over the details. The leak also lends credibility to the statement Biden made in Berlin, that he has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran.

Military and political moves coordinated as Hezbollah strongholds...	Another reserve brigade goes into action Sunday; Senior IDF official believes that within 'days to weeks' the mission in southern Lebanon will be completed, and notes several positive developments for Israel The IDF is working 'vigorously and quickly' with the aim of finishing the work in the area near the border in southern Lebanon, as well as the plan to attack Hezbollah's fire and command and control arrays 'within days to weeks.' No more. 'We strive for a situation where our planned military closing moves will be conducted in parallel with the progress of the diplomatic processes that will lead to a settlement,' a senior military official told Ynet. The political processes have already begun, and the official noted the following developments, all of which are positive from Israel's point of view: 1. Hezbollah and the Iranians want a cease-fire as soon as possible in order to preserve as much of their remaining capabilities as they can, and so that they can quickly reestablish themselves as a military-political force within Lebanon. 2. In the last few days, there was a rare public gathering of central political leaders and heads of sects in Lebanon: Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, who until recently was coordinating positions with Hezbollah; the leader of the Shiite Amal movement and the Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri; and the Sunni prime minister Sunni of Lebanon, Najib Mikati. Everyone called for a cease-fire and a political settlement without mentioning Hezbollah's demands and demands. 3. Mikati even came out publicly against Iran's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, which he would not have done when Hezbollah and Nasrallah were in their usual position of power. On Sunday, an additional reserve brigade is entering southern Lebanon to complete the clearing of the villages and fortified areas where Hezbollah's Radwan force prepared its logistical infrastructure and bases for infiltration into Israel. Every house in the village that had weapons in or under it will be destroyed, the senior military official said, and this will leave a great deal of destruction in the Shiite villages near the border.

IDF soldier succumbs to wounds sustained in southern Lebanon comb...	Sergeant Major (res.) Yishai Netanel Greenbaum critically wounded in battle on October 9; 'The world lost a precious soul today,' his widow Hadas says The IDF reported Saturday night that Sergeant Major (res.) Yishai Netanel Greenbaum, 38, a platoon sergeant in the 288 Brigade's 5030th Battalion, from Lod, has succumbed to wounds sustained in combat in southern Lebanon. Greenbaum was critically wounded on October 9. Earlier, the IDF reported that Staff Sergeant Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and Sergeant Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, both of the 401st Brigade's 52nd Armored Battalion, were killed in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the war, the IDF's death toll has reached 748, with 355 fatalities during the ground operations in Gaza. Greenbaum was also a social worker who specialized in treating trauma-affected soldiers, a role he continued during his reserve service as a combat soldier. In the battle where Greenbaum was wounded, fellow reservist Sergeant Major (res.) Ronny Ganizate was killed. Before the official IDF announcement, Greenbaum’s wife, Hadas, shared the news on social media, writing, 'With a broken and shattered heart, I must announce the passing of my beloved and heroic husband, Yishai Greenbaum. Yishai fell in defense of the homeland he so loved. The world lost a precious soul today. Thank you to the family and all who have supported us with your thoughts and prayers.' In a note reflecting on his reserve duty earlier this year, Greenbaum described balancing his dual roles as platoon sergeant and social worker during 150 days of service. 'Like many other reservists, I was called up on October 7 to serve in a battalion tasked with defensive missions in the north. The tension, the risks and the long days added another undefined role for me,' he wrote. Greenbaum recounted how he switched between military and social work duties, offering both operational leadership and emotional support. 'As a sergeant, I checked on wet gear during rainy nights. As a social worker, I ensured each soldier had a blanket and emphasized that every buddy checks on his friend. After mortar fire, as a sergeant, I led the troops to safety. As a social worker, I provided water and encouraging words to everyone.' He concluded his reflection by noting, 'The period ended, but the war continues. My reserve duty left me thinking about the place of both roles in my life. It seems the whole country needs more of the social worker’s role—strengthening our forces and healing from trauma.' 'An extraordinary individual' The Ramat Gan Hesder Yeshiva, where Greenbaum studied, mourned his death, describing him as having 'fallen a hero in battle in Lebanon.' In a statement, the yeshiva added, 'May we witness the vengeance for the blood of Your servants.' Yeshiva head Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira said, 'Yishai was a leader, both strong and gentle. He was a kind, compassionate person, an amazing father who spent quality time with his family, and a social worker who helped soldiers prepare for hardships. He was both gentle and steadfast, an extraordinary individual. We pray that his sacrifice for the nation will hasten redemption and that his soul will rest near the divine throne.' Lod Mayor Yair Revivo noted that Greenbaum worked in the city's welfare department, saying, 'Yishai loved this land, and his sole desire was to defeat the enemy so that we could live securely in Israel. We embrace his wife, Hadas, and their children, and we will provide any support they need. City staff have been supporting the family since his injury and even more so after his passing.' The Welfare Ministry expressed deep sorrow over Greenbaum's death, saying, 'Yishai was a dedicated social worker in the Lod municipality and a reservist who went to defend the residents of northern Israel and all the citizens of the country. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Hadas, his children, family, colleagues at the social services department, and all who loved him.'

Radwan forces fled and we’re in their houses, destroying them at...	In a vast underground command center, real-time footage tracks IDF operations in Lebanon; while communication systems relay multiple incidents along the border, personnel inside the bunker remain calm and composed A little caption appeared on one of the screens at 12:11 p.m. reading, 'Kiryat Yam, Kiryat Haim and Shmuel, Haifa – Bay.' This was followed by a string of further alerts in Kiryat Motzkin, Kiryat Bialik, Haifa – West, Haifa – Carmel, the Home Front Command sending automated messages online and onto apps. This is a great drama for those suddenly hearing the sirens wailing, quickly getting themselves to shelters and hearing explosion blasts, interceptions and crashes. But here, in the earth’s belly in the Northern Command pit, this is yet one more incident occurring in tandem with several dozen others. The wall facing dozens of people sitting deep within Mount Canaan is covered with a huge screen divided into dozens of squares, with something going on in each square. Remotely manned aircraft escorting the ground forces in Lebanese territory are broadcasting the live, up-to-date picture. Each force has its own aircraft escorting it in the sky, so you can simultaneously view several broadcasts from different battle sites. The digital map displays the forces’ locations and movements, and on the adjacent screen, a real-time update of the evacuation of wounded soldiers from inside Lebanon, bringing them for medical treatment in Israel. What’s going on on the home front, another piece of the puzzle - a piece for which the Home Command is responsible. A few hours later, at one of the crash sites in Kiryat Yam, you realize the huge discrepancy between the calm composure required in the bunker in Safed, a site protected from attack allowing people down there to carry on running the war, and the fear and anxiety that comes with hearing the sirens outside. There’s a little screen in the command pit broadcasting a Hebrew TV channel, the channel switching every few minutes. It’s on mute, and you just see the pictures from the crash site, interviews with dazed residents and the images of the damage and destruction. On another screen, an Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft follows a vehicle traveling on a dirt path somewhere in southern Lebanon, driving though orchards, turning left and carrying on straight. And the black and white picture, constantly homing in on it , momentarily making you forget about the drama that very moment in the Haifa Bay. Only when we see the little small shopping center on the corner of Jerusalem and Jabotinsky Boulevards, and with our own eyes, see the torn blinds, shattered windows and air-conditioning units torn off buildings, do we understand what happened here. A rocket that landed on the roof of Birkat Moshe bakery, has torn a hole through a layer of concrete and iron bars. Dozens of windows are shattered, and air-conditioning units torn off three buildings above the shopping center. The bakery owner, Eliran Assouline, says that he heard three consecutive sirens. 'Our safe room is at the back, inside the kitchen. We all got in. As soon as the sirens stopped, instead of waiting for ten minutes, I went out to check, and then I heard a huge explosion followed by a blast and I was hurled into the air.' Meir Ohayon, who owns the Beshem Ha’omanut tattoo parlor, a smiley guy with Rastafarian locks and a big tattoo of Salvador Dali on his arm, saw Assouline go flying. 'What’s that flying? I saw him hit by the biggest blast ever. He was like a meter into the air and two meters back. Like in the movies, he left the ground and went flying. I was just running to the shelter when the missile hit the roof and there was a massive explosion. Everything went black, the concrete went flying, bits of plaster were flying around. There was loads of smoke. It was crazy I tell you.' Haka's hill Not far from the pit, stands a battered old Willys jeep that served Maj. Gen, Yitzhak (Haka) Hofi, commander of the Northern Command in the Yom Kippur War. The base commander was then stationed in the fortress building in Nazareth (which now serves as the police’s northern HQ), too far away from the IDF’s battles staving off Syria’s surprise invasion of the Golan Heights. Back then, there weren’t any LED screens or planes remotely controlled from a hundred miles away from the front, broadcasting pictures of the war. Hofi had to jump into the jeep and find a position from which he could see the Golan Heights, and manage the front from there. Mt. Canaan above Safed was the perfect spot. Brig. Gen. (res.) Shuki Shahrur, 67, was only a 16-year-old boy at the time, but later enlisted and advanced in the army, serving as an operations officer, staff wing officer and the Northern Command’s chief of staff. In the past 20 years, he’s spent more time at the command base in Safed than at home. Following the 1973 war, it was decided to transfer the command headquarters from Nazareth to Mt. Canaan,' he says. 'I watched all the work setting up the command pit. They dug deep down into the mountain, and inserted kilometers of electric cables, air and water pipes. They started in 1979 and finished 11 years later. I had the honor of being the first to operate the pit as the command’s operations officer. Knowing this pit extremely well, I can say that it’s constantly undergoing the most advanced technological adjustments.' 'Down there, there’s a dining room, a gym, a clinic, a synagogue and barracks. These are huge spaces, interconnected by corridors and in the central areas, you can see the side of the mountain into which this the complex was dug. There are independent energy centers allowing for command continuity if, Heaven forbid, the whole business above ground is out of use.' None of this guarantees anything, certainly not winning the war. Impressive as this place might be, it’s a merely a technical matter allowing for ongoing management of this long war, with no end in sight. Almost all of the Hezbollah leadership has been assassinated. Radwan, Hezbollah's offensive force, has been severely hit, and the IDF is attacking from the air in Beirut and Bekaa, and on the ground in Lebanon. Four divisions have been assigned to the limited ground operation in southern Lebanon - a huge force of 11 brigades including six reservist brigades. And still, when we went down into the pit, sirens were sounding across the Galilee. Hezbollah is keeping up its missile and rocket firing capabilities, averaging 200 launches per day, enough to completely disrupt daily life. Fighter jets on standby We were asked to wait in a side room. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was just arriving for a visit. He sat down in front of a wall of screens, waited for his team to set up a camera who then filmed a video clip, later disseminated to all news outlets. 'Hezbollah is an organization with no head,' he said as those present watched the screens. 'Nasrallah has been assassinated, probably his successor too. A year into the war, and Hamas has been taken apart, Hezbollah a battered organization.' Two hours later, over 100 rockets were launched at Haifa and the bay area. But at the end of the day, when we put aside these boisterous statements, the technology and this impressive installation, we’re left with people. People keeping up a calm professional atmosphere, even with a firestorm raging outside. When one of the forces encounters a Hezbollah cell in a village in Lebanon, Lt. Col. Yuval Mazuz, the command’s operations officer, oversees managing the incident. We have two terrorists killed, and two of our forces wounded, requiring immediate evacuation. 'Immediate evacuation' means that the injury’s severity is moderate and up. A tank covers the evacuation while a remotely controlled aircraft covers all of this from the air. There’s also a combat helicopter not far, in case they need to launch a missile, and at the upper level there’s also a fighter jet ready to drop heavier munitions. Mazuz assumed the position in July 2023. Just before going down into the command pit in Safed, he passed the command baton for the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion onto his colleague, the late Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg. 'Passing over the role between two battalion commanders is a very intimate matter' he says. 'You sit down with your successor for hours on end, sharing commitments about personnel scheduling, dilemmas and your experiences commanding the battalion. We had plenty of meetings talking about the complexities around family life, about how you’re hardly home.' Then came October 7. The war caught the 13th Battalion in operations in the Gaza border region, where the Nahal Oz outpost is located. The battalion lost 41 officers and soldiers in Hamas’ surprise attack and the battles they fought reconquering the outposts and communities. The battalion wasn’t broken, and Greenberg prepared it for ground operations inside Gaza. Greenberg was killed in Shijaiyah just before 6 p.m. on December 12. Nine more officers and soldiers fell alongside Greenberg, including two company commanders from the brigade. At the time, Mazuz was in the command pit in the north in consultations with the general. 'I left my phone above, so I couldn’t be contacted. It then turned out that the brigade had been trying to get hold of me. They also called my wife to find me and she sent me loads of WhatsApp messages for me to get back to her,' he said. Mazuz was in Gaza by midnight of that day. His temporary appointment as company battalion carried into two and a half months, in which time he fought in Shijaiyah and the refugee camps in central Gaza. When appointed as permanent battalion commander after Greenberg was killed, he asked to focus on the fighting in Lebanon. 'This is what I’m dealing with right now' he says. 'Defeating our enemy.' Thirty seconds to get to a shelter As these lines are written, the north is still being bombarded. A little after one o’clock in the afternoon, sirens are again sounding in Haifa and the bay area. Shortly thereafter, the IDF spokesperson announced that two civilians were killed by a rocket in Kiryat Shmona. The command base has also been struck. Last February, a rocket hit the base, killing lookout Staff Sgt. Omer Benjo. There were almost daily sirens in Safed. The city itself is of no interest to Hezbollah. Their target is the command center. Improbable as it may sound, despite the city being targeted in the Second Lebanon War by Hezbollah’s efforts to hit the Northern Command base, Safed is not prepared for rocket fire, and most of the homes do not have safe rooms. 'If you’d have told me before that this is how much Hezbollah manages to fire, while the IDF is conducting ground operations in its territory, killing its men and severely damaging its infrastructure, commanders and arsenals, I’d have said you were on drugs.' Yitav Haddad, whose home is on the command fence on Netz Street, lives in a home with a wife, three children and no safe room. The neighborhood bomb shelter is over 30 seconds’ run away with three toddlers. 'We live over the pit,' he says, pointing at the home’s floor. 'No one thought to protect us. The Home Front Command toured the neighborhood and one of the officers said that we deserve three mobile shelters. That was over a month ago. As you see, this road hasn’t been given even one mobile shelter. I invite you to come stay with us and wait for the siren. Maybe a rocket or fragments from an interception will crash down, and then you’ll feel how our house shakes, nearly falling down from the force of the blasts.' Mazuz explains about proportion. 'I’m not playing down 200 rockets fired a day. This is clearly serious, and we can’t reconcile ourselves to it. But we must remember what the predictions were for a war with Hezbollah. Our estimates were for much more massive, broader and deeper fire. If you’d have told me before that this is how much Hezbollah manages to fire, while the IDF is conducting ground operations in its territory, killing its men and severely damaging its infrastructure, commanders and arsenals, I’d have said you were on drugs.' Maj. Gen (res.) Annan Abbas, control wing chief in the command pit, wants us to take some air for a moment. We met him after he’d finished managing an incident in which a Hezbollah drone hit a border outpost in the Margaliot sector, injuring four soldiers. 'Listen, carefully,' he says. 'I live the area. I was born and raised here and, as a local, I know how much the residents by the border area are afraid of Hezbollah’s capabilities. Whenever the army sends up flares suspecting an infiltration, the local people panic. Every incident on the fence makes the local people panic. The Radwan Force has put out propaganda videos, done stunts on motorbikes and threatened to conquer the Galilee. In practice, the very opposite has happened. Radwan forces fled, retreated from the confrontation line and we’re in their houses, destroying them at every altercation.' 'Commander, this is Dad' Abbas certainly is a character. The guy’s a Sphynx. He sits at the central post in the pit with special sports glasses protecting his left eye, injured during his service in the Druze Special Forces. Not a muscle in his face moved as the communication systems simultaneously relayed a series of different dramatic incidents in various sectors along the border fence. He's 51, from Peki'in. His wife, Layla, is the village high school’s prinicpal. Their eldest son, Gideon, was a squad commander in the elite Egoz Unit and was discharged following a severe training injury. He has since been serving as a reservist with his father in the command pit. His middle son Jamal served commanding the Paratroopers’ 101st Battalion’s 3rd company. He’s an impressive, good-looking guy. His father proudly shows me pictures on his phone. On the eve of the war, Jamal surprised his family, coming home for short leave. He went out with his friends to Tiberias on Friday night and stayed over to sleep at one of their homes. The following day, when Hamas took Israel by surprise on the Gaza border, Annan, the father, quickly donned his uniform and rushed to the command pit in the north. 'That’s my go-to response in an emergency,' he says. 'Putting on my uniform, and going down to my post in the command pit.' He didn’t get a chance to see his son come home, pack his bags and rush down south where he joined the battles fighting Hamas terrorists. Just before he set out, the young, 17-year-old daughter, Mirelle photographed him. Standing at the doorway, she caught him arranging his bag on his back. He’s already got his gun on him. The mother, with her back to the camera, is watching him get ready. Moments later he was in his car and off. Three weeks later, the evening before going into Gaza, on October 29, Jamal called his father. 'It was 1:30 a.m. I’d just come back from the command center,' the father says. 'Jamal sounded excited. He said they were about to go in, and that he’s sending a message to the soldiers’ parents telling them this is a just war, and that he’ll do everything to protect their children, his soldiers. He told me something that rings is my head to this day. 'Dad, this is an existential war for the country, and in existential wars people get killed, and maybe I won’t return from this war. And if I don’t come back, you must be proud of me.' I’m having this conversation at 1:30 a.m. after a long day in the pit. 'I answered. 'Forget your nonsense. Take care of yourself and of your soldiers. There are a lot of tunnels beneath your feet in Gaza. Don’t be reckless,' I said to him. 'Don’t be reckless' because I know him. He had no fear. My boy was a galloping horse, a spirited fighter. He calmly answered, 'Dad, I understand the situation. I have a D9 and I have tanks. I have dogs and I have the Air Force. We’ll do everything slowly. I’ve promised their parents to bring their children back healthy and in one piece.' The days passed, and reports of the bitter battles in the Gaza Strip at the start of the ground operations wracked the father’s nerves. He tried getting hold of Jamal on Vered Harim, the IDF’s encrypted phone, but he wasn’t answering. He tried contacting his son’s command post by walkie-talkie – to no avail. They made contact on November 15, Wednesday evening. 'I was just about to leave the pit for home with my son Gideon, and two guys suddenly call me. ‘Hang on, one minute, we’ve got a surprise for you. You’re now going to talk to Jamal on the walkie-talkie.’ He was in some hole in Gaza and we were in a bunker underneath Safed. The conversation was published a few days later, by which time the family was in mourning. Annan: 'Commander, this is Dad.' Jamal: 'Continue.' Annan: 'Dad and Gideon send you their love. You are the fighters’ spearhead. Take care of yourselves. Strike Hamas. Destroy them. Fight fiercely, and wisely. Respond faster than the enemy. Stay there inside as long as it takes, until victory. We miss you and love you very much. Come back in peace. We, the Northern Command and your family, support you. Look after yourselves. Come back in peace. We’ll see you.' Jamal: 'Thank you very much.' Annan: 'Thank you, thank you. Take care of yourself. We’ll be in touch.' Jamal: 'No problem, dear father.' Three days passed and, on Saturday, during a shift in the pit, the Northern Command chief Ori Gordin’s secretary came in and asked him to accompany her. 'I was in my spot,' he says, pointing at his post in the pit – the control officer’s position. 'She comes in and says to me, ‘The general wants you to go up to his office.' It’s one floor above us, here in the pit. She said he wanted to consult with me. ‘I don’t know what it’s about.’ When I went into his room, he immediately got up, came up to me and hugged me saying, ‘I’m sorry to tell you that Jamal was killed in clashes in Sheikh Ijlin in Gaza.’' We stood at his position in the pit in silence. What’s left to say in such a situation? The screen was displaying a big slide reading 'situation picture.' A tear drew out of his healthy eye. The screen to the side read '12:45 – Kiryat Bialik Industrial Zone.'

IDF releases footage of Sinwar slipping into tunnel before Octobe...	Clip shows Hamas leader and family transporting supplies into tunnel before attack on southern Israel; 'Hamas leaders prioritize their own survival over the lives of Gaza’s residents,' Hagari says The IDF on Saturday released video footage showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar the night before the October 7 massacre, carrying supplies to a hideout. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed new details about the pursuit of Sinwar, who was killed last Wednesday, including how close he was to Israeli hostages during the manhunt. 'This evening, we are sharing footage from the IDF and Shin Bet’s pursuit of Yahya Sinwar,' Hagari said. 'We tracked his actions in the hours leading up to the massacre to understand his escape route. On the night before the massacre, Sinwar was focused on his own survival and that of his family. In the video, you can see him and his family slipping into an underground bunker beneath their home on October 6, just hours before the attack. For hours, Sinwar and his son are seen moving supplies—food, a flat-screen television, mattresses—keeping the operation secret to minimize exposure.' Sinwar, Hagari said, had constructed an underground fortress in Khan Younis, where he hid and directed the attack. 'In February, IDF forces entered Khan Younis and located the path where he had been hiding. We found an underground complex with living quarters, showers, beds, safes and uniforms. Several times, our forces were just moments away from catching him.' The hideout was fully equipped, with televisions, food, sofas and communication devices. 'We knew he had been there because we found his DNA on a tissue he used,' Hagari said, adding that the hideout was just a few hundred yards from the tunnel where six hostages were executed in late August. 'Sinwar spent most of his time underground between Khan Younis and Rafah, only emerging to flee.' Hagari also provided details on Sinwar’s final moments. 'IDF and Shin Bet forces continued their operations above and below ground to capture Sinwar until he made a mistake. In the incident last Wednesday, forces engaged terrorists, who began fleeing to two nearby buildings. Sinwar escaped alone into one of them. Our forces fired at the building you see in the footage. This was the first time Sinwar, who had been hiding underground for a year, faced Israeli forces—and it was the moment he was killed.' The operation marked the conclusion of a relentless pursuit of Sinwar, whom Hagari described as the architect of the brutal October 7 massacre. 'Tonight’s revelations once again demonstrate that Hamas leaders, wherever they are, prioritize their own survival over the lives of Gaza’s residents. Sinwar was a wanted terrorist who hid while war raged around him.' When asked if Sinwar's death improved conditions for a potential hostage deal, Hagari said, 'Our mission is to create the conditions for the hostages’ return. There’s no doubt that Sinwar’s elimination aids that goal.' Regarding Israel's objectives in Gaza and humanitarian aid distribution, Hagari added, 'We operate under political directives, including facilitating the entry of 250 trucks into Gaza, and we will continue as instructed.'

Driver killed by Hezbollah rocket near Acre identified as Alexei ...	Victim, 50, reportedly pulled his car to the side of the road and was critically injured by shrapnel to his upper body; his passenger, who ducked and shielded his head, sustained only minor injuries The driver killed on saturday by Hezbollah rocket shrapnel on Highway 22 near Acre has been identified as Alexei Popov, 50, from Kiryat Haim. Popov sustained injuries to his upper body, while a friend traveling with him in the car was lightly injured. Hours after the incident, police officers arrived at Popov’s home to notify his wife of his death. A family friend noted that Popov had no other relatives in Israel, and his two children live in Ukraine. Neighbors told Ynet that Popov had been returning from grocery shopping when he was killed. 'I heard screams and crying from their apartment upstairs and realized they had informed his wife of his death,' said Maria, a neighbor. 'They were a wonderful couple, always together. She had recently traveled to Ukraine to visit her new grandchild, and he missed her terribly, waiting for her to return.' Popov was pronounced dead at the scene. 'We arrived and saw a car on the side of the road, heavily damaged by shrapnel. The windows were shattered, and nearby stores were also damaged,' Magen David Adom paramedic Alex Motskin said. According to the paramedic, Popov's friend recounted that they had pulled over when the siren sounded, but the explosion occurred before Popov could exit the vehicle. 'The passenger ducked down and shielded his head. He emerged from the car fully conscious, with a minor shrapnel wound near his ear. Unfortunately, the driver was critically injured in the upper body, and we pronounced him dead shortly after.'

US wants to see Israel scale back some of Beirut strikes, Austin ...	The United States would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Saturday. 'The number of civilian casualties have been far too high,' he told reporters at a G7 defense gathering in the Italian city of Naples. 'We'd like to see Israel scale back on some of the strikes it's taking, especially in and around Beirut, and we'd like to see things transition to some sort of negotiation that will allow civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes.' Tens of thousands of people have fled Beirut's southern suburbs - once a densely populated zone that also housed Hezbollah offices and underground installations - since Israel began regularly targeting the zone approximately three weeks ago. On Saturday afternoon, Israel carried out heavy strikes on several locations in the city's southern suburbs, leaving thick plumes of smoke wafting over the city horizon throughout the evening. The strikes came as Hezbollah fired salvos of rockets at northern Israel, with one drone directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's holiday home, his spokesman said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy5wm0011eyl	2024-10-19T10:58:15-07:00

This will not stop me or Israel from continuing our fight for security,' PM says; property damage assessors evaluate damage at Netanyahu's residence following drone strike Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran-backed forces of attempting to assassinate him and his wife Sara after a drone launched from Lebanon targeted his private residence in Caesarea on Saturday. 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me and my wife today made a grave mistake,' Netanyahu said. He vowed that the incident would not deter Israel from its mission. 'This will not stop me or Israel from continuing our fight for security,' he said. 'I say to Iran and its partners in the axis of evil: anyone who harms Israeli citizens will pay a heavy price. We will continue to eliminate your terrorists, bring our captives home from Gaza, and secure the north. We will achieve our war objectives and change the security reality for generations. Together we fight, and with God's help, together we will win.' A preliminary investigation revealed that the helicopter that detected the drone failed to identify it, leading to sirens being activated only in military areas and not in Caesarea. The drone, which was recorded on social media, struck a building near Netanyahu's home. Following the strike, security forces, bomb squads and emergency teams rushed to the scene, including property damage assessors from the Israel Tax Authority. Hezbollah launched three drones toward Netanyahu's residence, with two intercepted. The third was not detected until it hit the building, without triggering alarms. Netanyahu and his family were not at the residence at the time, and according to his office, the prime minister had not been there for the past week. However, neighbors reported seeing a convoy leaving the compound earlier in the day.

IDF names 2 soldiers killed in battle in northern Gaza	SST. Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and SGT. Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, both of the 401st Brigade's 52nd Armored Battalion, fell fighting in Jabaliya; IDF death toll in war reaches 747 The IDF reported on Saturday evening that Staff Sergeant Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and Sergeant Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, both of the 401st Brigade's 52nd Armored Battalion, were killed in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. Another 52nd Battalion officer was seriously wounded in the same incident. Additionally, another officer from the 53rd Battalion of the 188th Brigade was seriously wounded earlier Saturday by a drone strike in northern Israel. Since the beginning of the war, the IDF's death toll has reached 747, with 355 fatalities during the ground operations in Gaza. The IDF's ground campaign in Jabaliya is ongoing, as part of efforts to prevent Hamas from regrouping. IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee shared footage of Gazan civilians evacuating the Jabaliya area, attributing the exodus to the 'breaking of the fear barrier of Yahya Sinwar,' the elusive Hamas leader eliminated by Israeli forces on Thursday. He said that 'hundreds of civilians have begun to evacuate, with the IDF ensuring their safe passage through designated routes.' Adraee also reported the capture of several terrorists in the area, some of whom were found with weapons magazines, while one carried a letter expressing his desire to die as a martyr. Reuters reported on Saturday that Israel has 'tightened the siege' around hospitals in Jabaliya. Local residents and medical sources claimed that Israeli forces were 'bombarding homes and blocking the entry of medical and food supplies.' Earlier, the IDF announced that Givati Brigade combat teams had joined the 162nd Division in operations in the Jabaliya area. According to the IDF, division forces eliminated several terrorists in close-quarters combat, with the support of air force strikes. In central Gaza, the 252nd Division directed airstrikes that destroyed military sites used by Hamas for sniper attacks and the placement of explosives. In Rafah, Nahal Brigade combat teams, under Gaza Division command, eliminated two terrorist cells threatening Israeli forces. Additionally, IDF units from the Bislach Brigade combat team engaged and killed armed terrorists during an exchange of fire.

Hezbollah leadership filled with unknown figures, report says	Israeli official tells New York Times terror group promoted lower-ranking operatives to lead new command center coordinating rocket and drone attacks; IDF resumes strikes in Beirut’s Dahieh, destroys Radwan force underground base Hezbollah has replenished its ranks of commanders and key leadership positions with operatives whose names were previously unknown to Israel, an Israeli official told The New York Times on Saturday. In an in-depth report, the official explained that these individuals were once lower-level commanders, which has allowed Hezbollah to continue fighting Israel despite heavy losses. The Lebanese terrorist group, which has faced a series of major blows since September, scored notable successes this week, including a deadly drone strike on a Golani Brigade training base, the launch of a drone toward the residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea and the killing of five Golani soldiers in southern Lebanon. The group also carried out rocket barrages on the Haifa area, resulting in one civilian death. Another incident involved an attempt to abduct an IDF commando, highlighting Hezbollah’s gradual recovery on the battlefield. While these actions fall short of Israel's pre-war expectations, they signal a troubling shift after Hezbollah's diminished capabilities in recent months. According to a Reuters report last week, Hezbollah is preparing for a protracted war of attrition in southern Lebanon. The group's military leadership has been nearly wiped out, but a new command structure has taken over, directing rocket fire and combat operations. Sources within Hezbollah also told Reuters that the group still possesses a significant stockpile of weapons, including precision-guided missiles that have yet to be deployed. Western diplomats have expressed concern that Israel’s limited operation in Lebanon may escalate into a prolonged war, urging Israel to leverage its successes to secure a deal that distances Hezbollah from the border. Following the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's Dahieh district, Hezbollah established a new operations center within 72 hours, enabling terrorists in southern Lebanon to continue rocket launches and combat under direct orders. A Hezbollah field commander said the group’s fighters are acting 'according to front-line capabilities,' with the new leadership operating in complete secrecy. The commander described the current command structure as a 'small circle' with direct contact with the battlefield. In response to Hezbollah's actions, the IDF resumed airstrikes on Beirut’s Dahieh district on Saturday, marking the first strikes since Wednesday, after a six-day halt reportedly at the request of U.S. President Joe Biden. The attacks followed evacuation warnings issued to certain buildings, with extensive damage reported. The IDF also targeted the previously untouched town of Jounieh, north of Beirut, where a strike on a vehicle killed two people, one of whom was identified by Arab media as a 'military commander in Hezbollah intelligence.' Since the Israeli ground operation in southern Lebanon began, IDF forces have cleared several villages, engaging Hezbollah terrorists in close combat. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi estimates that approximately 1,500 Hezbollah fighters have been killed so far, describing the figure as a 'conservative estimate.' The IDF also announced on Saturday that it destroyed a central underground command post of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force using over 100 tons of explosives. The operation involved 8th Brigade forces and the Combat Engineering Corps' elite Yahalom Unit. The facility contained weapons storage, living quarters and other resources for prolonged occupation. 'We stand on the ruins of a Hezbollah tunnel that was intended for an attack on Galilee communities,' Galilee Division Commander Brig. Gen. Shai Klaper said after the operation.' 'The 8th Division, 91st Division and the Yahalom Unit did outstanding work here, leaving no trace of the tunnel. This area is completely devastated. In the nearby village, which has been transformed into a military stronghold, it is now uninhabitable. Wherever Hezbollah attempts this, we will destroy them to the end.' Thousands of rockets and more than 1,000 drones According to Ynet military correspondent Ron Ben-Yishai, Hezbollah still retains a significant arsenal of thousands of short- and medium-range rockets and missiles, including precision-guided ones, posing a persistent threat to Israel. However, the group may feel it is nearing the limit of what it can achieve through these means. In contrast, the potential of explosive-laden drones—essentially small cruise missiles—remains largely untapped. While Hezbollah has spoken about deploying 'drone swarms,' it has yet to launch more than five drones simultaneously against a single target. We can expect Hezbollah to ramp up its use of explosive drones, as they are harder to detect and intercept when flying low over the terrain, and they offer greater precision. Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea is a relatively easy target for Hezbollah, given its known and publicized location. A drone flying low over the sea from Lebanon could potentially reach it without being detected, and even if spotted, it would be difficult to intercept. In Saturday morning's attack, Hezbollah’s drone operators were accurate in their planning, but fortunately, the drones did not hit or come close to Netanyahu’s family, who were not at their Caesarea home at the time. This wasn't a matter of luck but rather a reflection of Hezbollah’s operators and intelligence failing to execute effectively. Given Hezbollah’s capacity to learn and adapt, we must be better prepared for the next attempt. This incident also highlighted a new phenomenon: sirens in certain areas without simultaneous alerts from the Home Front Command app. This is part of a new policy aimed at addressing the increased use of drones by Hezbollah, as well as by Shia militias from Iraq and Syria. The policy involves issuing warnings in areas with potential military or civilian targets even if the drones pose no immediate danger but might follow a projected flight path toward these locations. This shift came after the deadly strike on the Golani base, where the drone evaded interception attempts by planes, helicopters and Iron Dome systems. The downside of this policy is the increased frequency of alerts, which forces residents in affected areas to seek shelter more often. On the bright side, there are promising developments in the pipeline for better detection, interception and the ability to strike drones at their launch sites.

Memory as his weapon: The inspiring story of Matan, blinded in Ga...	A year after losing his sight from critical injuries near Gaza, Matan Levy fulfilled his dream of becoming a lawyer; now interning at the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office, he says, 'I can’t fight on the battlefield, so I fight crime in the courtroom' This is the remarkable story of Matan Levy, an IDF soldier who lost his sight but refused to give up. Today, he is fulfilling his dream of serving his country as a legal intern at the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office. On the morning of October 7, Levy, from the town of Oranit in central Israel, received a call from his reserve unit, the 5th Brigade’s 8111st Battalion, instructing him to report immediately to the Gaza border. At the time, Levy was completing an internship at a private law firm, having recently finished his law degree. But in the Gaza border region, his life changed forever. 'We were tasked with clearing the area of terrorists,' he recalled. 'There were tough encounters and intense events. After a few days, we transitioned to providing security for the artillery and tank units preparing for the ground offensive.' On October 14, while stationed near Kibbutz Nirim, a mortar barrage launched from Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun hit his unit. 'I was critically wounded, and my friend, Israeli hero Omer Bitan, was killed by the mortar,' Levy recalled. For two weeks, Levy lay in the ICU at Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Shva, hovering between life and death. 'After two weeks in a coma, I woke up and quickly realized I was blind,' he said. 'But the pain was so intense that I didn't focus on the blindness. The pain was so severe that I can't even describe it—it terrified me.' Levy underwent extensive rehabilitation at Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, spending nine months in the hospital. As the pain subsided, he began to process the reality of his blindness. 'I had to relearn everything—how to walk, how to navigate a world I couldn't see. Simple daily tasks became monumental challenges. It's a difficulty someone who can see wouldn't understand.' Despite his ordeal, Levy was determined not to give up on his dream of becoming a lawyer. 'During my rehabilitation, I decided I would continue to fight for the country, and I wanted to do my legal internship at the State Attorney's Office.' The matter reached the state attorney himself, who requested the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office (Criminal Division) to consider his candidacy. Levy was invited for an interview, preparing for it while still in rehab. 'It was the first time I dealt with legal materials without being able to see them, thanks to my amazing brother, who continues to help me.' 'While others can read through the material multiple times, I rely on my memory. My assistants read the material to me once or twice, and I memorize it.' Levy’s family—his parents and brother—were devastated by his blindness, but his mother, who had immigrated to Israel from Argentina for Zionist reasons, was a pillar of strength. 'My family was crushed, but my mother, a true lioness, reminded us all that nothing is stronger than life itself. The fact that I survived is a miracle, and that message stuck with me,' he said. His persistence paid off. He was accepted into the office and joined a team dealing with serious crime under Attorney Assaf Shavit and his mentor, Attorney Simi Yafit Deri. Levy is the first blind legal intern at the State Attorney’s Office, which equipped him with special software and provided two National Service assistants to help him. Daphna Vaknish, the head of interns at the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office, emphasized that Levy was accepted based on merit. 'He is treated like any other intern, required to meet the same targets, and he does so successfully.' 'Judges are amazed when Matan argues on behalf of the state and demonstrates his full command of the material,' Attorney Deri praised Levy's work. 'For example, we appeared in 23 different hearings before the parole board, and Matan handled it all flawlessly from memory, overcoming the challenges of working without written documents. He inspires everyone at the office.' Levy's work requires deep familiarity with complex legal documents, which he manages by listening to them rather than reading. 'While others can read through the material multiple times, I rely on my memory. My assistants, Yair and Ben, read the material to me once or twice, and I memorize it. I write legal opinions, argue in court, and appear before parole boards, handling everything like any other prosecutor,' he says. 'Most of my cases are in district courts. I feel like I’m living my dream. I can’t fight on the battlefield in Gaza or the north, but I’m fighting serious crime for the country in the courtroom. No terrorist can diminish my motivation or take away my smile.' October 14 marked the anniversary of Levy's injury. 'For me, it’s not the day I was wounded—it’s the day I survived. As long as I’m alive, I live with my head held high. I’ve decided to live a full and meaningful life despite my blindness. During my recovery, I met my partner, who is now both my eyes and my heart. Life is a blessing, and every moment is a gift.'

Hezbollah leadership filled with unknown figures, report says	Hezbollah has replenished its ranks of commanders and key leadership positions with operatives whose names Israel 'didn’t even know,' an Israeli official told The New York Times on Saturday.

Fallen warrior? Gaza’s heroic portrayal of Sinwar's death	Though IDF reports Hamas leader hid, fled and killed by Israeli forces, Gazans portray him as a hero; in resurfaced video, Sinwar declares, 'I prefer to die as a martyr than die ‘just because' While Israel celebrated the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, with international headlines labeling him a 'rat in a hole,' many in Gaza are hailing him as a hero. Footage of his final moments, where he appears masked, wounded and covered in soot has reinforced the narrative in Gaza that he 'fought until the very end.' Hours after the official announcement of his death, a video of Sinwar circulated in Gaza. In the footage, filmed during a 2021 interview, Sinwar said, 'The greatest gift the occupation can give me is to murder me.' He added, 'I would rather die as a martyr than from COVID, a stroke or a car accident. At this age (then 59), I am closer to that promise. I prefer to die a martyr rather than die ‘just because.’' Footage revealed by IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari showed Sinwar in his final moments, sitting alone in a corner of a room, covered in soot. The drone footage that captured him showed Sinwar holding a stick, which he weakly attempted to throw at the drone in an unsuccessful effort to bring it down. He did not return fire and likely realized his death was imminent. Unlike the meticulously planned assassinations of figures like Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif or Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah over the war, Sinwar's death occurred by chance, following a prolonged search in the area. 'Sinwar was hiding in an area our forces had surrounded for a long time. We didn’t know he was there, but we continued to act decisively. Our forces found Sinwar with a vest, a pistol and 40,000 shekels in cash. He tried to flee, and our forces eliminated him,' the IDF said. Despite his death, Gazan media quickly spread AI-generated images and cartoons portraying Sinwar in a heroic light. One image shows him leaning on the same stick he had thrown at the drone, accompanied by the caption, 'Defending the entire world to eradicate Zionist terrorism.' Another image, showing him standing with a vest and firing a weapon that was not in his possession at the time, depicts the gunshot wound on his head as only a small cut. Another cartoon depicted the chair Sinwar sat on in a famous image taken after the 2014 Operation Guardian of the Walls. While Sinwar himself is absent from the cartoon, the gun he held in the original photo remains on the chair, symbolically waiting for his successor, reinforcing the notion that 'leaders change, but the idea remains.' Conversely, another cartoon highlighted Iran's loss following Sinwar’s death, depicting him as a puppet whose strings had been cut, signaling that Iran may no longer control Gaza as before. Additionally, a photo of Sinwar from his release during the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange was recirculated. Gazan photographer Khaled al-Safi, who captured the image at the Rafah crossing, wrote, 'That was his reunion with freedom, and today was his reunion with martyrdom. You were blessed with life and became a sacred martyr.' Meanwhile, Hamas senior official Mahmoud Mardawi, perhaps in an effort to maintain the narrative of Sinwar as a 'heroic leader,' said that selecting a successor 'will not take long, it’s a natural process.' He also emphasized that 'our conditions for cease-fire negotiations will not change after Sinwar’s death,' further suggesting that 'the idea remains.'

Turkey says Israel pushing Iran to take 'Legitimate Steps'	Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan speeking in Istanbul during a visit of his Iranian counterpart says Israel is opening new fronts and drawing Iran into the war Israel's attacks in Lebanon and Gaza are pushing Iran to take 'legitimate steps', Turkey's foreign minister said Saturday in a joint press conference in Istanbul with his Iranian counterpart. 'Israel's aggressive stance is forcing Iran to take legitimate steps,' Turkey's Hakan Fidan said alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was 'constantly opening new fronts in the region' and 'trying to draw Iran into this war,' he said. 'The risk of war spreading to the entire region should not be underestimated.' Iran backs the Hamas terror group in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, whose top leaders have been killed by Israel in the widening Middle East crisis. Iran also backs Houthi rebels in Yemen and Shiite militias in Iraq, as well as Syria's armed forces. Tehran collectively calls these proxies and militias an 'axis of resistance' against Israel. On October 1, Iran launched a barrage of around 200 missiles in retaliation for the September 27 killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and the July 31 killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel, which has vowed to strike back at Iran for that barrage, on Wednesday in Gaza killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7 massacre that triggered the current war and escalating regional crisis. Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) have warned they would hit Israel 'painfully' if it attacks Iranian targets. Iran hosted naval drills on Saturday, with the participation of Russia and Oman and observed by nine other countries began in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, Iran's state TV said. The exercises, dubbed 'IMEX 2024', are aimed at boosting 'collective security in the region, expand multilateral cooperation, and display the goodwill and capabilities to safeguard peace, friendship and maritime security', the English-language Press TV said. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, said anyone with information on Israel's pending strike on Iran is accountable. 'Anybody with knowledge or understanding of 'how and when Israel was going to attack Iran', and/or providing the means and backing for such folly, should logically be held accountable for any possible causality,' he said in a post on X referring to the U.S. after President Joe Biden said he has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran. He declined to elaborate.

Some Lebanese Americans endorse Harris, expect more Lebanon suppo...	In a letter, the signatories write they were reassured that their concerns about the violence in Lebanon and the need for economic and political reforms would be supported if Harris won the elections; Trump avoids any specifics about plans for the Middle East Some prominent Lebanese Americans on Friday endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for president, saying in a letter that the U.S. had been 'unrelenting' in its support for Lebanon under the Biden administration and they expect additional backing if Harris wins in November. Signatories include former members of Congress Donna Shalala and Toby Moffett, former President Barack Obama's onetime transportation secretary Ray LaHood, academics, CEOs and investors. The endorsement came amid ongoing Israeli attacks on Lebanon. According to the Lebanese health ministry, more than 1.2 million people have been displaced. The Hezbollah terror group has also fired on Israel killing soldiers and civilians. On Saturday, over 150 rockets targeted Israel, killing at least one man and wounding others. A number of Arab Americans and Muslims are abandoning the Democratic Party over the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war with Hamas. Some Arab Americans and Muslims have declined to endorse Harris, while others are backing her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, or third-party candidate Jill Stein of the Green Party. The letter was organized by Ed Gabriel, president of the American Task Force on Lebanon, a Washington policy group, in his personal capacity. Gabriel is one of several Arab American and Muslim leaders who met with Harris when she visited Flint, Michigan, on Oct. 4. The signers wrote they had been reassured that their concerns about the violence in Lebanon and the need for economic and political reforms would be supported if Harris won the Nov. 5 election. Her views stood in 'stark' contrast to Trump, they wrote, without elaboration. 'This year has been very difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon.' Harris said on a visit to Michigan, home to the largest Arab American community in the United States. She said the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar 'can and must be a turning point.' 'Everyone must seize this opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, bring the hostages home and end the suffering once and for all,' she said. Trump's campaign had no immediate comment, but a source close to the campaign said it planned more outreach events in Michigan next week. Trump also stopped by a campaign headquarters in Hamtramck, a suburb of Detroit, on Friday. Trump, meanwhile, avoided any specifics about his plans for the Middle East, but he said he didn’t think the Arab American community would vote for Harris 'because she doesn’t know what she’s doing.'

Netanyahu says he is undeterred after drone targets his home	The prime minister and his wife were not at home during the drone attack on their private residence, the PMO says; Netanyahu says nothing will deter him and the war is to continue until victory Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday posted a clip filmed in Jerusalem saying nothing will deter him, just hours after a drone attack targeted his private residence in Caesarea. The Prime Minister's Office confirmed that the drone attack launched in Lebanon targeted his private residence in Caesarea adding that the family was not at home during the attack. The drone landed on another resident but caused no injuries. No sirens were activated, causing residents of the affluent community to voice their anger. 'There was a buzzing sound before the drone hit,' one resident said. 'It was unclear where it came from but then the explosion occurred.' 'I live nearby,' another man said. 'the explosion was louder than we were used to. At first we thought this may be an Iranian attack and could not understand why no sirens were activated. Can we feel safe? Once again a drone manages to evade low flying choppers and intercepts and this time it hit a house here.' 'The day before yesterday, we eliminated arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar. I said we were in our war of revival,' Netanyahu said. 'We are carrying on to the end. I am proud of our soldiers, our commanders and the citizens and nothing will deter me,' he said. Netanyahu's neighbors in Caesarea said they observed a convoy leaving the community in the early morning, before the drone strike but according to his office, he has not been in the home for over a week.

IDF soldier investigated for war crimes in Belgium	Probe launched after Palestinian journalists' investigative report into elite IDF unit, claiming civilians were executed; Belgian Justice minister says Israel has the right to self-defense but that does not excuse it from following international law Belgium prosecution was investigating a man with dual Israeli-Belgium citizenship who fought in Gaza, for war crimes. Israeli officials said an investigation was launched after Palestinian groups lodged a criminal complaint, but no proceedings have been put into place. According to Belgium's prosecution, the investigation centers around a 22-year-old citizen of the country who served as a sharpshooter in an elite unit of the IDF. It followed an investigative report by Palestinian journalist Younis Tirawi who accused the unit of 'the brutal execution of unarmed civilians.' Tirawi said he received his information from an American who also serves in the unit and who provided evidence that civilians were being targeted although they posed no danger. The unit which was operating in Gaza since October, is made up of 21 soldiers, among them three American nationals, two Frenchmen, a German, an Italian and a citizen of Belgium who is now being investigated. Belgium's Justice Minister Paul Van Tigchelt said on Friday that the investigation hoped to uncover whether the report was true. 'Israel has a right for self-defense but that does not excuse its duty to respect international humanitarian law,' he said.

Sirens warn of drone strike in central Israel, drone crashes in C...	A drone launched in Lebanon hits a building in the affluent community where prime minister's private residence is located; rockets fall into the Sea of Galilee Haifa, its surrounding areas and central Israel came under attack on Saturday after an explosion was heard in the affluent community of Caesarea, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence is located when an attack drone crashed into a building. No injuries were reported, and security and emergency teams were dispatched to ensure there was no danger from shrapnel or explosives. Drone infiltrations and rocket attacks began in the early morning hours targeting Tiberias and surrounding areas. Rockets were seen falling in to the Sea of Galilee, causing no injuries. The incident came shortly after sirens were activated in the Haifa Bay area, warning of an infiltration of hostile drones. Earlier still, sirens in the Emek Hefer region nearby warned of a hostile aircraft which the military then said was the result of a false alarm. In Tel Aviv and areas to the north of the city, sirens were also heard, warning of a drone strike although no explosions were heard there. 'During the past hour, three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory,' the IDF said in a statement. 'One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea. No injuries were reported. During the incident, sirens were activated in the Glilot military base. The presence of additional hostile aircraft in the area has been ruled out.' The military also said a projectile crossed the border from Lebanon and fell in an open area in the Haifa Bay region. There too, no injuries were reported.

IDF chief says 1,500 Hezbollah operatives eliminated, others surr...	Herzi Halevi says even Iran may not fully grasp what’s happening to Hezbollah, and the IDF continues to deliver significant blows and wipe out local leadership; Hezbollah fires over 75 projectiles from Lebanon into Israel and 6 UAVs intercepted by the IAF IDF Chief of Staff, Herzi Halevi said Friday that some 1,500 Hezbollah operatives were killed in the ongoing ground operation in Lebanon. Halevi held a situational assessment with top Northern Command commanders, and added, 'We are determined to strike Hezbollah as hard as possible.' We’ve taken out their entire senior command and are wiping out their local leadership.' 'Their entire chain of command is collapsing. Hezbollah is hiding casualties, including dead commanders. Our conservative estimate is that 1,500 operatives have been killed, likely more, given the scale of the strikes.' 'These are significant achievements,' he continued, 'Their willingness to surrender speaks volumes about their morale and self-confidence, as well as the combat capabilities you've demonstrated.' 'Even Iran may not fully grasp what’s happening to Hezbollah, its main proxy. Every day we’re delivering tough surprises, and you’ll continue bringing them—achieving victories while preventing the enemy from doing the same.' Meanwhile, on Friday over 75 projectiles fired by Hezbollah crossed from Lebanon into Israel. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported that the Israeli Air Force intercepted six UAVs throughout the day. The IAF has also struck dozens of launchers, Hezbollah infrastructure, command centers, and operatives in the area. IDF troops are conducting targeted raids in southern Lebanon, eliminating roughly 60 terrorists in air and ground operations. The troops dismantled rockets, anti-tank missile launchers, and large stockpiles of weapons, including explosives, mortars, and RPGs.

Israel’s elite rescue unit 669: 'We have no fear, ready to return...	The daring rescues under heavy fire, soldiers arriving at the helicopter with no pulse and surviving, and the nightmare moment when they lost friends in Gaza chopper crash; 6 elite Unit 669 soldiers, who juggle between reserve duty and working as doctors at Soroka Medical Center, explain why, even with some now grandparents, leaving the unit is unimaginable On the first night of the Gaza ground operation, the wounded young armored corps soldier that Sgt. Maj. (Res) Dr. Y. was treating, died in his arms. 'We were at a base in southern Israel,' says Y.' At 2am, we were called to treat armored corps guys who’d been hit by an anti-tank missile. His mother is the first thing I think about in such situations. Someone’s son is now lying wounded somewhere in Gaza, waiting for us to come get him out of there. If his mother knew what was happening, what wouldn’t she do to save him?' The helicopter landed in southern Gaza. 'We landed in the dark. The doors opened, and I saw the guys treating him running toward us. I couldn’t make out their faces. They were all covered in dust, but you know that whoever’s running toward you now is your best friend. Under different circumstances, you’d hug one another and drink coffee together. Now, they were shouting out the treatment they’ve given him. We took off back to Israel. We had three, men from this incident: One severely wounded, one in critical condition, and the other was relatively okay.' Dr. Y. says that choosing who to treat is simply a game of roulette. There’s nothing you can change. You’ve been given a wounded soldier. Now he’s yours. This was the situation on that flight. 'I could hardly see a thing' he says. 'It was dark and we were flying with no lights. I put my hands on his chest and face and couldn’t feel anything. I hooked him up to the machines and realized that he was in a very bad way.' 'I did everything I could to save him. I administered artificial respiration and gave him a blood transfusion. I only saw the severity of his injury as we turned on the helicopter lights on entering Israeli territory. I didn’t for a moment think he was dead. I also didn’t stop. We treated him until landing at Soroka. I’ve never been so happy to see the hospital lights.' The helicopter landed, and Y. rushed to the medical team with his wounded man. 'I ran with him into the trauma center, panting and shouting ‘low blood pressure, no vital signs’. My friends at the hospital weren’t moving. No one approached us. No one was helping me. With a sad look on their faces, they just took the ventilator from me.' 'I kept telling them what his condition was. And 30 people were just looking at me, realizing he’d already died. I hadn’t gotten it yet. Then it hit me. I asked ‘What? That’s it?’ And they nodded. The deputy hospital director patted me on the shoulder and the anesthesiologist gave me a kiss. I started crying. It was such a blow. I believed in what I was doing, in the treatment I was administering on the way. And he’s not with us anymore.' In his journal, Y. describes the terrible moment he parted from the young soldier he tried to save. 'I’m no longer his medical caregiver. I’m a citizen for whom he died. I lean in toward him, looking at his beautiful face, one hand tightly clasping his hand, the other on his shoulder. I begged his forgiveness. The mother was echoing in my head. God help us. If only she knew, she’d tear out her heart and switch it with his.' This is how the IDF’s most combat doctors sound. They’ve been in action for a year, saving lives on the battle field and in the safe and familiar hospital setting. They respond to any call to any injury or military altercation, land in the warzone, invariably under heavy fire, and evacuate the wounded to Israel. Just so that soldiers may come back to life, recover, and get back to themselves and to their families. Unit 669, or as it’s officially known, the 'Tactical Unit for Special Rescue' is a special IDF elite unit. Its role is to evacuate the dead and wounded from war and disaster zones. Unit combatants whose names cannot be published show up at evacuation zones in helicopters and on foot to evacuate those demanding medical treatment. Since the war began, the unit has conducted 800 rescue flights within the Gaza Strip, evacuating over 1,800 wounded to trauma centers across the country, providing them with urgent, lifesaving medical care on the way. In the current war, some are also operating on foot alongside infantry forces inside Gaza. For this article, we interviewed six Soroka doctors serving in 669: Maj. (Res) Dr. S (58); Sgt. Maj. (Res) Dr. Y. (35). Lt. Col. (Res) Dr, A (58); Maj. (Res) Prof. Y. (48), Maj. (Res) Prof. A. (52) and Maj. (Res) Dr. L. (50). They’re all married with children. Some have grandchildren. This is an extraordinary, elite team of people who, for the past year, have been dividing their time between routine work in the busy southern trauma center that treated the wounded on October 7, and has since treated hundreds of wounded soldiers, saving lives in Gaza, and risking their lives on every mission. They’re called to the danger epicenter at every hour, day or night, fight for the lives of the wounded, even if it seems hopeless. They hail from varied professional medical backgrounds. They’re surgeons, intensive care specialists, anesthesiologists and orthopedic doctors. Some are young, setting out on their medical careers. Others are senior doctors, including department heads in their 50s at top of their profession. Their age and hospital positions have long released them from reserve duty, but they adamantly refuse surrendering the right to save lives. 'We get to the field, with all our hearts in it, knowing we have to reach them as quickly as possible and bring them in for medical care' says. Prof. Y. 'The number of wounded can sometimes hinder you. Lots of evacuations are conducted under fire. There’s a lot of shelling and artillery fire, but you show up with a clear goal: finding the wounded as quickly as possible, and bringing them back alive into Israeli territory, to a hospital that will treat them. This makes the difference between life and death. Emotions come later.' 'Two weeks ago, they turned from doctors to patients. Operations of this small secret unit, the identity of whose members cannot be published, that’s usually conducted in the shadows, were recently exposed to the public. Due to poor terrain conditions, a Yasur helicopter on a routine mission evacuating a soldier shot in southern Gaza, crashed a few seconds before landing. Two combat soldiers Sgt. Maj. (Res) Daniel Alush and Sgt. Maj. (Res) Tom Ish-Shalom were killed in the incident, and eight more were injured, some severely, including the male and female pilots flying the helicopter, and two airborne doctors. Conditions of all injured have since greatly improved and they’re now out of danger. 'I got a call from the unit in the middle of night, telling me there was an extraordinary incident' says Lt. Col. Dr. A. 'Before leaving the hospital, I asked myself what should I be wearing now – Soroka scrubs or my army uniform? I went for the uniform, thinking that my friends, lying in beds as 'wounded,' would feel safer in the company of brothers in arms. The incident’s severity soon became clear. 'This wasn’t my first time in war finding myself treating people I know' says A. But the large number of wounded meant I needed to deal with it differently. I was not only helping treat them. I also had to brief the unit, whose people were extremely concerned.' 'My work demands I separate my mind from my heart. The work becomes technical. It was impossible in this case. These are people I’ve known for years: The pilots and the helicopter mechanic with whom I’ve flown so many times. They’re all very close friends. You could call them family. In recent months, I’ve spent more time with them than at home. We’ve been together in extremely dangerous situations. Together we’ve saved lots of soldiers’ lives.' How do you deal with such situation, the difficulty of treating the people closest to you? 'Our accrued experience demands we behave in a certain way. Otherwise, the treatment result won’t be as good. It sinks in later. We felt we had to represent our friends to their families and make them feel they’re in the safest possible place that we’d provide them with the best treatment possible. It’s very important for me to support people who aren’t from the medical profession – pilots, mechanics and their families, giving them the feeling that everyone’s with them, in the same boat.' All this as everyone in the unit know that, under different circumstances, on a different day, it could have been them there, lying in the trauma center bed 'We subconsciously know that this is an incident that could occur. The team involved in the incident had replaced me on my standby shift. Our tasks are completely identical. The chances of my lying there on the bed are exactly the same as theirs. If circumstances were different, they could be treating me.' Maj. Prof. A, also a senior hospital and unit doctor, chose to deal with the incident differently. 'I’ve developed the ability to block out things that interfere with my functioning' he says. 'The injured need me as a doctor, and I function as such. A few hours after the incident, the doctors in the WhatsApp group were talking about the incident, writing about how sad it was. I wrote, ‘Guys, we need to be strong. Our next wounded are waiting for us’.' 'Through the years, we take risks. As soon as a helicopter takes off, there are risks from both above and below. It’s no secret. I’m sure if before taking off in the helicopter, you were to tell those who fell in the course of duty, that it may crash that day, they’d stay on that helicopter.' And what about you? You’re part of the unit not just in medical terms, but also in the fighting. You’re exposed to its dangers. Does this kind of incident scare you? Dr. A. 'I’m going back to reserve duty today. The soldiers need me. I have to give them everything I can. I spoke to the pilot. We told him that we completely trust him and what they’re doing, and that we’re not afraid. We’re going out into the field again tomorrow.' Protocol for treating the wounded on the battlefield has changed during this war. Rather than trying to save them with daring and dangerous operations demanding time and space, the wounded are stabilized and evacuated to the hospital as quickly as possible. In more urgent or severe, imminently life-threatening cases, they’re taken to Soroka, a ten-minute flight from the Gaza Strip. Maj. Prof. A says: 'We do our best not to do anything we don’t have to. We stabilize the patient while we’re on the move and only do what we must to save him - giving him blood transfusions, opening veins. We less administer respiration and tracheal intubation (inserting a tube into the trachea windpipe). The helicopter is a substitute for the hospital. We’re guided by getting to the hospital as quickly as possible to provide the patient with the best care.' 'The most critical decisions are those taken in the first minute of treatment. Whatever’s decided in those moments can often determine whether the patient lives or dies. It’s an enormous responsibility. I think we do this extraordinarily well. You have seven or eight minutes before reaching the hospital to prepare everything you need. You can’t delay getting him into the trauma center even for a second after the helicopter has landed.' 'There are days we fly almost non-stop' says Prof. Y. 'We land in the field near the wounded man and get him to the hospital as fast as we can. The injuries from this war aren’t just from guns. There are lots of shrapnel and explosive devices too. The team also knows that, even after one of our patients dies, we have to carry on working. More wounded men are waiting for us in the field. We draw our strength from our success stories.' And, thankfully, there’s no shortage of these stories. 'In the war’s first week, we were called to rescue wounded men' says Prof. A. 'One of them, we were told, was in a stable condition. His condition, however, quickly deteriorated on the helicopter. We started giving him blood transfusions and administered artificial respiration. He had head injuries and had been hit on the arms and legs. We brought him to Soroka where we opened his chest to massage his heart muscles. He underwent a series of operations, and gradually regained consciousness. When I came back from the army, I carried on treating him. He spent a month with us and then onto rehabilitation. When I tell my team about this case, it really makes their day.' Maj. Dr. L. has recently joined the unit after serving as a combat pilot. In recent months, he’s been serving alongside the ground forces. 'I’m totally an infantry soldier' he says. 'All the unit’s doctors come from the core medical professions. They’re all experienced in treating the wounded in war conditions. Having experienced doctors with them, gives the forces on the ground a great sense of safety.' 'Treating the wounded in the field is very different from how we treat them in the helicopters' says L. 'I feel an enormous sense of duty and mission. You reach the wounded on the battlefield minutes, sometimes less, after the injury, armed up like the unit’s combat soldiers. You’re invariably getting shot at and you shoot back if you have to. My purpose as a doctor isn’t killing terrorists, but rather getting to the wounded at any cost, even when they’re firing at my head.' Haven’t you asked yourself what the hell you’re doing there, running around the alleyways of Gaza with a gun? Is this what you studied medicine for? 'My eldest son is 22. Spending time with the ground forces, with the guys from infantry and the armored corps, who are mostly his age, generates collaboration and brotherhood. Being able to sit together in Gaza and do whatever necessary together, not just fighting or treating the wounded, creates an amazing sense of unity.' Is closure, knowing what happens to the wounded you’ve treated, important for you? Prof. Y. 'Getting feedback about what happens is very important. The unit’s team know I’m from Soroka. Lots of them say to me, ‘We brought you a wounded soldier. What’s with him?’ They need to know that everything that’s done is done for the best. Even when a wounded soldier dies, it’s important for us to know. It’s closure of sorts.' 'During evacuation, we’re all determined to carry out the mission at its very best' says Dr. Y. 'Afterwards, on the landing pad, some cry, others hug. What we do is very rewarding. We’ve brought in soldiers in critical condition, at death’s door, and they survived. We had a soldier from central Gaza in a severe state of shock due to blood loss. When we brought him to the helicopter, he was as white as snow, with blood Oxygen saturation level of 38, the normal level being close to 100. The doctor with me thought that was the end of him. We suddenly saw him slightly gesturing. We said ‘Yallah, let’s go.’ We inserted blood through a hole in the bone and saved his life. His mother’s still in touch with us.' He says that they do remember the joyful success stories, but that they mainly remember the soldiers they don’t manage to save. 'I remember their faces. I have a list of all the soldiers I’ve evacuated. Who survived, and who was killed. It’s not easy. After every mission, everyone looks for their own wounded man, so see what happened with him. It doesn’t always end well. Some die, others have brain damage. We’re still in touch with some of them. We’re invited to their weddings. Changing from my army to uniform to my Soroka scrubs, and meeting people I’ve saved from the hell of Khan Younis, and I see them doing well, is a dream come true.' The medical team in the field and helicopters fight for the lives of every wounded man, how severe their condition. 'It’s important to convey this message to everyone, including the soldiers, families, brother, sisters, wives and girlfriends' says Dr. S. 'We have the most professional people in the army and medical profession in this unit. We treat the wounded in the most professional way. If we show up, they can relax. We’ll do whatever needed to save their loved ones.' 'We don’t give up' says Prof. A. 'Despite the standard approach in trauma being not resuscitating anyone with no signs of life following severe trauma, we’ll often keep trying fighting for these guys, both in the helicopters and at the hospital. How can we give up on them? They went to protect us, and we just give up? In the trauma center, they open the chest and massage to heart muscle to save them. The battle for their lives is to the bitter end.' This desperate and heroic medical care invariably demands unconventional means. 'We’ve developed lots of systems that don’t appear in the literature. Medical treatment in the field is very quick, and the wounded that used to die during evacuation, are now reaching the hospital alive. I open a vein with a very broad catheter that allows me to give him blood transfusion within one minute. You get a body, and a few minutes later, after four or five doses, he comes back to life. I’ve no idea how many of these we’ve seen. Patients we were told we couldn’t save have come back to life and recovered. We fight for them until the very last moment.' To save these wounded, Prof. A. tells us, you need to make decisions very quickly. 'What helps in these situations is experience, which we have, along with the medical profession we routinely practice. We can get a wounded man who’s relatively okay, and then he can suddenly decline. You need to make a thousand decisions to save him.' What’s going on with the injured guys when all this is happening? Can you talk to them, to calm them down, under all this pressure? Can you explain what’s about to happen? 'Generally, what they care about at that moment is what’s going on with their friends. Amidst the helicopter noise, with our helmets on, we shout, ‘Everything’s okay, you’ll live. We’ll be at the hospital in five minutes’. It’s very important to calm them, and we do that. At the hospital, the first thing we ask anyone who’s conscious, is their parent’s or wife’s telephone number. We give him a minute before respiration to exchange a few words with his family and explain what’s happened.' 'These soldiers, who survive injuries, will often develop post-trauma. I’m sure those minutes you spend calming them down, telling them ‘Everything’s okay. We’re going to save you and you’ll go back to living as you were before you were injured’ are critical in averting post trauma. What happens when, as a doctor, it’s already clear that what you’re promising isn’t going to happen? 'I lie. And there’s a very good chance he won’t even remember what went on there, under the influence of the painkiller and sometimes anesthetic medication. I believe this lie is for the best.' 'Evacuations aren’t always tragic' says Dr. Y. 'You also get magical, even comical moments. We had an American lone soldier who was psyched that we’d come to rescue him in a helicopter. He stared out of the window, stunned that he was in a Black Hawk. Midflight, he took an exercise book out of his pocket and started documenting the evacuation. Another soldier rolled up a cigarette in the helicopter.' There’s no shortage of success stories, some miraculous. 'We had a wounded man with no signs of life' says Prof. A. 'We could tell by the color of his skin, that he was dead, or in a very deep state of shock. We began resuscitating him and his breathing was agonal, i.e., terminal. We administered artificial respiration while infusing blood through two veins. A few minutes later, and he wasn’t breathing at all. We intubated him and he suddenly opened his eyes and started breathing. By the time we got to the hospital, his condition was relatively okay, breathing just with the aid of a mask. I’ve seen lots of amazing things in my work as a doctor. I’d never seen anything like that. I’ve had other very strange cases that, with all my professional experience, I’d say just couldn’t have happened.' Lt. Col. A. tells us, 'We do everything for every injured man, until nothing more can be done, to the point you declare him dead. We don’t give up even on a guy who’s dead when he’s brought into helicopter or lying on the ground. These soldiers are my son’s age. I can’t see myself giving up on a kid like this. I might be asked why we do all of this. After all, there’s no chance of saving him. But we’ve seen wounded men, who we thought there was no chance of saving, who recovered.' And when it doesn’t work? 'It hurts like hell. Real pain inside. It’s very hard to see media reports with pictures of guys I’ve tried to save who didn’t survive. Our mission is that they should live. Even when you know it’s not your fault, and you know you didn’t fail, it’s a terribly disappointing feeling.' On the morning of October 7, when it still wasn’t clear who was fighting whom and what exactly was going on in the south, the unit’s fighters were called to help evacuate wounded people from the Gaza Periphery. Some were taken straight to the hospital where they’d reported for duty as soon as the sirens went off. It was only when they were in the air that they understood the magnitude of the horror. Maj. Dr. L. started his reserve duty in the unit two days earlier. When they took off at 6:30, he was on a shift at the base. 'We were in the air half an hour later, and by 8 o’clock, we were evacuating the wounded from the Gaza Periphery. We were on the first Sikorsky (helicopter) in the field. What did you see from above? 'The skies were clear and calm where we were, but what was on the ground, looked very different. As a combat pilot, I’ve lived much of life with headphones, but I’ve never heard noise like on that terrible day.' L. tells us that 30 hours of non-stop evacuation started there. 'We’d evacuate the wounded, land, get new medical equipment, and take off again, over and over and over again. We didn’t have time to go to the bathroom or eat properly. We obviously didn’t sleep either.' 'You can’t imagine such a thing and you’ve no way of mentally preparing for it. As a pilot, you like having a back-up plan for every unforeseen eventuality. This was outside all of that.' How did you know where to fly to? 'It took us time to understand what was going on. On a Sikorsky, you don’t have TV, and we weren’t getting reliable information from outside and the communication systems were very busy. We constructed a picture on our own, throughout the day. We reached the first wounded using Google Maps, via friends and forces on the ground sending us locations. In the first evacuation, we were told, ‘Take the injured guy and take off. There are lots of terrorists around.’ We had severely wounded cases that we rushed to evacuate. Again and again. We gradually understood that this incident was like nothing else.' 'In the afternoon, we were sent to a Golani outpost with dozens severely wounded soldiers. The helicopter took off as soon as we got out as it was being shot at. We planned leaving with the wounded, but the gunfire exchange meant the helicopter couldn’t return. We reached late afternoon, and it didn’t look like we were getting out of there. At some stage, we got an Apache that fired at the terrorists from the sky as we loaded lots and lots of people onto the little helicopter and flew away. After dropping them off at Soroka, we got back into the field to carry on evacuating the wounded. In the huge chaos of that day, Soroka’s trauma center was like coming home after a hard day. You know you’ve brought the wounded to the right place.' Unlike hospital corridors where the department head is God, and the senior doctors his deputy, here at 669, everyone’s equal. The collaborative work, under fire, with the one and only purpose of saving our soldiers, turns the unit’s doctors and soldiers into a single body. Thus Dr. Y., the most junior of the team who started his residency less than a year ago, a mere week before the war broke out, found himself working shoulder to shoulder with his department head, with no hierarchical pretenses. 'All the senior doctors at Soroka are my friends from the unit. People at the hospital sometimes don’t know how to take it. We’re always hugging in the corridors and slapping one another on the back.' 'The professor is a special kind of guy. On the outside, he seems rather stern, but inside he’s as sweet as can be. At 2am October 7, I met him at a base in central Israel with a sandwich in his hand, and he asked me if I wanted a bite. He’d just evacuated dozens of severely injured people, and needed a hug himself. One day, I went to sleep and woke up to find cookies placed next to my bed and note reading, ‘Take care of yourself’.' And the love seems to be mutual. 'He’s an amazing guy. I’ve known since joining the unit' the department head says of his young resident. 'I’m proud he’s doing his residency with me. Being his supervisor is an honor.' This past year’s intensive work has created a special, almost family, bond between the two. 'At the end of the day, the unit has made us who we are' says Sgt. Maj. Y. 'I’ve become a totally different person since joining 669. Each person here is better than the next. ‘Salt of the Earth’ doesn’t cover it. We have people with an amazing desire to give. No one asks questions. No one thinks twice. We’re all addicted to the task and to the work. The chances of being part of this group are super low. The unit is super small and intimate. We all feel lucky to be part of it.' They all say that, after the mission itself, deep friendship is perhaps the most important part of their service. So, despite dealing with ongoing danger, no one was prepared for administering urgent medical care to their professional and unit colleagues. Dr. S., the oldest of the group, grandfather to a little granddaughter born during the war, was also injured evacuating wounded from Gaza. 'It was the second sortie that day' he says. 'The second incident was very hard and complex, with people killed and severely wounded. After initial assessment, I took the most severely wounded soldier who’d been hit by an explosion and was unconscious. At the Soroka landing pad, when we took him out and ran, taking him to the trauma department, I suddenly slipped and fell on the grass. I got up and fell again. I felt I couldn’t control my leg, so I told the guys, 'Run, I’ll be okay.' I was taken to the trauma department, where, once again, I got up and fell down. Only then did I understand that something had happened.' But this rather dry story doesn’t give the full picture. Dr. Y. who was there with him tells us, 'S. had torn his thigh muscle, which is excruciatingly painful. He was screaming in pain, louder than the noise the helicopter makes, but he adamantly refused that we treat him. He said, 'Guys, don’t touch me. Treat the soldiers.' Everyone admits that, despite their great and sacred task, the double lives they’ve been leading for the past year, of demanding work both at the hospital and in the unit, comes at a heavy cost. Most are still serving in the reserves, dividing their time between the hospital and the unit. 'Its geographical location means that most are evacuated to Soroka' says Dr. Y. 'It’s my second home. After long, hard hours in the field, I’ll go into the trauma department and all my friends welcome me with a smile and a hug. You get a love-boost and you have the strength to carry on. And yet, being away from the family is hard. The hardest thing was parting from my wife October 7 when she was in her final trimester. I left her alone in the house with non-stop sirens and rumors of terrorists infiltrating Beersheba. She’d started packing my bag when I called her from the hospital to tell her I was no my way to the unit.' L's firstborn daughter was born three months later, and he received short leave from the unit, after which he immediately returned to the unit. 'It was hard leaving the house before. After the birth, it was so much harder. I felt I was abandoning my wife and daughter. Amidst the death we were seeing all around, my daughter was the source of great joy. She’s saving the situation. I’m a very blessed father.' 'Those weeks of fighting were very intense for me and my family.' I’ve already done 250 days of reserve duty this year. My wife keeps asking when it’ll all be over. She didn’t imagine this is what I’d be doing at the age of 50. But this is me. I have one clear purpose to what I do - saving lives. That’s why I joined the unit. It’s enormously important. Every hour of every day, if they need me, I pack my things and go out to them. That’s where I belong.' Haven’t you thought of stopping? Telling yourself you’ve given enough, and that now others can give? 'I never say enough. Definitely not now. I have no dilemmas.' 'Leaving has never crossed my mind' says Prof. Y. 'We’re doctors, but we’re soldiers just like our friends with us in the helicopters. Despite our differences in age and background, we’re a group, like fingers on a hand. You can’t punch with one finger missing.' Dr. S., still rehabilitating from the injury, is counting days until he can save lives in the air again. 'I’m dying to get back to the unit' he says. 'Just don’t tell my wife.'

Biden sees opportunity to potentially end Israel-Iran fighting 'f...	Biden says US has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday there was an opportunity to deal with Israel and Iran in a way that potentially ends their conflict in the Middle East for a while. Speaking to reporters at the end of a visit to Berlin, Biden also said he has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran. He declined to elaborate. Tensions have been high in the region with Israel planning a response to the Oct. 1 missile attack carried out by Tehran. 'There's an opportunity in my view and my colleagues agree that we can probably deal with Israel and Iran in a way that ends the conflict for a while. That ends the conflict, in other words, that stops the back and forth,' Biden said. Biden added that he believed there was a possibility of working towards a ceasefire in Lebanon but that such efforts would be harder in Gaza.

The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported Friday that in the past 24 hours, some 60 terrorists were eliminated in southern Lebanon, and numerous targets were struck from the air and ground. Additionally, it was reported that earlier, the Israeli Air Force successfully intercepted two drones approaching from Lebanon outside Israeli territory. During the operation, forces located and destroyed rockets and munitions in areas from which launches into Israel occurred. They also identified and dismantled anti-tank missile launchers prepared for firing alongside rockets and other weaponry stored in a facility.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byukjgelke	2024-10-18T10:30:42-07:00

The butcher from Khan Younis - How Sinwar became an arch-terroris...	With a name like Sinwar—a combination of 'Sin' and 'War'—what could one expect? Yahya Sinwar, the man who orchestrated the October 7 massacre, embodied a life filled with violence, brutality, and conflict Yahya Sinwar’s dark legacy began with his family’s displacement from Ashkelon (then Al-Majdal Asqalan) during the 1948 war, driven by a desire to fulfill the Nakba's vision. Raised under Israeli control after the 1967 Six-Day War, Sinwar attended school and university, but his hatred only grew. He particularly resented Egypt for its peace treaty with Israel, which he saw as a betrayal. At university, Sinwar became a disciple of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Hamas’ co-founder, whose extremist ideology—advocating for jihad against Israel—shaped Sinwar’s worldview. However, he earned the nickname 'Butcher of Khan Younis' not for killing Israelis, but for brutally torturing and killing Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. His enthusiasm for such acts cemented his grim reputation. In 1988, Sinwar was sentenced to four life terms in Israeli prison for orchestrating abductions and killings of Israeli soldiers and suspected collaborators. He spent 22 years in prison, continuing his reign of terror by torturing fellow inmates. While some described him as fearless and brutal—often killing with his bare hands—others saw him as a coward, manipulating others into violence while keeping himself safe. During his time in prison, Sinwar learned Hebrew, read Israeli newspapers, and studied the culture, preparing for psychological warfare. He even wrote a novel, 'Thorns and Carnations,' an autobiographical tale. His stay in Israeli prison came at a significant cost to Israel—$612,000 over 22 years, which included life-saving surgery for a brain tumor by Israeli doctors. Ironically, one of those doctors later pleaded with Sinwar after his nephew was kidnapped by Hamas, only to find out the next day that his nephew had been killed. Sinwar’s brother, Muhammad, was instrumental in the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, which ultimately led to Sinwar’s release in the 2011 prisoner exchange. After his release, Sinwar swiftly rose through Hamas’ ranks, seizing power in Gaza by 2017 through eliminating rivals, often via public executions or throwing opponents off rooftops. One of Sinwar’s early moves as Hamas leader was to cosmetically amend the organization’s charter, replacing the word 'Jews' with 'Zionists' and 'jihad' with 'Free Palestine.' Yet, his ultimate goal—the destruction of Israel—remained unchanged. Sinwar kept his personal life largely hidden, but recent footage showed him walking through a tunnel with his wife and children. Rumors of his brutality in his personal life linger, though details remain unclear. He frequently acted independently of Hamas leadership, including launching the October 7 attack without waiting for Hezbollah or Iran to coordinate, choosing to rely on fear. His plans unraveled—Hezbollah didn’t attack, Israeli Arabs didn’t rise up, and Iran stayed out of the fight. On October 16, 2024, Sinwar was killed by the IDF, marking the end of his violent reign. His plan to destroy Israel failed, and even Palestinians are growing tired of the devastation his leadership has brought to Gaza. Now, the question is where to go from here. This moment—the fall of the 'Butcher'—offers a chance to restore hope and normalcy to the region. It’s time to focus on freeing the hostages. Offering high sums of money to Gazans who return hostages alive could create an incentive for change. With international support, there is an opportunity to help Gazans form a leadership committed to peace and rebuilding alongside Israel. Amid the chaos Sinwar left behind, there is a rare chance to restore stability and dignity. But we must remember, there are more Sinwars—particularly his brother, who may be eager to continue the violence. One of the promises Israel made after October 7 was to bring the innocent hostages home. These hostages do not receive the privileged treatment Sinwar received in Israeli jail. They are deprived of medical care, food, and held only for the crime of being Jewish. Noam Dan from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum shared the following after Sinwar’s death: 'The elimination of Yahya Sinwar is an important achievement. However, true victory in this war hinges on the return of the 101 abductees still held in Gaza. While Sinwar’s death is a blow to Hamas, it brings mixed emotions for the families whose loved ones remain trapped in Hamas tunnels. Prime Minister Netanyahu must now act with the same determination and ensure the swift release of the abductees. Sinwar is no longer an obstacle—the responsibility lies squarely with Netanyahu to decide if he will be the leader who abandoned them or the one who brought them home.'

And for such ways to resolve the situation to be found that would satisfy both sides,' Putin told reporters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjtw2exx1g	2024-10-18T08:17:39-07:00	
New details of Sinwar's assassination and the fighting that conti...	IDF says the military's actions cornered Yahya Sinwar, preventing him from escaping from the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood and setting the stage for his elimination For weeks, IDF troops from the Nahal Brigade and the 828th (Bislamach) Brigade have been fighting in Rafah, closely cooperating with the Shin Bet. The Bislach combat team operating in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood identified several suspects, and during the ensuing battle, they discovered they had killed the notorious Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. On Friday, IDF forces encountered two terrorists around the house where Sinwar was located, one possibly part of the group that accompanied Sinwar in his final hours. A preliminary IDF investigation revealed that on Wednesday morning, around 10 am, a soldier from the 450th Battalion spotted two suspicious figures moving between the ruins of the neighborhood. He reported the sighting, and Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Ran Canaan advanced with infantry and armored forces. He observed three suspicious individuals—two walking ahead, wrapped in blankets, and a third trailing behind, wearing a combat vest and armed, with a hood covering his head. Initially, there was concern that the two figures could be hostages, and the commander opened fire at the third individual, identified as a terrorist, hitting his hand. At this point, no one realized the terrorists was Sinwar. Contrary to earlier claims, Sinwar did not lose his hand. 'He’s no Trumpeldor,' IDF officials remarked. At that moment, the terrorists split up. Two entered a nearby house, while the third, later confirmed as Sinwar, fled to another. The two fired back at the IDF forces, critically wounding a soldier from the 450th Battalion, who was airlifted to the hospital and has since improved. The battalion commander called in reinforcements to check the house where Sinwar had fled. Bloodstains were found on the stairs, and the commander realized it was fresh blood. Sinwar threw two grenades from a window, one of which exploded but caused no injuries. The IDF forces shelled the building with tank fire, missiles, and machine guns, still unaware of Sinwar’s identity. After the first shelling, a drone was sent inside and captured footage of Sinwar, wounded, sitting on a couch and throwing a stick at the drone. By this point, it was 4 pm—six hours after the operation had begun. A second shell was fired, along with heavy machine-gun fire, which ultimately killed him. The unit continued its heavy bombardment until part of the building collapsed. Later that evening, another drone was sent into the building and spotted a body, though it couldn’t yet be identified. The decision was made to wait until daylight to enter. Around midnight, another terrorist was spotted in a lookout post and was killed. By Thursday morning, when another drone was flown inside, the forces noticed the body bore a resemblance to Sinwar. Photos were sent to the Southern Command headquarters, and a senior officer shared them with his counterpart at the Shin Bet’s operations division, asking, 'Do you recognize him?' Shin Bet operational teams arrived at the scene and began forensic tests to confirm Sinwar’s identity. When Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman arrived on-site and saw the body with his own eyes, he immediately realized it was Sinwar. According to the IDF, 'This operation followed several months of fighting during which the IDF, in cooperation with the Shin Bet and led by the 162nd Division, fought against the Rafah Brigade and the Tel al-Sultan Battalion, eliminating hundreds of terrorists. These actions cornered Sinwar, preventing his escape and setting the stage for his elimination.' Southern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman praised the soldiers, saying, 'Your persistence, patience, analysis of the terrain, vigilance, and pursuit of contact—engaging them and opening fire—made a significant impact. Your determination, systematic searches, and refusal to give up finding each of them one by one, led to this moment. When the opportunity came, you acted with operational alertness, engaged, took them down, and quickly closed the circle. This is how it should be. Here in Rafah, in Tel al-Sultan, we did it, and we’ll continue to do so everywhere. You have earned great respect for that.'

Outrageous': Lebanon and Iran see rare disagreement over UN reso...	Lebanese government is outraged after Iranian official says in interview Tehran was willing to negotiate the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 A rare confrontation between the Lebanese government and Iran took place on Friday after a senior Iranian official said Tehran was willing to negotiate the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 from 2006, which brought an end to the Second Lebanon War and stipulated Hezbollah terrorists would not be allowed to operate south of the Litani River. The unusual statement, viewed in Beirut as a violation of its sovereignty, was made by Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro. In the interview, Ghalibaf also said that France could serve as a mediator between Hezbollah and Israel. 'There’s no such thing as Israel, only a Zionist regime, which is an armed wing of the U.S. and not worth negotiating with,' he said, but added, 'We see a faint light at the end of the tunnel, a light that indicates Iran is willing to negotiate with France, a country that has traditionally defended Lebanon, regarding the specific conditions for implementing Resolution 1701.' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati expressed his outrage over the remarks and ordered the Iranian embassy chargé d'affaires to be summoned following the statement (the ambassador himself was injured in September’s pager attack and was evacuated to Tehran). 'We’re surprised by the Iranian Parliament Speaker’s statements. This declaration is an outrageous interference in Lebanon's affairs and an attempt to establish unacceptable control,' Mikati said. 'We informed the Iranian Foreign Minister and the Parliament Speaker during their recent visits to Lebanon that the Lebanese situation must be understood, especially since Lebanon is facing unprecedented Israeli attacks, and we’re working with all of Lebanon's allies, including France, to pressure Israel to a cease-fire,' Mikati added. 'The issue of negotiating the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 is managed by the state of Lebanon, and everyone is required to support it in this direction rather than impose new mandates, which are unacceptable from every national and sovereign perspective,' he added. Mikati has been heading a caretaker government for a long time due to his country’s prolonged political crisis. Although his government is weak and impoverished, some hope to strengthen it as part of a future settlement that could potentially end the conflict in the north based on the implementation of the UN’s resolution. Iran attempted to clarify Ghalibaf's remarks following Mikati’s response. A source close to the Iranian Parliament Speaker told the Hezbollah-affiliated network Al-Mayadeen, 'Ghalibaf's position affirms that Iran will support whatever the Lebanese government and Hezbollah support regarding a cease-fire. Cooperation with Europe aims to assist in reaching a cease-fire agreement that both the Lebanese government and Hezbollah will endorse.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjk00ja1xjl	2024-10-18T05:38:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/18/S1JEuo1xke/S1JEuo1xke_0_0_1000_567_0_small.jpg

Harvard sees biggest downtrend in donations in a decade	Donations to the prestigious Ivy League institute nosedive 15% in the last year against the backdrop of pro-Palestinian protests and president's resignation Harvard University experienced its most significant drop in donations in a decade, with a decrease of about $151 million compared to last year — marking a nearly 15% downtrend. This marks the largest decline since 2015, reflecting a turbulent period for the Ivy League institution. The main reason for this decline is the campus protests following the war in Gaza, which led to prominent university donors halting their funds, and the resignation of former president Prof. Claudine Gay, who faced harsh criticism regarding her handling of antisemitism on campus. The university's annual financial report indicated that Harvard received $1.17 billion in donations for the year ending in June 2024, a significantly lower number than the $1.38 billion received year-on-year. The greatest impact was on its endowment fund, which saw a 34% cut in donations, totaling a $368.1 million loss. Harvard's new president, Prof. Alan Garber, expressed his disappointment with this year's fundraising results, noting concerns they could signal future challenges in fundraising efforts. He stressed that some previous commitments still continue to support the university, but the financial report highlights the decline in donation revenue and the complex economic situation that created significant uncertainty regarding continued funding. The pro-Palestinian protests on campus, sparked by the university's response to the Hamas attack on October 7, led several key donors including the Ofer family, hedge fund mogul Ken Griffin and investor Len Blavatnik to withhold their contributions to Harvard. Despite the drop in donations, the university remains the wealthiest in the world, with an endowment fund valued at $53.2 billion, which yielded a 9.6% return over the past year. The financial report said the fund contributes about 37% of the institution's annual revenue, generating $2.4 billion that supports funding for professors' salaries, scholarships and research. University expenses continued to rise, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits, but Harvard managed to end the year with a budget surplus of around $45 million. Despite this, Prof. Garber and the university's administration stressed the need for cautious financial management in the future, given that expenses continue to outgrow revenue. Harvard is the second Ivy League university to report a drop in donations this year following a wave of protests across campuses. New York’s Columbia University York, which spearheaded pro-Palestinian demonstrations on U.S. campuses, recorded a nearly 30% drop in donations during its annual giving day.

Sinwar's body relocated to Israeli site after autopsy	The former Hamas leader's body reportedly delivered to secret site in the country after inspection of his body was completed following his elimination The body of former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was eliminated in Gaza on Thursday, was delivered to a secret facility in Israel following the completion of its autopsy, Ynet learned on Friday. At this stage, it's unclear what will be done with his body and whether it will be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations, which may also include a hostage deal to return the 101 Israeli hostages still held in the Gaza Strip. The autopsy revealed Sinwar was shot in the head and his body showed indication of bullet wounds. His body weight was normal. The results of the toxicology report, which will determine whether he was under the influence of drugs or psychoactive substances, have yet to be received. Sinwar was eliminated two days ago following an accidental encounter, without prior intelligence, with IDF soldiers in Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan refugee camp — the same area where the tunnel in which six Israeli hostages were executed at the end of August. The IDF later released drone footage following Sinwar’s encounter with the soldiers. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari confirmed Thursday night that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in Tel Sultan by IDF soldiers the day before. 'For months, the IDF and Shin Bet gathered intelligence to eliminate Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre. He was hiding in the area, and we didn’t know he was there. We identified Sinwar as a terrorist inside a building, found him with a vest, a pistol and 40,000 shekels. He was on the run, and we eliminated him. No hostages were with him.'

Berlin pushes for cease-fire after death of Hamas leader Sinwar	The death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar must lead to a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of all remaining hostages, spokespeople for the German government said on Friday. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock had concluded during a meeting with her U.S. counterpart earlier on Friday that 'this could be a turning point in order to reach a ceasefire, free the hostages and get more aid into Gaza,' a foreign ministry spokesperson said during a regular press conference.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjw4e2kgjg	2024-10-18T02:54:21-07:00	
Hezbollah says it will escalate war with Israel after Hamas leade...	Iran-backed terror group says Sinwar's death will strengthen its operative to launch new, stronger offensive against Israel amid Gaza war Lebanon's Hezbollah terror group said on Friday it was moving to a new and escalating phase in its war against Israel while Iran said 'the spirit of resistance will be strengthened' after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar, a mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war, was killed during an operation by IDF soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long war. Western leaders said his death offered an opportunity for the conflict to end, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would go on until the hostages seized by Hamas militants were returned. 'Today we have settled the score. Today evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed,' Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement after the death was confirmed on Thursday. 'To the dear hostage families, I say: This is an important moment in the war. We will continue full force until all your loved ones, our loved ones, are home.' Sinwar, who was named as Hamas' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades. He was killed during a gun battle in southern Gaza on Wednesday by IDF troops who were initially unaware that they had caught their country's number one enemy, Israeli officials said. The military released a drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building. Hamas has not made any comment itself, but sources within the terror group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed by Israeli troops. 'Chief obstacle' Despite Western hopes of a cease-fire, Sinwar's death could dial up hostilities in the Middle East where the prospect of an even wider conflict has grown. Israel launched a ground campaign in Lebanon this month and is now planning a response to an October 1 missile attack carried out by Iran, an ally of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah. But the demise of the man who planned the attack last year in which fighters killed 1,200 people in Israel and captured more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, could also help push forward stalled efforts to end the war in which Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. U.S. President Joe Biden, who spoke to Netanyahu by phone to congratulate him, said Sinwar's death provided a chance for the conflict in Gaza to finally end and for Israeli hostages to be brought home. The U.S. wants to kick-start talks on a proposal to achieve a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, calling Sinwar the 'chief obstacle' to ending the war. 'That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can’t predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,' he said. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said. Iran indicated no sign the killing would shift its support. 'The spirit of resistance will be strengthened' following the death of Sinwar, its mission to the United Nations said. Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing 'the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel'. The IDF said on Friday it had also killed Muhammad Hassin Ramal, Hezbollah’s commander of the Tayibe area in southern Lebanon. No comfort, no compromise Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was a significant achievement, it would not be complete while hostages are still in Gaza. Avi Marciano, the father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that 'the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell.' 'A little justice, but no comfort,' he said. 'There will be comfort only when Naama, Liri, Agam, Daniela and Karina, our girls' friends, return home.' In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, a displaced Palestinian named Thabet Amour told Reuters the Palestinian fight would continue. 'This is resistance that does not disappear when men disappear,' he said. 'The assassination of Sinwar will not lead to the end of the resistance or to a compromise or surrender and raising the white flag.'

Court indicts Jerusalem man of planning to carry out attack in Te...	Jerusalem District Court charges Ibrahim Al-Ramadi with conspiracy to murder and incitement to terror after he planned to attack hostages' family protest The Jerusalem District Court on Friday indicted Ibrahim Al-Ramadi, a 22-year-old resident of East Jerusalem of planning to carry out a terror attack alongside Hamas terrorists in Tel Aviv during a hostages’ families’ protest in the city. According to the indictment, submitted by Attorney Pua Ben Tov from the Jerusalem District Prosecutor’s Office, the man intended to carry out a terrorist attack against Jews with two other individuals. To this end, he met with a Hamas member and a member of another West Bank terror group to enlist their help. The three planned to conduct an attack using a timed explosive and discussed the best way to carry out an attack that would harm as many Jews as possible. The indictment added that the three considered various options for the attack: placing an explosive at a demonstration advocating for the return of hostages in Tel Aviv, a shooting attack on a bus in the Jordan Valley, kidnapping Jews and placing an explosive on a Jewish bus. At some point, one of the group members decided to back out of the plan and the suspect brought in another person to finalize the details, having decided to carry out the attack in Tel Aviv during a demonstration for the return of the hostages. Detectives from the Israel Police’s Central Unit Jerusalem District Police arrested the man at his home on September 17 following Shin Bet directions. The charges added the suspect incited terrorism, expressed support for a terror organization and made several social media posts praising, sympathizing with and encouraging acts of terror. On October 9, 2023, two days after Hamas’ attack, he posted an image of Hamas terrorist with the caption, 'God, grant victory to Islam and Muslims.' The indictment charges the young man with terrorism charges including conspiracy to murder, expressing support for a terror organization, incitement to terrorism and contact with a foreign agent. The prosecution has requested that the defendant be remanded in custody until the end of the legal proceedings against him. 'The investigation revealed that at some point the man, a supporter of the Jenin Brigades and Hamas, decided to conspire with others from the West Bank to assist in his murderous plots. With their help, he planned to purchase weapons and explosives to carry out terrorist attacks against security forces and civilians,' the Israel Police and Shin Bet said in a joint statement. 'The joint investigation revealed that the terrorist had already written a will, created a social media group called 'Soldiers of God,' and was preparing to execute his plan to attack participants in the protest,' the statement added. 'Fortunately, however, he didn’t manage to acquire the weapons he had planned to use for the attack, as he was arrested by the Shin Bet and the police, thwarting his intentions. He declared that he still intended to carry out an attack even after his arrest, saying, ‘I would have carried out an attack and killed a large number of people if I hadn't been arrested.''

The stories of five Golani commandos killed in Lebanon	Two officers and three soldier's of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit fell in battle against Hezbollah terrorists; these are their stories The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Thursday five of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit’s soldiers were killed in battle in southern Lebanon. According to a military investigation, the troops scanned a building close to the Israel-Lebanon border and were surprised by four Hezbollah terrorists hiding in it, prompting a deadly firefight resulting in three soldiers seriously injured and five who lost their lives. These are their stories: Maj. Ofek Bachar Deep sorrow fell on Ness Ziona following the tragic news of the death of resident Maj. Ofek Bachar. Maj. Bachar, 24, who rose through the ranks in the elite Egoz Unit, had taken on the role of a platoon commander in the Golani Reconnaissance Unit three months ago. His soldiers came to know him as a brave and skilled officer and struggled to process the loss of their commander. Maj. Bachar, is survived by his parents, Ronit and Yehuda and his siblings, Sagi and Ofir. 'Ness Ziona Mayor Shmuel Boxer, the city council members and the entire community send their warmest embrace to the grieving family and will stand by them during these difficult times,' a Ness Ziona Municipality statement read. Capt. Elad Siman Tov The settlement of Tzofim located in the West Bank, received the news of the death of resident Capt. Elad Siman-Tov, 23. a platoon commander in the Golani Reconnaissance Unit, with great sorrow. 'The entire community mourns the loss of Elad, one of our finest sons, right in the middle of the Sukkot holiday,' said Yossi Dagan, head of the Shomron Regional Council. 'Elad was a righteous man, an officer and a commander adored by his soldiers. It's hard to believe.' 'He was a war machine,' one of the officer’s soldiers recalled. 'His soldiers loved him and he loved them, caring for them as if they were his own children.' Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder, 22, a resident of Jerusalem who fell alongside four of his comrades from the Golani Reconnaissance Battalion in combat in Lebanon, will be laid to rest at the Mount Herzl Military Cemetery. Last week, Staff Sgt. Wieder celebrated his birthday and said goodbye to his parents, Moti and Yael, for the last time. Staff Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom, 21, a Golani Reconnaissance unit soldier who fell in the fierce battle, will be laid to rest in his hometown of Hebron. Staff Sgt. Yahalom was given his middle name, 'Dror,' after Col. Dror Weinberg, a Hebron Brigade commander who was killed in November 2002. Yahalom enlisted in the elite unit two years ago and returned to active duty even after marrying his wife Shachar. He is survived by his parents, Moshe and Tehila and ten siblings. 'I’ve known Yehudah personally since he was a young boy,' said Hebron Local Council head Eyal Gelman. 'Yehudah was the salt of the earth. A brave hero who fought across all fronts with his unit over the past year.' 'Yehudah contributed greatly to the building of Hebron and the Land of Israel. We embrace his beloved wife, Shachar, Moshe and Tehila, and the entire Yahalom family and will stand by their side in every way in these difficult times,' he added. Staff Sgt. Yaakov Hillel Staff Sgt.

The deputy or a 'strawman': Sinwar's potential heirs in Hamas	The former Hamas leader's sudden elimination leaves the terror group without strong leadership and could shift the center of power abroad; these are his possible replacements Former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s elimination in Gaza on Thursday is sending the Gazan terror group into freefall with speculation about his possible successor. The list of potential Hamas successors includes various senior figures within the terror organization — most of whom reside in Qatar or other countries. While one of the leading candidates is originally from Gaza, the rest are senior members of the terror group’s politburo, indicating Sinwar’s death could shift the power back to leaders overseas. This marks a change after years where the balance of power leaned toward senior Gazan figures. 'Decisions will be returned to Hamas’ branch abroad, which may help push negotiations for a cease-fire forward,' Hamas sources told Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. 'Sinwar was a true leader — he would promote and remove figures in the movement at his discretion,' A source close to the terror organization's leadership claimed. 'He took control of decision-making in an extreme manner, which was evident from the moment he became head. Communication with him was difficult, complicated and often disrupted.' Sinwar's potential successor will need to be accepted by the terror group’s leadership abroad and likely have some ties to Iran as well. These are the terror group’s possible candidates: Khaled Mashal One potential contender is Khaled Mashal, considered one of the most powerful figures in Hamas's politburo, although his views have differed from Sinwar's — especially regarding ties with Iran. Mashal currently serves as the leader of Hamas’ foreign branch, and headed its politburo for 21 years, from 1996 to 2017, before deciding to step down. In 2021, he was re-elected as the leader of Hamas’ foreign branch in an attempt to return to the Palestinian political arena. In 1997, he survived an assassination attempt in a botched Mossad operation in Jordan. Khalil al-Hayya Khalil al-Hayya, Sinwar's deputy, left the Gaza Strip before October 7, 2023, and has since been one of the senior figures leading negotiations for a cease-fire and a hostage deal on behalf of the terror organization. Al-Hayya also maintains strong ties with Iran, where he traveled following the terror group’s former politburo member Ismail Haniyeh's assassination to attend his funeral. The New York Times reported that al-Hayya was part of the 'closed military council' Sinwar convened over two years to plan the October 7 attack and acted as a special envoy for classified discussions on the matter with Iran and Hezbollah. According to a Gazan source, al-Hayya is seen as having a strong chance of being appointed head of Hamas’ politburo. 'Sinwar groomed him for the role and brought him closer to Iranian elements that support Hamas,' the source said. 'Al-Hayya's power within the group’s politburo is evident today. He’s considered one of the few Sinwar trusted.' Mousa Abu Marzook Mousa Abu Marzook, who served as Haniyeh's deputy when he was head of Hamas' politburo and is regarded as one of the senior figures in the organization's political wing, lived in the U.S. for many years and has since moved between various Arab capitals. Over the past year, he held a series of interviews worldwide, including one where he said that the tunnels built in Gaza were intended to protect Hamas, not the residents of the Strip. 'It's the UN's responsibility to protect them,' he said. Abu Marzouk also played an important role in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. Unlike Mashal, he isn’t not considered a charismatic or influential 'threat' and was often given a platform and spotlight by Haniyeh on various occasions. A 'strawman' candidate? In August, following Haniyeh’s assassination, Saudi networks reported that the person expected to take over as head of Hamas's political bureau was Muhammad Ismail Darwish, who serves as the head of Hamas' Shura Council. It was later revealed that Darwish wasn’t chosen, with Sinwar taking the role instead. Nevertheless, Hamas released a photo of its Shura Council head meeting with Islamic Jihad leader Ziyad al-Nakhalah last August, about two weeks after Sinwar's appointment as head. One figure less likely to take over Hamas' politburo is his brother, Mohammed Sinwar, who has already likely taken over as head of the terror group's armed wing.

Mohammed Sinwar: The ruthless brother who 'came back from the dea...	People would look at the ground when he walked by,' Gazans say of younger brother of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar; rising through the ranks by earning trust and loyalty, he survived numerous assassination attempts, with rumors of his death falsely circulated in the past In December, a brief video from a 4-kilometer-long (2.5-mile-long) mega-tunnel revealed, for the first time, an image of one of Gaza’s most wanted figures: Mohammed Sinwar, the younger brother of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Since the deaths of senior Hamas military commanders, including Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa, Mohammed Sinwar has emerged as the de facto second-in-command of Hamas’ leadership in Gaza, propelled by the unwavering support of his brother. Mohammed Sinwar, 49, was born in Khan Younis and was among the earliest recruits to Hamas, participating in acts of terror during the First Intifada. He was imprisoned in Israel for nine months and later spent three years in a Palestinian Authority prison, escaping in 2000. A Gaza source noted that Sinwar grew up under the ideological influence of Hamas co-founder Abd al-Aziz al-Rantisi. The Sinwar brothers share much in common, including the nickname 'Abu Ibrahim,' given to both after their first sons, named after their father, Ibrahim. Mohammed Sinwar became a trusted confidant of Yahya, one of the few who knew his whereabouts during nearly a year of war. His family ties provided him with a smooth path to the top of Hamas, with no suspicions from within the organization of disloyalty. Mohammed Sinwar’s role was first revealed by Hamas in 2005 when the group broke from its tradition of secrecy and disclosed the identities of seven commanders leading attacks against Israelis and IDF forces. Sinwar was named among them as the commander of the Khan Younis Brigade. At the time, Israel reportedly made three assassination attempts on him—through sniper fire, a double airstrike on his home and an explosive device in the wall of his house, which he uncovered. One of Sinwar's most significant operations was orchestrating the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006, an event that eventually led to the prisoner exchange deal in which his brother Yahya was freed. At the time of the abduction, Mohammed Sinwar served as the commander of the Khan Younis Brigade, conditioning Shalit’s release on the freedom of his brother Yahya, who would later rise to lead Hamas before his death. Loyalty over ability 'Mohammed became a significant player in Hamas' military wing. When Yahya Sinwar was in Israeli prison, he trusted that Mohammed had control over Shalit. Today, it’s clear that Mohammed’s status within the military wing grew due to his proximity to Yahya—who believes in specific people,' said Dr. Yuval Biton, former head of the Intelligence Division in Israel's prison service who knew Yahya well. 'Yahya doesn’t look at abilities; he looks at loyalty, and that’s what drove Mohammed’s rise in Hamas.' Biton explained that Yahya Sinwar likely sought to consolidate power by surrounding himself with trusted figures in the leadership, allowing him to make decisions without opposition. 'As we approached the Shalit deal, the Sinwar brothers opposed it—even though Yahya’s name was at the top of the release list. Yahya pushed Mohammed to convince the leadership to reject the deal, but Saleh al-Arouri and Khaled Mashal supported it and ultimately overruled the Sinwars,' Biton said, referencing a historical moment that led to Yahya’s eventual leadership of Hamas following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. Israel has made repeated attempts on Mohammed Sinwar’s life over the years. His home was bombed during Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, and again in Operation Protective Edge in 2014, though he was not there. During the latter operation, rumors circulated that Sinwar had been killed, with images claiming to show his dead body. However, Sinwar remained elusive, and his name faded from public view until May 2022. Al Jazeera reported that he had not attended his father’s funeral in January 2022, leading some media outlets to refer to him as 'the one who returned from the dead.' In May 2022, Sinwar reemerged in a brief 30-second interview with Al Jazeera, appearing as a silhouette—a technique used for years by Mohammed Deif. 'When we issue warnings to the occupation or send a message, we mean every word, and every letter has weight and impact on the ground,' Sinwar said. 'Precise and focused efforts have been made to establish this, and important equations have been set. When we say this, we know how to identify the occupation’s soft spots and how to press them. We have succeeded in setting important equations, and the enemy calculates its actions accordingly.' 'People would look at the ground when he walked by' Mohammed Sinwar, often referred to as 'the man who returned from the dead,' has instilled fear among Gaza’s population on multiple occasions. Known for his charismatic yet harsh and intimidating persona, Sinwar commands respect but also terror. 'He’s feared as a man capable of killing without hesitation. This family is known for its hot temper, and Mohammed, in particular, is a frightening figure,' said a source in Gaza. After his brother Yahya was released from Israeli prison in the 2011 Shalit deal, Mohammed’s influence grew. 'Yahya only understands power, and that’s Mohammed’s legacy too. He has been involved in numerous executions of collaborators, as well as brutal interrogations and torture in Hamas prisons,' the source added, describing the Sinwar brothers’ role in internal purges before the current war. 'When Mohammed scolds someone, they are paralyzed with fear. No one in Gaza dares to cross him.' The source noted that people were so terrified of Mohammed Sinwar that they avoided eye contact with him. 'People would look at the ground when he walked by, afraid of how he might interpret even a glance.' Mohammed Sinwar is also accused of overseeing harsh torture in Hamas prisons, along with his brother Yahya. One high-profile case involved the former Hamas commander of the Zeitoun Brigade, Mohammed Shetawi, who was executed in February 2016 for moral offenses. Shetawi was reportedly suspected of collaborating with Israel, potentially providing information that led to an assassination attempt on Mohammed Deif. Another version of events, presented by a different Hamas operative, suggests that Shetawi was executed after he criticized Yahya Sinwar in a security report for operational mistakes that led to the deaths of Hamas leaders. Shetawi was later accused of having relationships with the widows of those killed. Either way, Shetawi was executed under the Sinwar brothers' orders after enduring brutal torture. Inside Hamas' mega-tunnel Mohammed Sinwar played a key role in orchestrating Hamas’ October 7 surprise attack on Israel, making him one of the most wanted figures in Gaza. Considered one of the architects of the massacre, Sinwar has now likely succeeded Mohammed Deif, further sharpening the target on his back. In December, two months into the war, the IDF released rare footage showing Sinwar traveling in a jeep with bodyguards through a massive tunnel network, discovered just hundreds of yards from the Israeli community of Netiv HaAsara and the Erez crossing. He was reportedly receiving a briefing from a team of engineers and tunnel diggers, brought in from Khan Younis for the ambitious tunnel project, and toured the tunnel’s twists and turns. In response, the IDF distributed flyers in Gaza, offering a $300,000 reward for information leading to Sinwar’s capture—$100,000 less than the bounty on his brother Yahya. The flyer also featured Rafa Salama, the Khan Younis Brigade commander, and Mohammed Deif, both killed in Israeli airstrikes in July. Salama had a $200,000 bounty on his head, while Deif's was $100,000. In February, IDF forces raided and completely destroyed Mohammed Sinwar’s office at the Al-Qadisiyah post in Khan Younis. Mohammed Sinwar’s current status remains unclear. While IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has not named him among the top Hamas leaders, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant did publicly single him out, alongside his brother Yahya, during a visit to the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza last month. 'We will eliminate Hamas, and we will reach Mohammed Sinwar, as well as Yahya Sinwar. We will get to all of these people, these cursed terrorists,' Gallant declared. 'For anyone who thinks otherwise, look at Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif. They thought they were invincible, and they are no longer with us. They made their mistake, and he will make his too. We will complete our mission.'

Sinwar’s death: A victory tainted by fears for hostages’ fate	Analysis: Hamas leader's unexpected elimination may trigger unforeseen consequences; potential successors, internal uprisings, a Hamas-Iran rift and shifts in Israel’s military strategy are all on the table Shin Bet pressed the IDF to continue operations in the area where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed, near the tunnel where six hostages were executed in Rafah. Intelligence suggested senior Hamas leaders were hiding in the sector, sometimes even above ground. This assumption ultimately proved correct. While there is satisfaction and even celebration over Sinwar's elimination, Israeli officials are aware that the new reality could bring risks, particularly for the remaining hostages held by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and other terrorist groups in Gaza. Careless moves or premature announcements by Israel at this sensitive time could endanger the hostages. The fact that Sinwar was killed in a direct confrontation with Israeli forces, rather than by an airstrike, may offer some solace to his fanatic supporters, potentially affecting their treatment of hostages. However, the loss of a charismatic religious leader like Sinwar could also incite retaliation and spur desperate acts of revenge, especially from Gaza residents who saw him as a symbol or even a messianic figure. The immediate concern is for the hostages, who are held by unpredictable factions. Their captors’ reactions to Sinwar’s death remain difficult to anticipate. The successor The future dynamics of Gaza, both in the short and long term, will largely depend on who succeeds Sinwar as Hamas leader in the Palestinian enclave and as head of the organization’s political bureau. A key challenge is finding a figure in Gaza with communication channels open to all factions, particularly the Hamas terrorists holding Israeli hostages, and whose decisions are accepted by the various groups involved. If Sinwar’s brother, Mohammed Sinwar, takes over, it is likely that he will be familiar with his late brother’s communication methods with Hamas leadership abroad, particularly in Doha, Qatar. This could enable Egypt and Qatar to establish contact with him. However, Mohammed Sinwar may not command the same authority as his brother, making it harder for him to prevent the 'privatization' of hostage control by families, organizations and armed groups in Gaza. Each of these groups may have its own ideas on how to use the hostages as leverage for their own interests. Another potential successor is Az al-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’ Gaza Brigade. One of the few surviving senior leaders of Hamas’ military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, Haddad is known for his charisma and having survived several Israeli assassination attempts. If Haddad replaces Sinwar, his influence on the fate of the hostages could differ. As a native of northern Gaza, Haddad is considered a commander of the region, including Gaza City, which is under heavy attack and siege by the IDF. He may be more open to negotiations involving easing conditions for northern Gaza residents in exchange for progress on hostage talks. This contrasts with Mohammed Sinwar, former Khan Younis commander, who is known for his ruthlessness and unwavering loyalty to his brother. However, it is unclear whether Haddad has the same lines of communication with Hamas' external leadership as Sinwar did, or whether the various groups holding hostages would listen to him, viewing the hostages as their own 'property.' On the other hand, Yahya Sinwar’s death could potentially work in favor of the hostages if their captors realize that their fate could mirror Sinwar’s unless they reach a deal with Israel. The Gaza question Sinwar’s killing has raised questions about how it will impact the achievement of Israel's war objectives and whether it will hasten the end of the war under conditions that ensure security for southern Israel. Sinwar’s death is expected to deliver a major blow to Hamas’ morale and, in the medium term, significantly reduce the terrorist group’s motivation to continue fighting. Sinwar was seen as a mythic Islamic figure, and the loss of such a leader often dampens the resolve of his followers. Historical precedent suggests that the elimination of charismatic figures has long-term effects. For example, PIJ struggled for a decade following the assassination of its leader Fathi Shaqaqi in Malta in the 1990s, carrying out few attacks during that time. Similarly, the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Iraq led to a retreat of ISIS terrorists from many areas they had controlled. Sinwar’s removal could also embolden many displaced Gazans, now living in dire conditions along the coast in al-Mawasi, to rise up against Hamas, which has diverted humanitarian aid to fund its operations. Both the reaction of Gaza’s population and Hamas terrorists' motivation will depend on who succeeds Sinwar. His brother, Mohammed Sinwar, known like his sibling as 'Abu Ibrahim' after their father, is feared and brutal but lacks his brother’s charisma. Though he was once mentioned as a possible successor to Mohammed Deif after he was killed alongside the Khan Younis brigade commander, Mohammed Sinwar lacks the public authority of other potential leaders, such as Haddad. It is unclear if either of them will be able to assert their authority over Gaza in a way that allows Hamas to maintain its civilian control over large parts of it. If Sinwar’s successor cannot impose order in Gaza or manage humanitarian aid distribution, the Palestinian enclave could descend into chaos, resembling the 'Somalization' of Gaza, where power falls to whoever can assert the most force. Such a scenario would pose a challenge to Israel and a threat to IDF forces, but it might also present an opportunity for Israel to step in, fill the power vacuum and dismantle Hamas’ control in Gaza once and for all. Iranian influence Sinwar was only recently appointed head of Hamas’ political bureau following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. His death leaves behind a critical question: Will Hamas maintain its close relationship with Iran’s mullahs in his absence? During the Syrian Civil War, tensions ran high between Hamas, a Sunni Islamist group, and the Shiite leadership in Tehran, as well as Syria’s Alawite leader, Bashar al-Assad, who is aligned with Shiite Islam. Hamas was expelled from Damascus, where Khaled Mashal led the political bureau, after refusing to support Assad, who had provided refuge to Hamas’ leadership. One of the top contenders to succeed Sinwar as political bureau chief is again Khaled Mashal, currently in Doha. Mashal has long opposed deepening ties with Iran, which could signal a shift in Hamas’ alliances, potentially distancing the group from Tehran and its so-called 'Axis of Resistance.' If Mashal reclaims the leadership role, Hamas may no longer align as closely with Iran’s network of proxies. The uncertainty over Hamas’ leadership could also influence Israeli decision-making regarding potential retaliatory strikes on Iran. While theoretical chances of renewed negotiations might delay action, Israeli officials believe that waiting too long could undermine the legitimacy of a strike, as international attention may quickly fade from Iran’s October 1 missile attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the defense establishment argue that momentum should be seized and suggest that Sinwar’s elimination could actually accelerate plans for a strike. Meanwhile, speculation grows over who might be the next target—perhaps Iran’s Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami or even Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei himself. The Palestinian Authority Negotiations are currently underway between the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Hamas' overseas leadership to explore the possibility of establishing civilian governance in Gaza, as an alternative to Hamas' rule. Sinwar’s vision had been for the PA, under Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, to return to Gaza after being ousted by Hamas in the 2007 coup. Under this arrangement, the PA would manage civilian affairs such as health, education and infrastructure, while Hamas would focus on rebuilding its military power to prepare for future attacks against Israel. If Hamas now fully relinquishes its armed control over Gaza, it could present a significant dilemma for the Israeli government. Netanyahu, along with key political allies like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, are ideologically opposed to PA control in Gaza, fearing it could lead to the establishment of a unified Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Much depends on whether Hamas can appoint a new leader to replace Sinwar, and who that leader will be. Only after this is clear can realistic predictions be made about the future. For now, the news of Sinwar’s death is tempered by concerns for the fate of Israeli hostages and uncertainty over how, if at all, his death will impact the course of the war in Gaza.

Regional states signal increased involvement in post-war Gaza fol...	Foreign leaders note increased willingness to engage in Gaza’s rehabilitation and establishing alternative authority to Hamas; IDF confirms Sinwar tried fleeing north; Biden, Netanyahu agree Sinwar’s killing presents opportunity to advance hostage talks Israel received messages Thursday from several regional countries expressing a stronger interest and motivation to be involved in the post-war governance of Gaza following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar’s elimination, seen as a major obstacle, could affect not only hostage negotiations but also future plans for Gaza’s reconstruction and governance. Throughout Thursday, Israeli officials held talks with foreign leaders, including those in the Middle East, noting increased willingness to engage in Gaza’s rehabilitation and in establishing an alternative authority to Hamas. Various Middle Eastern countries have been linked to discussions about Gaza’s future. In May, The New York Times reported that senior aides to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explored a post-war plan involving shared control of Gaza with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the U.S., in exchange for normalization with Saudi Arabia. However, in September, UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed cast doubt on the plan, saying his country would not support post-war efforts in Gaza without the establishment of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, Israeli officials believe Hamas' overseas leadership has now become the central player in the hostage negotiations, making the pressure from mediators more effective after Sinwar’s death. The U.S. views Sinwar’s killing as an opportunity to expedite the war’s conclusion and facilitate a hostage deal. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the matter with his Qatari counterpart. One of the key questions following Sinwar's death is what will be done with his body. Israel has yet to make a decision, but officials familiar with the matter suggested that if required during hostage negotiations, Israel would be willing to return Sinwar’s body as part of a deal. Israeli officials speculated that Sinwar may have been planning to flee to Egypt, pointing to forged passports found at the location where he was killed. There had been significant concern in Israel over the possibility of Sinwar being on the run and disconnected from his organization. However, in a statement, the IDF confirmed that Sinwar had been 'in flight and trying to escape north.' In a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, it was revealed that U.S. President Joe Biden called Netanyahu from Air Force One to congratulate him on the successful operation. Biden reportedly praised the IDF's efforts, and the two leaders agreed on the importance of seizing this opportunity to secure the release of the hostages, committing to work together toward that goal.

IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari confirmed Thursday night that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in Tel Sultan by IDF soldiers the day before. 'For months, the IDF and Shin Bet gathered intelligence to eliminate Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre. He was hiding in the area, and we didn’t know he was there. We identified Sinwar as a terrorist inside a building, found him with a vest, a pistol and 40,000 shekels. He was on the run, and we eliminated him. No hostages were with him.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syn00wxkl1l	2024-10-17T13:23:37-07:00

The only deal on the table is Hamas’ full surrender, the release of hostages and the exile of the remaining terrorists,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byqiygyg1x	2024-10-17T13:13:04-07:00	
Biden heads to Germany for talks on Ukraine, Middle East	U.S. President Joe Biden took off for Berlin on Thursday for a short visit to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine with the leaders of Germany, France and Britain as Kyiv urges its Western allies to take immediate action to end the fighting. The conflict in the Middle East is also expected to be high on the agenda in talks between the leaders, as the Biden administration hopes Israel's killing of Hamas official Yahya Sinwar could bring a ceasefire in Gaza closer to fruition. Biden had originally been scheduled to convene a broader meeting of Ukraine's military supporters at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany last week during a planned three-day state visit to the country that would have been the first in nearly 40 years. He canceled that trip to focus on dealing with Hurricane Milton but is making up for it with the quick visit this week. The Ramstein meeting will be held virtually in November, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. The president now will land late on Thursday in Berlin and hold bilateral talks on Friday morning with Germany's president and chancellor, before a planned meeting with the leaders of Germany, France and Britain.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1y1keyeje	2024-10-17T13:09:59-07:00	
US to kickstart Gaza cease-fire talks after Sinwar's death, State...	The United States wants to kickstart talks on a proposal to achieve a cease-fire and the release of hostages in Gaza, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Thursday, after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, which he called a 'seismic event.' Miller told a regular press briefing that Sinwar had been the 'chief obstacle' to reaching an end to the war, which began when Sinwar orchestrated an attack on southern Israel in which Palestinian terrorists killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. The Biden administration has worked unsuccessfully for months with mediators Qatar and Egypt to try to reach a deal that would see Israel cease operations in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas in the attack just over a year ago. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said. 'That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can't predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a cease-fire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,' he said. Washington would now 'redouble' its efforts and try to push forward the cease-fire proposal 'that has been on the table for some time,' Miller said, without detailing the proposal.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1t00ry1ekl	2024-10-17T13:08:41-07:00

Sinwar’s desperate last moments: Tried to down drone with stick b...	IDF forces identify 3 terrorists in Rafah, opening fire as Hamas leader flees to nearby building and hides on second floor; his body found during sweeps day after; Bislach soldier severely wounded in incident WARNING: This article contains graphic images. The encounter that led to the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Wednesday was part of the IDF’s ongoing efforts to locate and destroy tunnels in Rafah. Sinwar was killed after the building he was in collapsed on top of him, as well as shrapnel from two types of munitions: a Merkava Mark 4 tank shell fired by the 460th Brigade and a Matador missile made by Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The incident began around 10 a.m. when a 450th Battalion soldier spotted a suspicious figure entering and exiting a building, alerting his commander, who ordered fire in response. At 3 p.m., IDF forces, using a drone, identified three figures leaving the building, attempting to move from house to house. Two figures were covered with blankets, walking ahead of Sinwar to clear the way. The 450th Battalion commander opened fire on the group, causing them to scatter. Two terrorists fled into one building, and Sinwar into another. Sinwar moved to the second floor of the building, and the IDF responded by firing a tank shell at it. As the IDF Infantry Commanders School (Bislach) unit began to sweep the building, two grenades were thrown at them—one exploded, the other did not. The troops pulled back and sent a drone, which detected an injured figure, face covered, sitting in a room and attempting to knock the drone out of the air with a stick. The next sweep of the building occurred at dawn, when troops discovered a body with recognizable features, leading to the identification process, which was completed in the evening. 'We knew Sinwar’s estimated location for a while despite the high level of secrecy Hamas maintained around him,' said an IDF official. 'We knew he had been in Rafah, and we focused on uncovering the underground infrastructure there to find him.' The IDF also revealed that 'a few weeks ago, in a similar underground operation, we discovered a room with evidence suggesting Sinwar had been in the same complex. Even yesterday, we weren’t sure if Sinwar had escaped to Khan Younis. This is a significant achievement that should translate into a strategic one.' The IDF is still investigating the identity of the two terrorists who were with Sinwar, and it remains unclear whether one was a Hamas battalion commander. 'Hamas continued operating even when Sinwar was out of contact,' the army official noted. 'There are other senior figures within Hamas, and they have a structured chain of command. There’s Hamas abroad, and Sinwar's brother, Mohammed.' The Bislach commander who led the sweep and identified Sinwar was wounded at the beginning of the war when he joined the fight at the Gaza border, losing soldiers in the same battle. During Wednesday's encounter that led to Sinwar’s death, a soldier from the 450th Battalion was severely injured by gunfire from the two terrorists who escaped into a nearby building. The wounded soldier, a resident of a Druze village in northern Israel, was evacuated to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva, where he is currently in intensive care. His condition is stable, with a gunshot wound to his upper body. His father said the soldier's commanders had briefed the family on the events. 'My son was the first to engage, and they attacked him. He was later struck by a bullet. He’s not speaking yet but communicates with us using his hands,' he said. The soldier's uncle called him 'a hero of Israel' and said, 'For a year they hunted Sinwar, and now they’ve got him.' Earlier Thursday, the IDF officially confirmed Sinwar’s killing in Rafah’s Tel Sultan neighborhood. 'The leader of the Hamas terrorist organization, responsible for the October 7 massacre, has been eliminated,' a statement read. 'Sinwar orchestrated and executed the deadly attack and promoted his murderous ideology throughout the war and beforehand, making him responsible for the murder and abduction of many Israelis.' The IDF and Shin Bet highlighted that 'Sinwar was killed after a year of hiding within Gaza’s civilian population, both above ground and in Hamas tunnels. The dozens of operations carried out by the IDF and Shin Bet over the past year, and particularly in recent weeks, restricted Sinwar’s movement and led to his elimination.' In a recorded statement following Sinwar’s killing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, 'The man responsible for the worst massacre in our people's history since the Holocaust has been killed. We have settled the score with him. Evil has taken a hard blow, but our mission is not yet complete.' Addressing Gaza’s residents and the terrorists holding hostages, he added, 'Sinwar destroyed your lives. He told you he was a lion, but in reality, he hid in a dark den—and he was killed while fleeing in panic from our soldiers. His elimination marks an important milestone in the downfall of Hamas' reign of evil.'

Cash, UNRWA ID, weapons—and Mentos: The items found on Sinwar’s b...	IDF forces discover large sums of cash, identification documents and numerous weapons alongside bodies of slain Hamas leader and senior terrorists killed with him during Rafah operation Large amounts of cash, an UNRWA ID card and various weapons were discovered alongside the bodies of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and senior terrorists killed with him in Rafah’s Tel Sultan neighborhood, the IDF confirmed Thursday. Also found at the scene were Mentos candies. The IDF officially confirmed Sinwar’s killing after his body was identified. In the statement, the IDF said, 'Sinwar orchestrated the October 7 massacre and promoted his murderous ideology both before and during the war, making him responsible for the murder and abduction of many Israelis.' According to the IDF and Shin Bet, Sinwar had been hiding for a year among Gaza’s civilian population, both above ground and in Hamas tunnels. Numerous operations by the IDF and Shin Bet over the past year, particularly in the weeks leading up to his death, restricted his movements and eventually led to his elimination. Unlike other high-profile assassinations during Operation Iron Swords, such as those of Mohammed Deif and Hassan Nasrallah, Sinwar’s killing resulted from an unplanned encounter. Soldiers from the Infantry Commanders and Combat Training School (Bislach), conducting a counterterrorism sweep, identified and killed three terrorists in a booby-trapped building, unaware that one of them was Sinwar. Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai reported that Shin Bet had insisted the IDF continue operations in Tel Sultan, suspecting Hamas leaders might be present, sometimes even above ground. An earlier airstrike had targeted a tunnel in the area where the IDF believed Sinwar was hiding, but he was not found there. The bodies of the terrorists were first examined using drones due to the presence of explosives. One body resembled Sinwar, leading soldiers to suspect they had killed the Hamas leader by chance. To confirm Sinwar’s identity, soldiers took photographs of the body, which were sent to the police forensic unit. As first reported by Ynet, Sinwar’s identity was confirmed through dental records, with fingerprint analysis later corroborating the identification. Another key indicator of Sinwar’s presence was the identity of one of the terrorists killed alongside him, who was known to be close to the Hamas leader. According to reports from Gaza, the two other terrorists killed were Sinwar’s bodyguards, one of whom was also a teacher for UNRWA, while the other was a senior official in Hamas' National Security Office. It was later reported that one of the terrorists might have been Muhammad Shabana, the commander of Hamas' Rafah Brigade.

Trump blames Ukraine's Zelensky for starting war with Russia	Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump on Thursday blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for helping start that nation's war with Russia, a comment that further suggests Trump is likely to radically shift U.S. policy toward Ukraine if he wins the Nov. 5 election. The former president has frequently criticized Zelensky on the campaign trail, repeatedly calling him 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for having solicited and received billions of dollars of U.S. military aid since the war broke out in 2022. Trump has also slammed the Ukrainian leader for failing to seek peace with Moscow, and he has suggested Ukraine may have to cede some of its land to Russia to make a peace deal, a concession Kyiv considers unacceptable. Trump's comments on the PBD Podcast on Thursday with Patrick Bet-David went a step further than his previous criticism. He said Zelensky was to blame not just for failing to end the war, but for helping start it, even though the conflict broke out when Russia invaded Ukrainian sovereign territory. 'That doesn't mean I don't want to help him because I feel very badly for those people. But he should never have let that war start. The war's a loser,' Trump said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r10we1jx1g	2024-10-17T12:09:15-07:00

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday called Israel's killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar a step of progress toward eliminating the threat Hamas poses to Israel after Jerusalem confirmed it had killed the terrorist group's leader. 'Justice has been served,' Harris told reporters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 'Sinwar was responsible for the killing of thousands of innocent people, including the victims of October 7 and hostages killed in Gaza.' 'This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,' Harris said.

IDF names 5 Golani commandos killed in fierce battle in southern ...	Maj. Ofek Bachar, Capt. Elad Siman Tov, Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder, Staff Sgt. Yakov Hillel and Staff Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom, all of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, reportedly ambushed by terrorists while sweeping building for terror infrastructure Five elite Golani Brigade soldiers were killed on Wednesday during an intense firefight in a southern Lebanese village near the Israeli border, the IDF reported on Thursday. Among the fallen, all of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, were Maj. Ofek Bachar, 24, a company commander, from Nes Ziona; Capt. Elad Siman Tov, 23, a platoon commander, from Tzofim; Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder, 22, a squad commander, from Jerusalem; Staff Sgt. Yaakov Hillel, 21, from Jerusalem; and Staff Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom, 21, from Hebron. According to an initial IDF probe, the Golani Reconnaissance Unit entered a multi-story building in a Lebanese village near the western sector of the border at around 5 p.m. The mission was based on intelligence reports indicating the presence of terrorist infrastructure. As the unit approached, the building came under aerial fire. Roughly 30 minutes into the search, during which the soldiers discovered several weapons caches and underground positions, gunfire erupted from a stairwell. Four Hezbollah terrorists, who had concealed themselves in the building, opened fire at close range. The ensuing firefight resulted in the deaths of the five soldiers, including the company commander. The Golani troops returned fire, killing the terrorists. Three soldiers were pronounced dead at the scene, while two others later succumbed to their injuries at the hospital. Five additional soldiers were wounded, including the company's deputy commander, with three sustaining serious injuries. Air support provided cover fire, allowing medevac helicopters to extract the casualties to a hospital in Israel within an hour. The IDF is now investigating how the Hezbollah terrorists evaded detection during the building sweep, despite the soldiers' professional conduct. Golani Brigade forces have been operating in southern Lebanon for two weeks, initially in the village of Maroun al-Ras before expanding to other areas to neutralize Hezbollah's Radwan forces, which pose an invasion threat to northern Israel. The troops have uncovered and destroyed advanced Hezbollah weaponry near the border and killed more than 10 Hezbollah militants in recent days. In separate incidents, a soldier from the Golani Brigade's 12th Battalion and a reservist officer from the 6th Brigade's 8173rd Battalion were seriously wounded in fighting in southern Lebanon. Two additional reservists from the 8173rd Battalion were also wounded.

Netanyahu: Sinwar's killing marks 'beginning of day after Hamas'	In video statement, PM calls Hamas leader's death turning point in war and urges Gaza residents to release hostages or face consequences, declaring collapse of Hamas rule imminent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday evening called the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar a pivotal moment in the ongoing war and the 'beginning of the day after Hamas.' 'Sinwar ruined your lives,' he said in a video statement, addressing Gaza’s residents. 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. This is the beginning of the day after Hamas. 'The mastermind behind the worst massacre of our people since the Holocaust, a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands of Israelis and the abduction of hundreds, has been eliminated by our heroic soldiers.' He reassured the families of the hostages, saying, 'This is an important moment in the war. We will continue with all our strength until your loved ones, who are also our loved ones, are brought home. This is our highest commitment.' Netanyahu called on Gaza’s residents to release the hostages. 'Sinwar’s elimination marks a significant milestone in the collapse of Hamas’ rule,' he said. 'To the terrorists, I say: Your leaders are fleeing, and they will be eliminated. I call on anyone holding our hostages—lay down your weapons and return them, and you will be allowed to leave and live. But if you harm our hostages, you will be held accountable, and your fate will be sealed.' Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, speaking at the Gaza border, also called on Gaza residents to surrender. 'Sinwar ended his life beaten, hunted and fleeing, not as a commander but as someone who only cared for himself,' he said. 'This is a clear message to the families of the fallen and the hostages, as well as to Gaza residents: the man who brought disaster upon you is gone. Now is the time to release the hostages and surrender. Israel has closed a long-standing account with Sinwar—a vile murderer who planned and executed the October 7 massacre.' President Isaac Herzog commended the IDF, Shin Bet and security forces for the killing of Sinwar. 'Sinwar, the mastermind behind the deadly October 7 attack, has for years been responsible for heinous acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians, citizens of other countries, and the murder of thousands of innocent people. His evil endeavors were dedicated to terror, bloodshed, and destabilizing the Middle East,' he said in a statement. 'Now, more than ever, we must act in every way possible to bring back the 101 hostages who are still being held in horrific conditions by Hamas terrorists in Gaza.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar visited the site in Gaza where Sinwar was killed, accompanied by Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, Operations Directorate head Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk and Gaza Division commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. Halevi praised the soldiers, saying, 'Your professionalism and determination led to this—one year later [after the October 7 massacre], we have settled the score with Sinwar.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also praised the IDF for the killing of Sinwar, saying, 'Congratulations to the IDF and the entire nation of Israel for eliminating the mass murderer. Now the IDF must ensure that every resident in Gaza knows Sinwar is dead, while intensifying military pressure and offering safe passage and financial incentives to those who return the hostages and lay down their arms.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called it a 'historic elimination in Rafah' and urged the continuation of the offensive 'until total victory.'

IDF confirms Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in Gaza operation	Military and Shin Bet confirm arch-terrorist killed on Wednesday in clash with Israeli forces in southern Gaza where operations intensified based on intelligence pinpointing whereabouts of senior Hamas leaders The IDF and Shin Bet confirmed Thursday that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in an operation in southern Gaza the day before after a year-long manhunt. Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre and responsible for the abduction and murder of numerous Israelis, was eliminated by IDF soldiers from the Southern Command. According to a statement, Sinwar had evaded capture for the past year, hiding among Gaza's civilian population and within Hamas’ underground tunnel network. His operational movement was increasingly restricted by a series of IDF and Shin Bet operations, leading to his eventual elimination. In recent weeks, IDF and Shin Bet forces, under Southern Command, intensified operations in southern Gaza based on intelligence pinpointing the whereabouts of senior Hamas leaders. Soldiers from the IDF’s 828th Brigade encountered and killed three terrorists during the operation. After identifying the body, officials confirmed that one of the terrorists was Yahya Sinwar.

Israeli shekel surges on reports of Sinwar's death	Reports of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing led to an immediate strengthening of the Israeli shekel against foreign currencies on Thursday evening. Two days after a negative inflation report reduced the likelihood of the Bank of Israel raising interest rates, the shekel gained strength without any rate hike. The dollar dropped by nearly 0.75% in after-hours trading, settling at around 3.73 shekels compared to the earlier official exchange rate of 3.7630 set before the Sukkot holiday, which had seen a 0.4% increase. Against the euro, the shekel strengthened even further, rising by approximately 1.4% to trade at around 4.03 shekels, compared to the official rate of 4.0956 shekels set before the holiday, which had seen a 0.2% increase. The shekel's rise follows news that IDF forces killed three terrorists in Gaza during a surprise encounter, including Sinwar, the leader of Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gzj6rk1e	2024-10-17T09:45:28-07:00

Hamas leader reportedly hid in same tunnel as hostages Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov before they were killed by captors in August; IDF investigating whether hostages murdered during Sinwar’s escape Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was likely killed in an IDF raid Thursday, had been in a Rafah tunnel with six Israeli hostages—Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov—who were executed by their captors in late August. Israeli authorities have evidence placing Sinwar in the tunnel where the hostages were held, though it remains unclear when he left. The IDF is investigating whether the hostages were killed during his escape. The bodies of the six hostages were discovered with gunshot wounds to the head and other parts of their bodies, with signs of mistreatment. Some bore indications of prior injuries from their initial capture that had been treated. One of the hostages showed signs of being tied up, and the condition of the bodies suggested they had been neglected for an extended period. Sinwar's death came during a surprise encounter in Gaza, where IDF soldiers killed three terrorists, initially unaware that one of them was Sinwar. His identity was later confirmed, and his body is being transported to Israel. Michal Lobanov, the widow of Alex Lobanov, reacted to the news on Instagram, writing: 'Keeping such a huge secret inside, knowing he surrounded himself with you, our angels—he chose you, he killed you, he destroyed our lives. My love, now my circle is complete. Nothing will ease the pain, but now you can celebrate up there. Celebrate, it's over. But please, let the hostages come home. This victory isn’t sweet without them.' Gil Dikman, cousin of Carmel Gat, added: 'The account isn’t settled until the last hostage is returned.'

Sinwar’s body identified by dental records: Meet the soldiers who...	Without prior intelligence, IDF Bislah troops encounter and kill 3 terrorists during counterterrorism operation, later realizing they may have eliminated Hamas leader and October 7 massacre mastermind WARNING: This article contains graphic images. The soldiers responsible for what is likely one of the most significant Israeli military achievements in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war are from the IDF's Infantry Commanders and Combat Training School, commonly known by its Hebrew acronym Bislah. While clearing a terrorist stronghold, the troops identified and eliminated three terrorists in a booby-trapped building, which had previously been partially demolished by the IDF. IDF forces discovered large amounts of Israeli cash and identifying documents on the terrorists' bodies. Due to the presence of explosives and grenades, drones were initially used to examine the bodies. One of the terrorists bore a strong resemblance to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, leading troops to believe they may have killed him unintentionally, without prior intelligence. The exact location of the raid remains undisclosed for security reasons. To confirm Sinwar’s identity, soldiers photographed the body and sent the images to the Israeli police’s forensic unit. Assistant Commissioner Aliza Raziel, head of the unit, confirmed that the teeth in the photos matched Sinwar's dental records from his time in Israeli custody. 'We had Sinwar’s dental data on file, and the match was clear,' Raziel said. 'This was one of the most significant moments this year, allowing us to quickly provide critical information to the field.' Further evidence suggesting Sinwar’s death included the presence of a senior Hamas commander known to frequently accompany him. Reports from Gaza indicated the other two terrorists killed were Sinwar’s bodyguards, one of whom worked as a teacher for UNRWA and the other a high-ranking official in Hamas’ National Security Office. The IDF confirmed the killing of three terrorists and is investigating whether one was Sinwar. The military clarified that, despite rumors, the terrorists’ identities have not yet been officially verified and that no hostages were found at the site. Senior Israeli officials later said that the chances Sinwar was killed were 'very high.' A spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that families of the hostages had been informed that no hostages were present at the scene. 'Sinwar was likely killed, and Israel remains committed to pursuing all those responsible for the October 7 attacks,' a senior official added. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant posted a brief message on X (formerly Twitter), quoting the Bible: ''You will chase your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.' Leviticus 26:7.' The post was accompanied by images of senior terrorist leaders Mohammed Deif and Hassan Nasrallah marked with an X, and another image of an X on a black background—an apparent reference to the potential killing of Sinwar.

Reports of Sinwar’s death cause confusion in Arab media	Despite no official confirmation, Arab media outlets quick to declare Hamas leader dead; terror group yet to respond to reports; while some Palestinians celebrate online, others remark he likely died above ground, not in tunnels Reports of the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Tuesday have left Arab media in confusion. While speculation grows that Sinwar was killed, Israeli officials have yet to confirm it officially. However, some Arab outlets, citing unnamed sources, quickly published claims that Sinwar had been killed, with several relying on photos from the scene. Hamas has so far declined to comment or confirm whether Sinwar was among those killed. Social media users in Gaza and across the Arab world reacted with skepticism to the reports, especially those from Israeli media. Some expressed hope the identification was wrong, with one post reading, 'God, let it not be him, may he remain a thorn in the filthy occupier's throat.' Others admitted that the resemblance between Sinwar and the body in the circulated images was undeniable, saying, 'It seems to be him.' On Arab social networks, some praised Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre, for reportedly dying in battle rather than hiding in tunnels. 'Sinwar became a martyr in combat, not in a tunnel,' one post read. Arab media outlets primarily echoed Israeli reports, with Asharq Al-Awsat noting that the Israeli military was investigating whether Sinwar had been killed by chance, while Sky News Arabia went further, reporting, 'A source confirmed to Sky News Arabia that Sinwar was killed in a clash with Israeli forces in Rafah.'

Yahya Sinwar: The end of the October 7 massacre mastermind	Sentenced to hundreds of years for murdering Palestinians, he spent 22 years in Israeli prison, where he had brain surgery; released in the 2011 Shalit deal, he quickly rose through Hamas' ranks; Now, Israel believes the arch-terrorist is likely dead For 22 years, Yahya Sinwar was imprisoned in Israel, where he underwent a life-saving surgery. Released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange deal, Sinwar quickly rose through Hamas' ranks in Gaza. In 2017, he was elected to lead Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and just months ago, he was appointed head of the terrorist group's political bureau. Now, Israeli military and intelligence forces are investigating whether Sinwar—the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre—was killed during an IDF operation in Gaza. Israeli officials estimate the likelihood of his death as 'very high.' Born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in October 1962, the same camp as senior Hamas commander Mohammed Deif, Sinwar co-founded Hamas' internal security wing, Majd, responsible for identifying Palestinian collaborators with Israel. As a 'successful' hunter of collaborators, Sinwar personally executed over 10 Palestinians suspected of working with Israeli authorities. It was these murders, rather than the killing of Israelis, that led to his arrest and 1989 sentencing to five life terms in prison—earning him the nickname 'The Butcher of Khan Younis.' In 1987, Sinwar received a tip that a man named Rasmi Salim had 'abandoned Islam.' He sought permission from Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to kill Salim, then tracked him with other operatives, kidnapping him at knifepoint. Under violent interrogation by Sinwar, Salim allegedly confessed to collaborating with Israel and acting against Islamic principles, after which Sinwar and his associates executed him. In 2008, while in Israeli prison, Sinwar underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor. He was released in 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit exchange, and upon returning to Gaza, his rapid rise to power began. In a speech following his release, Sinwar called on Hamas’ military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, to continue kidnapping Israeli soldiers to secure the release of more Palestinian prisoners. 'The release of prisoners will only be achieved through the kidnapping of Jews and swapping them,' he said, predicting that such exchanges were much closer than expected. Sinwar quickly consolidated power in Gaza, gaining support and becoming Hamas' most powerful figure in 2017, eclipsing Ismail Haniyeh. Under his leadership, Hamas in Gaza overtook Hamas' external leadership, shifting the center of power within the organization. Earlier this year, following Haniyeh’s assassination in late July, Sinwar was elected head of the entire Hamas movement. In 2018, Sinwar gave a rare interview with Italian journalist Francesca Borri, saying, 'War is not in anyone’s interest, certainly not ours. Who wants to confront a nuclear power with slingshots? War achieves nothing,' while adding, 'I won’t say I won’t fight again, but I don’t want more wars. I want the siege to end. My first commitment is to my people—to defend them and their right to freedom and independence.' Sinwar is also believed to have orchestrated the deadly October 7 terror attacks. Earlier this month, it was revealed that for over two years, he convened senior Hamas officials in a special 'military council' where they meticulously planned the attack. The New York Times reported that the protocols of these meetings, which were captured by the IDF in a tunnel Sinwar had used to escape, detailed Hamas’ preparations and deception campaign aimed at misleading Israel about its intentions. Since the attack, Israeli forces have been hunting Sinwar. In February, IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed footage of Sinwar, uncovered by Israeli ground forces in Gaza, showing him three days into the war alongside his brother Ibrahim, one of his wives and children. Presenting the video, Hagari said, 'This footage is a result of our pursuit of Sinwar. The manhunt will not stop until we capture him, dead or alive. We are determined to get him.' Sinwar’s younger brother, Mohammed, 48, founded Hamas’ security apparatus and was behind the 2006 kidnapping of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. During Shalit’s captivity, Mohammed reportedly swore to his associates in Khan Younis, 'If I don’t bring Yahya back to our mother, there will be no deal.' Mohammed Sinwar remains one of Hamas’ top officials in Gaza today.

Western diplomats warn against prolonged Lebanon war	Envoys say UNIFIL mandate in the 2006 UN resolution must be amended and ask Israelis not to give Hezbollah an excuse to remain a major player in Lebanon by occupying territory there; say many hope to see the back of the terror group Western diplomats voiced concerns that the fighting in Lebanon could turn into a prolonged war. They expressed distrust of Israel's claims that the offensive in South Lebanon was a limited one, which could explain the fierce opposition of UNIFIL to remove its forces from the fighting. The diplomats agreed that the peacekeepers' mandate was insufficient and said it would have to be amended in a future agreement. They said that despite the severe blow inflicted on Hezbollah recently, the terror group has a leadership that can make decisions. 'There is an understanding in the international community of the severity of the threat from Hezbollah. There must clearly be a different solution in South Lebanon and the situation cannot return to what it was. The West must examine how it can contribute to negotiations.' The diplomats said many in Lebanon would be happy to see the last of Hezbollah but an Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory would only justify Hezbollah's position to act. 'Don't give them excuses,' they said. 'Israel needs a system to enforce a new deal, that includes boots on the ground,' they said adding that Israel is wrong not to be in dialogue with allies and cannot achieve all of its goals in Lebanon. 'Israel had successes and must use them as leverage to reach an agreement.'

Netanyahu says France should stand by Israel in fight for joint v...	PM says Israel and France should work together to return stability to Lebanon, asks how many Hezbollah missiles UNIFIL managed to prevent and slams Macron for distorting history Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said France should change its position and stand by Israel so that the two countries can work together to bring stability back to Lebanon. Netanyahu spoke with the French daily Le Figaro after French President Emmanuel Macron criticized the Israeli leader in a closed government meeting, saying that Israel was created by a UN decision and thus cannot disregard UN resolutions. In response, Netanyahu's office issued a statement criticizing Macron's remarks and evoking the French government's collaboration with the Nazis occupation during World War II. Netanyahu told Le Figaro that Israel does not receive weapons from France and expects its nearing allies to support its fight against the terror of Iran and its proxies. He said the fight against Hamas, Hezbollah and the Iranian regime is a fight for the values Israel and Europeans share. The prime minister also said Macron had distorted history in his remarks and said the United Nation's recognition of the right of the Jewish people to a homeland did not create the state of Israel. 'The Jewish people were connected to the land of Israel for 3,500 years and the state was established by those who fought for its independence including Holocaust survivors. He repeated his position that Israel must maintain security control from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu also said Israel was not opposed to the presence of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon but claimed Hezbollah used the peacekeepers' positions to for protection as they launched missiles against Israel and had dug underground tunnels and fortifications where large amounts of the newest Russian-made weapons were stored. He told the French publication that since the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon war, and the security council's vote to pass resolution 1701, it was not enforced at all. 'How many Hezbollah missiles had UNIFIL prevented? Zero,' he said. Netanyahu told Le Figaro that a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia was possible and could come earlier than expected.

German warship shoots down drone off Lebanon	corvette Ludwigshafen am Rhein deployed with UNIFIL peacekeepers; German defense ministry says drone parts being taken out of the sea for inspection A German warship operating as part of the UNIFIL peacekeepers mission on Thursday shot down a drone off the coast of Lebanon, the Defense Ministry in Berlin said. 'The corvette brought an unidentified unmanned aerial vehicle into the water in a controlled crash,' the spokesperson said, reporting no damage to the German vessel or its crew. 'The corvette Ludwigshafen am Rhein is continuing its duties,' he added. Germany's DPA news agency reported the incident and said the ship's defense systems shot down the unidentified unmanned aircraft. This was the first time the corvette was involved in a military incident in years and also the first reported incident of a drone being shot down by anyone other than the IDF. According to the report, the drone was shot down northeast of the Lebanese border town of Al Naqoura, at some distance from the shore, and at a close proximity to the German ship. Parts of the drone were retrieved from the sea and were being examined. There are 60 German crew members and additional soldiers onboard the vessel. The incident comes as Israel faces international outrage after incidents of shots fired by the IDF at peacekeepers in South Lebanon. Israel denied targeting the UNIFIL troops and said it repeatedly asked the forces to withdraw from the area where fighting against Hezbollah was underway, to avoid harm. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah was using UNIFIL positions as cover for their attacks against Israel. Italy's defense minister said on Thursday that the U.N. peacekeeping mission to Lebanon is vital to ending the war in the region and needs to be strengthened and not withdrawn from combat zones as Israel has demanded. 'Israel needs to understand that these (U.N.) soldiers are not working for any one side. They are there to help maintain peace and promote regional stability,' Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told parliament on Thursday. He said the resolution establishing the UNIFIL mandate was last revised in 2006 and needed updating. 'UNIFIL is a complex mission with a mandate that is difficult to implement, has inadequate rules of engagement and forces that are not equipped for the current conflict,' he said. Crosetto has called on the United Nations to update its operational capacity, including creating a rapid deployment force to enhance UNIFIL's freedom of movement and give them more firepower. 'The practical disconnect between the assigned mission and the capacity to implement it makes it more necessary than ever to rethink and strengthen UNIFIL,' Crosetto said. Italian President Giorgia Meloni was due to visit Beirut on Friday.

Iranian Foreign Minister visits Cairo a day after Egypt's intelli...	Arqchi reportedly prepares visit to Egypt of Iranian president; officials in Jerusalem concerned after long-serving Abbas Kamal leaves mediator role during crisis in Israel-Egypt relations Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi arrived in Cairo on Thursday to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his counterpart Badr Abdelatty. This was the first official visit to Egypt by a senior Iranian minister in a decade. The president's palace said the meeting focused on regional developments, with al-Sisi reiterating Egypt's call to avoid the expansion of conflict and the need to halt escalation to prevent a full-scale regional war. 'Araqchi emphasized the importance of continuing efforts to explore prospects for mutual development of relations between the two countries,' the statement added. Araqchi arrived for 'important talks with Egypt's high-ranking officials that will be held tomorrow,' Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said in a post on X on Wednesday, after stops in countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq and Lebanon. The Qatari Al Araby al Jadeed reported that the minister was preparing a visit by Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian. Relations between Egypt and Iran have generally been fraught in recent decades but the two countries have stepped up high-level diplomatic contacts since the eruption of the Gaza crisis last year as Egypt tried to play a mediating role. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty traveled to Tehran in July to attend the country's presidential inauguration. The visit comes just one day after the announcement in Cairo that al Sisi decided to replace his long-time Intelligence chief Abbas Kamel who was an active participant in the mediation efforts to secure a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. Israeli officials said they were concerned about the move. Kamel who has been head General Intelligence agency since 2018, was a well-known and respected figure in Jerusalem who had strong ties to Israeli and American security officials. Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar met Kamel in Cairo earlier in the week. Kamel who had recently asked to delegate some of his heavy workload after suffering health problems, according to reports, will be appointed an advisor to the president and is to be replaced by Major General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad who had previously been his deputy. Rashad is not known in Israel and he is stepping into his new role at a time when Israeli-Egyptian relations are in crisis over the war in Gaza and the Israeli insistence to control the Gaza-Egypt border and the Philadelphi Corridor that runs along it. Negotiations to bring a cease-fire in the Gaza war have also stalled and according to the Qatari prime minister, there has been no discussion with the parties to the conflict in over three weeks. 'Basically in the last three to four weeks, there is no conversation or engagement at all, and we are just moving in the same circle with the silence from all parties,' Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday.

How Israel-Norway relations crashed| 'Since the Oslo Accords, we'...	From strong affinity and alliance, Norway's positions shift to support of Hamas, an arms embargo and international arrest warrants for Israeli leaders although some in the Jewish community insist government positions differ from public sentiments It wasn’t always this way. The collapse of Israel-Norway relations - as illustrated in recent months with Norway’s recognition of a Palestinian state and Israel’s diplomatic blitz against Norway – is reminiscent of an ugly divorce, each partner taking out their years of pent-up anger and resentment on the other. It began as a love story between two countries who found common ground, caring for one another and optimistically trying to bring peace to the Middle East. Three decades later, the experiment blew up in dissolution. 'I think Norway’s unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state is an admission of failure,' says Hilde Henriksen Waage (65) of Oslo University, a leading expert on Israel-Norway relations and the Oslo process in Norway. 'After the Cold War, in Norway, there was a desire to build up an image to make it stand out and remind the US that we’re here, that we’re more than a border with Russia and that contrary to our geographical location, we’re in the middle of the action. It was decided we’d offer the world peace. And it’s failed. Not only is there no peace, but things have gotten much worse. And the finger’s being pointed entirely at Israel’s current government.' Norway’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andreas Kravik views Norway’s unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state somewhat differently: 'We did it to advance peace and recognition between Israel and Palestine. This is something we’re committed to,' he says. 'We saw that the Oslo Accords took negative directions that have created a lack of security for both Israelis and Palestinians. So, we were forced to think differently about how to embolden the moderate elements, weakened in this brutal conflict. Both sides deserve peace, but there’ll be no peace without a two-state solution. And as the war in Gaza rages on, we have to preserve the two-state solution alternative.' Norway took another step against Israel when it supported an arms embargo against Israel at the UN, while most European countries (including Sweden) abstained. Until the mid-'70s, the Norwegian public, along with the country’s political organizations, were clear Israel supporters. Norway transferred two tons of heavy water to Israel for peace purposes, despite it's real use being clear to all. 'We identified with Israel because, like Norway, it was a small country formerly ruled by others, and it had the image of a socialist paradise,' says Waage. The first cracks began appearing following the 1967 Six-Day War with hints of whispers from Palestinian refugees on the streets. Then in July 1973, Mossad assassinated Ahmed Bouchikhi, a Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer, mistaking him for arch-terrorist Hassan Salameh who had participated in the Munich massacre. 'I remember as a child, sitting around the table with my parents’ friends' recalls Waage. 'My parents were devout, Israel-loving, Christians. They were friends with a socialist couple from the radical left who openly supported Palestine before it was acceptable. When they started talking about Israel, they told me and my sister to go to the other room and then we heard yelling. My sister and I looked at each other and asked ‘Who are these crazy people and what’s making them lose their minds?’ When it came to choosing an MA thesis topic, this was my obvious choice.' The real change came in 1978-82. Journalist Odd Karsten Tveit first traveled to the region after The Litani Operation and has since written over a dozen books on the subject. The most recent published last September was a bestseller. 'When I got to the Middle East, there were already thousands of Norwegian soldiers serving as part of UNIFIL forces, he says. 'These aren’t men from the radical left. These are conservatives who signed up for the role 100% supporting Israel. When they finish, almost 100% of them are against Israel.' Why? 'Because they’d been fed a fairytale and it turns out that Israel is the strong, occupying side. They witness IDF operations in Lebanon. Also, thousands of nurses, midwives and doctors volunteered in the West Bank, and they all come back to Norway telling their friends and family what they’ve seen, and the narrative begins to change.' 'Norway had a soft spot for Israel. When Mossad needed Norwegian passports for operations in the Soviet Union, they knew they could talk to someone here but, gradually, it started changing. The First Lebanon War and the invasion of Beirut and [the Christians' massacre] in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, changed the public discourse and opinion and began influencing the politicians. Now we see that Israel is reacting more harshly toward Norway than it is toward Spain and Ireland, who have also unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state. What’s the difference? 'One difference is the emotional connection due to the Oslo Accords. We’re also not in the EU, so it’s easier to attack us.' Tivet is referring to Foreign Minister Katz’s 'retaliatory measures' against Norway: Israel rescinded the diplomatic status of eight Norwegian Embassy personnel working in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority, and Norway consequently closed its office in the West Bank. 'We had, and still have, deep friendly relations with Israel and Israeli citizens, but the extreme and unacceptable steps taken by the current government have proven to us that it is actively disrupting the two-state solution, the only solution for peace,' says Deputy Foreign Minister Kravik. 'Norway isn’t hostile to Israel, it’s a friend. But friends need to be honest and talk about policies they don’t agree with.' Leif Knutsen (63) is a member of Oslo’s Jewish community. Shortly following the October 7 massacre, he started publishing an almost daily newsletter offering an alternative to what the average Norwegian was getting from the country’s mainstream and social media. 'Since Oslo, the Norwegians have become obsessive about Israel. The collapse of the accords means that in politics, academia, the media, or on any platform influencing public opinion, everything about Israel is negative. This has led to the demonization of Israel among the Norwegian public, 50% of whom, when surveyed, responded that Israel is indeed doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to the Jews.' Facing a community of 2,000 Jews, we have a quarter of a million Muslims in Oslo alone. This dictates the Norwegian narrative and politics. We also have a sharp increase in crime rate, and as this is statistically connected to certain minority communities here, we also see antagonism toward the Muslim minority and to the Pro-Palestinian demonstrations.' Do you feel antisemitism here? 'We have antisemitism-based violence. People spit and curse and there are places - mainly in the big cities – where you wouldn’t identify as a Jew or as an Israeli. This comes primarily from the Muslims, who do the locals’ legwork for them. Although the locals have been brainwashed with antisemitism, claiming that Israel is conducting genocide and murdering children, they’re horrified when accused of antisemitism, as it’s not part of how they see themselves. During this year’s International Women’s Day march, the organizers initially allowed Jewish women to march with signs protesting rape committed on October 7. When they showed up, however, other demonstrators blocked them shouting 'No Zionists on our streets.' This act crossed the line for the public and the Norwegian prime minister also wrote a letter protesting the incident.' 'Since October 7 and the ensuing war, we’ve witnessed an increase in antisemitism toward Jews in Europe, sadly including Norway,' says Deputy Foreign Minister Kravik. 'The prime minister and foreign minister are in contact with the community and we’ve increased security. The Jews in Norway aren’t responsible for Israel’s policies and we’ll never accept antisemitism. Since October 7, we’ve fiercely condemned the Hamas attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself within international law and have stressed the immediate need to unconditionally release all the hostages.' Knutsen also explains internal factors contributing to the deteriorating discourse regarding, and hostility toward, Israel: 'This government is operating badly and may be on its way to elections next year. Following October 7, a new foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, came in from a humanitarian, rather than diplomatic background. Since assuming his position, he’s been under pressure from his party, demanding he take more drastic and aggressive measures against Israel.' Eide blames Israel alone and has freely accepted Hamas’s versions of events and its casualty figures. His inexperience means he has said things to the media that would ordinarily get diplomats fired. (For example, the Israeli Embassy only learned of Norway’s recognition of Palestine through newspaper headlines). Even before this, the government prevented the King of Norway from conveying his condolences to Israel following the massacre, claiming that this was the government's job, and sent off a particularly lukewarm message of condolence. Norway also refuses to recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization. The message is clear to the Norwegian public: the failing minority government is dependent on two left-wing parties and has dragged Norway to a clear anti-Israel stance, including, in August supporting the issue of arrest warrants for Benny Gantz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'Here’s another example,' says Knutsen. 'Just before the Passover holiday, the foreign minister ordered the state retailer responsible for the sale of alcohol, to remove all the wines from the West Bank and the Golan from the shelves. So, there wasn’t enough wine for the community. They wouldn’t dare do such a thing to any other minority. But what can we Jews do? Write a letter of complaint? ' 'On the other hand, a survey conducted by The Norwegian Center for Holocaust and Minority Studies,' says John Arne Moen, chairman of Norway’s second largest Jewish community, in Trondheim, 'shows that there’s a much better attitude toward Jews than toward Muslims.' The discrepancy between the government's hostility to Israel and the public’s attitude was also demonstrated by Norway’s public vote in the Eurovision semifinal, awarding Eden Golan a perfect score. But across Oslo and other big cities, we’re seeing horrific exhibitions about the 'genocide' Israel is conducting, including cuffed Gazans being led by Israeli soldiers to their execution, cheerful celebrations of the murder of Israelis at the Allenby Bridge and trampling on Israeli flags on the outskirts of the king’s palace. However, as Israel flexes its muscles to rescind the status of diplomats operating in the West Bank, Norway closed its offices near Ramallah and accused the Israeli government of extremism. Part of this, an Israeli official told us, is about the Norwegian’s arrogant character. 'They can do everything better than everyone else, even bringing about peace. They don’t have the capacity for soul-searching.' Foreign Minister Barth Eide is a contributing factor to the crisis. He has compared Israel to Russia, claimed Israel is conducting war crimes, and has demanded other countries not sell arms to Israel so as not to be accused of war crimes. Norway, alongside Spain, Ireland and France, went back to financing UNRWA and spoke out against other countries who had frozen their UNRWA funding after it was revealed that 12 of its employees had taken part in the October 7 massacre. Eide claimed that 'for 12 rotten apples, you don’t stop funding a whole organization.' A senior Labor Party representative on Norway’s Committee of Foreign Affairs and Defense recommended UNRWA for the Nobel Peace Prize. Leading newspapers reported that 'Israel started a war against Hamas.' The ruling Labor Party youth movement summer camps have been boycotting Israel for years. At the most recent summer camp, the teenagers were photographed in keffiyehs and holding signs accusing Israel of genocide. 'It’s very hard to persuade my students in lectures that Israel’s policies, even the very state, are right,' says Prof. Waage. 'There’s a generation with no sympathy for Israel or knowledge of the Holocaust. I can give long lectures, and then they’ll ask me why I’m against boycotting Israel.' Prof. Waage is Norwegian academia’s good and bad girl. She’s good at her job, and so has more access to material than other scholars. She’s bad as what she finds there, are things the government is trying to conceal. She learned Hebrew a decade ago so as not to depend on her (settler) research assistant as she rummages through the archive in Jerusalem. To her surprise, she found all of the Norwegian government’s secret Oslo documents there. 'The Oslo process actually began in 1979,' she says. 'The Iranian regime fell and the US asked us to supply Israel with oil. Norway went to ask Arafat if that was okay by him, so as not to endanger Norwegian soldiers in Lebanon. He agreed, but asked Norway to mediate between him and the Israelis, as Israel viewed Norway as a friend.' 'We now understand how wrong we were. We were desperately trying to create this jewel for our image and were drunk on our own success. We’ve been telling ourselves this fairytale for 30 years, gracing the salons of, London Brussels and Washington. Until now, it’s been important for us to maintain friendly relations with Israel, but recognizing this failure has given us free rein to criticize Israel. Israel’s reaction, though, is simply insane. All this makes me concerned and really sad.'

Gilat brings joy amid war through interactive theater	The Gilat Foundation uses therapeutic theater to uplift disabled and injured children in hospitals across Israel following year-long fighting The children’s smiles lit up the popular restaurant in Jerusalem, a rare sight after months of multifront war in Israel. These children face daily struggles, whether born with disabilities, injured in attacks, or affected by ongoing conflict. Pitmaster restaurant hosted an event to raise awareness and support for the Gilat Foundation, which uses theater to bring joy to sick children. Founded in 2023 after the October 7 massacre, the Gilat Foundation launched its program in Israel and is now active in four hospitals: Shaare Zedek Medical Center, ALYN Hospital, Shalva National Center, and the Kerem Institute. Around 4,000 children have participated, and four more hospitals, starting with Hadassah after Sukkot, are set to join this year. The Gilat Foundation was established in memory of Gilat Eisenmann, who passed away in 2008 at age 11 after spending much of her life in the hospital. Gilat’s cousin, Shlomi Eisenmann, told The Media Line, 'What’s truly remarkable is that despite those years of sorrow, her parents found the strength to create something positive. They started an organization to help kids just like her.' He explained why therapeutic theater became a central part of the initiative: 'Theater was Gilat’s passion. Even though she was physically impaired, mentally, she was sharp as a knife. She was always aware of everything going on around her. People would visit her, and she’d say, ‘Why are you sad? Be happy. Everything is fine.’ That was her thing. Even in the face of her challenges, she lifted everyone around her.' When the war in Israel began, Shlomi said Gilat’s parents felt compelled to act. 'They rushed to Israel because they realized it was necessary. Many kids were injured or became clinically ill from the attack, and others, already sick, had to be moved to the center of Israel. These children, already in vulnerable situations, had to deal with even more upheaval. It’s tough. That’s why offering them therapeutic theater every week, giving them a space to feel like normal kids, is so vital.' He emphasized the program’s measurable impact: 'One of the heads of education at Alyn Hospital told us that in just two months since the start of the war, she saw an 80% increase in the children’s well-being. That’s a real, measurable result.' Shlomi described the unique power of theater: 'Theater is medicine no doctor can prescribe. You can’t buy it in a supermarket or a pharmacy. We organize everything—bring the kids out of their rooms, even when they don’t feel like moving. Once they come to the show, it changes everything. It’s an hour where they can forget their struggles, and that’s something invaluable.' Tali Eisenmann, president of the foundation and Gilat’s mother, told The Media Line that she had wanted to be a doctor since childhood, which later influenced her decision to become a medic. 'But it didn’t work out. My father said to me, ‘It’s not a study for a religious girl,’ and I was used to listening to him, so I didn’t do it—and I regret it.' 'After Gilat passed away, I still thought maybe I’d be a doctor because I saw how important it is, but I didn’t do it. It was too much; I couldn’t handle it. When we came to Israel, I thought, ‘I want to be a medic.’ So in that, she didn’t really play a role, but what she does play a role in is my approach to people,' Tali shared. 'I’ve learned it’s very important to approach not only the patient but also the people surrounding them because when someone is chronically ill, it’s not only the patient who suffers—it’s the whole family,' she explained. 'I also learned that just because someone is in a wheelchair or disabled, it doesn’t mean they can’t answer, can’t think, or that they’re not normal. You should approach the person directly, even if they have learning difficulties or are mentally disabled—they’re still a person and deserve to be treated like one,' Tali said. Yossi Zecharia is a father of four. His 8-year-old son, Lior, was born with a leg malformation—one leg is shorter than the other. Yossi told The Media Line that Lior has already undergone eight surgeries and will require additional ones nearly every year until he turns 18. The theatrical performances raise Lior’s spirits and give him a moment to forget he has a disability. Lior looks forward to when the actors come to ALYN Hospital to perform. It makes him happy they come to perform, particularly when the children are involved in the play. Mahdi Haruv has worked in ALYN Hospital’s rehabilitation department for five years as a teacher and playroom coordinator. Haruv speaks with passion and pride about the impact of the Gilat Theater on children from all backgrounds. As an Arab Israeli from the Shuafat neighborhood in East Jerusalem, he sees the Gilat program as not only a way to empower patients but also as a place where they learn values and gain a broader understanding of the world. 'The children learn about themselves, get a more positive sense of self, they learn how to be more patient with themselves, with their families, so they can see and be seen in a positive manner. Gilat shows them what they can do in order to be part of society,' Haruv told The Media Line. According to Haruv, many children experience anxiety attacks during their recovery process. Rehabilitation helps them understand their emotions, and the interactive theater program teaches them how to cope with distress and reduce long-term stress. 'Most importantly, theater brings happiness to their faces,' he said. These children are also learning about the world beyond the hospital, with the program teaching them about countries on every continent. The restaurant was packed, and Gilat’s name appeared on large TV screens, placemats, and goody bags. The video playing showed Gilat, a confident young child of 11, who beamed. The joyful atmosphere gave way to the somber reality of war, reflecting the heart-wrenching emotions many have experienced. Zvi Steinfeld, a partner and chef at Pitmaster, is known for captivating guests with his culinary skills. The Gilat videos on screen suddenly turned to Ben Shimoni and Gaya Chalifa, who had worked at the Petach Tikvah branch. Steinfeld told The Media Line that they were at the Nova Festival on October 7. Shimoni managed to escape three times, each time bringing others to safety. On his third escape, he took Chalifa and three others with him. On their way out, they were ambushed by terrorists and killed, Steinfeld shared. 'I worked together with both for nearly two years. We spent many afternoons and nights working side by side. After the services, we would often sit to catch our breaths, discussing anything that evening service to our lives and future plans. They were both incredible young, beautiful people who had a bright future ahead of them that was taken too soon,' Steinfeld said. While the war has heightened stress nationwide and deepened the divide between Israelis and Arabs, Haruv remains hopeful. 'Gilat has taught values and respect to the patients and families who come together during the performances,' says Haruv. 'They are all treated equally, no matter if they are religious or secular, Jew or Arab.' 'At this critical time of war, Gilat gives something important to the state that will help the entire country. It’s an opportunity for peace,' he says. 'If sick kids can play together during war, and then their parents come together, it’s a recipe all can learn from.'

Assad restricts pro-Iran militias in Syria, Strike on Latakia att...	A UK-based Syrian opposition site claims Damascus regime fears being dragged into war, prevents attacks on Israel with the help of Russians At least two people were injured early on Thursday in an overnight strike on the Syrian port of Latakia, which was attributed to Israel. Syrian state media said the attack on the port caused a fire, while other reports claimed the target was a weapons storage facility at the entrance to the port city and that serious damage was caused to homes in the area. Hours earlier, Syrian President Bashar al Assad had imposed restrictions on Iran-backed militias' activities in his country, according to a report in the UK-based Syrian opposition site the Observatory for Human Rights. According to the report, the restrictions were imposed fearing Israeli attacks. The site reported that Assad fears the break-out of war with Israel after previously limiting the scope of their operations along the Syrian-Israeli border on the Golan Heights. It claimed the Damascus regime issued military orders, 'in agreement with the Russians,' to limit Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian militias in villages near Damascus and Homs including the Homs desert that could be used to launch drones at Israel. Unnamed sources quoted in the report claimed the regime was inspecting cars with Lebanese license plates and surveying people arriving from Lebanon, out of concern that Syrian territory would be used to attack Israel. The Observatory said thousands of pro-Iranian militias, including Hezbollah were in Syria and that Israel may take advantage of their presence to strike and to drag Syria into a war it has no interest in. The sources also said that the Syrian military's 4th division, under the command of Assad's brother Maher, issued strict orders not to attack the Golan Heights and 'ignite' conflict with Israel. They said roadblocks were keeping regime forces some 15 kilometers (9 miles) away from the border with Israel and Russian forces were positioned at 17 points along the border to reduce friction while pro-Iranian militia sites were being patrolled by joint Syrian and Russian forces in a number of locations around Syria, to keep an eye on them.

U.S. B-2 stealth bombers strike Yemen in message to Iran	Attack targets Houthi underground weapons stores; 'unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified' Austin says The United States conducted precision strikes on Wednesday against five underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' Austin said in a statement. 'The employment of US Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere.' According to reports the use of strategic bomber, in the unprecedented attack, was meant to indicate their possible use to strike Iran's nuclear facilities if and when the United States chooses to do so. 'We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks,' he said. Sources told CNN on Thursday that several of the stealth bombers were used in the strike on the Iran-backed Houthis hitting stores of 'advanced weapons' and in response to attacks on US and military vessels as well as commercial ships in the Red Sea. According to the Hezbollah-Affiliated Al Mayadeen network in Lebanon, the UK also participated in the strike on targets near the Yemeni capital of Sanaa and in the northern Saada governorate. A Houthi spokesperson said the attacks were 'a failed attempt to protect Israel,' and to deter the Houthis from supporting Gaza and Lebanon. 'To the Americans and British we say, our abilities are great, and our response will come.' Last month, the IDF attacked the Houthi-controlled Hodeida Port and other strategic targets in Yemen some 1,800 kilometers (1118 miles) away, in response to a Houthis surface-to-surface missile launched at at Tel Aviv. 'The airstrikes focused on key military infrastructure in the Ras Issa and Hodeidah regions, including power stations and a port used for importing oil. These facilities were being used by the Iranian-backed Houthi regime to transfer weapons and military supplies, including oil, to their forces,' the IDF said in a statement.

Focused on his personal needs': New details on alleged Iranian s...	Document details how Vladimir Varkhovsky, suspected of being recruited to kill an Israeli scientist by Tehran, was involved in financial struggles; these are characteristics Iran looks for in an agent A document compiled on Vladimir Varkhovsky, who was charged with a series of security offenses on behalf of Iranian intelligence and agreed to assassinate an Israeli scientist for $100,000, had previously sought 'quick and easy financial solutions without exercising judgment,' Ynet learned on Wednesday. The document came following his involvement in a credit card fraud case. Varkhovsky made aliyah to Israel from Ukraine eight years ago and worked as a security guard in a building and was unarmed. 'At the time of the offense, he was focused on his personal and immediate needs, exercising short-term judgment,' the document from 2017 read detailing the man’s entanglement following financial difficulties shortly after his arrival in Israel. 'His behavior indicates problematic patterns of conduct and coping.' He was ultimately convicted in the case and served community service. 'They [Iranians] usually tend to recruit people with limited means. Not necessarily of foreign origin, but those born and raised here have more nationalism, making it harder to recruit them to act against their own country. People who recently moved here — have less national affiliation on the face of it, making them targets or at least a starting point,' said M., who previously worked at the Defense Ministry. However, he also pointed to 'vulnerabilities' among native Israelis: 'Lower socio-economic status, urgency to pay a criminal body or a criminal record — because they've already broken the law before.' 'For young people, like the couple from Ramat Gan who don't have children, there's less to lose,' he added. 'Their families aren't in the country, and it's harder to reach them. Unfortunately, many young people spend a lot of time on social media without realizing what they're getting into.' 'You can't easily send them to buy weapons, but rather to film locations and spread malice — it's important for parents to monitor what their kids are doing online,' he explained. Dvir Kariv, who served in the Shin Bet for 22 years, said, 'The idea is to harm Israel from afar —using innocent people in exchange for money. They (the Iranians) will approach people with a criminal past, those who have already broken the law, or innocent, desperate individuals. The guy from Petah Tikva agreed to kill a scientist after a series of bad turns.' 'There are people who wanted to be like James Bond and join intelligence agencies but ended up as security guards. They get drawn into becoming enticing agents from abroad, which gives them a taste for life. You get money, dabble in intelligence and life seems like a Hollywood movie — until you find yourself in an abyss at some point,' he added. Iranian recruitment efforts are conducted via through various ads — some on Facebook — or offers for translation services in different languages, with payments of thousands of shekels per page. This is how the Iranians try to lure numerous residents. 'The Iranians want to retaliate quickly for what we've done to them. Many of us 'live' on social media since the COVID-19 pandemic and technological development. Iranian agents operate on two levels — either personal or broad approaches. If it seems too good to be true, it isn't,' Kariv said. 'They filter out unsuspecting people who think they can make easy money from home. These innocent people enter their details and that’s where the fall begins.' Varkhovsky’s espionage case wasn’t the only one uncovered this week. Vladislav Victorsson, 30 and Anna Bernstein, 18 who were recruited by an Iranian intelligence operative on Telegram, were initially asked to spray graffiti, then to distribute flyers and later set cars on fire — with the ultimate goal being to assassinate a high-ranking Israeli official. Varkhovsky was similarly asked to spray graffiti, plant tracking devices and finally, collect a gun. 'It escalates and deteriorates,' Kariv said. 'At some point, they ask for a picture while carrying out the mission and only pay after they receive it. This serves as leverage.' Adi Carmi, who served in the Shin Bet for 28 years, explained, 'Moti Maman — an Ashdod businessman — who was caught after being in Iran, has a completely different profile from those caught this week, who supposedly had no ties to the state.' 'He was recruited because businessmen operating outside the country's borders have more face-to-face access and the ability to exploit them is more present. When you post a random, intriguing ad on Facebook, thousands respond and a few remain who don't realize what they're getting into. It's like a honey trap — they start getting entangled and then they begin to fear being blackmailed,' he added. In a typical year, the Shin Bet foils around 500 attempts of severe attacks within Israel's borders. Since the war in Gaza began, 1,200 attacks have been thwarted according to the intelligence agency. Most civilians targeted were identified by agencies before the attacks, but concerns still exist that not all can be stopped in time. 'The working assumption is that you don't expose them all — because the more complex recruitments worry the Shin Bet as they're conducted more slowly and cleverly. The technological foundation is much deeper and more intricate,' Kariv explained.

Starvation': UN Security Council criticized Israel in emergency ...	International community in meeting on humanitarian situation in the Strip accuse Israel of 'policy of starvation' amid IDF operations in the area and US threats of an arms embargo The UN Security Council convened this for an emergency session on Wednesday on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, amid recent IDF operations in the northern part of the Strip over the past week and against the backdrop of U.S. threats to impose an arms embargo on the country if it fails to deliver humanitarian aid and fulfill its commitments. The session saw unprecedented criticism of Israel, in a language not heard even in the past year of the ongoing war. The discussion was initiated at the request of several countries, including the UK, France and Algeria. Israel's isolation was evident during the session, where all speakers mentioned the harrowing images of Palestinians burning to death at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah following an IDF strike executed Sunday overnight. Responsibility for the incident was placed on Israel, which was also accused of starvation tactics, cutting off food supplies to northern Gaza and systematically displacing Palestinians who had already been uprooted from their homes. While Western representatives did mention the hostages held by Hamas, the majority of the speeches reflected positions critical of Israel. The United States is watching to ensure that Israel's actions on the ground show that it does not have a 'policy of starvation' in the northern Gaza Strip, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council on Wednesday. She told the 15-member council that such a policy would be 'horrific and unacceptable and would have implications under international law and U.S. law.' 'The Government of Israel has said that this is not their policy, that food and other essential supplies will not be cut off, and we will be watching to see that Israel's actions on the ground match this statement,' Thomas-Greenfield said, in a ratcheting up of the U.S. posture toward its longtime ally. The United States has told Israel that it must take steps in the next 30 days to improve the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave or face potential restrictions on U.S. military aid, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. 'Food and supplies must be surged into Gaza, immediately. And there must be humanitarian pauses across Gaza to allow for vaccinations and the delivery and distribution of humanitarian aid,' Thomas-Greenfield said. A deadly attack on southern Israel by Palestinian Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023, triggered Israel's retaliation in Hamas-run Gaza, sparking a humanitarian crisis in the besieged enclave. Authorities say more than 42,000 people have been killed and almost the entire population of 2.3 million displaced. Israel's Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon told the council that the issue in Gaza was not a lack of aid, saying more than 1 million tons had been delivered during the past year. He accused Hamas of hijacking the humanitarian assistance. 'Israel, along with our international partners, continues to flood Gaza with aid, but it will never reach all those in need as long as Hamas remains in power,' he said. 'Hamas has weaponized the humanitarian situation.' Hamas has repeatedly denied Israeli allegations that it was stealing aid and says Israel is to blame for shortages. ‘Unconscionable’ The UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. The UN said no food aid entered northern Gaza between October 2 and October 15. 'Given the abject conditions and intolerable suffering in north Gaza, the fact that humanitarian access is nearly nonexistent is unconscionable,' acting UN aid chief Joyce Msuya told the council. On Wednesday, the IDF unit that oversees aid and commercial shipments to Gaza said 50 trucks carrying food, water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment provided by Jordan were transferred to northern Gaza. Danon cited the recent medical mission as an example of Israel's 'comprehensive' humanitarian efforts, adding that 'as always, we acted in accordance with international law, going above and beyond our obligations.' Danon also spoke about the start of a second round of polio vaccinations on Monday by the UN children's agency UNICEF and the World Health Organization, targeting 590,000 children under the age of 10 during area-specific pauses in fighting. Algeria's UN Ambassador Amar Bendjama questioned Israel's humanitarian efforts. 'How is it possible that we can vaccinate these children yet we cannot feed them?' he said. 'The inevitable conclusion is that this is not ... collateral damage, but a deliberate calculated Israeli policy of starvation.'

US's threatening letter to Israel could spell trouble at The Hagu...	Blinken and Austin's letter warning Jerusalem of a weapons embargo if aid fails to reach Gaza could provide ammunition for ICC prosecutor in bid to issue warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant The U.S.’s threat of a weapons embargo against Israel conditioned in the supply of humanitarian aid into Gaza could spell trouble for the country at the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague after ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan applied for arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The letter, issued by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demanded that Israel take concrete steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within 30 days. In addition to ensuring regular aid transfers, the U.S. also calls on Israel to allow Red Cross visits to Palestinian detainees and to halt Knesset legislation that would prevent the Palestinian aid agency UNRWA from operating in Israel. Since Israel’s assurances in March and a subsequent letter in April, which had led to improvements in aid delivery, the amount of assistance entering Gaza has dropped by over 50%, according to the letter. Aid deliveries in September were reportedly the lowest in a year. The letter could serve as strong circumstantial evidence for Khan’s claim that Israel did arbitrarily block the delivery of humanitarian aid — at least until March 2024. Otherwise, there would have been no need for the assurance letters issued in March and April, as revealed in the letter. The Americans aren’t disconnected from what’s happening at The Hague and the letter’s leak might alter the opinions of the judges who are set to decide on the prosecutor's request to issue urgent arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant due to allegations of prolonged starvation offenses. US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council on Wednesday that Israel’s operations in the Gaza Strip proved it doesn’t have a 'policy of starvation,' across the enclave and specifically in its northern sector. 'The Government of Israel has said that this is not their policy, that food and other essential supplies will not be cut off, and we will be watching to see that Israel’s actions on the ground match this statement,' she stressed. French President Emmanuel Macron's words against Israel also bolster the ICC’s French judge — one of the three judges on the pre-trial panel. Blinken and Austin effectively accuse Israel of allegedly blocking the entry of aid trucks to northern Gaza. Khan is required to prove that this constitutes an 'organized policy,' and that those against whom warrants are sought acted in line with this policy — to establish a crime against humanity. The leaked letter aids in substantiating this claim, which is often hard to prove as it’s rare to find documents that indicate a criminal plan. The letter, coupled with the growing international sentiment against Israel, especially amid the war in Lebanon and reports of the blockade on northern Gaza, could expedite the court's decision to issue the warrants. There has been no substantial change in Israel's policy regarding humanitarian aid to Gaza, according to Israeli officials. They attribute the harsh letter to the U.S. administration's lack of confidence in Israel's intentions. U.S. officials reportedly feared that Israel was planning to starve Gaza, in line with the so-called 'General's Plan' proposed by retired IDF Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, which involves isolating northern Gaza. Israel has repeatedly announced in recent days it was allowing aid into northern Gaza. According to Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), responsible for facilitating aid into Gaza, 50 aid trucks entered the Strip on Wednesday, 12 on Tuesday and 30 on Sunday.

UK mulls placing sanctions on Ben-Gvir, Smotrich	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer tells parliament country is looking into the move following 'abhorrent' comments made by both ministers since outset of the Gaza war UK Prime Minister and the country's Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said on Wednesday his country is considering imposing sanctions on National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. 'We are looking at that,' he said in the parliament after being asked about remarks made by the two. He described their statements as 'abhorrent' and called on Israel to increase the quota of humanitarian aid entering the northern Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, the UK announced sanctions against seven Israeli settler groups 'involved in the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.' One of the organizations is the 'Amana' movement, which is 'involved in the construction of illegal settler outposts and threatening and perpetrating acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank.' Other organizations include the 'Od Yosef Chai' yeshiva, 'Hashomer Yosh,' and 'Torat Lechima.' Ben-Gvir responded to the UK's potential actions, saying, 'Just as the British attempted to thwart the establishment of Israel prior to its rise, they are now continuing to do so amid a war for survival. The sea is the same sea and the British are the same British.' 'The British need to understand that the days of the Mandate are over. In any case, they don't scare me and I will continue to act solely in accordance with the supreme national interests of the State of Israel and for the residents of the state, our soldiers, police officers and prison guards. Down with the White Paper!' he added. Smotrich also responded to Starmer's statement, saying, 'The British Mandate has ended, and with it, the White Paper, but the one-sidedness and hypocrisy remain. God willing, I will continue to do everything in my power to advance a policy of eliminating the Nazi terror from Gaza, Lebanon, and Iran and to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian terror state that would threaten the existence of the State of Israel and the security of the Jewish people.' 'No threat will prevent me from doing what is right and moral for the citizens of Israel and if the British want to wrinkle their noses at my Zionist policies, then so be it,' he added. The UK isn't the first to announce it was considering imposing sanctions on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. The European Union also considered the issue headed by an initiative by EU Foreign Minister Josep Borrell but didn't have majority support among the member states to approve the move.

How Israel’s bulky pager fooled Hezbollah	An invisible detonator and wafer-thin plastic explosives turned batteries into bombs The batteries inside the weaponized pagers that arrived in Lebanon at the start of the year, part of an Israeli plot to decimate Hezbollah, had powerfully deceptive features and an Achilles' heel. The agents who built the pagers designed a battery that concealed a small but potent charge of plastic explosive and a novel detonator that was invisible to X-ray, according to a Lebanese source with first-hand knowledge of the pagers, and teardown photos of the battery pack seen by Reuters. To overcome the weakness - the absence of a plausible backstory for the bulky new product - they created fake online stores, pages and posts that could deceive Hezbollah due diligence, a Reuters review of web archives shows. The stealthy design of the pager bomb and the battery’s carefully constructed cover story, both described here for the first time, shed light on the execution of a years-long operation that has struck unprecedented blows against Israel's Iran-backed Lebanese foe and pushed the Middle East closer to a regional war. A thin, square sheet with six grams of white pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) plastic explosive was squeezed between two rectangular battery cells, according to the Lebanese source and photos. The remaining space between the battery cells could not be seen in the photos but was occupied by a strip of highly flammable material that acted as the detonator, the source said. This three-layer sandwich was inserted in a black plastic sleeve, and encapsulated in a metal casing roughly the size of a matchbox, the photos showed. The assembly was unusual because it did not rely on a standard miniaturized detonator, typically a metallic cylinder, the source and two bomb experts said. All three spoke on conditions of anonymity. Without any metal components, the material used to trigger detonation had an edge: like the plastic explosives, it was not detected by X-ray. Upon receiving the pagers in February, Hezbollah looked for the presence of explosives, two people familiar with the matter said, putting them through airport security scanners to see if they triggered alarms. Nothing suspicious was reported. The devices were likely set up to generate a spark within the battery pack, enough to light the detonating material, and trigger the sheet of PETN to explode, said the two bomb experts, to whom Reuters showed the pager-bomb design. Since explosives and wrapping took about a third of the volume, the battery pack carried a fraction of the power consistent with its 35-gram weight, two battery experts said. 'There is a significant amount of unaccounted for mass,' said Paul Christensen, an expert in lithium batteries at Britain’s Newcastle University. At some point, Hezbollah noticed the battery was draining faster than expected, the Lebanese source said. However, the issue did not appear to raise major security concerns - the group was still handing its members the pagers hours before the attack. On Sept. 17, thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded in the southern suburbs of Beirut and other Hezbollah strongholds, in most cases after the devices beeped, indicating an incoming message. Among the victims rushed to hospital, many had eye injuries, missing fingers or gaping holes in their abdomens, Reuters witnesses saw, indicating their proximity to the devices at the time of detonation. In total, the pager attack, and a second on the following day that activated weaponized walkie-talkies, killed 39 people and wounded more than 3,400. Two Western security sources said Israeli intelligence agency Mossad spearheaded the pager and walkie-talkie attacks. Reuters could not establish where the devices were manufactured. The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which has authority over Mossad, did not respond to a request for comment. Lebanon’s Information Ministry and a spokesperson for Hezbollah declined to comment for this article. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed a role. The day after the attacks Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant praised Mossad's 'very impressive' results in comments that were widely interpreted in Israel as a tacit acknowledgment of the agency's participation. U.S. officials have said they were not informed of the operation in advance. The weak link From the outside, the pager’s power source looked like a standard lithium-ion battery pack used in thousands of consumer electronics goods. And yet, the battery, labeled LI-BT783, had a problem: Like the pager, it did not exist on the market. So Israel's agents created a backstory from scratch. Hezbollah has serious procurement procedures to check what they buy, a former Israeli intelligence officer, who was not involved in the pager operation, told Reuters. 'You want to make sure that if they look, they find something,' the former spy said, requesting not to be named. 'Not finding anything is not good.' Creating backstories, or 'legends', for undercover agents has long been a core skill of spy agencies. What made the pager plot unusual is that those skills appear to have been applied to ubiquitous consumer electronics products. For the pagers, the agents deceived Hezbollah by selling the custom-created model, AR-924, under an existing, renowned Taiwanese brand, Gold Apollo. Gold Apollo’s chairman, Hsu Ching-kuang, told reporters a day after the pager attack that he was approached about three years ago by a former employee, Teresa Wu, and her 'big boss, called Tom' to discuss a license agreement. Hsu said he had scant information about Wu’s superior, but he granted them the right to design their own products and market them under the widely distributed Gold Apollo brand. Reuters could not establish the identity of the manager, nor whether the person or Wu knowingly worked with Israeli intelligence. The chairman said he was not impressed by the AR-924 when he saw it, but still added photos and a description of the product to his company’s website, helping give it both visibility and credibility. There was no way to directly buy the AR-924 from his website. Hsu said he knew nothing about the pagers’ lethal capabilities or the broader operation to attack Hezbollah. He described his company as a victim of the plot. Gold Apollo declined to provide further comment. Calls and messages sent to Wu went unanswered. She has not given a statement to the media since the attacks. ‘I know this product’ In September 2023, webpages and images featuring the AR-924 and its battery were added to apollosystemshk.com, a website that said it had a license to distribute Gold Apollo products, as well as the rugged pager and its bulky power source, according to a Reuters review of internet records and metadata. The website gave an address in Hong Kong for a company called Apollo Systems HK. No company by that name exists at the address or in Hong Kong Corporate records. However, the website was listed by Wu, the Taiwanese businesswoman, on her Facebook page as well as in public incorporation records when she registered a company called Apollo Systems in Taipei earlier this year. A section of the apollosystemshk.com site devoted to the LI-BT783 put emphasis on the battery’s outstanding performance. Unlike the disposable batteries that powered older generation pagers, it boasted 85 days of autonomy and could be recharged via a USB cable, according to the website and a 90-second promotional video on YouTube. n late 2023, two battery stores came online with the LI-BT783 listed in their catalogs, Reuters found. And in two online forums devoted to batteries, participants discussed the power source, despite its lack of commercial availability: 'I know this product,' a user with the handle Mikevog wrote in April 2023. 'It’s got a great datasheet and a great performance. Reuters could not establish the identity of Mikevog. The website, the online stores, and the forum discussions bear the hallmark of a deception effort, the former Israeli intelligence officer and two Western security officers told Reuters. The websites have been scrubbed from the web since the pager bombs wreaked havoc in Lebanon, but archived and cached copies are still viewable. Ruing the day they bought the pagers, Hezbollah leaders said they had launched internal investigations to understand how the security breach could happen and identify possible moles. The group had shifted to pagers at the start of the year after realizing that cellphone communications were compromised by Israeli eavesdropping, Reuters previously reported. Hezbollah's investigations have helped uncover how Israeli agents used an aggressive sales tactic to make sure Hezbollah’s procurement manager chose the AR-924, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The salesperson who conveyed the offer made a very inexpensive proposition for the pagers, 'and kept bringing the price down until he was pulled in,' the person said. Lebanese authorities have condemned the attacks as a serious violation of Lebanon's sovereignty. On Sept. 19, in his last public speech before he was killed by Israel, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the device blasts could amount to a 'declaration of war' and vowed to punish Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire since Oct. 8, 2023, when the militant group began launching rockets at Israeli military positions in solidarity with its Palestinian ally Hamas. In the wake of the device attacks, Israel has launched a full-on war on Hezbollah, including a ground invasion of southern Lebanon and airstrikes that have killed most of its top leadership. The internal investigation, still underway, suffered a setback on Sept. 28: Eleven days after the pager attack, the senior Hezbollah official tasked with leading the procurement probe, Nabil Kaouk, was himself killed by an Israeli airstrike.

30 rockets from Lebanon target Galilee areas	Following the sirens that sounded in the Upper Galilee, Central Galilee and Western Galilee areas, approximately 30 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory, according to the IDF. The majority of the projectiles were intercepted and fallen projectiles were identified in the area. Magen David Adom reported following the alarms in the Karmiel area that medics and paramedics went a number of scenes where reports were received, and in one of them they located two wounded people, about 45 years old, who were hit by shrapnel and are being treated at the scene. Their condition is described as light. In addition, a direct hit was made on a home in Majd al-Krum.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkxf00qpyjx	2024-10-16T04:52:21-07:00	
Retired banker or scientist? Tel Aviv family caught in Iranian sp...	Iranian handler sends Israeli recruit photo of Tel Aviv resident, instructing him to knock on man’s door just days before allegedly obtaining gun for assassination; 'My father is over 80 and has no connection to any security matters,' son says The indictment filed Wednesday against Vladimir Varkhovsky, 35, from Tel Aviv, details a series of security-related offenses allegedly carried out at the behest of Iranian intelligence. The indictment describes how Varkhovsky arrived at a building in the city's L neighborhood, at the request of a foreign agent with whom he was in contact, and knocked on the door of an apartment on the fifth floor. Shlomi, the son of Emanuel, who lives in the apartment, told Ynet he was shocked by the revelations. 'My father is a retired Bank Hapoalim employee—he has no connection to security matters,' he said. The indictment, submitted to the Lod District Court, alleges that Varkhovsky was instructed to obtain a gun intended for the assassination of an Israeli scientist. The foreign agent, posing as an Israeli citizen living in Canada named 'Eli,' promised Varkhovsky $100,000 and offered to help smuggle him to Russia after the murder. Varkhovsky allegedly traveled by taxi from Tel Aviv to Modiin, where he collected a bag containing a handgun, a matching magazine and 15 bullets. Upon returning to his home, he was arrested by security forces. Days earlier, the foreign agent had asked Varkhovsky to locate a person living on Borla Street in Tel Aviv, providing a photograph for identification. According to the indictment, on September 19, Varkhovsky went to Borla Street, trying to find the individual. He entered the building and, at the agent's request, photographed the mailboxes and apartment doors. Later, he asked the agent which apartment to target, and the agent specified a particular number. Varkhovsky spoke with neighbors on the first floor, showed them the photo and asked if they knew the person. They said they did not. He then proceeded to the fifth floor, knocked on the door, but received no answer. For this and other actions, Varkhovsky was paid via cryptocurrency. Shlomi, whose father Emanuel resides in the apartment Varkhovsky visited, expressed disbelief. 'I imagine they knew who they were looking for. My father is over 80, and this has nothing to do with him. It’s absurd that they photographed the building. I’m not worried; my father has no connection to any security matters.' Neighbors in the building were also shocked to learn their residence had been implicated in the indictment. 'I hope there's nothing more to this. It’s unsettling to know that people were photographing our building. I don’t know what to do—it's scary. Anything could happen at this point, but this is very strange,' one resident said. 'The elderly man who lives here has been around for years; he's very nice. It’s frightening to think people were taking photos here,' another neighbor commented. 'A few days ago, people knocked on my door asking if I live alone. They looked like police officers,' a different neighbor added. 'I feel very uncomfortable knowing strangers were taking pictures of my building,' a fourth resident said. The indictment charges Varkhovsky with contact with a foreign agent, possession and transportation of a weapon and conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism. It states that Varkhovsky, who immigrated to Israel from Ukraine eight years ago, maintained contact with the foreign agent via the Telegram app and carried out several tasks for him between August and September 2024. Among these tasks were spraying anti-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu graffiti around Tel Aviv, placing plastic containers with tracking devices near Segula Cemetery in Petah Tikva and sending videos from protests in Tel Aviv in an attempt to contact another demonstrator. Varkhovsky was paid in cryptocurrency for all these activities. The indictment further notes that during the 'period of contact,' Iranian intelligence operatives communicated with Varkhovsky through several Telegram profiles. The foreign agent, calling himself 'Eli,' asked Varkhovsky if he wanted to earn money. When Varkhovsky agreed, the agent sent him $10 via a cryptocurrency wallet. Several days later, the agent instructed Varkhovsky to spray graffiti with the word 'LEHI' in English and Hebrew. Varkhovsky complied, spraying the message at four locations: Barzilai Street, a Tel Aviv train station parking lot, the area between Nahmani and Tiomkin Streets and near Nahalat Binyamin. For each instance of graffiti, the foreign agent transferred $30 to Varkhovsky’s wallet. After completing this task, the agent asked Varkhovsky if he wanted to earn more money. Varkhovsky agreed, and the agent requested that he use a different mobile phone. Varkhovsky complied, and some of their communications were carried out using a Xiaomi device in his possession. In exchange for switching devices, the agent transferred $200 to Varkhovsky. At the end of September, the foreign agent instructed Varkhovsky to purchase two empty 10-liter plastic containers and hide them, along with a tracking device, in bushes behind a bus stop near Segula Cemetery. Varkhovsky followed the instructions, photographing the hiding place and sending the exact location to the agent. For this action, Varkhovsky was paid $100. Taking part in anti-government protests Later, the foreign agent asked Varkhovsky to spray more graffiti, this time with the message 'Netanyahu=Hitler.' Varkhovsky agreed and sprayed the message multiple times on walls and ATMs. Additionally, the agent requested that he film protests in Tel Aviv. Varkhovsky complied, sending a video he had recorded several days earlier, which showed a man throwing wooden planks into a bonfire. In the request to extend Varkhovsky's detention until the end of legal proceedings, authorities noted, 'The prosecution holds substantial evidence supporting the defendant’s guilt, including detailed confessions made during interrogations by the Shin Bet and Israel Police, in which the defendant admitted to the actions described in the indictment, though he claimed he never intended to carry out the assassination of the scientist. 'The prosecution also has Telegram correspondence between the defendant and the foreign agent that aligns with his confession, along with photos and videos documenting some of the tasks he was assigned.' The defendant has a prior conviction, though details were not provided. 'The war between the Shin Bet and Iran is intensifying,' the agency said in a statement. 'The series of cases that have been exposed, and those yet to come, clearly illustrate Iran's relentless efforts to recruit, activate, and carry out attacks within Israel. The Shin Bet's ability to preemptively thwart these attempts prevents Iran from achieving its goal of assassinating Israeli targets. Recruitment efforts through social media are widespread, targeting diverse groups, and some individuals fall into their trap. Those who choose, in times of war, to work for Iranian intelligence in exchange for payment will face severe consequences.'

IDF distributes 'tactical sukkahs' to troops for holiday	Hundreds of compact sukkahs, designed according to Jewish law, were distributed to IDF troops, as well as special holiday kits; But are soldiers even obligated to sit in a sukkah according to Jewish law in time of war? The IDF has introduced the latest innovation for the Sukkot holiday - the tactical sukkah. This compact sukkah unveiled on Tuesday at first may look like it was assembled incorrectly – it stands just about one meter in height, length and width, barely large enough for an adult to sit inside. But that's precisely the point: These sukkahs are designed according to Jewish Law, while keeping a low profile and reducing the risk that a bullet or an anti-tank missile might hit soldiers sitting inside. In addition to the traditional s'chach roof covering, the kit includes an easy-to-assemble metal frame and three elastic straps that make the sukkah’s walls kosher according to Jewish law, without the need for fabric walls. The Logistics Corps of the IDF's Military Rabbinate emphasizes that per the guidelines approved by the chief military rabbi, 'building a sukkah in Gaza or other high-risk areas requires the explicit approval of a commander ranked lieutenant colonel or higher, ensuring that the sukkah poses no security or safety risks.' Along with distributing sukkahs and sets of the four species to all IDF units, the Military Rabbinate has also provided holiday kits to soldiers in southern Lebanon, along the border, and in Gaza and its surrounding areas. Northern Israel received 260 tactical sukkahs and 15,000 pocket-sized prayer books for the holiday season. Interestingly, many sukkahs in northern Israel from last year weren’t dismantled, as Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel immediately after the October 7 attack. As a result, many were damaged or worn out, prompting the recent distribution of tens of thousands of replacement parts for sukkahs. Additionally, 4,000 sets of the Four Species and 5,500 holiday law booklets were distributed. For soldiers in Gaza and the surrounding region, 140 tactical sukkahs, 2,500 compact prayer books, more than 2,400 Four Species sets, and 4,200 holiday law booklets were provided. Wives of reservists wanted to know if their husbands, returning from combat after weeks of reserve duty, were required to sleep in the sukkah The obvious question is whether soldiers are even obligated to sit in a sukkah. Many have recently asked Rabbi Yosef Zvi Rimon, rabbi of the Gush Etzion Regional Council, for clarification. He responded: 'Soldiers in Gaza, Lebanon, or in combat in the West Bank are exempt from the obligation of sitting in a sukkah. These soldiers aren’t just travelers; they’re engaged in a mitzvah and, as the Talmud teaches, 'one who is occupied with a mitzvah is exempt from another mitzvah,' especially in a defensive war. Soldiers staying at the base, who aren’t in combat, should make an effort to sit in a sukkah, except those in high-alert or stressful situations. In all cases, it’s best to consult with the military rabbi.' For soldiers able to sit in a sukkah but who haven’t received the proper equipment, the rabbi reminds them that a sukkah must be at least '10 handbreadths' high, between 80 cm and 96 cm (2.6 feet and 3.1 feet), depending on different rabbinic opinions, and at least 'seven by seven handbreadths' wide, 56 cm by 56 cm (1.8 feet), or 70 cm by 70 cm (2.3 feet) for those more stringent. When necessary, he notes, 'it is permissible to make a sukkah using car doors, with both doors open, and place schach above them. However, make sure the gap beneath the doors isn’t more than 24 cm. You can fix this by placing stones or something stable under the doors, or by parking the car so the doors are above a curb. The third wall can be made by adding a partition or parking another car nearby.' One sensitive issue has arisen in inquiries from the wives of reservists. They wanted to know if their husbands, returning from combat after weeks of reserve duty, were required to sleep in the sukkah, or if, according to Jewish law, they were allowed to sleep with their wives instead. 'The Talmud states that one must not sleep outside the sukkah,' Rimon replied, but he emphasized: 'Rabbi Moses Isserles justified those who are lenient. He said that since one is supposed to sleep with their spouse as they would at home, and since a wife generally cannot sleep in a sukkah, the husband is also exempt. While this reasoning is considered leniency, and many were hesitant to sleep in the sukkah outside Israel, in Israel, we should strive to have a proper, comfortable sukkah and sleep in it whenever possible.

Can Israel really destroy Iran's nuclear program?	Experts warn an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites could push Tehran closer to developing a nuclear weapon, potentially backfiring; diplomacy is seen as a safer path, since any military action risks wider regional conflict Could Israel destroy Iran’s nuclear program if it wanted to? And if Israel chose to attack Iranian nuclear facilities, would it be effective? Several experts say the outcome may not be what the Israeli public hopes for. An attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities could strengthen Iran’s resolve to acquire a nuclear weapon rather than eliminate its capability, says James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'They play, you play,' said Tel Aviv University Professor Eyal Zisser. 'You try not to cross a line. When the line is crossed, it’s total war. We have to consider what the repercussions would be.' Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon, but it has operated a civilian atomic energy program for over five decades. Analysts believe Iran could produce enough enriched uranium and the necessary components to build a nuclear weapon in a relatively short time. However, this doesn’t mean Israel can –or should – target Iran’s nuclear program the way it did with Iraq or Syria. Iran’s nuclear program relies on centrifuges rather than nuclear reactors, which are used to enrich uranium, James Acton explains. These are the same types of centrifuges that fuel power reactors. Centrifuges are small, about 20 centimeters to 30 centimeters in diameter, and one meter to two meters tall. Acton says Iran has at least a few thousand of these at two main sites: Natanz and Fordow. This situation is very different from Israel’s attacks on Iraq’s Osirak reactor in 1981 and Syria’s reactor in 2007. In those cases, the nuclear weapons programs were concentrated in a single, large facility centered around one reactor, which had required significant resources and investment to build. As a result, destroying those reactors effectively dismantled the entire nuclear program. The Osirak strike set Iraq’s nuclear ambitions back by at least a decade, while Syria, due to its ongoing civil war, has not been able to rebuild. Acton explains that Iran would likely respond by relocating any new facilities deeper underground or even hiding centrifuge operations in regular, unmarked industrial buildings in plain sight. As a result, Israel would have to continuously track and detect these sites, potentially launching new strikes every year or two. 'While an Israeli strike can dent its capabilities in the short term, it can’t remove those capabilities in the long term,' according to Acton. Regarding the two known facilities – though there may be additional clandestine sites – Natanz consists of a large underground facility housing around 50,000 centrifuges and a smaller facility at ground level. Acton estimated that the underground facility is no more than 10 meters deep. In contrast, the Fordow facility is buried within a mountain, likely 60 meters to 80 meters underground. Given this, there is considerable evidence suggesting that Israel lacks the capability to destroy Fordow. Acton explains that Israel would need the U.S.-developed Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) for such a mission. However, even if the U.S. were willing to provide Israel with the weapon, there would only be a practical way to deliver it to Iran with U.S. assistance. The MOP, over 20 feet long, is much larger than other bunker busters and penetrates deeper than any conventional alternative. Professor Hooshang Amirahmadi, president of the American Iranian Council and a professor at Rutgers University, suggested an alternative: using an Azerbaijani airbase near western Iran to get closer to the target. However, despite Israel’s strong ties with Azerbaijan, the country has never publicly agreed to such a plan, and Amirahmadi doubts it would allow Israel to do so. As such, unless Israel can carry out a cyberattack or find another method to disrupt Fordow, it will likely have to hold off without full US support. Even if attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities were possible, it might not be the best course of action, according to Acton. Although U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in June that Iran could produce enough fissile material for a weapon in 'one or two weeks,' the country would still need to take additional steps to turn this material into a functional weapon. Acton explains that he believes Iran is aiming to have the capability to build a nuclear weapon quickly but has not yet decided to actually produce one. 'An Israeli strike makes it much, much more likely that it will make the decision to do so,' Acton says. He added that if Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, it would feel significantly more emboldened. 'One can imagine an Iran more willing to strike Israel and target civilians with ballistic missiles, potentially in larger numbers,' and using its proxies more openly,' he says. 'I think a nuclear-armed Iran is a pretty bad prospect for Israel.' Both Acton and Amirahmadi agree that diplomacy is a better option and likely the one the US would prefer over a risky military response. Israeli action without U.S. support could strain the relationship between the two countries. 'The U.S. has already said it does not like the idea of Israel attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities because it thinks it can stop enrichment in Iran through negotiations, just like they did last time,' according to Amirahmadi. In 2015, Iran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. However, the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018. Acton believes another deal could be reached – perhaps not as sophisticated as the original JCPOA, but one that could still verifiably keep Iran short of developing a nuclear bomb. Acton notes that the U.S. would likely need to lead such an initiative, though another country could publicly take the lead while the US provides sanctions relief as part of the deal. He also expressed concern that diplomacy might be abandoned altogether if former President Donald Trump returns to office. On the other hand, he is 'not optimistic' that Vice President Kamala Harris, if elected, would prioritize such a deal, although she is 'temperamentally much more inclined to reach an agreement. ' Alternatively, Israel could choose to target Iran’s oil infrastructure, which might have an even greater impact, Amirahmadi said. 'What Iran is really concerned about is not that Israel will hit its nuclear program,' Amirahmadi explained. Instead, he said, a strike on the country’s oil supply and shipping infrastructure 'will certainly escalate this conflict' and could even lead to regime change because it would 'stop Iran from functioning economically.' However, he cautioned that if such a strike were to happen, 'you could not control Iran because Iran will feel very lost.'

Israel's long and winding road to achieving its war goals	Analysis: Israel’s strategy hinges on IDF military successes in Gaza and Lebanon, aiming to push adversaries toward a diplomatic resolution on Israeli terms; while the army has made progress, the political echelon has yet to take the necessary steps Israel has a clear strategy guiding both the military and political leadership in its current multi-front war. This is the impression gained from conversations with senior defense and intelligence officials, as well as field visits in Gaza and Lebanon. A note of caution: this strategy is not designed, nor does it aim, to deliver a 'total victory' in the war, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may have hoped while still in shock from the horrors of the October 7 attacks. However, it is capable of significantly improving the national security of all Israeli citizens and making a substantial positive impact on the personal safety of residents in the Western Negev and the Galilee—especially the 80,000 Israelis who have been displaced from their homes. The foundation of this strategy is the war's objectives, as formulated and approved by the Cabinet. These objectives, while intentionally vague due to political and coalition considerations, have been translated by the IDF into concrete terms. For each front, the IDF established its 'strategic purpose,' as understood by the top generals based on the Cabinet's decisions. From this, the IDF determined the specific missions, resources and combat methods. While the tactics and means have evolved over the past year of fighting, the strategic purpose for each front has remained consistent. The core principles of Israel’s political-security strategy are clear: the IDF will achieve military gains in Gaza and Lebanon that will compel the enemy on each front to seek, or even request, a diplomatic settlement to end the fighting on terms favorable to Israel and aligned with the Cabinet’s war objectives. In the other five theaters, including Iran, the goal is to restore and strengthen the strategic deterrence that was severely eroded on October 7. The transition from military success to a diplomatic resolution will be decided by the political leadership, specifically the prime minister, with Cabinet approval. In the other five theaters, including Iran, the goal is to restore and strengthen the strategic deterrence that was severely eroded on October 7. The aim is to reestablish a situation where Israel's adversaries, as well as those sitting on the sidelines, see Israel as a power not worth confronting—and, if possible, one worth cooperating with. Favorable terms in Lebanon This strategy is advancing more quickly in Lebanon than in other theaters, with the IDF nearing a point where diplomatic negotiations for a cease-fire may soon be possible, according to defense sources. Preliminary talks have already begun with intermediaries and relevant parties. This progress is largely due to the military achievements on the ground. The IDF has reportedly neutralized two-thirds of Hezbollah’s long-range missile capabilities and a significant portion of its short-range firepower. Hezbollah and Shiite leaders in Lebanon have expressed willingness to agree to a cease-fire in southern Lebanon without linking it to the ongoing war in Gaza. Additionally, Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force and other terrorists have been pushed 5 to 8 kilometers (3 to 5 miles) back from the border, with some forces retreating north of the Litani River. As a result, Hezbollah and Shiite leaders in Lebanon have expressed willingness to agree to a cease-fire in southern Lebanon without linking it to the ongoing war in Gaza. While the IDF believes there is room to further deepen its gains, the military has already submitted a proposal to the political leadership outlining Israel’s conditions for a potential agreement. The defense establishment hopes a diplomatic resolution in Lebanon will include the following: the removal of Hezbollah’s Radwan Force and its direct fire capabilities beyond the Litani River; restrictions on Lebanese civilians approaching the border; an internationally backed arms embargo on transfers from Iran to Lebanon; the deployment of the Lebanese Army to the south, strengthened and equipped by the U.S. and European nations under close supervision; and most crucially, ensuring that Israel retains freedom of military and intelligence operations within Lebanon to enforce any cease-fire. Unlike Gaza, the conditions in Lebanon are more conducive to a resolution. Lebanon has a government—albeit dysfunctional—with which negotiations are possible. Unlike Gaza, the conditions in Lebanon are more conducive to a resolution. Lebanon has a government—albeit dysfunctional—with which negotiations are possible, and there is support for a settlement from key international players, including the U.S., France, Saudi Arabia and other moderate Sunni nations. These countries are willing to fund Lebanon’s reconstruction and push for political reforms. Even Iran, Hezbollah’s patron, is reportedly interested in halting the fighting to allow Hezbollah time to regroup and rebuild its forces. Additionally, Hezbollah has been weakened, and both the Shiite community and broader Lebanese population, including over a million internally displaced people, are eager for a diplomatic settlement. Far from a settlement in Gaza Israel remains far from achieving its strategic objectives in Gaza, despite significant military advances. While Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have been largely dismantled as conventional military forces, both groups retain some active guerilla capabilities, and key elements of their infrastructure, including tunnels, remain intact. Hamas continues to recruit terrorists and rebuild command centers in areas vacated by the IDF. More concerning, the group has not relinquished its civilian control over Gaza and is using international humanitarian aid as a tool of governance, distributing it selectively and even selling supplies to fund its operations. There is no external force with enough influence over Hamas to secure the release of hostages or force the group to fully cede control of the Gaza Strip. Despite mediation efforts by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has so far refused to engage in negotiations, leaving both Israel and Gaza’s residents at an impasse. The military operation focused on Jabaliya has not achieved its full objectives. IDF officials admit that pressure on Hamas is insufficient and suggest that additional forces may be required to clear the remaining civilians. The IDF recently launched an operation in northern Gaza, led by the 162nd Division, with Hamas claiming it is an attempt to implement the so-called 'Generals' Plan' devised by retired IDF Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland. The plan aims to push northern Gaza residents southward, followed by a blockade that would cut off humanitarian aid to those remaining, whom Israel could classify as combatants under international law. Although Israel has not officially confirmed this plan, it has not denied it either. Currently, the military operation focused on Jabaliya has not achieved its full objectives. IDF officials admit that pressure on Hamas is insufficient and suggest that additional forces may be required to clear the remaining civilians and force Hamas into negotiations, possibly over hostages and an end to the fighting. The primary challenge, however, remains finding an alternative to Hamas’ civilian rule, which the group clings to as the key to its survival and ability to rebuild. Hamas' grip on power is reinforced by its control over humanitarian aid distribution. Israel is exploring options to wrest control of aid from Hamas, including the possibility of using a U.S. civilian company, under IDF protection, to deliver and manage aid distribution. Various proposals are under consideration, but the defense establishment has made it clear that IDF troops will not be directly responsible for humanitarian aid distribution, to avoid risking soldiers' lives. While not officially endorsed by the Cabinet, Israel’s undeclared war objective is to restore its strategic deterrence against the entire Shiite axis led by Iran. The IDF strikes on Hezbollah and Hamas have largely rebuilt much of the deterrence lost after the October 7 attacks. However, Iran—the 'head of the snake' driving the ring of fire around Israel—remains neither fully deterred nor significantly weakened. As for a formal alternative civilian government in Gaza, Israel acknowledges it does not want to assume control of the Palestinian enclave. Netanyahu’s office has also ruled out the Palestinian Authority (PA) as a potential governing force, not only due to opposition from far-right coalition partners Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, but also because the PA, under Mahmoud Abbas, is seen as too weak to assert control over Hamas. Israeli officials believe the PA would, at best, manage civilian affairs—such as education, healthcare and infrastructure—while allowing Hamas and PIJ to continue operating as armed factions, similar to the situation in Lebanon with Hezbollah. For Israel, this scenario is unacceptable. Despite military successes, such as dismantling Hamas and PIJ’s armies and securing strategic corridors in Gaza, Netzarim and Philadelphi, Israel has no clear plan for dismantling Hamas' civilian control, which remains one of the key war objectives. The situation requires creative and flexible solutions that the current government, under Netanyahu, has yet to produce, largely due to political and personal constraints. Deterring Iran While not officially endorsed by the Cabinet, Israel’s undeclared war objective is to restore its strategic deterrence against the entire Shiite axis led by Iran. The IDF strikes on Hezbollah and Hamas have largely rebuilt much of the deterrence lost after the October 7 attacks. However, Iran—the 'head of the snake' driving the ring of fire around Israel—remains neither fully deterred nor significantly weakened. Although it has also taken hits, and the combined losses of Hamas and Hezbollah, along with Iran's missile attack failures, have sharply increased Israel’s deterrence, the goal is still not fully achieved. Much now depends on the impact of Israel's response to the Iranian missile strike on October 1. A key factor in Israel’s deterrence, and its ability to achieve its war aims, is its relationship with the U.S. and international legitimacy. With the U.S. election race in full swing, Netanyahu—who, along with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, is navigating Israel’s U.S. relations—must tread carefully. While Netanyahu has made no secret of his hope for a Trump victory, he understands that Vice President Kamala Harris has a strong chance of winning, and thus must maintain good relations with her as well. This explains why, according to The Washington Post, Israel informed the U.S. that it does not intend to target Iran’s oil or nuclear facilities in its retaliatory strikes. It also explains why Israel, at the request of the U.S. and France, has significantly reduced its airstrikes in Beirut to avoid harming American civilians. The bottom line: Israel has a strategy that the IDF is implementing with some success, but the real challenges lie ahead in the coming months. There may be results by the end of the year, but a note of caution is warranted—Israel’s current government and coalition are unpredictable and could become an obstacle to a diplomatic resolution that would secure most of the war’s objectives.

Canada suffers 670% jump in number of antisemitic incidents	Report by the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism shows a dramatic increase in hate crimes against Jews in Canada since war broke out in Israel. The most recent incident reported: a shooting outside a Jewish girls' school in Toronto during Yom Kippur Canada has experienced a dramatic 670% increase in the number of reported antisemitic incidents since October 7, 2023, compared to the same period last year, according to a report by the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism released on Tuesday. This increase includes violent incidents such as shootings at Jewish institutions, and arson attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and other community institutions. Although Jews make up only 1.4% of the Canadian population, they are the victims of 70% of the hate crimes committed on religious grounds in Canada. In the city of Toronto, 19% of all hate crimes in 2023 were aimed at Jews, a figure that jumped dramatically in the last quarter of the year, at the same time as the growing tensions in the Middle East. In the latest incident, Toronto police have opened an investigation into a suspected hate crime following a shooting outside a Jewish girls' school on Yom Kippur. No casualties were reported, but damage was done to the school, including a window that was shattered by bullets fired at the school building. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau commented on the incident and wrote: 'Antisemitism is a dangerous and ugly form of hatred, and we will not allow it to pass in silence.' Pro-Palestinian protests have contributed significantly to the rise of antisemitism in Canada, particularly among campus activist groups and leftist organizations, with many doing so while connecting anti-Israel sentiments with broader revolutionary ideas. This led to increased expressions of support for terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah, alongside incidents of violence that occurred during demonstrations in major cities such as Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto, as well as prominent universities such as McGill. In the Israeli report, for example, a number of 'Prominent Antisemitic Generators and Influencers in Canada' are cited, including Sarah Jama, a provincial member of parliament in Ontario. Jama publicly blamed Israel for the massacre of approximately 1,200 Israelis by Hamas on October 7, 2023, leading to her condemnation in Ontario's provincial parliament. On November 25, 2023, at a rally in Ottawa, Jama called for the destruction of Israel using the slogan 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.' Jama publicly denied documented atrocities committed by Hamas in the October 7 terrorist attack, including the rape of Israeli women, claiming there was no actual evidence of it. She is associated with groups such as the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), the BDS movement and other anti-Israel groups. She expressed support for the pro-Hamas encampment at the University of Toronto, which was part of a broader movement on North American campuses to promote anti-Israel rhetoric and harass Jewish students. Another influencer in the report is Laith Marouf, of Lebanese descent, a former consultant funded by the Department of Canadian Heritage. Marouf made a number of explosive antisemitic comments on social media, including referring to Jews as 'bags of human feces' and declaring that they deserve a 'bullet to the head.' Despite his history of hate speech, Marouf's organization, the Community Media Advocacy Center (CMAC), has received over $500,000 in Canadian government contracts. When his antisemitic comments came to light, it sparked outrage in Canada. In 2022, after Marouf's statements were revealed, the Canadian government suspended a $133,000 contract with CMAC, and the Department of Canadian Heritage took legal action to recover the funds. Another body linked to hatred of Israel is the Samidoun organization, which the United States and Canada have already announced sanctions against due to its support for terrorism. The Canadian branch of the organization is a pro-Palestinian network established in 2011. Its stated goal is to 'support Palestinian prisoners and advocate for the Palestinian struggle against Israel' through rallies, conferences and demonstrations. Samidoun has already been outlawed in Israel and Germany for its open support of Palestinian terrorism and ties to groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Other names that appear in the report are those of Brandon Taylor Moore, a Canadian-American real estate broker who is active on social media - his comments blame Jews for global issues, promote antisemitic myths, and suggest Jewish complicity in the Holocaust; and Samira Mohyeddin - an independent Canadian journalist and influencer, a former host on CBC Radio in Canada and currently host of the 'On the Line' podcast. She promotes anti-Zionist and antisemitic content on her platforms, particularly in reference to Israel's alleged genocidal intentions. The Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: 'The current reports produced by the ministry allow us to closely follow and monitor the state of antisemitism in each country. In the past year, the Jewish community in Canada has faced a reality it had not known before: a dramatic increase in the scope of antisemitic events, verbal and physical attacks in the public sphere and discourse. We are working together with the Jewish community on this issue, and this coming November the ministry will hold a course for 30 rabbis and community leaders from Canada, which should give Canadian Jews a significant boost during this difficult time. We are closely following the perpetrators of antisemitism and delegitimization against the State of Israel, and are constantly working together with the various authorities to narrow their steps and outlaw them.'

Preparing to attack Iran: Guarantees to US, Russian pressure and ...	It's been two weeks since Iran attacked Israel and there has been no response yet; US received guarantees that Iran's oil and nuclear facilities will not be the targets, at least this time; Russia is also pressing for a limited retaliation; Gallant: 'Our response will be precise, painful and surprising' Two weeks have passed since Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, and there is still no Israeli response. The United States believes that they have received guarantees from Israel that this response will not include Iranian oil or nuclear facilities, but those assurances do not extend to future attacks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to hold a limited consultation regarding the response on Friday, and on Sunday the political-security cabinet will convene. After the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal reported that Netanyahu informed the Biden administration that he planned to attack Iranian t recent attack. military targets and not oil or nuclear facilities, the New York Times also reported on the decision, but emphasized that the decision only refers to the response to the most recent attack. According to the report, a final decision has not yet been made, and the Israeli response attack could still be large in scope, which may lead to several rounds of attacks. Two sources familiar with the matter said that 'Israel's assurances to the Americans touched on the upcoming attack, which means that Israel can still hit more ambitious targets in future rounds of attacks against Iran.' The Biden administration believes that sending the THAAD air defense system, with about 100 soldiers to operate it, is expected to somewhat alleviate Israel's fears of the Iranian response. Reports from the past few days indicate that the arrival of that battery - components of which have already landed in Israel - is considered part of the coordination between Israel and the U.S., and possibly is a return that Israel received in exchange for responding to U.S. requests to refrain from attacking nuclear facilities. Still, the Associated Press reported that U.S. officials warned that the assurances received by the United States 'are not set in stone and the circumstances may change.' They said that Israel had a 'mixed past' regarding keeping promises, and that more than once internal politics led to change. Meanwhile, pressure is also coming from Russia. The Russian President's special representative for the Middle East and African countries, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, said that Moscow maintains contacts at various levels with Israel, and conveyed Russia's concerns regarding a possible Israeli response to Iran. 'We are in contact with the embassies, our ambassador also maintains contacts through other channels, and they are conducted daily,' the deputy minister noted. In an interview with the Arabic-language Al-Hurra network, IDF spokesman Brigadier General Daniel Hagari was asked about Israel's response plan to Iran and said that Israel 'knows how to protect its citizens.' He was asked if the same THAAD system that Israel received from Washington is an indication of an imminent Israeli attack and answered: 'Israel knows what to do at the time and in the manner it chooses.' Hagari did not explicitly answer the question of whether Israel would coordinate the response with other countries, emphasizing that Israel is not fighting Iran or the Iranian people, but the regime. In preparation for that Israeli attack, and Iran's expected response, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant convened the Supreme Military (Emergency Economy) Committee. In the discussion, Gallant insisted on the readiness of the various systems, with an emphasis on the health, energy and communication systems, to deal with a scenario of widespread rocket fire at the State of Israel. 'After defending Israel about two weeks ago from a vicious Iranian attack of 200 ballistic missiles that were fired at us, we have no intention of putting up with a violation of our sovereignty and an attempt to harm Israeli citizens and infrastructure without reacting' Gallant said. 'The response against Iran will be precise, painful and surprising. ... The meaning of such an action could also affect other places. We have seen examples of this.' 'We have no interest in opening additional fronts and additional operations,' Gallant added. 'I am involved in preparing the security system, together with The Chief of Staff, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. All in all, we are all seeing things eye to eye, both in relation to the need for a response and the essence of the response.'

Israeli security officials said on Wednesday the 'war between the Shin Bet and Iran is escalating,' with recent cases highlighting Iran’s relentless attempts to recruit and activate operatives inside Israel. According to the officials, Iran has been broadly targeting diverse audiences through social media, with some individuals falling into the trap. 'Those who choose to work for Iranian intelligence during wartime in exchange for money will pay a heavy price,' officials warned. The Shin Bet credited its efforts in preventing Tehran from achieving a symbolic victory, such as assassinating Israeli targets.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydgeg6kyg	2024-10-16T00:50:41-07:00	
US delivers 'harshest message in decades,' officials say after ar...	While France, Italy and others have imposed arms embargoes on Israel, Blinken-Austin memo stands out; officials say urgent steps needed to increase Gaza aid and avoid munitions crisis; US calls for Red Cross visits to Palestinian inmates and freeze on anti-UNRWA legislation France, Italy and other European countries have already imposed arms embargoes on Israel, but the new U.S. threat to impose a similar embargo if humanitarian aid is not delivered to Gaza is particularly unusual. Israeli officials said Tuesday night that this is the harshest letter the United States has sent to Israel in decades, particularly with the threat to cut off the supply of weapons. Israel will soon have to take significant action to increase humanitarian aid to avoid a crisis with the U.S. There has been no substantial change in Israel's policy regarding humanitarian aid to Gaza, according to Israeli officials. They attribute the harsh letter to the U.S. administration's lack of confidence in Israel's intentions. U.S. officials reportedly feared that Israel was planning to starve Gaza, in line with the so-called 'General's Plan' proposed by retired IDF Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, which involves isolating northern Gaza. Israel has removed the private sector from the distribution of aid and closed crossings in northern Gaza, leading to a significant reduction in the number of aid trucks entering the Palestinian enclave. This raised suspicions in Washington that Israel was deliberately limiting aid. Recent discussions about having the IDF manage aid distribution did little to alleviate those concerns. The backdrop to this situation is the growing crisis of trust between the White House and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Notably, the letter from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was addressed to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, bypassing Netanyahu. The letter demands that Israel take concrete steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within 30 days. In addition to ensuring regular aid transfers, the U.S. also calls on Israel to allow Red Cross visits to Palestinian detainees and to halt Knesset legislation that would prevent the Palestinian aid agency UNRWA from operating in Israel. The deeper implication of the Blinken-Austin letter is that if Israel does not address the humanitarian crisis in northern Gaza within 30 days, it could face a severe arms crisis, as the U.S. continues to delay shipments of heavy bombs. Failure to meet the U.S. demands could jeopardize the continuation of military aid, which requires approval from both Blinken and Austin. The letter cites Section 620i of the Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibits military aid to countries that block U.S. humanitarian assistance. It also references a national security memorandum issued by President Joe Biden in February, requiring the State Department to report to Congress on Israel’s compliance with U.S. and international law in its use of American weapons. Senior officials said the letter was no surprise, as the U.S. had been warning Israel for weeks that it was heading in this direction. They described it as a 'wake-up call' for Israel to comply with U.S. legislation, noting that the administration’s ability to provide munitions could be constrained. In their letter, Blinken and Austin emphasized that the U.S. State and Defense departments are required to continuously evaluate Israel's adherence to its commitment to 'facilitate and not arbitrarily deny, restrict or otherwise impede, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance and U.S. government-supported international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance' to Gaza. 'We are now writing to underscore the U.S. government's deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory,' the American officials wrote. 'Despite the July transition from combat operations to Special Counterterrorism Operations in the Gaza Strip, multiple evacuation orders have forced 1.7 million people into a narrow coastal strip from Muwasi to Deir al-Balah. Extreme overcrowding has put these civilians at risk of lethal contagions,' according to the letter. The letter is a 'wake-up call' for Israel to comply with U.S. legislation 'We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza,' the letter also said. Since Israel’s assurances in March and a subsequent letter in April, which had led to improvements in aid delivery, the amount of assistance entering Gaza has dropped by over 50%, according to the letter. Aid deliveries in September were reportedly the lowest in a year. The U.S. letter outlined a series of demands, including allowing at least 350 trucks of aid into Gaza daily, instituting humanitarian pauses across the Strip, permitting civilians in Muwasi and the humanitarian zone to move east before winter, canceling evacuation orders where no operational need exists, speeding up World Food Program efforts, removing dual-use items from restricted lists and creating an expedited aid route through Ashdod port. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the Biden administration had made similar requests regarding humanitarian aid in April and had received a positive response from Israel. 'This letter comes following a decrease in the amount of humanitarian aid getting into Gaza, which we have been very worried about since the beginning of the conflict,' he told a press briefing. 'Why was the letter sent? Because there was a drop in humanitarian aid. It's not that we didn't convey these concerns to the Israelis. 'There is a sense of urgency regarding the desperate need for aid in Gaza. President Biden has consistently raised this issue with the Israelis. He has been fully aware of the efforts to communicate these concerns, both verbally and in writing, and it has come up in his talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu.' 'The weapon may lead to a violation of international law' Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron called for an end to the transfer of weapons to Israel that might be used in the war in Gaza. This followed his support for a September 18 resolution initiated by the Palestinians at the UN General Assembly. Relations between France and Israel reached a nadir on Monday evening when Macron criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a closed session with his ministers. 'Netanyahu must not forget that his country was established by a UN resolution; he cannot disregard his obligations to those resolutions,' Macron reportedly said according to French newspaper Le Parisien. Netanyahu later rebuked the French leader's remarks in a phone call. On Tuesday evening, the French government decided to ban Israeli companies from participating in Euronaval, the world’s largest naval weapons fair, scheduled to be held next month in Paris. Twelve Israeli companies had planned to exhibit at the event. If this negative trend continues, it will likely also prevent Israeli participation in the Air Salon in Le Bourget, the crown jewel of defense exhibitions. Britain has already announced the suspension of around 30 arms export licenses to Israel out of roughly 350. The decision was made by the Labour government, which emphasized that it was not an arms embargo. It explained that an inspection had found a 'clear risk' that the weapons could lead to 'a significant violation of international law.' Meanwhile, Germany has begun rejecting Israeli requests to purchase various weapons and is effectively operating a 'silent embargo' on Israel. Italy halted arms transfers on October 7, 2023, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her country’s parliament. 'We have frozen all contracts,' she said. Referring to an incident in which the IDF fired at a UNIFIL post in southern Lebanon, Meloni added that she would visit Beirut.

Tel Aviv man arrested for allegedly spying for Iran, planned assa...	Vladimir Varkhovsky, 35, allegedly agreed to assassinate scientist for $100,000 and had acquired weapon for task; suspect reportedly promised assistance in fleeing to Russia following assassination Israeli authorities have arrested a Tel Aviv resident on suspicion of carrying out missions for Iranian intelligence, including graffiti, distributing flyers and gathering information on Israeli targets, Israeli Police announced Wednesday morning. According to officials, Vladimir Varkhovsky, 35, allegedly agreed to assassinate an Israeli scientist for $100,000 and had obtained a weapon for the task. The Shin Bet said communication with his handlers was in English. He is expected to appear in Lod District Court for a remand hearing later Wednesday. The indictment accuses Varkhovsky of contacting a foreign agent, illegal possession of a weapon and conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism. According to the indictment, Varkhovsky communicated with an Iranian agent via the Telegram messaging app and carried out several tasks for the agent between August and September 2024. These included spraying anti-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu graffiti around Tel Aviv, placing plastic containers with tracking devices near Segula Cemetery in Petah Tikva and filming protests in Tel Aviv in an attempt to connect with another demonstrator. Varkhovsky was reportedly instructed to retrieve a pistol intended for the assassination of the Israeli scientist. The foreign agent promised him $100,000 and assistance in fleeing to Russia after the murder. Varkhovsky collected the gun and matching magazine at a pre-arranged location as part of the plot. He received payment for his activities in digital currency. In his remand request, prosecutors noted that 'the defendant committed serious security offenses while Israel is engaged in one of its most challenging wars, with Iran among the adversaries. The defendant knew the agent represented a hostile entity and continued cooperating with him. His actions were thwarted thanks to the efforts of Israeli security forces, who arrested him before the assassination plan could be completed.' The intelligence network that led to Varkhovsky’s arrest was uncovered through a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Israeli police’s serious crime Lahav 433 unit, often dubbed 'the Israeli FBI.' 'Varkhovsky documented some of the tasks he carried out and received payment for them. His communication with Iranian agents was conducted in English, and he was instructed to purchase a dedicated phone for these interactions,' the Shin Bet said in a statement. The Shin Bet and police warned that Iranian intelligence has used social media platforms to recruit unsuspecting Israelis for various tasks. 'While some assignments may initially seem harmless, they pose a genuine threat to national security. Many Israelis who received suspicious outreach did not respond and alerted the authorities,' the statement added. Superintendent Maor Goren, head of the security division at Lahav 433, added: 'This case is part of a series of serious investigations where Israeli citizens were recruited by foreign agents. However, this case stands out due to its severity and boldness: the defendant had already armed himself with a pistol, magazine and bullets, after agreeing to carry out the murder of a scientist for $100,000 and planning to flee the country with the foreign agent’s help to Russia immediately after the attack.' The indictment follows a similar case just days earlier, in which a couple from the nearby city of Ramat Gan was charged with contacting an Iranian agent and agreeing to assassinate Israeli officials.

Xi says China willing to be a partner, friend with the US	Chinese President Xi Jinping said a successful partnership between China and the United States is an opportunity for the two countries to be enablers for each other's development rather than an obstacle, according to state media on Wednesday.

North Korean state media said on Wednesday around 1.4 million young people had applied to join or return to the army this week, blaming Seoul for a provocative drone incursion that had brought the 'tense situation to the brink of war.' The fiery rhetoric comes after North Korea last week accused Seoul of sending drones over Pyongyang that scattered a 'huge number' of anti-North leaflets. It then blew up inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the border on Tuesday, and warned that the South would 'pay a dear price.' The young people, including students and youth league officials who had signed petitions to join the army, were determined to fight in a 'sacred war of destroying the enemy with the arms of the revolution,' the official KCNA news agency said. Photographs published by KCNA showed what it said were young people signing petitions at an undisclosed location.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wyi0ny1l	2024-10-15T23:23:52-07:00	
After 6-day lull, IDF strikes Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut	Israeli fighter jets strike Hezbollah weapons cache stored in underground facility in Dahieh district, days after request from Biden to reduce military actions in Lebanese capital Israeli fighter jets struck a Hezbollah weapons cache stored in an underground facility in Beirut's Dahieh district early Wednesday, the IDF said, marking Israel's first strike on the Hezbollah stronghold in six days. Sky News Arabia reported explosions in Dahieh shortly after IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee issued a public warning, calling on residents of specific buildings in the Hezbollah-controlled suburb of the Lebanese capital to evacuate immediately, claiming that they were near Hezbollah facilities targeted for destruction. 'This is an urgent warning. You are located near Hezbollah facilities the IDF will strike soon. For your safety and the safety of your families, you must leave,' Adraee wrote on X. The military said extensive precautions were taken to minimize civilian casualties, including prior warnings to the local population guided by intelligence from the IDF’s Intelligence Directorate. The strike came after a brief lull in Beirut attacks, which coincided with a request from U.S. President Joe Biden to reduce military actions in Lebanon’s capital. In addition to the Beirut strikes, the IDF carried out extensive airstrikes in southern Lebanon, including in the city of Nabatieh. Earlier, the IDF reported that 98th Division forces had killed dozens of terrorists in southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours in clashes and airstrikes. The forces also discovered a massive cache of weapons, including firearms, grenades, rocket launchers and anti-tank missiles aimed at northern Israeli communities. The IDF also revealed that, with guidance from the Northern Command, more than 140 Hezbollah targets were hit across 50 locations in Lebanon. These strikes targeted weapons depots, rocket launchers, military sites and terrorist squads. In one instance, 91st Division troops spotted terrorists firing at them and directed an Israeli Air Force aircraft to eliminate the attackers. Overnight Wednesday, Hezbollah launched a heavy barrage of rockets at Safed and surrounding areas in northern Israel. The IDF reported that around 50 rockets were fired from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted. Several rockets hit the area, including one that landed in a residential yard. Shrapnel caused damage to a building, and two civilians were lightly injured while seeking shelter and were taken to a hospital. Meanwhile, in Gaza, Israeli airstrikes, in coordination with the 454th Fire Division, killed Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, commander of Hamas' drone operations in northern Gaza. Al-Mabhouh had overseen drone launches aimed at Israel and IDF forces. In Jabaliya, 162nd Division troops eliminated terrorists in close-quarter firefights and airstrikes. Additionally, in the Rafah area, Nahal Brigade soldiers, operating under the Gaza Division, used drones to target and neutralize an armed terrorist cell planning an attack.

IDF raids Hezbollah strongholds from Mount Dov, operates special ...	Forces from the Heharim Brigade, including the special mountain infantry Alpinist Unit, carried out targeted raids in dense terrain within Hezbollah’s Radwan Force compounds Forces from the 810th Heharim (Mountain) Regional Brigade, including the special mountain infantry Alpinist Unit, have been conducting targeted raids from the Har Dov area into dense terrain in southern Lebanon over the last week. These operations, under the command of the 210th Division, aim to strike Hezbollah's terror infrastructure and prevent its entrenchment in the area. So far, the brigade has carried out several focused raids on Hezbollah’s Radwan Force compounds, which were used by terrorists to launch terror activities. Alongside the Alpinists, the forces also include the 9204th Infantry Battalion and the 8130th Armored Battalion of the HeHarim Brigade. They have successfully located and destroyed weapons caches, surveillance equipment and military infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah. In one abandoned Hezbollah compound, soldiers found a solar panel that had been providing the terrorists with electricity, enabling them to remain there for extended periods. Among the items destroyed were technological devices and additional weaponry. Footage from the site revealed batteries at the entrance and a Star of David imprinted on the ground – likely trampled by the terrorists. 'This was a massive complex meant to sustain them for a long time without outside support,' said one soldier in a video. 'In the past two weeks, we’ve been operating inside Lebanon to locate and destroy the enemy’s infrastructure and weaponry, which they’ve accumulated over a long period to use against us when the time came,' Colonel Liron Appleman, commander of the Heharim Brigade, said. ' We prepared for this day, trained our troops, and we’ll do whatever it takes to complete the mission. We will change the security situation here and bring the residents of the north back to their homes quickly and safely.' The Alpinist Unit consists of reservists who served in elite infantry units during their regular service. During normal times, regular infantry units patrol the upper Hermon Ridge in the summer, but as winter approaches, only the Alpinists are called up, as they are the only ones trained to operate in the heavy snow.

Murder, drugs and arms smuggling: Meet Maher al-Assad, Iran's man...	Syrian president's brother and commander of the elite Fourth Division plays a key role in advancing Tehran’s influence within the regime; even his sister-in-law accuses him of being equally complicit in crimes against the Syrian people On Sunday, Sept. 29, Israel reportedly launched an airstrike on a villa in the Yafour area on the outskirts of Damascus, according to Arab media reports. The villa is said to belong to Syria's elite Fourth Division, commanded by Maher al-Assad, the brother of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition-affiliated war monitor, reported that senior Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard officials frequented the villa. No casualties were reported in the strike. The group also claimed that Assad had been warned that any transfer of weapons from the Fourth Division’s stockpiles to Lebanon would make them a target of future Israeli strikes. It described Assad as a key figure in Iran’s influence within the Syrian regime and someone closely aligned with Hezbollah. Although rumors circulated about Assad’s fate following the attack, Syrian sources said he was not present at the villa at the time. Over the years, there have been multiple unconfirmed reports of Maher being injured or killed, but none have been verified. Following the villa strike, additional airstrikes were reported in Syria in the following days. Israel has long aimed to disrupt Hezbollah’s weapons supply routes through Syria, which are part of the broader Iranian-Shia axis. On Oct. 3, just days after the villa strike, another Israeli attack reportedly targeted a site linked to the Fourth Division near Yafour. According to Qatari newspaper The New Arab, an Israeli drone hit the division's site west of Damascus. Opposition-linked Syrian outlet Voice of the Capital added that Israeli drones were targeted in interception attempts around the Yafour, Dimas and Jadida Al-Shibani areas in Damascus’s suburbs. While strikes on the Fourth Division are nothing new, the recent escalation raises questions about the intensity of the attacks and the prominent role of Maher al-Assad, who oversees everything from above. Succession hopes derailed by fiery temperament Maher al-Assad, born on Dec. 8, 1967, is the youngest son of Syria’s late President Hafez al-Assad and his wife Anisa Makhlouf. He grew up largely out of the public eye as his father assumed power, and later studied at Damascus University. Following his studies, Maher joined the Syrian military, following in the footsteps of his older brother, Bassel al-Assad. After Bassel’s death in a car accident in 1994, Maher was considered a potential successor to his father, but the role ultimately went to his brother Bashar, despite Bashar’s lack of military experience. Reports suggest Maher’s fiery temperament played a role in him being passed over. Maher is married to Manal Tawfiq Jadaan and has two daughters and a son. Assad is known in Syria as a ruthless military commander, holding a rank equivalent to major general and leading the elite Fourth Division of the Syrian army, one of the most loyal divisions to the Assad regime. In recent years, the Fourth Division has also become an economic powerhouse, overseeing the production and smuggling of drugs, particularly the stimulant Captagon, which is trafficked from Syria to other countries in the region. Some reports link Assad to the leadership of the Republican Guard, an elite unit tasked with defending the regime and Damascus from external threats, although other sources dispute his involvement. Assad has faced opposition from within his own family. His sister-in-law, Majd Tawfiq Jadaan, aligned with the Syrian opposition, has publicly denounced him, describing him as being like his father, Hafez, in 'malice, cunning and crimes.' In a past interview, she accused Assad of playing a central role in the destruction of Syria and the genocide of its people, saying he bears as much responsibility as his brother Bashar. In 2011, Assad was targeted by U.S. sanctions imposed on his brother's regime. Then-President Barack Obama signed an executive order sanctioning Syria’s intelligence agency and two of Bashar’s relatives, including Maher, in response to the brutal crackdown on the popular uprising that spiraled into the country's more-than-a-decade-long civil war. The other relative sanctioned was Atef Najib, a cousin of the president.

IDF chief: Hezbollah hides its dead as Israel tightens the noose	Halevi says military will 'apply more pressure as Hezbollah faces growing distress'; army spokesperson Hagari presents graphic of top Hezbollah leaders killed, noting fate of Nasrallah's successor and intelligence chief remains unclear Israel's military chief said on Tuesday that Hezbollah’s decision to withhold information about its casualties shows the terrorist group is in a difficult position. 'Hezbollah is hiding its casualties while fabricating losses on our side, There is a gap that shows the organization is in a difficult situation,' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said during a security briefing. 'We need to widen this gap, protect our forces, strike their operatives and apply more pressure as Hezbollah faces growing distress.' Halevi’s remarks come as Hezbollah has reportedly stopped publishing its daily list of casualties since Israel launched its Operation Northern Arrows, which opened with a spree of exploding pagers and walkie-talkies that killed dozens of Hezbollah terrorists and maimed thousands and continued with airstrikes on Beirut and a ground incursion into southern Lebanon. While the group has also refrained from disclosing the names of its senior commanders killed in the fighting, Israel continues to target key figures. Meanwhile, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari highlighted on Tuesday during an interview with the U.S.-based Arabic-language channel Alhurra the list of top Hezbollah commanders killed since the start of the war, including Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. Hagari presented a graphic showing other high-ranking figures, such as Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah’s expected successor, and Hezbollah intelligence chief Ali Hussein Hazima, though their deaths remain unconfirmed. Among the confirmed slain leaders are Ibrahim Muhammad Qubaisi, head of Hezbollah’s missile and rocket division; Ali Karaki, southern front commander; and Ibrahim Aqil, head of operations. The list also includes Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah’s top military commander, Nabil Qaouk, head of Hezbollah's preventive security unit, and several others responsible for arms transfers and air defense. Hagari reiterated that Hezbollah initiated the hostilities last year and emphasized that the Israeli military would continue targeting locations where the group stores weapons. 'Any home containing Hezbollah weaponry will be struck,' he said, adding that Lebanon’s borders would remain under close surveillance to prevent arms smuggling. 'We are not at war with the state of Lebanon or its people,' Hagari said, clarifying that Israeli operations are focused on Hezbollah’s use of southern Lebanese villages as military bases. 'Our actions are limited to targeting the villages Hezbollah has turned into terror hubs near our border.'

Hezbollah fighters targeted for capture as IDF applies Gaza tunne...	8th Armored Brigade reservists, at deepest point of Israel’s southern Lebanon offensive, uncover underground terror base, highlight physical challenges of navigating tough terrain and finding weapons caches and tunnels unknown even to intelligence While regular IDF brigades like Golani and the Paratroopers fight in southern Lebanon border villages, reserve brigades are tasked with deeper missions as part of Israel’s ground operation to eliminate Hezbollah's Radwan Force threat to the Galilee. Now in its third week, the mission focuses on clearing the border region of this invasion threat. Reservists from the 8th Armored Brigade, who until a few weeks ago were expanding the Beit Hanoun corridor and conducting raids in northern Gaza neighborhoods like Zeitoun and Al-Rimal, now find themselves fighting in one of the northernmost points of Israel's ground operation in southern Lebanon—reportedly the farthest from the border, according to a senior officer. On Monday, the 8th Armored Brigade uncovered Hezbollah’s largest combat tunnel found by the IDF in Lebanon. Located on the outskirts of a major village in the eastern sector, the tunnel was designed to launch hundreds of Radwan fighters toward Kiryat Shmona. The concealed underground complex, stretching about 800 meters (0.5 miles), included sleeping quarters for long-term stays, designed to withstand airstrikes. It featured a fully equipped kitchen, showers, motorcycles, off-road vehicles and hundreds of advanced weapons, including Kornet anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft systems and personal firearms. Fresh food indicated that Radwan operatives had been present until recently. Soldiers identified a terrorist attempting to exit one of the shafts through a nearby apartment and eliminated him from the air. The discovery of this large underground base was attributed to ground searches conducted by soldiers rather than specific intelligence. The tunnel was demolished within three days of its discovery, a result of lessons learned from the fighting in Gaza. At the start of the ground incursion against Hamas, it took Israeli forces weeks to inspect and destroy tunnels due to fears of booby traps and ambushes. However, thanks to improved combat tactics, new methods and advanced technologies developed in Gaza, this process has been significantly shortened to just a few days, sometimes less. Operations against tunnels now proceed more efficiently, often involving IDF tracker dogs or specialized drones to scan underground areas before troops enter. The need to stretch resources across multiple fronts has kept IDF soldiers on duty throughout the holiday period, with the ground operation in southern Lebanon relying heavily on the Northern Command's reserve brigades, alongside younger regular forces from the 36th and 98th Divisions. Despite years of neglect, the confidence that reservists have instilled in the General Staff and political echelon over the past year is paying off. Soldiers in their 30s and 40s from the 8th Armored Brigade crossed into southern Lebanon, covering challenging terrain and marching miles to reach their objectives. 'The soldiers marched all night to reach their targets and quickly received supplies and reinforcements along the logistical routes we opened,' the IDF said. 'Only a few soldiers reported feeling unwell, so we deployed the brigade’s tanks.' Troops were also briefed on how to avoid being captured by Hezbollah, a key objective for the terror group. Additionally, a primary directive was emphasized: capture Hezbollah terrorists and Lebanese suspects as high-value operational and intelligence targets.

Israel assures US it won't strike Iranian nuclear or oil sites, U...	The Biden administration believes it has won assurances from Israel that it will not hit Iranian nuclear or oil sites as it looks to strike back following Iran's missile barrage earlier this month, two U.S. officials said Tuesday. The administration also believes that sending a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel and roughly 100 soldiers to operate it has eased some of Israel's concerns about possible Iranian retaliation and general security issues. The Pentagon on Sunday announced the THAAD deployment to help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran's ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October, saying it was authorized at the direction of President Joe Biden. However, the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic discussions, cautioned that Israel's assurances are not ironclad and that circumstances could change. The officials also noted that Israel's track record on fulfilling pledges in the past is mixed and has often reflected domestic Israeli politics that have upended Washington's expectations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkvb6nhjkx	2024-10-15T12:06:48-07:00

Radwan Force fled after Nasrallah’s assassination, captured Hezbo...	Detained fighter, shown in footage emerging from southern Lebanon tunnel, claims all local commanders scattered, plan to invade Galilee scrapped following arch-terrorist's killing; IDF forces nab 3 more Radwan fighters holed up in underground tunnel Three Hezbollah operatives from the terrorist group’s elite Radwan Force were captured by IDF Golani Brigade soldiers in southern Lebanon, the army announced Tuesday evening. In footage from the interrogation of a Hezbollah terrorist, identified as Waddah Younis, he claimed that Hezbollah fighters fled following the assassination of their leader Hassan Nasrallah last month and that senior commanders in the sector had abandoned their posts early in the fighting. Younis was the first Hezbollah fighter captured since Israel's ground operation began. According to the military, soldiers discovered an underground tunnel in a building used by Hezbollah terrorists. After surrounding the site, Younis surrendered and was taken into custody for interrogation, where he described the Radwan Force as unmotivated and primarily interested in financial gain. He also said their plan to advance into Israel’s Galilee was scrapped after Nasrallah’s death. Two more Hezbollah fighters were later captured when Israeli forces uncovered another underground tunnel in the same area. The operatives, along with a large cache of weapons, surrendered after being surrounded. All three captives are currently being held and interrogated by Israel's Unit 504, which specializes in intelligence gathering and field interrogations. Unlike in the Gaza Strip, Unit 504’s intelligence network in Lebanon has been extensive and deeply established over the years. The use of agents in Lebanon has provided invaluable intelligence, playing a key role in the IDF’s recent operations across the country. Much like in Gaza, Unit 504 operatives are embedded directly with combat units, working alongside soldiers to guide them to targets and conduct field interrogations. Captured terrorists are then transferred to specialized facilities, where professional interrogators focus on extracting critical information to aid ongoing military efforts.

Israel's demining near Golan signals wider front against Hezbolla...	Sources say move may allow strikes on Hezbollah from east, targeting supply routes from Syria and tightening pressure on terror group from multiple fronts In a sign Israel may expand its ground operations against Hezbollah while bolstering its own defenses, its troops have cleared landmines and established new barriers on the frontier between the Golan Heights and a demilitarized strip bordering Syria, security sources and analysts said. The move suggests Israel may seek to strike Hezbollah for the first time from further east along Lebanon's border, at the same time creating a secure area from which it can freely reconnoiter the terrorist group and prevent infiltration, the sources said. While demining activity has been reported, sources who spoke to Reuters — including a Syrian soldier stationed in south Syria, a Lebanese security official and a UN peacekeeping official — revealed additional unreported details that showed Israel was moving the fence separating the DMZ toward the Syrian side and digging more fortifications in the area. Military action involving raids from the Golan and possibly from the demilitarized zone that separates it from Syrian territory could widen the conflict pitting Israel against Hezbollah and its ally Hamas that has already drawn in Iran and risks sucking in the U.S. Israel has been trading fire with Tehran-backed Hezbollah since the group began launching missiles across Lebanon's border in support of Hamas after its deadly attack on southern Israel triggered Israel's military campaign on Gaza. Now, in addition to Israeli aerial strikes that have caused Hezbollah significant damage in the past month, the group is under Israeli ground assault from the south and faces Israeli naval shelling from the Mediterranean to the west. By extending its front in the east, Israel could tighten its squeeze on Hezbollah's arms supply routes, some of which cut across Syria, Lebanon's eastern neighbor and an ally of Iran. Navvar Saban, a conflict analyst at the Istanbul-based Harmoon Center, said the operations in the Golan, a hilly, 1,200 square km (460 square mile) plateau that also overlooks Lebanon and borders Jordan, appeared to be an attempt to 'prepare the groundwork' for a broader offensive in Lebanon. 'Everything happening in Syria is to serve Israel's strategy in Lebanon - hitting supply routes, hitting warehouses, hitting people linked to the supply lines to Hezbollah,' he said. Israel's mine removal and engineering works have accelerated in recent weeks, according to a Syrian intelligence officer, a Syrian soldier positioned in southern Syria and three senior Lebanese security sources who spoke to Reuters for this story. Fortifications The sources said the demining had intensified as Israel began ground incursions on Oct. 1 to fight Hezbollah along the mountainous terrain separating northern Israel from southern Lebanon around 20 km (12 miles) to the west. In the same period, Israel has ramped up strikes on Syria, including its capital and the border with Lebanon, and Russian military units — stationed in Syria's south in support of Syrian troops there — have withdrawn from at least one observation post overlooking the demilitarized area, the two Syrian sources and one of the Lebanese sources said. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss their monitoring of Israel's military operations in the Golan, most of which was seized by Israel from Syria in 1967. The Syrian soldier stationed in the south said Israel was pushing the fence separating the Golan and the demilitarised zone (DMZ) further out and erecting their own fortifications near Syria 'so there would not be any infiltration in the event this front flares up.' The soldier said Israel appeared to be creating 'a buffer zone' in the DMZ. A second senior Lebanese security source told Reuters that Israeli troops had dug a new trench near the DMZ in October. One senior Lebanese security source said the demining operations could allow Israeli troops to 'encircle' Hezbollah from the east. The DMZ has been home for the last five decades to the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), mandated to oversee the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian forces after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. A UN peacekeeping official in New York said that UNDOF had 'recently observed some construction activity being carried out by Israeli military forces in the vicinity of the area of separation,' but did not have further details. Russia leaves overlook point Asked about the demining, the IDF said it 'does not comment on operational plans' and it 'is currently fighting against the terrorist organization Hezbollah in order to allow for the safe return of northern residents to their homes.' UNDOF, Russia and Syria did not respond to requests for comment by Reuters. A report to the UN Security Council on the activities of UNDOF, dated Sept. 24 and seen by Reuters on Oct. 4, cited violations on both sides of the demilitarized zone. Russian troops, meanwhile, have left the Tal Hara outpost, the highest point in Syria's southern Daraa governorate and a strategic overlook point, according to the two Syrian sources and one of the Lebanese sources. The Russians had left because of understandings with the Israelis to prevent a clash, a Syrian military officer said. Syrian authorities, whose country is part of Iran's so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' have sought to remain out of the fray since regional tensions soared after Hamas' Oct. 7 assault last year. Reuters reported in January that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had been discouraged from taking any action in support of Hamas after he received threats from Israel. Hezbollah too had 'steered away' from building up any forces in the Syrian-held Golan. Syria's army has not made additional deployments, the Syrian military intelligence officer told Reuters.

In call with French leader, PM stresses Israel’s efforts to aimed at eliminating Hezbollah threat and secure return of northern residents, following Macron’s criticism that Israel, created by UN decision, cannot disregard UN resolutions Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday that he opposes a unilateral cease-fire in Lebanon. Netanyahu emphasized that Israel’s actions aim to eliminate Hezbollah’s threat and ensure the safe return of northern residents. The phone call followed a report in French newspaper Le Parisien that claimed that Macron criticized the Israeli leader in a closed government meeting, saying that Israel was created by a UN decision and thus cannot disregard UN resolutions. Earlier this month, Macron urged a halt to arms deliveries to Israel, which has come under scrutiny over its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza and mounting civilian death toll. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,' Macron told broadcaster France Inter. 'France is not delivering any,' he added during the pre-recorded interview. Macron reiterated his demand for a cease-fire in a call with Netanyahu the next day. Following the conversation, Netanyahu's office responded by emphasizing that, given Iran's backing of terror groups, Israel expects its allies to support its efforts, not impose restrictions that would ultimately bolster 'Iran's axis of evil.'

Israeli couple tied to Iranian assassination plot faces scrutiny ...	Indictment against Vladislav Victorsson and his partner, Anna Bernstein, for allegedly carrying out tasks for Tehran resurfaces troubling stories from their past, including sexual offenses against minors and alleged animal abuse The indictment of Vladislav Victorsson, 30, and his partner, Anna Bernstein, 18, for their involvement in an Iranian plot to assassinate Israeli officials has brought renewed focus on Victorsson's vast criminal history. The Shin Bet and Israeli police revealed their alleged connection to the plot on Monday, sparking a wave of social media reactions, particularly regarding Viktorson’s disturbing past. In 2015, Victorsson, who had since changed his last name to McLoughlin, was convicted of multiple sexual offenses against minors. At the age of 20, he was sentenced to two years in prison after being charged with statutory rape, sodomy and indecent acts involving six girls aged 12 to 14. The prosecution, led by the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office, accused Victorsson of exploiting the vulnerability of minors, meeting them in public places like the Dizengoff Center in Tel Aviv and through social media. In one case, he was accused of assaulting a girl in a parking lot, continuing the attack despite her protests, telling her 'I know you like it.' Victorsson also distributed explicit images of his victims he took or asked them to take for him without their consent, a detail that resurfaced online in recent days. During his remand hearing, prosecutors presented a confrontation between Victorsson and one of his victims, in which she described how he forcibly performed a sexual act on her, saying, 'After I said no six times, he finally stopped.' Victorsson reportedly responded, 'I always stop after two.' During his interrogation, Victorsson admitted to most of the acts attributed to him but denied forcing himself on any of the minors. When questioned about why he engaged in sexual relations with underage girls and whether he knew it was illegal, he replied, 'I knew it was wrong, but I didn’t know what the consequences would be.' In another instance, he remarked to investigators, 'I got to stop meeting minors.' Upon his release, Victorsson was arrested again in 2019 for violating his probation terms by contacting minors via social media. 'There is an evidentiary foundation and a reasonable suspicion that the suspect committed sexual offenses against minors. In recent days, it emerged that the suspect made contact with several minors through social networks. He then met with them and performed sexual acts on them. The investigation also revealed that the suspect photographed the minors naked,' his detention order stated. His connections to Tel Aviv’s gothic youth subculture earned him notoriety, with multiple individuals recalling past encounters with him. After his conviction and time in prison, acquaintances posted the allegations against him on social media. 'I remember this story, they talked about how he would lure girls to the underground parking lot at the [Dizengoff] Center and then rape them there,' wrote one Facebook user named Jack. 'I was one of the complainants who stood against him,' another user wrote in 2022. 'I was the one who exposed his second phone, where he distributed pictures and videos of the girls, including sexual acts he filmed without their knowledge. The number of Facebook accounts and family name changes he’s made won’t help him hide his face unless he gets plastic surgery.' A third user wrote: 'I knew someone who was part of the investigation back then, and she said he told the investigator, 'I usually stop after the third no.'' Another user wrote: 'I didn't know him, and now I found out he's part of the kink community and even participated in parties. I'm shaking.' Victorsson, for his part, denied any connection to the allegations and wrote in a past Facebook post. 'I heard a rumor that people are trying to frame me, spreading nonsense about my time at the Center and calling me a rapist,' he wrote. 'It's true that I spent two years in prison, but not for the reasons they are trying to pin on me. I was sentenced back then because, in the distant past, I was too kind to people who didn’t deserve it.' Following the announcement of his involvement in the espionage case, many of his former acquaintances resurfaced their accounts on social media. 'Remember Vlad from 2015? Now he's an Iranian agent. I’m shocked,' wrote one acquaintance. 'He was looking for work in the [Revolutionary Guard] Corps,' joked another user named Sergey. Bernstein, also implicated in the Iranian plot, is a model from Petah Tikva and is listed on Facebook as engaged to Victorsson. Her personal life came under scrutiny after a TikTok video surfaced showing her dog convulsing, allegedly after consuming a cannabis-laced cookie. Victorsson defended her, claiming the incident was accidental.

UK sanctions target Israeli settler outposts in West Bank	Britain takes action against 7 settler groups accused of inciting violence against Palestinians and calls for end to settler expansion Britain on Tuesday sanctioned Israeli settler organizations that it said had sponsored violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank, and called on Israel to 'stop settler expansion on Palestinian land.' The sanctions target seven settler outposts or organizations involved in facilitating, inciting, promoting or providing support for activity that amounts to serious abuse of the human rights of Palestinians, Britain said. 'The inaction of the Israeli government has allowed an environment of impunity to flourish where settler violence has been allowed to increase unchecked,' British foreign Minister David Lammy said, noting settlers had also targeted schools and families with young children. 'The Israeli government must crack down on settler violence and stop settler expansion on Palestinian land,' he added. The latest sanctions, which impose asset freezes on the organizations, represent the third set of measures against persons involved in settler violence in the West Bank, Britain said. Most countries deem Jewish settlements built on land Israel captured in the 1967 Six-Day War as illegal, and their expansion has for decades been among the most contentious issues between Israel, the Palestinians and the international community. Israel cites biblical, historical and political ties to the area.

US warns Israel Gaza aid must resume or military assistance could...	Washington conditions further arms provisions to Israel on entry of American humanitarian aid into Gaza within 30 days; components of THAAD missile defense system arrive in Israel, with US troops set to operate it U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have warned Israel that if it does not allow the transfer of American humanitarian aid to Gaza within 30 days, the U.S. may halt military assistance. The message was delivered to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer through an official document. The American officials threatened to invoke a national security memorandum issued in March which set conditions for continued U.S. military support to Israel, including allowing unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid. Despite recent claims by Israel that it is not preventing aid, including the entry of 30 trucks of food into northern Gaza on Monday, the U.S. remains concerned about restrictions. Washington has demanded concrete steps from Israel within 30 days, warning that failure to comply could impact future military aid. This comes as the U.S. continues to delay shipments of heavy bombs to Israel. However, the Pentagon confirmed that components for the THAAD missile defense system began arriving in Israel, with U.S. troops expected to operate the system as part of preparations for a potential Iranian response to future Israeli strikes. Pentagon Press Secretary Pat Ryder said that the THAAD system will be fully operational soon, but did not provide a specific timeline due to security concerns. The deployment follows Israel’s request for additional U.S. military assets to bolster regional security. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni announced in parliament that Italy has frozen all arms and munitions contracts with Israel since October 7. This follows an incident where Israeli forces fired at a UNIFIL position in southern Lebanon, wounding two people. Italy's defense minister called the attack a 'war crime,' prompting IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi to speak with his Italian counterpart, Gen. Luciano Portolano, about the security situation and Hezbollah’s use of positions near UNIFIL posts for terrorist activities.

Police officer killed in Highway 4 shooting attack named	Authorities identify slain cop as First Sgt. Adir Kadosh, 33, who was set to get married next month; attacker identified as Gaza resident who had been living illegally in the West Bank in recent years Israeli authorities identified the police officer killed in Tuesday morning's shooting attack on Highway 4 near the Yavneh interchange as First Sgt. Adir Kadosh, 33. Kadosh, a member of the Traffic Division since 2022, was shot while trying to engage the terrorist who had infiltrated Israel from the West Bank. The attacker, identified as Muhammed Dardounah, 28, a resident of Jabaliya in Gaza who had been living illegally in the West Bank, was later shot and killed by an armed civilian at the scene. Kadosh, who joined the police in 2013 after serving in the Border Police, is survived by his parents, two siblings and his fiancé, with whom he was set to marry next month. His funeral will take place at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Holon cemetery. The civilian who neutralized the attacker had recently received his firearm as part of a reform led by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. 'I saw the terrorist shooting, stopped my car and fired back,' the man said. 'Thanks to the minister’s reform, I was able to carry a weapon, and lives were saved today.' In addition to Kadosh, a 42-year-old man was moderately injured, and two others sustained minor injuries. The wounded were transported to Assuta Hospital in Ashdod and Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot. An investigation revealed that the assailant approached on foot from the sandy areas near Palmachim and opened fire on a police vehicle parked along the roadside. The attacker continued shooting at passing vehicles before being neutralized by the civilian between Holot and Yavneh interchanges. Ben-Gvir and Police Commissioner Daniel Levy arrived at the scene, receiving a briefing from Central District Commander Maj. Gen. Yair Hetzroni. Ben-Gvir praised the civilian’s actions, saying, 'This reform is proving its worth time and again—armed citizens are saving lives.' Commissioner Levy added, 'A police officer paid with his life. We are doing everything to ensure officers respond swiftly in such incidents to protect civilians.'

The World Health Organization said on Tuesday it had been able to start its polio campaign in central Gaza and vaccinate tens of thousands of children despite Israeli strikes in the designated protected zone hours before. As part of an agreement between the Israeli military and Hamas, humanitarian pauses in the year-long Gaza war had been due to begin early on Monday to reach hundreds of thousands of children. WHO spokesperson Tarik JaÅ¡areviÄ‡ told a Geneva press briefing that over 92,000 children, or around half of the children targeted for polio vaccines in the central area, had been inoculated on Monday. 'What we have received from colleagues is that the vaccination went without a major issue yesterday, and we hope It will continue the same way,' he said. Other humanitarian agencies have previously voiced concerns about the viability of the polio campaign in northern Gaza, where an Israeli offensive is under way. Aid groups carried out an initial round of vaccinations last month, after a baby was partially paralyzed by the type 2 polio virus in August, in the first such case in the territory in 25 years.

My brother's keeper: Study finds deep psychological impacts on si...	Hebrew University study explores the 'unrecognized grief' of sibling loss during, after October 7 events, highlighting unique needs of those left to cope with loss; Findings challenge assumptions about grief dynamics, urging tailored responses for those affected by prolonged national crises Pioneering Research on the 'Emotional Toll of Sibling Loss During October 7 Events: A groundbreaking study' from the Hebrew University explores the psychological aftermath faced by 444 adults grieving siblings killed during the events of October 7 and subsequent war. Led by Captain (Res.) Masada Buchris, under Professor Anat Zeira’s mentorship, the research honors Buchris' brother, Major Chen Buchris, the deputy commander of the Maglan unit, who was killed in battle at Kibbutz Nahal Oz, and his close friend, Major Ariel Ben Moshe, a company commander in Sayeret Matkal (IDF's Delta Force equivalent), who also fell on October 7 at Kibbutz Re'im. 'Hani led the first force into Kibbutz Nahal Oz on that dark Saturday, sacrificing himself for his mission –saving lives and leading troops on the ground,' Buchris reflected. 'Losing my brother is a heavy cloud that shadows me constantly. Every word in my academic work echoes his presence. My pain intertwines with his bravery, pushing me to overcome darkness and conquer sorrow.' Approximately 10% of study participants lost more than one sibling during the October 7 events and the Gaza war. About 30% reported the death of another close person, such as a parent, spouse or friend, during these events. Although no significant differences related to birth order were found, deeper analysis revealed complex dynamics between birth order and coping strategies. Siblings who suffered the death of an eldest sibling experienced more psychological distress and sought less support, likely because the eldest often serves as a key support figure. Conversely, those who lost younger siblings tended to seek more help. Exposure to distressing videos intensified the psychological burden Interestingly, no differences emerged between siblings who lost members in security forces versus those who did not, challenging the societal belief that losing a sibling in heroic acts eases grief. However, those whose siblings served in security forces reported higher levels of negative self-thoughts, possibly due to guilt and helplessness. Many felt abandoned by security forces, believing their siblings were 'left to die.' Uncertainty about their siblings' fate and exposure to distressing Hamas videos exacerbated their distress. Moreover, women reported higher levels of emotional distress (anxiety, depression, somatization) compared to men, and were more likely to seek help, social support and connection with the deceased. Siblings living in attacked areas reported higher emotional distress, negative thoughts and help-seeking behaviors compared to those in safer regions. 'There aren't many studies, either in Israel or globally, examining the impact of sibling loss on adults, perhaps because it's often seen as less significant and classified as 'unrecognized grief,'' Buchris said. 'The findings highlight the need to raise awareness of bereaved siblings' unique needs and develop tailored responses during prolonged national crises.'

In blow to Harris campaign, Arab lobby withholds endorsement beca...	In 1st, Arab American Political Action Committee declines to endorse a presidential candidate, claiming both Harris and Trump 'blindly support the criminal Israeli government'; This could encourage Arabs and Muslims not to go to the polls, which could cost Harris dearly in the Michigan vote and give Trump the victory in the election The U.S political lobby AAPAC, or the Arab American Political Action Committee, announced Tuesday morning that it had decided not to support either of the two major party candidates in the presidential race and would not endorse Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. The lobby announcement is another signal of the danger facing Harris, who as a Democratic candidate is the more natural choice for Muslims and Arabs, and largely needs their support. It is customary in the U.S. that, as the election date approaches, labor unions, political lobbies and also major newspapers endorse the candidate who, after examining the facts, they think is the most suitable to serve as president. In its announcement Tuesday morning, AAPAC said that it had decided to refrain from giving such an endorsement to any of the candidates for this election. 'Both candidates have endorsed genocide in Gaza and war in Lebanon,' AAPAC said in its statement. 'We simply cannot give our votes to either Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump, who blindly support the criminal Israeli government.' This is the first time since the establishment of the lobby in 1998 that it has refrained from declaring support for a presidential candidate. The PAC usually endorses Democrats. Arab and Muslim Americans overwhelmingly backed President Joe Biden in 2020 but have been vocal opponents of U.S. support for Israel, especially the Biden administration's support since October 7, which has eroded their backing of Democrats. Trump has historically had low approval from that community due to past statements and his policy of a travel ban targeting Muslim-majority nations when he was in office. Like Harris and Biden, Trump has also been a vocal supporter of Israel. During the Democratic primaries at the beginning of the year, an Arab-Muslim protest movement against Biden took shape and, at its peak, Muslims who came to the polling stations in Michigan voted uncommitted, as a sign that if the Biden administration continued on its way in support of Israel - that the voting bloc would will abstain and not vote for him in the elections in November There is particularly great significance: in the state of Michigan, which divides 15 electors in the elections, and where there is a large Muslim population. Since the battle there is quite close (according to recent polls, Harris leads by less than a percentage point, deep within the range of sampling error), if they do not go to the polls they could hand Trump the victory in the state and possibly in the U.S. as a whole. Trump has historically had low approval from that community due to past statements and his policy of a travel ban targeting Muslim-majority nations when he was in office. Like Harris and Biden, Trump has also been a vocal supporter of Israel. Not gaining AAPAC's support is not surprising to the Trump campaign and is not expected to cause and changes. On the other hand, other Arab organizations have recently called on Arab and Muslim voters to vote for Harris despite their displeasure with her conduct, arguing that Trump's rise to power would be even worse for them.

Terrorist cell responsible for Tel Aviv suicide bombing apprehend...	Israeli security forces dismantled a Hamas-linked terror cell responsible for the Tel Aviv bombing in August, arresting eight operatives; The international plot, orchestrated from Turkey, included additional explosives and funding, underscoring Hamas' strategic reach and intent to escalate regional tensions Two months after the explosion that rocked southern Tel Aviv, which a suicide bomber set off injuring a 33-year-old man, Israel Police and the Shin Bet revealed that they apprehended the cell that orchestrated the attack. In a synchronized operation, Tel Aviv’s Central Unit and the Shin Bet detained eight terrorists, along with the driver who drove the suicide bomber from Shu'afat refugee camp to the Tel Aviv explosion site. Indictments are set for a military court on Tuesday. Investigations traced the cell’s roots to a Hamas network operating along the Nablus-Turkey corridor. Under the guidance of Hamas leadership in Turkey, the cell executed the attack, targeting a bustling area. During the probe, two ready-to-use explosive devices, each weighing 8.8 lbs., were surrendered, planned for further attacks in Israel. Following the August evening's powerful blast, extensive police forces, including explosive ordinance disposal units and forensic teams, scoured the scene. Shin Bet and police identified the bomber as Ja'far Muna, a Hamas operative from Nablus. The investigation exposed a terror infrastructure, directed by a Hamas commander in Turkey, aiming to carry out suicide attacks in Israel. Simultaneously, the Shin Bet and IDF apprehended Hamas operatives from Nablus, who led the infrastructure and coordinated with Abada Bilal, a senior Hamas figure in Turkey, released in the deal that brought Gilad Shalit back from Hamas captivity in 2011. Under his direction, the suicide bombing was executed. The investigation uncovered that one operative traveled to Turkey multiple times, securing funds for explosives and receiving bomb-making training from Hamas personnel. Eight terrorists were arrested on suspicions of executing and planning the attack. At the investigation's conclusion, a prosecutor's statement was filed against them, and the military prosecution will continue with terror-related indictments on Tuesday. An additional indictment is expected for an East Jerusalem resident from Beit Hanina, who transported the suicide bomber from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. In a joint statement, Shin Bet and police declared: 'The investigation clearly highlights the entrenchment of Hamas' command in Turkey and the extensive efforts by Hamas' overseas leadership to inflame the region and carry out suicide bombings in Israel.'

Former Stasi officer sentenced to 10 years for 1974 murder of Pol...	Martin Naumann becomes first former Stasi agent convicted of murder, a historic verdict with 'great symbolic significance' for Germany's atonement efforts An 80-year-old former Stasi officer, Martin Naumann, was sentenced to ten years in prison by the Berlin Regional Court on Monday for the murder of Polish citizen Czesław Kukuczka at the Friedrichstraße border crossing on March 29, 1974. The court found it proven that Naumann shot Kukuczka, 38, in the back from a distance of two to three meters during his escape attempt at the busiest border checkpoint between East and West Berlin. The judges had no doubt about the defendant's guilt, reaching an 'unequivocal conviction' that he was the perpetrator. Judge Bernd Miczajka stated, 'It was not the act of an individual for personal reasons, but planned and executed ruthlessly by the Stasi,' emphasizing the broader operation behind Kukuczka's killing. The Berlin public prosecutor's office had requested a 12-year prison sentence, but the court decided on a 10-year sentence instead. The verdict can still be appealed, and the 80-year-old defendant does not have to go to prison until it is legally binding. Naumann remained silent throughout the trial, which began in March 2023, choosing to remain silent as a defense strategy. His lawyer, Andrea Liebscher, requested acquittal, arguing that it was not proven that he was the shooter, despite the prosecutor requesting a 12-year prison sentence. The case dates back to March 29, 1974, when 38-year-old Polish firefighter and father of three, Czesław Kukuczka, stormed the Polish embassy in East Berlin with a fake bomb, demanding to be allowed to pass to the Western sector of the divided city. Embassy officials pretended to agree to his demands but alerted the East German authorities about the threat. The Stasi, the secret police of the former communist East Germany, made Kukuczka believe that his departure had been accepted, luring him into a trap with a forged permission. Kukuczka was escorted by Stasi officers to the Friedrichstraße station, known as the 'Palace of Tears,' where he passed through several checkpoints without incident. Believing he was safely crossing with authorization, he was shot in the back from close range by Stasi agent Martin Naumann while heading towards the tunnel leading to the West Berlin subway. The shooting was carried out on behalf of the East German secret police during a Stasi operation in the transit area of Berlin-Friedrichstraße station. The killing was witnessed by several schoolgirls waiting in line at the border crossing. These schoolgirls, now adults, were summoned to testify during Naumann's trial in Berlin. One of the witnesses, a then 10th-grade student, saw a man in a long coat and tinted sunglasses shoot Kukuczka in the back. After being shot, Kukuczka collapsed and was taken to a secret police prison hospital, where he died soon after from multiple gunshot wounds. An investigation later revealed that he did not have a bomb in his bag and was unarmed at the time of the incident. For his role in the killing, Naumann received a decoration, a 'Kampforden,' and was regarded by his superiors as an 'exemplary' communist and secret policeman, displaying 'ruthlessness' and 'constant loyalty to the leadership of the party and state.' The archived document states that Naumann 'carried out this task carefully, courageously and resolutely and was able to neutralize the terrorist by using a firearm.' The case remained unresolved for decades. Initial investigations into Kukuczka's death in the 1990s did not yield significant results, and the case was closed in 2005. In 2016, new information found by two historians in Stasi archives linked Naumann to the death of Kukuczka, leading to new potential witnesses. This decisive piece of information emerged from the Stasi's voluminous archives, including a list of twelve names, one of which was Naumann. In 2021, Poland issued a European arrest warrant for Naumann, prompting the German justice system to reopen the case. The trial, which began in March 2023, is seen as the culmination of decades of investigations that had been started and then stopped, described as one of 'outstanding historical significance.' The trial has forced Germany to relive the Cold War era, a period when the country was divided by the Iron Curtain between East and West. The conviction of Naumann is considered a landmark ruling, reflecting the gravity of the crime and marking the first time a former Stasi officer has been found guilty of murder for a homicide committed on duty. Historians and officials have emphasized the great symbolic significance of this verdict for Germany's efforts to atone for the injustices of the communist dictatorship. Maria Nooke, Brandenburg's state commissioner for addressing East German injustice, welcomed the court's decision regarding the Kukuczka case, stating, 'It is in line with the historical assessment of the case.' She further stated, 'The trial demonstrates the importance of the legal and social reassessment of the injustices of the GDR up to today.' The defendant's lawyer maintained that there was no proof that Naumann fired the fatal shot and that Kukuczka's death constituted involuntary manslaughter, which is subject to statutes of limitations. However, the court disagreed, ruling that the act was a treacherous murder and that Naumann acted 'ruthlessly,' establishing his guilt 'beyond doubt.' Prosecutor Henrike Hillmann claimed that other, 'milder' means of 'neutralizing' Kukuczka could have been used, such as incapacitation or arrest. The verdict highlights the difficulties in prosecuting Stasi-related cases, as most defendants received light sentences or were acquitted due to lack of evidence or testimony. Until now, all convictions related to Stasi crimes have been for manslaughter or aiding murder, and those who have been convicted have largely faced the lesser sentence of manslaughter, assuming that they were acting on orders of the Stasi. Czesław Kukuczka was a 38-year-old Polish builder, firefighter, and father of three, who had grown up near Limanowa, a town 30 miles southeast of Krakow. His children—a daughter and two sons—and sister appeared as co-plaintiffs in the trial, demanding a conviction for murder, which they pursued for fifty years. The victim's lawyers emphasized that their clients were never seeking a specific punishment or revenge, but rather truth. Lawyer Rajmund Niwinski stated, 'The joint plaintiffs are thankful to the court and the German state for this trial.' He expressed satisfaction with the verdict, stating, 'I think it is a satisfying verdict for the family.' The trial is one of the few recent proceedings related to crimes committed by the former communist regime of the GDR, raising critical questions about how societies confront their pasts and the need for accountability and truth-telling. Historians note that this trial brings to light a recent period of German history that has been somewhat neglected, highlighting the need for accountability and truth-telling regarding the crimes of the East German regime. The verdict can still be appealed. Despite the opening of the Stasi archives in the 1990s, few cases were able to be completed due to the agents ensuring they left no traces behind. The conviction of Naumann has 'great symbolic significance' in Germany's efforts to atone for the injustices of the communist dictatorship, according to officials. The trial demonstrates the importance of the legal and social reassessment of the injustices of the GDR up to today.

Back from the dead? IRGC chief Qaani appears live on TV in Iran	After weeks of speculation regarding his fate, Iran’s Quds Force Commander Esmail Qaani reappears at a funeral for a fellow terrorist; Rumors of his interrogation and heart attack swirl amid heightened regional tensions following Israeli strikes on key Hezbollah figures in Beirut Esmail Qaani, the elusive commander of Iran’s Quds Force, emerged looking very much alive on state television, ending weeks of speculation about his fate. His appearance came during a solemn memorial; ceremony in Iran for Abbas Nilforoushan, a key Quds Force figure killed in Beirut alongside Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah. Rumors had swirled around Qaani's disappearance, with claims ranging from his assassination in Beirut to conspiratorial whispers of his interrogation over alleged Israeli ties – dismissed by Iran as 'fake news.' Lebanese network Al-Mayadeen reported that Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, planned to honor Qaani, mirroring recent accolades given to Iran’s Aerospace Force commander after a missile attack on Israel. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf labeled the rumors of Qaani's demise as 'false news,' asserting his continued activity. The intrigue deepened with reports from Sky News Arabic, citing Iranian sources, alleging Qaani was under investigation for an intelligence breach and suffered a heart attack during questioning. His office chief, suspected of Israeli links, was implicated. This narrative was fueled by Qaani's absence following a powerful assault in Beirut’s Dahieh district, targeting Hezbollah’s Hashem Safieddine, slated as Nasrallah’s successor. While the IDF has yet to confirm Safieddine's elimination, Israeli Prme Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated as much. A Reuters sourcereported Qaani’s presence in Dahieh during the attack, although he reportedly missed a pivotal meeting with Safieddine. Further fueling suspicions, Qaani was last seen publicly alongside Hashem Safieddine’s brother Abdullah in Tehran. The New York Times added to the mystery, reporting Qaani’s Beirut trip aimed to assist Hezbollah leaders reeling from recent attacks in Lebanon. A Revolutionary Guards member in Beirut told the paper that Iranian silence on Qaani stoked panic among junior Guards. Since October 7, Qaani reportedly traversed the Iraq-Syria-Lebanon axis, meeting with Nasrallah and Fuad Shukr, both slain in Beirut. Suspicion around him deepened, sources claimed, when Qaani skipped a Hezbollah meeting in Dahieh that Israel later targeted, having initially planned to attend with his office chief, Ihsan.

North Korea demolishes cross-border roads with South Korea amid e...	Kim Jong Un orders closure of transport links after accusing South Korea of flying drones over Pyongyang North Korea officially began demolition operations, blowing up the roads that connect South and North Korea's Gyeongui Line and Donghae Line, specifically targeting sections previously used for cross-border exchanges. The explosions were confirmed by the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, who reported that the North Korean military had set off detonations in the east and west of the Korean Peninsula. The demolition of the roads occurred after North and South Korea exchanged threats amidst rising animosities over North Korea's accusation that South Korea flew drones over its capital. North Korea described the alleged drone flights as 'the enemy's serious provocation.' In response, the South Korean military immediately conducted firing exercises south of the Military Demarcation Line and warned of stern punishment if the safety of its citizens is threatened. Following Kim Jong Un's order, North Korea detonated bombs north of its eastern and western borders. The explosions are seen as a significant shift in policy and a display of North Korea's growing loathing of South Korea's conservative government. The destruction of the roads illustrates Kim Jong Un's hardening policy towards the South. The South Korean government issued a statement strongly condemning North Korea's actions, stating that they are 'extremely abnormal' and that North Korea must bear all responsibility for the deterioration of the situation. The South Korean Ministry of Unification emphasized that 'the Gyeongui Line and Donghae Line railways and roads are products symbolizing inter-Korean cooperation after the inter-Korean summit of the leaders of South and North Korea.' In response to the explosions caused by North Korea, South Korea's military fired warning shots within its border, confirming that the shots didn't cause any damage on Seoul's side of the border. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that they are 'strengthening their surveillance and alert posture' in response to North Korea's movements. The Gyeongui Line connects South Korea's western border city of Paju to North Korea's Kaesong, 26 kilometers away, and is a symbol of inter-Korean cooperation and peace. It starts from Seoul Station, north through Goyang City and Paju City in Gyeonggi Province, enters North Korea, passes through Kaesong and Pyongyang, and reaches Sinuiju. The Donghae Line is a railway from Yangyang County in Gangwon Province, South Korea, to Wonsan City in Gangwon Province, North Korea. It was opened in 1937 and is 180 kilometers long, passing through Mount Kumgang. Since the division of North and South Korea, the Gyeongui Line and Donghae Line railroads have been declared interrupted on both sides. The reopening of roads connecting the two ends of North and South Korea has been regarded as a symbol of reconciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas. However, now North Korea has unilaterally exploded the Gyeongui Line and Donghae Line railroads, which are regarded as symbols of peace, following its announcement to cut transport routes toward South Korea. The South Korean Ministry of Unification stated: 'They were constructed at North Korea's request, financed through loans, at a cost of 132.9 million dollars. We reiterate that North Korea still has the obligation to repay the debt.' The ministry added: 'Regarding North Korea showing such regressive actions, we are deeply saddened. The responsibility for blowing up the railways and roads connecting South and North Korea rests entirely with North Korea.' Observers say it is still unlikely for Kim Jong Un to launch preemptive, large-scale attacks on South Korea, because that would certainly invite massive retaliation by the more superior South Korea-U.S. forces, which would pose a threat to his survival. Analysts say the incidents reflect an escalation of tensions on the peninsula but do not signal the imminent start of a military conflict. Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, stated that North Korea's actions are a practical military measure related to the hostile dual-state system it has frequently mentioned and may indicate plans to erect more physical barriers along the border. He also noted that the road detonations could be 'preparatory work for its construction of those walls.' The recent destruction of roads aligns with Kim Jong Un's earlier edict to forgo the aim of peaceful unification with South Korea, marking a significant shift in policy. This action signifies a complete rupture of North and South Korean relations and declares South Korea the 'principal enemy.' Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have sharply increased in recent years, with North Korea performing a series of provocative missile tests, which it describes as a warning in response to the actions of Seoul, and South Korea and the United States expanding their military drills. The South Korean military is bolstering its readiness and surveillance posture in coordination with the United States while closely monitoring North Korean military activities. North Korea has accused South Korea of infiltrating drones to drop a 'huge number' of anti-regime propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month, describing it as a political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict. North Korea threatened to respond with force if South Korean drones drop propaganda leaflets again, warning it would consider it 'a declaration of war.' During a meeting with his top military and security officials, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un described the alleged South Korean drone flights as the 'enemy's serious provocation' and laid out unspecified tasks related to 'immediate military action' and the operation of his 'war deterrent' for defending North Korea's sovereignty. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea would face the end of its regime if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. The South Korean military is strengthening monitoring and maintaining a state of alert. In June 2020, North Korea blew up an empty, South Korean-built liaison office just north of the border in retaliation for South Korean civilian leafleting campaigns. North Korea has a history of staging choreographed events to destroy facilities on its soil as a political message. The destruction of roads connecting the two Koreas is not the first time North Korea has targeted symbols of rapprochement, as it has previously destroyed infrastructure as a political signal. Experts say Kim Jong Un likely wants to reduce South Korea's voice in the regional nuclear standoff and seek direct ties with the United States. Analysts say Kim Jong Un is also likely hoping to reduce South Korea's cultural influence and strengthen his rule at home. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. North Korea has also planted mines, removed lamps along its sections of the inter-Korean roads, and taken out ties on the northern side of the railways. The operations of these routes were later suspended as the Koreas wrangled over North Korea's nuclear program and other issues, with recent announcements from Pyongyang indicating further cuts and fortifications. Tuesday's detonations appear largely symbolic after Kim Jong Un removed the concept of peaceful reunification with the South from North Korea's policy stance. Kim Jong Un's regime has stepped up its defiance of the United States and its allies in recent years by ramping up its nuclear production efforts and strengthening ties with Russia. Washington has accused North Korea of supplying ammunition and missiles to Moscow for its war in Ukraine, a charge that Pyongyang denies. The South Korean Ministry of Unification reminded: 'We reiterate that North Korea still has the obligation to repay the debt.'

India and Canada expel each other's diplomats amid dispute over S...	Trudeau claims 'credible allegations' link Indian agents to Hardeep Singh Nijjar's murder on Canadian soil India has expelled six Canadian diplomats, including Acting High Commissioner Stewart Ross Wheeler and Deputy High Commissioner Patrick Hebert, marking a significant escalation in diplomatic tensions between the two nations. This move comes in the wake of heightened tensions over allegations made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accusing Indian agents of involvement in the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil. On October 14, 2024, India announced that the expelled diplomats must leave the country by 11:59 pm on Saturday, October 19, 2024. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India stated, 'The Government of India has decided to expel the following six Canadian Diplomats: Mr. Stewart Ross Wheeler, Acting High Commissioner; Mr. Patrick Hebert, Deputy High Commissioner; Marie Catherine Joly, First Secretary; Ian Ross David Trites, First Secretary; Adam James Chuipka, First Secretary; Paula Orjuela, First Secretary.' Canada had earlier informed India that it expelled six Indian diplomats, including High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, over allegations of their involvement in a criminal network targeting Canadian Sikhs. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly stated that the expulsions were due to accusations of 'widespread murder, extortion and coercion' by Indian diplomats across Canada. In a press release, she said, 'Keeping Canadians safe is the fundamental job of the Canadian government. The decision to expel these individuals was made with great consideration and only after the RCMP gathered ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case. We continue to ask that the Indian government support the ongoing investigation in the Nijjar case, as it remains in both our countries’ interest to get to the bottom of this.' The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) disclosed ongoing investigations into the involvement of agents of the Government of India in serious criminal activity in Canada. RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme reported that there had been 'over a dozen credible and imminent threats to life' specifically focused on members of the pro-Khalistan movement. He stated, 'We reached a point where we felt it was imperative to confront the government of India,' but discussions with Indian law enforcement were unsuccessful. India has strongly denied the allegations regarding Nijjar's killing, calling them 'absurd' and 'motivated,' with Prime Minister Narendra Modi describing the allegations as preposterous. The Indian foreign ministry dismissed the aspersions cast against High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma as 'ludicrous and deserving of contempt,' and stated the report contained 'unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations.' India's Ministry of External Affairs stated, 'There is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains,' in response to the allegations made by Canada. The diplomatic fallout occurred after allegations by RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme regarding the involvement of Indian government agents in serious criminal activities in Canada, including a 'threat to public safety.' The RCMP has evidence indicating that 'agents of the Indian government have used various entities in Canada and abroad to gather information,' and they have established linkages between this investigation and agents of the Government of India. RCMP Deputy Commissioner Brigitte Gauvin described the situation as 'extremely concerning' and emphasized that Indian diplomats must protect their nationals' interests and not engage in criminal activities, which is a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who held Canadian citizenship, was a leader in the movement for an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan, and had been a vocal supporter of the Khalistan movement, organizing an unofficial referendum for it at the time of his death. He was murdered in June 2023 near Vancouver, raising significant concerns within the Canadian community regarding the safety of individuals from the South Asian diaspora. The tension escalated when Trudeau claimed that Indian government agents were involved in the murder of Nijjar on Canadian soil, which he described as 'credible allegations.' Trudeau stated, 'The government of India made a fundamental error in thinking that they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians here on Canadian soil, whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts.' He accused India of using its diplomats and organized crime to attack Canadian citizens, linking these actions to allegations of murder, extortion, and coercion. India has accused Trudeau of pandering to Canada’s large Sikh community for political gain, believing he is targeting India to gain votes from Khalistanis in the upcoming elections. India has in the past described Hardeep Singh Nijjar as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group, having been designated a terrorist in 2020 for alleged involvement in an attack on a Hindu priest—accusations his supporters termed unfounded. Following Trudeau's allegations in September 2023, relations between India and Canada deteriorated significantly, with India suspending the issuance of new visas for Canadians and asking Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic presence. The diplomatic row has led to a significant deterioration in ties, with India asking Canada to reduce its diplomatic staff by 41 out of 62 members and suspending visa services. The Indian government expressed that it has 'no faith' in the current Canadian government's commitment to ensuring the safety of the six expelled diplomats, leading to the decision to withdraw them. India's Ministry of External Affairs stated, 'Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner [Sanjay Kumar Verma] and other diplomats and officials.' India 'strongly' rejected a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats were 'persons of interest' in an investigation, calling it 'preposterous imputations' and part of the political agenda of the Justin Trudeau government. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly confirmed that the diplomats were expelled and not withdrawn, as reported by Canada's foreign ministry. She added, 'We continue to ask that the Indian government support the ongoing investigation in the Nijjar case, as it remains in both our countries’ interest to get to the bottom of this.' The RCMP links Indian government agents to homicides, acts of violence, and organized crime targeting the South Asian community in Canada, as well as interference in democratic processes. The RCMP found evidence of interference in Canadian democratic processes. The RCMP has evidence indicating that 'agents of the Indian government have used various entities in Canada and abroad to gather information,' and they have established linkages between this investigation and agents of the Government of India. India has vehemently denied all accusations regarding Nijjar's death and described the actions taken by Canadian authorities as 'unjustified' and 'completely unacceptable,' reflecting a growing frustration in diplomatic relations. India's Ministry of External Affairs warned that India now reserves the right to take further actions in response to recent efforts by the Canadian government to fabricate allegations against Indian diplomats. The Indian government expressed that it has 'no faith' in the current Canadian government's commitment to ensuring the safety of the six expelled diplomats. The mutual expulsion of high-ranking diplomats constitutes a further escalation of the conflict between Canada and India. The developments came hours after the Canadian government declared the six Indian officials as 'persons of interest' for their alleged role in the June 2023 killing of pro-Khalistan figure Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia. Canada underscored its commitment to keeping citizens safe, asserting, 'Canada took this decision as its main interest remains the safety and security of all Canadians, defending our sovereignty and upholding the rule of law.' Stewart Wheeler stated that Canada has provided 'credible and irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.' He added, 'It is in the interests of both our countries and the peoples of our countries to get to the bottom of this.' After leaving the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, Wheeler reiterated Trudeau's accusation regarding the Indian government's involvement in the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. The RCMP disclosed ongoing investigations into the involvement of agents of the government of India in serious criminal activity in Canada. RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said the RCMP has charged 'a significant number' of people with direct involvement in homicides, extortions, and other criminal acts of violence over the past few years. The RCMP added, 'Despite law enforcement action, the harm has continued, posing a serious threat to our public safety.' India has been asking countries like Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom to take legal action against Sikh activists involved in the Khalistan movement. The Khalistan movement is banned in India but has support among a minority of Sikhs in the diaspora, especially in Canada. Approximately 770,000 Sikhs live in Canada, constituting 2% of the Canadian population, with significant support for the pro-Khalistan movement among the diaspora. Relations between India and Canada have been severely strained since Trudeau alleged he had credible evidence linking Indian agents to Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s murder, particularly following his claims of 'potential' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of the Khalistani terrorist. India has categorically denied allegations regarding Nijjar's death, calling them 'absurd and motivated' and 'preposterous.' The Indian foreign ministry said earlier on Monday, 'This latest step follows interactions that have again witnessed assertions without any facts. This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains.'

Israel faces 'severe shortage' of interceptor missiles, says repo...	Experts and senior officials in the military industry tell London-based Financial Times newspaper that Israel is facing a 'serious munitions issue' as it prepares for an attack in Iran, which could ignite further escalation. CEO of IAI: 'Some of our lines work 24 hours, 7 days a week. It is no secret that we need to replenish stocks.'' Israel faces a severe shortage of interceptor missiles, as it strengthens its air defense systems to defend against attacks by Iran and its proxies, the London-based Financial Times newspaper reported Tuesday morning, citing senior military industry officials, former officers and experts. The newspaper describes how the U.S. is rushing to help close the gaps, including the deployment of the advanced THAAD air defense system that will soon arrive in Israel, in what is described as a race against time to strengthen Israel's air defense. 'Israel’s munitions issue is serious,'' Dana Stroll, a former senior official at the U.S. Department of Defense, responsible for the Middle East, explained to the newspaper. 'If Iran responds to an Israel attack [with a massive air strike campaign], and Hezbollah joins in too, Israel air defenses will be stretched,' she said, adding that U.S. stockpiles are not limitless. 'The U.S. can’t continue supplying Ukraine and Israel at the same pace. We are reaching a tipping point.' The newspaper links the closing of the gaps in defense to the Pentagon's announcement of the deployment of the THAAD system that will arrive in Israel, in preparation for the expected attack in Iran, which could lead to further regional escalation. According to the Pentagon, the U.S. is 'rushing' to help close the gaps in the Israeli defense lines, which is why it announced the placement of the battery. Boaz Levy, chief executive of Israel Aerospace Industries, a state-owned company which makes the Arrow interceptors used to shoot down ballistic missiles, told the newspaper he is running triple shifts to keep production lines running. 'Some of our lines are working 24 hours, seven days a week. Our goal is to meet all our obligations,' Levy said, adding that the time required to produce interceptor missiles is 'not a matter of days'. While Israel does not disclose the size of its stockpiles, he added: 'It is no secret that we need to replenish stocks.' The British newspaper explained that Israel's three-tiered air defense systems have so far succeeded in intercepting most of the UAVs and missiles fired by Iran and its proxies at the country. The Iron Dome system intercepted short-range rockets and UAVs fired by Hamas from Gaza, while the David Slingshot intercepted heavier rockets fired from Lebanon, and the Arrow system stopped ballistic missiles from Iran. During the Iranian attack in April, according to the IDF, a 99% interception rate was achieved against the barrage, which included 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles. Israel reportedly had less success in repelling the second barrage, that took place at the beginning of the month, which included more from 180 ballistic missiles. Intelligence sources told the newspaper that nearly 35 missiles hit the Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel near Be'er Sheva. As for Hezbollah, Lt. Col. Assaf Orion, former head of the strategy department in the IDF, explained to the British newspaper: 'We are not seeing Hizbollah’s full capability yet. It has only been firing at around a tenth of its estimated prewar launching capacity, a few hundred rockets a day instead of as many as 2,000.' 'Some of that gap is a choice by Hezbollah not to go full out, and some of it is due to degradation by the IDF . . . But Hezbollah has enough left to mount a strong operation,' Orion added. 'Haifa and northern Israel are still on the receiving end of rocket and drone attacks almost every day.' During the security review presented to the ministers Monday by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the head of the IDF's Strategy Division Major General Eliezer Toledano, Gallant was asked about armaments. He replied that there was a large gap when he entered the Defense Ministry, which he instructed to be filled before the start of the war. He revealed that 'we are still dependent in air armaments and American planes,' but he clarified that 'we are working with all our might to promote blue-white production and the development of independence' on the issue of armaments. Our commentator Ron Ben Yishai pointed out in a recent piece that the agreement being formed with the U.S. to place THAAD in Israel is as much a result of American coercion as it is of Israeli necessity. The IDF's need is clear: It needs the addition of American interceptor missiles and launchers to deal with the hundreds of missiles that the Iranians may launch , if and when Israel responds to the attack against it on October 1. In this case, the quantities and numbers speak for themselves. The more missiles are launched in one or two small volleys in order to saturate the defense systems - the more launchers, interceptor missiles and radars are needed. Israel has several layers of interceptor missile batteries. On top is the Arrow 3 system, which hits the attacking missiles at a distance of hundreds of kilometers outside the atmosphere. Below that is the Arrow 2, which hits missiles close to the limit of the atmosphere, at a distance exceeding 100 kilometers. Far below is the David Slingshot system, which is designed to protect against missiles from a long distance in the atmosphere. At the bottom is the Iron Dome, which protects sites and intercepts missiles at short ranges of up to a hundred kilometers. Brigadier General Zvika Chaimovitz, former commander of the air defense system, said Tuesday morning in an interview with Ynet: 'The THAAD system is a significant force component and I don't want to compare it with the Arrow system, but in the end you add dozens more interceptors. It is a significant force that joins our forces, and we have seen scenarios of 200 missiles. It is assumed that if the conflict with Iran continues, we are expected to see more here.' According to him, 'the U.S. is a great power. When you look at capabilities, it's not a numbers game. In the end it's a combination of defense and attack. As for the economy of armaments, it is the result of policy. I don't think, from my knowledge, that an armaments economy component is leading the U.S. We are very far from the stage where we will have to do a lack economy.' He also emphasizes that, despite the damage to the terrorist organization, Hezbollah still 'has more capabilities.' 'It is too early to eulogize it. Hezbollah is in the stage of recovery and coming out of the shock. It is a decentralized organization, very focused at the strategic level.'

Australia puts sanctions and travel bans on 5 Iranians	Australia's government has imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on five Iranians contributing to the country's missile defense program, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Tuesday. Iran's launch of at least 180 ballistic missiles against Israel on Oct. 1 was a 'dangerous escalation that increased the risk of a wider regional war,' Wong said in a statement. The fresh sanctions target two directors and a senior official in Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization, the director of the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group, and the commercial director of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group. The decision brings to 200 the number of Iran-linked individuals and entities now sanctioned by Australia. 'Australia will continue to hold Iran to account for its reckless and destabilizing actions,' Wong said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1cui9sykg	2024-10-15T00:16:25-07:00

Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, said on Tuesday Israel deliberately chose to expand what he called its 'aggression' to implement pre-planned schemes in the West Bank and Lebanon. Israel had done so 'because it sees that the scope for that is available,' he said in his annual speech to open the Shura Council. The Council has legislative authority and approves general state policies and the budget, but has no say in the setting of defense, security, economic and investment policy for the small but wealthy gas producer, which bans political parties. Amendments to Qatar's constitution will be proposed by the Shura Council and put to a popular referendum vote, Qatar's Emir added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryb2gqiy1x	2024-10-14T23:50:49-07:00	
UN Security Council expresses 'strong concern' for UNIFIL workers	International law must be obeyed,' council warns, as peacekeeping force on border with Lebanon refuses to evacuate border area for its own safetly despite IDF requests as fighting rages The UN Security Council issued a statement overnight between Monday and Tuesday condemning the repeated incidents in which UNIFIL personnel were injured by IDF fire in southern Lebanon, and saying that the Security Council has 'strong concern' about the harm to peacekeeping force personnel. 'We express our strong concern after several UNIFIL positions were damaged. We urge all parties to respect the safety and security of the peacekeepers,' according to the statement. 'We also express deep concern regarding civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. We call on all parties in Lebanon to comply with international humanitarian law and the full implementation of Resolution 1701, which requires additional practical steps to be implemented. In addition, we emphasize the need for diplomatic efforts that will bring an end to the conflict.' Israel has turned to UNIFIL many times over the past two weeks in an attempt to evacuate the force's personnel from their positions in southern Lebanon for their own safety, following incidents in which UN peacekeeping force personnel were injured. Various commanders in the IDF, including an officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel, asked the force to move its position so that nothing would happen to them, but it has not responded. Requests were also forwarded to the commander of the force himself. UNIFIL firmly refuses to listen to the Israeli entreaties to move its positions and insists on remaining in the line of fire, as well as actually endangering the foreign soldiers arriving from countries around the world. Since the ground operation began, the IDF has asked UNIFIL to withdraw its forces five kilometers from the Blue Line, the nickname of the border between Israel and Lebanon, so that they are not harmed. The absolute refusal to evacuate surprised Israel, but the force's answer was unequivocal: 'We will not move from our positions.' The spokesman of UNIFIL, Andrea Tenenti, posted a video Monday night on the X platform in which he reiterated that the force will not move from its positions. 'We are staying. We are in southern Lebanon under the mandate of the Security Council, so it is important to maintain an international presence and maintain the UN flag in the region,' he said. He added: 'There were several targeted attacks against our soldiers, and the parties have an obligation to protect the peacekeepers and ensure their safety and security. At the end of the week, UNIFIL accused the IDF of opening fire on its peacekeepers 'intentionally' several times, in the direction of its positions, hitting cameras and a guard tower, and that within 48 hours five of its men were wounded. UNIFIL also complained that IDF tanks were approaching the positions in a way that endangered the security personnel and that the tanks were drawing fire from Hezbollah. Yesterday, a joint statement from Italy, Great Britain, France and Germany joined the many condemnations that Israel received following the attack on UNIFIL personnel. 'UNIFIL plays an essential balancing role,' stated the four countries, who noted that Israel must maintain the security of the force's personnel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that 'the best way to ensure the peace of UNIFIL soldiers is to listen to Israel's request to temporarily move away from the danger zone.' According to Netanyahu: 'The charge that Israel deliberately attacked UNIFIL personnel is completely false. It's exactly the opposite. Israel repeatedly asked UNIFIL to get out of harm’s way. It repeatedly asked them to temporarily leave the combat zone, which is right next to Israel’s border with Lebanon. In fact, on the day that Israel began its ground operation next to our border with Lebanon, we asked them specifically, 'Please leave this area so you're not harmed.'' Netanyahu added: 'Israel is not fighting UNIFIL. It's not fighting the people of Lebanon. It is fighting Iran’s proxy Hezbollah, which uses Lebanese territory to attack Israel. Hezbollah attacked Israel last year without any provocation on October 8th, a day after the Hamas massacre, and it's continued to attack us ever since by launching over 10,000 rockets and missiles at Israel.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyhecks1yl	2024-10-14T23:43:40-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/r1eS6t00RR/r1eS6t00RR_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Report: Israel faces severe shortage of interceptor missiles	Israel faces a severe shortage of interceptor missiles, while strengthening its air defense systems to defend against attacks by Iran and its proxies, according to the London-based Financial Times, citing senior military industry officials, former officers and experts. 'Israel's munitions problem is serious,' Dana Stroll, a former senior official at the U.S. Department of Defense, who is responsible for the Middle East, explained to the newspaper. 'If Iran responds to the Israeli attack, and Hezbollah also joins in, Israel's air defenses will be stretched,' she said, adding that the supplies of interceptors are not infinite.

More than 200 demonstrators arrested; Many from groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace; they chanted 'let Gaza live' and 'stop funding genocide' in front of the exchange's iconic building and also protested against operation in Lebanon Police arrested more than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had staged a sit-in outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday to demand an end to U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza, authorities said. The protesters, many of them from activist groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace, chanted 'let Gaza live' and 'stop funding genocide' in front of the exchange's iconic building near Wall Street, in lower Manhattan. None of the protesters got inside the stock exchange but dozens crossed a police security fence set up outside its main building on Broad Street. A police spokesperson said 206 arrests were made, without providing details. Jewish groups involved with the protests said around 500 demonstrators attended. The stock exchange had no immediate comment. The protesters directed anger at American defense contractors and weapons manufacturers. Others chanted slogans against Israeli attacks in Lebanon, where Israel says it is waging war against Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. '(Hundreds) of Jews and friends are shutting down the New York Stock Exchange to demand the U.S. stop arming Israel and profiting from genocide,' Jewish Voice for Peace said on X, opens new tab. Israel denies genocide allegations at the World Court, and says its military operations in Gaza target Hamas militants. There was also a much smaller number of pro-Israel counter protesters at the site, who carried Israeli flags. The demonstration was the latest expression of anger against American support for Israel's assault on Gaza, which it launched after Hamas killed 1,200 in Israel and took 250 others hostage in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent military assault on blockaded Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire population, according to Gaza health officials.

Over 200 Hezbollah targets struck in Lebanon in last 24 hours	The airstrikes also took place deep within Lebanon; IDF troops continue operational activity in the central and southern Gaza Strip Over the past day, in coordination with ground troops, the Israeli Air Force has struck more than 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in southern Lebanon and deep within Lebanon, including terrorist cells, anti-tank missile posts, and surface-to-surface missile launchers, the IDF spokesman reported on Tuesday morning. In one of the strikes, the troops identified multiple terrorists entering a structure in the area. Shortly following the identification, the IAF struck the site and eliminated the terrorists. The IDF is continuing 'targeted operational activity against Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon,' according to the IDF. Troops eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and in IAF strikes, dismantled Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure, and located vast quantities of weaponry. On Monday, the IDF located an underground complex that served as the headquarters of Hezbollah's elite unit, Radwan Force. The headquarters, about 800 meters long, is located close to the border with Israel, in the heart of a civilian neighborhood in southern Lebanon. The soldiers located weapon caches in the tunnel, including anti-helicopter missiles, munitions, motorcycles, additional underground shafts, and enough supplies to stay in the underground complex, including food, a kitchen, and living quarters. According to the IDF, all of these were intended to be used by the Radwan Force as part of the plan to occupy the Galilee. According to the military spokesperson, the troops found cups with coffee that was still hot when they arrived. In the Gaza Strip, IDF troops are continuing operational activity in the Jabaliya area and have eliminated dozens of terrorists over the past day, the IDF spokesman reported on Tuesday morning.

This is how the Hezbollah UAV evaded detection, with fatal result...	Aerial defenses lost the drone 30 miles northeast of Acre; Misidentified as birds, it evaded interception twice, using GPS for precise targeting, leading to a deadly impact on a military base On Monday morning, Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar conducted a personal inspection of the Golani Training Base site before the initial assessment of the drone strike's impact. In recent months, IDF has noted that the Air Force intercepts drones daily from all fronts. Major General Bar has ordered the full elimination of all operatives and commanders of Hezbollah's UAV unit (Unit 127) as the most effective countermeasure against the threat. Their elimination will now receive intelligence and operational priority. Since the war's onset, about 1,200 UAVs have been launched toward Israel from various fronts. In total, approximately 23,000 different launches have been recorded, including rockets and missiles. Within Israeli territory, 221 UAVs have hit, while the rest were intercepted with a success rate of about 80%. 'For over a decade, we have prepared for the UAV threat, and it cannot be said that we were unprepared for it,' the IDF stated. 'We came strong, but in defense, there's never enough, and there's always room for more progress and investment. We examine every idea and proposal.' The primary reason for the UAV's successful strike on the dining hall was that it disappeared off of the radar 30 miles northeast of Acre after being initially tracked by IDF detection systems. After about half an hour, it hit the base, killing four soldiers and injuring dozens. In hindsight, IDF understands that the Air Force mistakenly believed the UAV had crashed into the sea. Apart from a brief minute-and-a-half tracking segment found later as it headed toward northern Sharon, it wasn't detected. Radar analysis suggested it could have been classified as a UAV or a flock of birds, but due to a short timeframe and the presence of hundreds of low-altitude targets, including birds, it wasn't classified as such. The Air Force attempted to shoot it down twice, following the interception of two similar UAVs from Lebanon by a missile boat and Iron Dome. It flew low over roads on its way to the Golani base. Using a GPS system installed on it, it flew to a predefined point with pinpoint accuracy to a specific room. There was no real-time navigation. Its warhead contained three to four pounds of explosives and extensive shrapnel, but the precise angle of impact enabled the deadly strike and penetration. Initial findings also reveal that a report was received from the police to the Air Control Unit near the northern town of Yokneam about a suspicious aircraft seen by a civilian. However, at the same time, a helicopter matching the description and location was in the sky, most likely causing some confusion. As a preliminary lesson from the incident, Major General Bar instructed the widening of the margins even further regarding alerts to towns and military camps, which may lead to more alarms and false alerts in the coming days, or 'To err on the side of caution with a more permissive alert policy.' It also became clear that at the beginning of the launch of the three UAVs, there was a combined event in which Hezbollah launched rockets and three precise missiles toward the Haifa area, indicating a coordinated and synchronized barrage. IDF identified signs of tactical recovery by Hezbollah after the initial blows it suffered. They are making adjustments and trying to improve after everything we've taken and continue to take from them,' according to the IDF. After the publication of the initial investigation findings, Golani Brigade Commander Colonel Adi Ganot addressed his soldiers. 'The Golani Training Base serves as the gateway to the brigade. The great loss we suffered this year is difficult and painful, but, as always, we have known and will know how to recover and rise from it and continue with our mission: defending the State of Israel and its residents.'

Hezbollah slams BBC for joining IDF press tour in Lebanon	Hezbollah accuses BBC of violating 'the sanctity of Lebanese lands, Lebanese sovereignty and Lebanese laws' calling it unjustified and 'absolutely unacceptable' Hezbollah’s Media Relations Office condemned the British BBC network on Monday after a team entered a village in southern Lebanon accompanied by the IDF. According to Hezbollah's announcement, published in an official statement, the BBC violated Lebanon's 'territory, sovereignty, and applicable Lebanese laws.' Hezbollah released the following statement. 'In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The BBC, with all its platforms and in different languages, did not just blindly side with the murderers and criminals and justify the Zionist barbarism against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, but brazenly sent a team that entered a southern village accompanied by the occupation army and violated the sanctity of Lebanese territory, sovereignty, and applicable Lebanese laws, as shown by the reports published by this institution.' 'Hezbollah’s Media Relations condemns this unjustified and absolutely unacceptable move and demands the Ministry of Information, the National Media Council, and the relevant judicial and security agencies take the necessary legal measures against the BBC and its teams in Lebanon and protest to the BBC Company and the legal bodies representing it. It also demands that the unions of journalists, editors, and free media outlets in the world condemn this step,' the terror organization said. Journalists were taken by the military spokesperson into South Lebanon, where troops uncovered Hezbollah's underground infrastructure. On Monday, the IDF revealed an 800-meter-long tunnel prepared with a fully-contained kitchen, and missiles and weapons in the ready for use by Radwan forces in their planned invasion of the Galilee. Another tunnel that was located by the soldiers, had vehicles with full gas tanks, fitted with machineguns and new, still packed military gear ready for the invading terrorists to use, along with personal equipment they may need. Hezbollah prefers that its activity be covered by agreeable, affiliated media networks such as the Lebanese Al-Mayadeen network, the Al-Akhbar newspaper, or Radio A-Nur. Whenever reports come from unaffiliated media networks, the terror organization raises problems, citing even violent incidents between Hezbollah operatives or supporters and journalists who came to cover a story. Such clashes have often been seen in the Dahiyeh district in ​​Beirut, an area considered Hezbollah's stronghold, which has suffered several attacks in recent weeks. The terror organization is trying to doctor the information coming out of Dahiyeh which explains why we have seen Lebanese broadcasts interrupted by Lebanese officials, either from Hezbollah or the organization's supporters, who did not allow them to broadcast freely from the areas of the attacks in recent weeks. Hezbollah actively tries to suppress networks that broadcast, according to the terrorist organization, the Israeli narrative. Every once in a while, an article would appear on Hezbollah-affiliated networks, saying that any network violated the organization's 'rules' and stood by Israel. For example, following the assassination of the former Hezbollah Chief of Staff Fuad Shukr, a Hezbollah supporter reprimanded a Sky News reporter after she had called the terror organization a 'militia.' The Hezbollah supporter stood next to her and demanded that she never call the organization a militia while the Al-Akhbar newspaper reported the incident and added that it was biased coverage against Hezbollah.

Israel tells US Iran strike will not target oil or nuclear facili...	Officials say the strike will be significant and they are preparing for a counter-attack in full coordination with the Americans ; 'Israel and the U.S. see eye to eye' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed the U.S. that Israel was willing to attack Iranian military targets and not oil or nuclear facilities, according to a report in the Washington Post, quoting two officials, to avoid regional war. Officials in Jerusalem said the Israeli strike in retaliation for Iran launching 180 ballistic missiles on Israel earlier this month, would be substantial. Netanyahu has been consulting with his defense minister and senior security officials to decide on the timing and scope of the attack. On Sunday, he met with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief Herzi Halevi and senior intelligence officials in an intelligence base, for an unannounced meeting and continued consultations on Monday. The Biden administration announced it was deploying its THAAD missile defense system to the area along with American troops that would operate it, to bolster defenses should Iran launch a new and more extensive attack. The discussions with Washington continue, to reach maximum coordination if Iran does respond to the Israeli strike but according to the UK-based Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper, Iran has indicated that if the Israeli attack is a limited one, this round would be closed. 'There is an understanding among some senior Israelis that Iran is interested in a cease-fire,' sources told the paper. 'Israel and the U.S. see eye to eye,' officials said. 'There is no is coordination about the attack and what would follow,' he said adding the Israelis believe Iran will respond.

IDF's new target: Hezbollah's drone unit courtesy of Iran	Hezbollah's Unit 127, founded by Hassan al-Laqis, who was assassinated near his Beirut home a decade ago, specializes in UAV development learned from Iran, now tops the military's target list after a deadly drone attack kills soldiers; Amid the dense forest of geopolitical maneuvering, Hezbollah's Unit 127—its drone division—has emerged as a formidable player, evolving significantly since the 2006 Second Lebanon War. This unit, primarily rooted in Lebanon, has sharpened its expertise in crafting and deploying drones for a spectrum of purposes—ranging from offensive operations to intelligence gathering. Major General Tomer Bar, the Air Force Commander, ordered the corps to prioritize the dismantling of this unit's cadre, marking them as high-value targets in the complex chess game of regional security. This comes in the wake of the deadly attack by a Sayyad 107 drone that exploded Golani training base's dining hall, claiming the lives of four soldiers and injuring dozens of others. The brainchild behind this drone initiative was senior Hezbollah figure Hassan al-Laqis, who was allegedly assassinated over a decade ago near his Beirut residence. Al-Laqis, who had been a mastermind in UAV development, reportedly frequented Iran, visiting factories, engaging in military drills, and consulting with experts. His name, etched in Hezbollah's lore, was often invoked by former Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who spoke about al-Laqis's pioneering efforts in UAV technology for Hezbollah. Nasrallah himself was known to visit al-Laqis’s labs, where innovation in drone technology was nurtured to meet the tactical needs of the organization. Unit 127's reach extends beyond Lebanon, playing a pivotal role in establishing drone infrastructure in Syria, particularly in regions like Homs and Palmyra, in direct collaboration with local Iranian forces. This unit operates closely with Iran's Quds Force Unit 340, which aids Iran's proxies in developing autonomous weapon production capabilities across the Middle East—from Yemen to Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed an unrelenting offensive against Hezbollah across all of Lebanon, including Beirut. He said this was a broader, grueling campaign against what he termed the 'axis of evil' led by Iran, asserting that despite the heavy toll, Israel continues to achieve significant strategic victories.

Netanyahu says Hezbollah uses UNIFIL positions to attack Israel	PM says accusations that IDF purposely targeting peacekeepers are false and repeats his call for the UNIFIL forces to withdraw for their protection; 'We are not fighting UNIFIL or Lebanese civilians but an arm of Iran that attacks Israel,' he says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Hezbollah was using UNIFIL positions to attack Israel. The prime minister responded to a statement issued by European nations condemning Israeli attacks on the peacekeeping force in South Lebanon. 'Israeli attacks on the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are contrary to international humanitarian law and must stop at once, Italy, Britain, France and Germany said. In their statement, the four nations reaffirmed 'the essential stabilizing role' played by UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, adding that Israel and other parties had to ensure the safety of the peacekeepers at all times. Last week the leaders of Italy and France said they were outraged by the IDF attacks that resulted in injury to three members of the force. The U.S. also voiced concern and said they were seeking explanations from Israel. The UNIFIL mission, which includes hundreds of European soldiers, has said it has repeatedly come under attack from the IDF in recent days but rejected any possible withdrawal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected accusations that Israeli troops had deliberately targeted the peacekeepers as 'completely false' and repeated a call for them to be withdrawn from combat zones. He said the military did its utmost to avoid harming UNIFIL personnel while striking Hezbollah fighters. 'But the best way to assure the safety of UNIFIL personnel is for them to heed Israel's request and to temporarily get out of harm's way.' He said Israel was not fighting against the UNIFIL force or the citizens of Lebanon but against an arm of the Iranian regime, the Hezbollah terror group that has used Lebanese territory to attack Israel and continues to do so. 'Hezbollah launched over 10,000 rockets and missiles at Israel. It uses UNIFIL positions and installations for cover while attacking Israeli cities and their residents,' Netanyahu said. 'These attacks have cost many Israeli lives, including on Sunday [in the deadly drone strike on a base, killing four] and Israel has the right to defend itself and will continue to do so.' On Sunday, Netanyahu called on UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to order the UNIFIL forces to leave the areas where fighting was underway, for their own safety. 'Mr. Secretary General, Get the UNIFIL forces out of harm's way. It should be done right now, immediately,' Netanyahu said in a video posted by his office. He said Israel regrets any harm caused to the peacekeeping troops and does everything possible to prevent such harm but the simple way to avoid such events is simply to remove the troops from danger.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjsdkwjk1g	2024-10-14T13:41:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/13/B1btsvKJye/B1btsvKJye_0_307_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

EU sanctions Iran for supplying drones and missiles to Russia	Sanctions are imposed on Iran's defense officials and airlines, freezing assets after earlier warning of swift response to Iranian military support for Russia's war on Ukraine The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on Iran’s deputy defense minister, senior members of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and three airlines over allegations that they supplied drones, missiles and other equipment to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari is one of seven senior officials now banned from traveling in Europe and whose assets in the bloc were frozen. The EU said he 'is involved in the development of Iran’s (drone) and missile program,' given his high-level defense role. Iran Air, Mahan Air and Saha Airlines had their assets frozen. The EU said their planes were 'used repeatedly to transfer Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles and related technologies to Russia, which have been used in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.' EU foreign ministers endorsed the sanctions at a meeting in Luxembourg In March, the bloc had warned that 'were Iran to transfer ballistic missiles and related technology to Russia for use against Ukraine, the EU would be prepared to respond swiftly, including with new and significant restrictive measures.' EU member countries, with the exception of Hungary, have been supplying weapons and ammunition as well as economic and other support to Ukraine worth some 118 billion euros ($129 billion) since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on reports of an attack on UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon and said that 'the best way to ensure the safety of UNIFIL soldiers is to heed Israel's request to temporarily retreat from the danger zone. The accusation that Israel attacked UNIFIL on purpose is completely false. The opposite is true. Israel repeatedly asked UNIFIL to stay away from danger. In fact, on the day the ground operation near the Lebanese border began, we asked them explicitly.' Netanyahu added that 'Israel is not fighting UNIFIL and the citizens of Lebanon, but an Iranian proxy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rysdp1okkl	2024-10-14T11:51:01-07:00	
FM Katz welcomes EU and UK recent sanctions on Iran	Following the EU and the UK, imposing sanctions on Iran for proliferating arms and threatening Europe and the Middle East's stability, Foreign Minister Israel Katz commented on the decision. 'I welcome the decision by the European Union and the UK to impose additional sanctions on Iran, including on airlines and individuals involved in the transfer of ballistic missiles and UAVs that threaten Europe and the Middle East. These sanctions send a clear message that the international community will not tolerate Iran's dangerous actions, its support for terrorism, and its destabilization of the region. Iran and its proxies continue to pose a threat to the free world, and through coordinated and decisive action can we stop its aggression and ensure security in the region.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1f11byikjl	2024-10-14T11:47:34-07:00	
Arab states shift humanitarian aid from Gaza to Lebanon	UAE's 'With You, Lebanon' campaign and Qatar's medical supplies highlight regional support, while aid deliveries face challenges amid reports of Israeli attacks on convoys In recent weeks, humanitarian aid from Arab nations has shifted from Gaza to Lebanon after repeated IDF strikes and after the ground offensive began, forcing residents of the south to move north to safety. The United Arab Emirates launched the 'With You, Lebanon' campaign to provide support and humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people. Arab reports claim that this campaign has already amassed 250 tons of aid. Over 4,400 volunteers have helped collect approximately 10,000 aid packages for Lebanese citizens enduring economic, social, and humanitarian crises worsened by the conflict. Sultan Al-Shamsi, the UAE's Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs for Development and International Organizations, said that the campaign underscores the Emirates' solidarity with Lebanon. He also said that the UAE will continue its support, especially with winter approaching. While the UAE has also been providing substantial aid to Gaza since the war began, recent days have seen a notable shift in focus toward Lebanon, since transporting aid there is more feasible by land, air, or sea. In contrast, in Gaza, only the land route has been consistently operational since the war began, while air and sea routes have been less effective. Qatar is also contributing aid to Lebanon. At Beirut's Rafic Hariri Airport, Qatari aid, including 17.3 tons of medical equipment and medicine, has arrived. Reports indicate this is the third plane from Qatar in an airlift initiated by the Minister of State for International Cooperation, Lolwah Al Khater. Known for her support for Gaza and criticisms of Israel, her initiatives have been significant. Lebanon's ambassador to Oman announced a delivery of 40 tons of medicine thanking the 'kind and generous humanitarian initiative,' highlighting Oman's longstanding support for Lebanon during challenging times. Iran's 'Al-Alam' channel said there was a plane arriving in Latakia, Syria, with aid for Lebanese families displaced by the conflict. Some reports from Syria and Lebanon claim Israel was targeting this aid. The Hezbollah-affiliated 'Al-Akhbar' reported an Israeli attack on a convoy in northern Bekaa near Syria. Media linked to Hezbollah also reported Israeli strikes on sites where the humanitarian aid from Iraq and Syria was being collected. Iraq was among the first to send aid to Lebanon, even before the war's significant turning point with the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. Following explosions in Lebanon, Iraq sent 20 medical professionals and 15 tons of aid to Beirut. Lebanon's 'Al-Jadid' channel reported the arrival of a Saudi aid plane, the second within 24 hours. Additionally, Lebanon's 'LBCI' network noted a Royal Jordanian Air Force plane with aid for the Lebanese Army landed in Beirut. Arab media reports indicate Gazans have noticed the shift of humanitarian focus toward Lebanon. Munir Al-Barash, Director-General of the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, told Qatar's 'Al-Jazeera' that Gaza remains the 'burning front now,' despite reports of it becoming a secondary focus. The interview ended abruptly as Al-Barash became emotional discussing the casualties in Gaza.

800 meter Hezbollah tunnel uncovered near border, 'coffee in cups...	The underground base has a fully equipped kitchen next to anti-helicopter missiles, munitions, and motorcycles; complex was to be used by Hezbollah's Radwan Force in its planned invasion of the Galilee The IDF located an underground complex that served as the headquarters of Hezbollah's elite unit, Radwan Force. The headquarters, about 800 meters long, is located close to the border with Israel, in the heart of a civilian neighborhood in southern Lebanon. The soldiers located weapon caches in the tunnel, including anti-helicopter missiles, munitions, motorcycles, additional underground shafts, and enough supplies to stay in the underground complex, including food, a kitchen, and living quarters. According to the IDF, all of these were intended to be used by the Radwan Force as part of the plan to occupy the Galilee. According to the military spokesperson, the troops found cups with coffee that was still hot when they arrived. During a raid on a compound, the IDF encountered a terrorist who had barricaded himself in the headquarters. He was killed in an airstrike. At the same time, troops battled and killed several Radwan terrorists, located weapons, and destroyed Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure above and below ground. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would continue to attack Hezbollah wherever the terrorists are. The prime minister spoke after a visit to the wounded soldiers hurt on Sunday when a Hezbollah drone exploded in a base in central Israel, killing four and wounding dozens more. 'I want to make it clear. We will continue to hit Hezbollah mercilessly in all parts of Lebanon, including in Beirut, according to operational considerations. We have proven this recently, and we will continue to prove it in the coming days as well,' Netanyahu said after reports that the IDF had suspended attacks on the Lebanese capital after the prime minister's call with U.S. President Joe Biden, last week.

PM consults Gallant, Military chief on response to Iran missile s...	The unannounced meeting is held in an intelligence base after the Biden administration decides to deploy its THAAD air defense system to assist Israel in intercepting ballistic missiles Pime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi held a confidential discussion on Sunday night at an Intelligence base. The focus was on a potential Israeli strike on Iran in retaliation for the missile attacks earlier this month. This meeting, which included representatives from the IDF Intelligence Directorate, indicates that the decision on this critical matter will rest solely with these three top officials. Other members of the political-security cabinet will only be briefed on the broad outlines of the decision. Before the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah last month, Netanyahu visited an intelligence base and received a detailed briefing from officers regarding the potential operation. Military sources suggest that this visit gave Netanyahu the confidence to approve the action and further operations against the Shiite terrorist organization. Sunday's meeting is one of several discussions among the three, expected to make the decision, but it is considered the most significant so far. A source familiar with the details said that the three were aligned on the objectives and are likely to keep them from additional cabinet members to prevent any information leaks. Following Iran's ballistic missile attack earlier this month, recent reports indicated that the Islamic Republic was on edge about a possible Israeli response and was working continuously to mitigate it. As far as Israel is concerned, reports from Iran are deemed credible. On Sunday, the United States confirmed the deployment of a THAAD air defense system to the region to assist Israel in intercepting ballistic missiles. About 100 American soldiers would be sent to the area. This move reflects Washington's expectations of an imminent Israeli strike in Iran and a potential Iranian response, recognizing that Israeli defense systems cannot provide complete protection, as evidenced by the ballistic missile attack earlier this month.

IDF strikes Christian area in Lebanon in 1st since war	At least 18 reported killed; Saudi media says the target was a senior member of Hezbollah; earlier reports claim local mayors fearful of displaced with Hezbollah ties bringing danger At least 18 people were killed, and one person was injured on Monday, according to a report in the Reuters news agency, in the first Israeli air strike on the predominately Christian region of Aitou in north Lebanon. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Manar said the house that was hit was rented by one of its reporters Lebanese who evacuated from areas that were under Israeli attack, have moved to other parts of the country and have rented homes there. Local mayors have appealed to them not to host members of Hezbollah, according to reports. According to a report in Lebanon's English language Independent newspaper last August, residents of Dahieh did not believe that the capital would come under attack but after the assassination of Hezbollah's senior military commander Fuad Shukr in July, they became anxious and afraid. The Lebanese government unlike the government in Israel, did not provide any assistance to the displaced, nor did Hezbollah, and that caused outrage. The forced evacuations revealed the split in Lebanese society and landlords were afraid to rent property to people who may have ties to Hezbollah because they may put them at risk. One mayor said his town saw many former residents of Dahieh, trying to find furnished accommodations and landlords were limiting them to one family for each apartment. A Lebanese researcher told the paper that at the start of the war, people were uprooted from the South and moved into Sidon, Nabatiyeh and Beirut but after attacks on the Dahieh, more people were forced to evacuate further to the north and rent prices spiked as a result.

Not in Gaza or Lebanon, but here': The stories of fallen soldier...	Sergeant Omri Tamari, Sergeant Yosef Hieb, Sergeant Yoav Agmon and Sergeant Alon Amitay were killed after a Hezbollah drone exploded inside of their base near Binyamina; these are their stories The IDF on Monday released the names of four soldiers killed in a Hezbollah drone attack on the Golani Training Base near Binyamina the night before. Sergeant Omri Tamari, 19, from Mazkeret Batya; Sergeant Yosef Hieb, 19, from Tuba-Zangariyye; Sergeant Yoav Agmon, 19, from Binyamina-Giv'at Ada and Sergeant Alon Amitay, 19, from Ramot Naftali, all infantry trainees in the Golani Brigade. These are their stories. 'Yosef fell in the same month as his grandfather did' Sergeant Yosef Hieb is the 18th fallen soldier from the Hieb tribe and was a resident of the Bedouin village of Tuba-Zangariyye in the eastern Galilee. Hieb was related to the head of the village’s council, Hussein Hieb, who shared, 'Yosef was a brave soldier, a righteous son, an example of loyalty and giving.' 'We ask God to grant his family patience and comfort during this difficult time. We believe that God chooses pure souls to take them to the gardens of happiness,' he added. Attorney Wissam Omar, a family friend, said in an interview with Ynet on Monday, 'His grandfather fell in 1991 and his father is a police officer. This is a family that has contributed and continues to contribute a lot.' Wissam knew Yosef and shared, 'He was simply a wonderful and lovely child; it's so tragic that he fell. God must have willed it this way. He fell in the same month as his grandfather did. This is a bereaved family. We share in the family's profound grief and offer them our strength.' Amitai visited home on Saturday: 'His mother was anxious' Last Friday, Amitai Alon surprised his parents, Hagit and Itzik and his two younger siblings, twins Uriya and Hadas, 12, by arriving home for Yom Kippur. 'They sent him to say goodbye to his mother. I spoke to him on Friday and he was so happy, so glad to be home for Shabbat,' said Michal Nidam-Alharrar, Amitai's aunt. A few minutes before the start of the fast, Amitai's mother Hagit, managed to wash his uniform, who enlisted into the Golani Brigade eight months ago, just like many members of his large family from Kiryat Shemona who joined the unit. Amitai studied at a high school in Kibbutz Kfar Blum and those who knew him describe him as a beloved, funny and cheerful young man. Two years ago, he lost his two best friends in a car accident, and had since adopted their families and was unwilling to part from them. 'He visited their parents every Friday, never missed even on weekends when he came home from the army and sent them flowers. He never forgot anyone. He made sure to visit his grandparents at the hotel too,' Nidam-Alharrar said. Amitai and his family live in the settlement of Ramot Naftali and were evacuated when the war broke. Hagit, a lieutenant colonel in the reserves, was released from compulsory service two months before October 2023, but was called back to serve when the war began. 'His mother has dedicated her whole life to the military and was so anxious when she sent her eldest son to serve,' his uncle Yishai Alharrar said. 'She was afraid he'd finish basic training and the conflict in Lebanon wouldn't end. She so hoped he wouldn't have to fight there, but the most painful thing is that he was hurt in a place that should've been safe,' Yishai added. On Sunday, Amitai's father, Itzik, drove him to the bus stop and hugged him goodbye. 'He knew something terrible might happen. His mother, Hagit, was so scared and anxious,' Yishai described. Amitai's uncle said he spoke with him mother minutes before the attack took place. 'It was during the training course when they felt safer and that's when he got hurt. A person's fate is sealed,' he said. 'Amitai was eagerly waiting for his enlistment and wanted to be a combat soldier and a commander, just like his mother and uncles. He was an amazing child and a lover of people,' he added. Omri trained for two years to enter a combat unit The drone strike also claimed the life of Omri Tamari from Mazkeret Batya. 'It's incomprehensible for a grandfather to bury his grandson,' said Avraham Tamari, 81, Omri's grandfather, who lives in Kibbutz Sde Avraham. 'My father, Yaakov Tzvi, was killed in the War of Independence in Jerusalem when I was a 5-year-old child. My older brother Shmuel was killed in 1968 during the Jordan Valley War. On that terrible night, we received the call about Omri's death,' he recalled. Omri, who was in a gap year at the kibbutz, took care of animals and worked with children with special needs. He was drafted mid-year into combat service in the unit. He was determined and proud of his military service. 'He prepared himself well for the army and wanted to contribute as much as possible,' Avraham shared. 'He was in great shape and gave his best. He was proud to serve as a combat soldier in Golani,' he added. 'We heard about the attack in Binyamina and thought it might have been at another base until they called to inform us about Omri a few hours later. He used to call to check on me and always said he was in a place where he was contributing.' 'A remarkable figure, a quiet leader, introverted, smart, athletic and deeply principled,' the pre-military training group Omri trained in said following news of his death. 'Omri was dedicated and committed to his personal and team success. After passing many trials, he joined Golani and was driven by a deep sense of duty to the country and its future. 'Omri, who devoted all his energy to combat fitness training for two and a half years, stood out for his dedication and ongoing commitment. Even after joining the army, he stayed connected to the program, which appreciated and loved him back. Omri chose a gap year because of his deep love for the country and his desire to contribute in every possible way,' the group added. Yedidya Etzion, principal the Mazkeret Batya school in which Tamari studies, said, 'It's hard to put into words what Omri was — a young man led by values who excelled in everything he did, physically or intellectually. An outstanding athlete and student, a quiet leader who spoke little but was full of values.' 'I never heard him say a bad word about anyone or even complain — he was always focused on doing good wherever he was, whether at school, during his gap year, or in the army,' he added. Yoav died just a few kilometers from his family's home Yoav Agmon was the second of four children in the Agmon family. The son of Tzafrir, a high-tech professional at Elbit System, and Lilach, an elementary school teacher. He enlisted this past August and took great pride in his combat service in Golani. 'Yoav was always smiling and helping everyone, one of those people you call 'salt of the earth,'' his close friend said. 'He was full of joy and loved by all his friends. We never thought tragedy would strike so close to home.' The tragic incident took place at the Golani Training Base, which is less than three kilometers (1.8 miles) from the family's home. 'It's incomprehensible,' a relative said in pain. 'Not in Gaza, not in Lebanon — but here, right near home.' Yoav's parents, along with the town’s residents, are struggling to come to terms with the heavy loss. His loved ones described him as a 'silent leader,' and spoke of a young man full of pride in his service with Golani. IDF representatives arrived at the family's home late last night to deliver the devastating news. Relatives and Yoav's friends gathered at the family’s home in Binyamina-Giv'at Ada, struggling to cope with their shock and grief. 'Yoav was killed just minutes from home, at a base that was supposed to be the safest place,' family members said.

Did CIA help in the assassination of senior Hezbollah official?	Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper quotes officials saying CIA operatives gather information on the terror group from Lebanese security officials, reveal the whereabouts of Wafiq Safa ahead of the IDF strike, and aim to weaken the Iran-backed group politically Was the CIA involved in the assassination of Wafiq Safa? According to a report in the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper that may have happened. Ibrahim al Amin, editor of the paper published a story on Monday titled, American enters the war – Officers join Beirut station to weaken Hezbollah from within.' He claimed Lebanese security officials admitted that Western intelligence agencies led by the U.S. initiated daily conversations with them to collect information on Hezbollah. The officials said that a CIA team arrived at the Beirut airport and drove out in a convoy of armed cars to the American embassy to join the CIA station there. The report claimed that Hezbollah assigned Safa in his role as liaison to the Lebanese Army, to be in contact with some of the security officials although the terror group was aware that he may be compromised. Israel assassinated him in an attack on Beirut earlier this month. One official said Hezbollah's suspicion over the U.S. involvement in the war grew after Safa was targeted by Israel and said he believed American intelligence played a role in his assassination. 'The United States will support Israeli assassinations of non-military Hezbollah leaders to minimize its sway over Lebanese politics.'

IDF says three projectiles crossed into Israeli territory from Lebanon and were intercepted; millions rush to shelter as sirens blare in areas south of Haifa to the north to the outskirts of Ashdod Sirens blared in Israel from the north to the south of Monday afternoon as rockets were launched in Lebanon. Millions of Israelis rushed to shelter while aerial defenses intercepted some of the incoming threats. The IDF said three projectiles crossed into Israeli airspace from Lebanon and were intercepted. No damage or injuries were reported after an initial investigation. Some shrapnel from intercepting rockets fell in Holon, just south of Tel Aviv but no injuries were reported there. Ben Gurion Airport halted all flights for the duration of the attack and a flight arriving from Berlin, Germany, changed course and flew toward Cyprus before entering into Israeli airspace. Another flight preparing to depart for Portugal was stopped on the runway. Hezbollah targeted vast areas of the north during the day on Monday including the cities of Haifa and Acre. On Sunday, a drone exploded inside a military base in central Israel killing four soldiers and wounding dozens of others.

Israel accused of preventing food aid to north Gaza	As Israeli forces operate in Jabaliya and civilians are urged to evacuate, world leaders ask if Netanyahu is implementing a plan to lay a siege on the northern part of the Strip to force Hamas terrorists out and establish an alternative civilian rule UN officials claimed Israel was preventing food aid from reaching Gazan civilians in the northern parts of the Strip, the Associated Press said on Monday. According to the report, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was considering a plan to block humanitarian aid from reaching northern Gaza to force Hamas terrorists into submission. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) denied that the crossings to northern Gaza have been closed, but according to the AP, they did not respond to questions about how many aid trucks have reached the area in recent days. COGAT said on Monday that 30 trucks entered through 'Crossing 96' (in central Gaza), but those are likely not intended for the residents of northern Gaza. The UN estimates that about 400,000 Palestinians remain in the north, and a senior UN official noted that only around 100 people have fled to southern Gaza since the raid on Jabaliya began about a week ago. The plan promoted by former senior military officials, calls for Israel to maintain control over the area for an indefinite period to attempt to create a new civilian administration without Hamas, splitting the Gaza Strip in two. The cabinet did not decide to implement the plan and it is unclear how seriously it was being considered. When asked by AP if the evacuation orders in northern Gaza marked the first stages of the plan, an IDF spokesperson said no. 'We have not received a plan like that,' he said. But one official with knowledge of the matter said parts of the plan were already being implemented, without specifying which parts. A second official, who is Israeli, said Netanyahu 'had read and studied' the plan, 'like many plans that have reached him throughout the war,' but didn’t say whether any of it had been adopted. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan isn’t supposed to be discussed publicly. The so-called Generals’ Plan was presented last month by a group of retired generals and high-ranking officers, according to publicly available minutes. Since then, officials from the prime minister’s office called seeking more details, according to its chief architect, Giora Eiland, a former head of the National Security Council. Eiland said the only way to stop Hamas and bring an end to the yearlong war is to prevent its access to aid. 'They will either have to surrender or to starve,' Eiland said. 'It doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re going to kill every person,' he said. 'It will not be necessary. People will not be able to live there (the north). The water will dry up.' He believes the siege could force Hamas to release the 101 hostages still being held by the terror group since its Oct. 7 attack. So far, despite the IDF's evacuation orders, only a small number of people have relocated from northern to southern Gaza. Many residents remain hesitant, partly due to fears that conditions in the south may not be much better and concerns that they won’t be allowed to return to their homes in the north. 'All Gazans are afraid of the plan,' said Jomana Elkhalili, a 26-year-old Palestinian aid worker for Oxfam living in Gaza City with her family. 'Still, they will not flee. They will not make the mistake again ... We know the place is not safe,' she said, referring to southern Gaza, where most of the population is huddled in dismal tent camps and airstrikes often hit shelters. 'That’s why people in the north say it’s better to die than to leave.' In addition to fears about their fate, if they evacuate, some residents report that Hamas terrorists are intimidating them, warning them not to heed the Israeli military’s evacuation orders and to stay inside their homes and shelters. On Monday, the IDF released a recording of a conversation between a representative of the military intelligence and a Gazan resident. The resident is heard saying 'The problem is that when we follow the army's instructions and try to go to Al-Mawasi, there are people who come out against us and start hitting us with sticks, telling us 'go back, go back' What should we do?' The IDF accused Hamas of using Gaza’s civilians as human shields, preventing them from responding to the army's calls to evacuate to safer areas.

Israeli couple indicted in Iranian plot to assassinate Israeli of...	Authorities uncover Iranian attempt to recruit 2 Israelis to carry out assassination plot; indictment lists various tasks suspects allegedly performed for Tehran, including arson, spraying graffiti and posting flyers Israeli authorities have thwarted an Iranian plot to assassinate Israeli officials, the Shin Bet security agency and Israel Police announced Monday. Charges were filed against two residents of Ramat Gan—30-year-old Vladislav Viktorson and his 18-year-old partner, Anna Bernstein—accused of working under the direction of an Iranian agent to carry out various criminal activities. According to the Shin Bet, Viktorson had been in contact with an Iranian agent since August, conducting tasks such as hiding money, burning vehicles and recruiting accomplices, including Bernstein. Viktorson communicated in Hebrew with an individual named 'Mari Hossi' on social media, fully aware of the agent’s Iranian ties. He carried out tasks that included spraying graffiti, distributing flyers, setting fire to vehicles and sabotaging infrastructure. In exchange, he received over $5,000 in digital currency. For each piece of graffiti sprayed in Petah Tikva and Ramat Gan, the defendants were allegedly paid $20, totaling about $2,000. For the arson of vehicles in Yarkon Park, they received $1,450 in digital currencies and an additional $2,850 as an advance for future vehicle burnings. The investigation revealed that Viktorson had agreed to more severe actions, including plans to assassinate a prominent Israeli figure and carry out grenade attacks. He sought weapons such as a sniper rifle and handguns to execute these missions. To accomplish his tasks, Viktorson recruited two additional citizens, including his partner, who participated in some of these operations. He was also tasked with locating homeless individuals to recruit for further missions and filming protesters during demonstrations. The couple was charged in the Tel Aviv District Court with contact with a foreign agent, vandalism, arson and conspiracy. Viktorson also faces terrorism-related charges for conspiring to commit murder. A senior Shin Bet official said that the investigation highlights Iran’s ongoing efforts to recruit Israeli citizens for espionage and terrorism. Several such networks have been uncovered in recent months, with many Israeli citizens reporting suspicious contacts to authorities. During questioning, they admitted to acting under an enemy entity's direction but claimed they did not intend to harm national security. According to the indictment, the two 'established a connection with a foreign agent via Telegram and carried out tasks on their behalf that could jeopardize national security in exchange for payment in digital currencies.'

Nobel economics prize goes to researchers of prosperity	U.S.-based academics Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson won the 2024 Nobel Prize in economics 'for studies of how institutions are formed and affect prosperity', the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Monday. The prestigious award, formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is the final prize to be given out this year and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million). 'Reducing the vast differences in income between countries is one of our time's greatest challenges. The laureates have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for achieving this,' said Jakob Svensson, chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences. 'Societies with a poor rule of law and institutions that exploit the population do not generate growth or change for the better,' the award organizers added on their website. Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while James Robinson is at the University of Chicago.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywjwocjke	2024-10-14T03:27:07-07:00	
Hezbollah supporters flood social media with false claims IDF chi...	As impact of deadly drone strike on Golani ascertained, false rumors of Halevi’s death flood social media, amassing millions of views and highlighting use of fake news as psychological warfare; Halevi arrives at base for assessment after strike Hours after a deadly drone strike on a military base near Binyamina killed four Golani Brigade recruits and injured dozens, false reports circulated on social media Sunday and Monday claiming that IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi had been killed in the Hezbollah attack. The rumors, aimed at boosting the terror group and engaging in psychological warfare, were quickly disproven when Halevi arrived at the base after the incident to meet with commanders and medical teams. Despite being untrue, the claims spread rapidly on social media, with two prominent posts on X amassing two million views each within 12 hours. The rapid spread of misinformation, often outpacing the dissemination of facts, is bolstered by a well-coordinated network of Hezbollah and Hamas supporters online. An initial IDF investigation revealed that the drone exploded in the base’s dining hall during dinner, killing three soldiers instantly, with a fourth succumbing to his injuries later. Air Force helicopters evacuated the wounded, while military counselors were dispatched to support those traumatized by the attack. The relatively new base, which includes modern infrastructure and bomb shelters, was targeted by two Hezbollah drones, likely of the Sayyad 107 model, launched from Lebanon via the sea. The IDF detected both drones before one was intercepted off the coast of Nahariya. The second drone was pursued by fighter jets but lost contact before it exploded at the base. The Air Force is investigating why the drone was not rediscovered and why no alarm was triggered.

Families of wounded IDF recruits recall nightmare of deadly drone...	I hope he can recover emotionally,' says mother whose son sat at table with 3 of victims when Hezbollah drone hit Golani Brigade training base; 'he and his friends witnessed horrific sights, there was a major failure,' says another relative 'The images of these young soldiers, recruits who only enlisted in August, will stay with them for a long time,' said a relative of one of the soldiers injured in Sunday's Hezbollah drone attack on the Golani Brigade training base near Binyamina. The attack, which struck the base’s dining hall, killed four soldiers and wounded over 50 others, including eight seriously. Speaking from Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera, the relative expressed disbelief at the lack of warnings ahead of the attack: 'It’s incomprehensible—no alarms were triggered, which would have sent everyone to shelters. I don’t want to call it a blunder, but something went wrong. One drone was intercepted, but the other disappeared. Something wasn’t right.' Another relative, whose family member was also evacuated to the hospital, said, 'It was a direct hit on the base. My relative survived, but the sights he and his friends witnessed were horrific. The Air Force must conduct a thorough investigation—there was a major failure.' Residents in nearby Kiryat Yam and Yokneam reportedly alerted authorities to the drone, prompting questions as to why no alarms were activated. 'This is a huge tragedy—four dead, dozens wounded. Alarms should have been triggered to prevent this disaster,' the relative added. Hagit Ohayon, whose son Yarin was lightly wounded in the attack, recounted the events in an interview with Ynet: 'It was a miracle. They entered the dining hall around 7:15 p.m., and as soon as they sat down, there was a massive explosion. There was chaos—dust, smoke, loud noise. It took him a minute to realize it was a drone because no alarm was sounded. He messaged us saying he was okay and that there were fatalities, which he had seen.' At HaEmek Medical Center in Afula, four soldiers with light injuries are recovering. 'It was a huge miracle,' said the parents of one injured soldier. 'Just minutes after the explosion, he called us, and we rushed to be by his side.' Another mother, Galit, whose son was hospitalized at Hillel Yaffe, shared her relief: 'He was sitting with three of the soldiers who were killed, and he survived. It was a miracle. The drone hit their table in the middle of the dining hall. He went to help a friend, only to realize he was bleeding from his own head.' She described her son's condition: 'He has shrapnel in his arm and abdomen, but thank God he survived. He’s not talking much, but he saw some horrific sights. I hope he can recover emotionally.' Galit also expressed gratitude for the support she received, saying, 'We’re from Holon, and we’ve been surrounded with love and support here.' Another father questioned why no alarm system was activated: 'I don’t understand why we didn’t activate the warning systems to prevent this disaster. There were dozens of young soldiers in the dining hall for dinner. The drone pierced through the roof and exploded. I hope my son and the other wounded soldiers recover, both physically and emotionally. They witnessed terrible scenes—friends covered in blood, crying for help.' The IDF released on Monday the names of the four soldiers killed in the attack: Sgt. Omri Tamari from Mazkeret Batya, Sgt. Yosef Hieb from Tuba-Zangariyye, Sgt. Yoav Agmon from Binyamina-Giv'at Ada and Sgt. Alon Amitay from Ramot Naftali. All were 19-year-old infantry recruits in the Golani Brigade.

Germany's Greens blocking arms exports to Israel since March, rep...	Ministers freeze all requests to export weapons and tank and helicopter parts to Israel, conditioning approval on Israel’s assurance that no weapons imported from Germany would be used for 'genocide' Senior ministers from Germany's Green Party have blocked arms deals with Israel, with no licenses for arms or parts exports issued since March, according to a Bild report released on Sunday. In a heated debate in the German parliament last week, conservative leader Friedrich Merz claimed that Germany has not approved any such exports for weeks or even months. However, Chancellor Olaf Scholz took the podium afterward, asserting that 'Germany has supplied and will continue to supply weapons to Israel.' Sources from various coalition parties indicated that during secret federal security meetings—attended by the chancellor and key ministers—Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, both leaders of the Green Party, blocked the arms exports to Israel. While Baerbock’s position wasn’t surprising, given her recent reactions to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and anti-terror operations in Tulkarm, Habeck’s stance caught many off guard. He had, after all, previously expressed strong support for Israel’s right to defend itself and ensure the safety of its citizens. Just in September, Habeck stated, 'There is no arms export ban to Israel. Each request is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.' According to Bild, Green Party ministers froze all requests to export weapons and parts for tanks and helicopters to Israel, conditioning the approval on Israel’s assurance that no weapons imported from Germany would be used for 'genocide.' Government insiders reportedly called this demand 'absurd,' arguing that its sole purpose was to block arms exports to Israel. 'Accusing Israel of genocide aligns with the rhetoric of its most ardent enemies,' said one source close to the meetings. 'It’s unclear how Israel could defend itself if an international court, biased against Israel, ever ruled it was committing genocide.' The newspaper reported that Israel provided the necessary assurances in writing to the German government last week, leading Scholz to tell parliament that arms exports to Israel would resume. The actions of the Green Party, particularly Vice Chancellor Habeck, have been nothing short of astonishing. Although the Greens are experiencing a slump in popularity, as seen in recent elections in three East German states, they seem to be catering to their base of left-leaning voters, many of whom favor diplomatic solutions and generally hold anti-Israel views. In contrast, despite the Greens’ opposition to Israeli arms exports, the German cabinet, with Green Party support, approved the sale of air-to-ground missiles to Saudi Arabia and authorized €336 million worth of arms exports to Turkey—two countries with particularly poor human rights records. Meanwhile, arms exports to Israel have dropped from €326.5 million in 2023 to just €14.5 million by August this year.

Elusive and lethal: Inside the Hezbollah drone that struck IDF ba...	Since October 7, Hezbollah has been making extensive use of Iranian drone mass-produced locally; Israeli defense industries stumped in countering threat The drone strike that injured over 60 individuals and killed at least 4 at a Golani Brigade base near Binyamina on Sunday — seems to have precisely hit its target. The IDF is now investigating the incident, but from the limited details currently available, the drone was likely a Sayyad 107 model, a UAV manufactured in Iran and widely used by Hezbollah, which also produces it in large quantities in Lebanon. The model’s flight path can be programmed to frequently change altitude and direction, making it difficult to detect and track. It has a range of up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) and is small, with a very low radar signature compared to larger, metal-made UAVs. Its detection relies on the heat emitted by the engine, which is also challenging to identify via optical means. The military is examining all possibilities, but it's almost certain that the UAV, which hit a critical target and caused many casualties, wasn't only a specialized model but also that Hezbollah managed to overwhelm or disrupt the IDF's detection systems by launching a mixed salvo of rockets and two other drones aimed at the Western Galilee. The UAVs continued toward the sea off the northern coast and the Iron Dome system intercepted one. The IDF dispatched fighter jets and combat helicopters to track the remaining UAV, but contact with it was lost. The IDF is now conducting a thorough investigation into how both the fighter jets and helicopters that had been tracking the UAV lost sight of it. It's possible that the UAV was pre-programmed to sharply descend toward the ground or the sea and continue flying at low altitude, exploiting the coastal terrain and then the hills of the coastal plain to evade interceptors. Hezbollah has gained considerable experience in operating UAVs over the past year, successfully causing numerous casualties among civilians and primarily IDF soldiers at remote bases. Over half of the drones launched by Hezbollah are intercepted, either by IDF fighter jets sent to engage them or by the Iron Dome and David's Sling systems. However, due to the UAV's small size and very weak radar signature, the Iron Dome's fire control radars and the optical sensors on fighter jets and helicopters often lose track of them, especially in hilly areas where radar echoes from the terrain are dominant and misleading. The sophisticated UAVs manufactured by Iran are equipped with inertial navigation systems in addition to satellite navigation, enabling them to stay on course and strike their targets even when faced with GPS jamming. This is intended to mislead them, but Iran and Hezbollah sometimes bypass the American GPS jamming by using unique satellite navigation systems developed by Russia or China. Neither Russia nor Ukraine have found an effective solution to the drone threat despite the war in the area now ongoing for nearly three years. Both sides in this conflict struggle to intercept the other side's explosive and reconnaissance drones in significant numbers. The reasons are well known: UAVs and even more so drones, are small, fly low and slow and optical detection systems also struggle to identify them. All the sensors, including optical and radar systems, often fail to detect them. The IDF and Israel’s defense industries have been trying to find a solution to this issue at least since the current war began, but there’s still no effective detection and interception solution, particularly for consistent tracking and targeting that would allow successful interception of UAVs, which are essentially miniature cruise missiles. It can be assumed that when Israel finally deploys laser-based interception from the ground and from aircraft, the process of intercepting these threats will be easier and more efficient than using the Iron Dome, David's Sling, or aerial interceptor missiles. The laser system, despite having undergone several tests, will not be operational until mid-2025. Even then, however, the primary challenge will remain to detect and track UAVs that fly very low, using valleys and prominent terrain features to hide before rising and crashing into their targets. There’s still no proper solution to this issue, which likely explains the lack of alert sirens sounding and the reason why the UAV injured so many when it crashed into its target.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Monday morning that Israel was 'focusing national efforts on addressing the drone threat' after a Hezbollah drone struck a military base, killing four soldiers and injuring dozens others.

Attacks by Israel on the United Nations' peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are 'unacceptable' and contrary to UN rules, Spain's Foreign minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Monday. 'It is contrary to what we expect from any member state of the United Nations, which is ultimately an organization that protects world peace,' he told reporters ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers held in Luxembourg.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1mxe8qjjl	2024-10-14T01:20:07-07:00	
Tunnels like in Vietnam': Hezbollah’s secret war machine thrived...	As IDF deepens ground operations in Lebanon, extent of past negligence on full display: terror stronghold built near Nahariya, more lethal than arsenal used for October 7 attacks; Hezbollah built supply tunnels stocked with Iranian and Russian arms Hezbollah has prepared three elite Radwan Force regiments, known as 'fawjs' in Lebanese military jargon, for potential action against communities in Israel's Western Galilee. Each regiment is marked with its own tactical identifiers to prevent friendly fire, and different colored markers guide fighters through a network of hundreds of tunnels. These markers help Hezbollah fighters quickly locate their weapons caches and regroup with their units. Underground, in Hezbollah’s logistical plan, fighters are equipped with commando knives, personal weapons (machine gunners, snipers, drivers and team leaders), communication devices, night-vision goggles, combat uniforms tailored to each fighter, Blundstone boots, storm gear, emergency food supplies, blood units and advanced first-aid kits. All of this equipment is stored in fortified thickets along the border, giving Hezbollah tactical oversight over Israeli towns like Nahariya, Kiryat Shmona and various kibbutzim and moshavim in the area. The logistical plan, modeled after the IDF's 2007 logistical improvements following equipment shortages in the 2006 Lebanon War, provides personalized, modern gear for each Hezbollah fighter, similar to IDF preparations for rapid deployment to southern Lebanon. As the IDF deepens its ground operations in Lebanon border villages, the scale of Hezbollah’s preparations is becoming clear. Senior commanders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and successive defense ministers, are now facing criticism for allowing Hezbollah to develop this extensive infrastructure over the past decade—described as twenty times more lethal than the arsenal used by Hamas in its attack on southern Israel on October 7 last year. These fortified areas, once referred to as Hezbollah 'nature reserves,' have long been used to shield the terrorist group from Israeli military operations. In the 2006 Lebanon War, the IDF avoided entering these zones, which Hezbollah had also used during Israel’s occupation of the southern Lebanon security zone prior to its 2000 withdrawal. Colonel Yoav Schneider, commander of the 205th Iron Fist Brigade, noted that in 2006, the IDF did not dare enter these areas. Schneider, who previously commanded the 82nd Battalion in 2019 near Gaza, had openly expressed frustration with restrictive rules of engagement that limited fire on Hamas fighters. Against Hezbollah, Schneider said, Israeli policy had been even more lenient. Schneider now strikes a more diplomatic tone, acknowledging that the political leadership will need to finish the military’s work. However, some of his reservists are less restrained. 'It would be a disaster if we revert to a policy of containment after we leave,' one reservist said. 'Hezbollah will rebuild its invasion infrastructure, and it will be a tragedy for future generations. We're doing our part—the political leadership must do theirs and set a long-term policy.' Hezbollah invasion still in the cards Lt. Col. (res.) Binyamin Tropper, one of nine siblings of MK Chili Tropper, commands a battalion under Col. Yoav Schneider’s brigade. 'We’re combing every inch here,' he said. 'We walk through the thicket, suddenly sense something in the leaves, and discover yet another tunnel prepared for Hezbollah’s Radwan Force, packed with large explosives meant to breach the border wall, bags full of equipment and more. We’re clearing everything. This is what we’ve been training for since 2006. Our mission is to ensure residents of the north return home with real security, not just a ‘sense of security,’ and we’re not done yet.' 'We’ve been here since Rosh Hashanah, through Yom Kippur and will remain through Sukkot and Simchat Torah at the earliest,' Tropper added. 'We’re loud and present, not operating like a special forces unit. Golani veterans are out here in force, and anyone left from Hezbollah is afraid to face us. As a veteran of the 2006 Lebanon War, I remember we didn’t dare enter these areas. Even the explosives here are wrapped to withstand winter conditions.' Brig. Gen. Yiftach Norkin, commander of the 146th Division, is operating in dual roles. While most of his brigades operate beyond the border, some of his forces are still defending the Western Galilee. Reflecting on the situation, Norkin recalled his time as a battalion commander in the Metula sector years ago, when Hezbollah prepared to launch a massacre of the local population from the opposing border village of Kfarkela. 'We’ll learn from this and investigate what we saw and didn’t see over the years,' Norkin said. 'The key now is to complete the mission. Discovering the scope and spread of their preparations was significant. We were surprised to find that the weapons were positioned so far forward. We had expected them to be further back.' Some of the battalion and brigade commanders from those earlier years, now uncovering the extent of Hezbollah’s preparations, are shocked that they were tasked with defending civilians while a lethal, state-level threat was growing right in front of them. Despite most of its forces being deployed in Lebanon, the 146th Division remains on alert for infiltration attempts into the Galilee. Hezbollah has trained hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in the western sector, some affiliated with Hamas, who could attempt to breach the border if an opportunity arises. Senior Northern Command officers warn of this exact scenario, noting that while the IDF is on the offensive and confident in its capabilities, complacency could set in as the weeks go by, despite ongoing airstrikes on Hezbollah targets. Under UNIFIL's nose In a Lebanese-controlled area with a clear view of Israel's Western Galilee and the Haifa University towers in the distance, a square iron door hidden among the bushes opens to a 30-foot-deep underground bunker. The bunker is connected by tunnels to nearby rooms storing Hezbollah’s Radwan Force’s weapons and supplies. Less than 300 feet away are an IDF post and a UNIFIL position, both close enough to have likely seen or heard the years-long digging and equipping of the site, despite the dense thicket concealing it. The military supplies—heavy boxes of weapons and ammunition—must have been transported above ground, as there is no tunnel connecting the site to nearby Lebanese villages. Despite the cover of dense vegetation, concealing such an operation, especially over years, would be difficult. Camouflaged explosives are even suspended in the treetops, ready to target any Israeli forces that dare to enter. 'This isn’t a temporary setup, but rather a network of military positions, tunnels and bunkers, like those built in Vietnam, all under UNIFIL’s nose,' Israeli officers explained. 'The weapons are of the highest quality, made in Iran and Russia.' 'We respect UNIFIL, and there was no intent to harm them during recent events. We’re investigating those incidents,' said Brig. Gen. Norkin. 'But this is a complex combat environment, and when attacking in such areas, mistakes can happen.' Col. Dvir Diamond, commander of the Carmeli Brigade operating in the sector, stepped into his role without a formal transition and was immediately thrown into the fray. His dark protective glasses cover the eye he lost in Gaza during 2014’s Operation Protective Edge. Previously, as the commander of the elite Duvdevan Unit, he preferred to stay in the shadows, and even now, he lets his soldiers speak for him. Diamond was at the forefront during the massacre at Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7, losing soldiers in the battle, while his unit continued to excel in operations in the West Bank and Khan Younis. His colleague, Col. Schneider, vowed, 'We will do whatever it takes to prevent Hezbollah from returning here. We now realize we cannot go back to the situation we were in. Hezbollah is battered, with many of its commanders eliminated, creating chaos within the group. Right now, they don’t want to engage with us and are abandoning their infrastructure to save themselves.' A reserve officer, armed with a chainsaw, began cutting through the thick vegetation—a small effort, but part of a larger operation. The IDF has promised a significant clearing of Hezbollah’s 'terror jungle' as the campaign continues.

Chased by fighter jets, Hezbollah drone disappears before fatal e...	Preliminary IDF investigation reveals drone detected after entering Israel from Lebanon via the sea, tracked and pursued by fighter jets and helicopters before disappearing from radar, only to explode minutes later The IDF reported Monday night that a preliminary investigation into the drone strike that killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others at the Golani Brigade Training Base near Binyamina was being tracked and chased by Israeli aircraft before disappearing from radar shortly before the fatal explosion. According to the investigation's findings, two drones were launched by Hezbollah—likely of the Sayyad 107 model— and entered Israel from Lebanon via the sea. The drones, launched just before 7 p.m., were detected by the IDF's radar systems. One was intercepted off the coast of Nahariya, while the other was under aerial surveillance by fighter jets and helicopters. However, contact with it was lost at some point. Minutes later, it exploded in an army base adjacent to Binyamina, killing 4 IDF soldiers and injuring at least 67. The Israeli Air Force is now investigating why the drone wasn’t rediscovered and why no warning siren was sounded. The Sayyad 107 drone has a range of about 100 kilometers (60 miles) and a wingspan of 1.5 to 2 meters (5 to 6.5 feet). Drones of this type have infiltrated Israeli airspace dozens of times during the ongoing war, causing damage to infrastructure and buildings. Last month, one of these drones struck a building in Nahariya, along with dozens of other sites. As part of the initial strikes in Operation Northern Arrows, the IDF targeted Hezbollah’s drone storage facilities, describing them in a statement as 'armed drones.' A soldier who witnessed the explosion described the drone hitting the dining hall while Golani recruits were having dinner: 'There was a crazy boom, without any warning, The iron door bent. We didn’t know what happened, and suddenly something pierced through the ceiling. We didn’t hear anything before, just the huge blast. No sirens went off. We ran to the shelter, and that’s when I saw they needed tourniquets. There were a lot of injured people covered in blood. We helped them get to the shelter and waited there.' Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Lebanon, particularly in Beirut. 'Hezbollah is still capable of defending Lebanon and its people,' the terror group said in a statement. Al Jazeera quoted a Hezbollah source claiming the organization launched 'swarms of drones' in the attack. 'Hezbollah's capabilities remain strong and can reach deep into Israel,' the source added. Sky News Arabia reported that the drone was launched under the cover of a rocket barrage targeting the Galilee. Meanwhile, the Saudi network Al-Hadath, citing unnamed sources, claimed the drone 'fired a missile' before it exploded. If confirmed, this would not be the first such instance. In May, Hezbollah claimed to have used a drone equipped with S5 missiles in an attack near Metula, claiming that one missile was fired before the drone detonated on its target.

I heard a massive boom, then something burst through the ceiling...	Eyewitness to drone strike at IDF base near Binyamina, which left dozens injured and 4 dead, recalls, 'We ran to the shelter, soldiers needed tourniquets, many bleeding heavily'; 'He managed to call his sister, said he was hurt but okay,' soldier's parents say Dozens were injured, including four soldiers killed, in a Hezbollah drone attack on a Golani Brigade training base near Binyamina on Sunday. The drone, a Sayyad 107, struck the base's dining hall, where the brigade's recruits were eating dinner. Eyewitness accounts from the scene and hospitals describe the aftermath as harrowing. Images from the base show a blood-stained floor where the drone exploded. One soldier who witnessed the blast said, 'I had just finished eating and was heading to the corridor to return my tray when I heard a massive boom. The metal door bent from the impact. We didn't understand what happened, then something burst through the ceiling of the dining hall. We heard nothing beforehand—just the explosion. There was no alarm. We ran to the shelter, and that's when I saw soldiers needed tourniquets. Many were bleeding heavily. We helped them reach the shelter and waited there.' Parents of a soldier evacuated to Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera, where more than half of the 58 wounded soldiers were taken, recounted their panic. 'A friend called and told us our son had been hit in the head and was bleeding. He managed to call his sister, said he was hurt but okay,' said the mother. 'We rushed here. We just want to see him and hold him. It's hard to handle this pressure, we can't even breathe.' The father of another wounded soldier said, 'He has two shrapnel injuries, one in his head and one in his arm, but he's okay and fully conscious. He said they suddenly heard a boom, but there was no alarm.' Magen David Adom paramedic Rafi Sheva described the scene: 'Dozens of MDA teams arrived. We declared a mass-casualty event and treated the wounded. It was a devastating scene—blast and shrapnel injuries everywhere. The injured were evacuated quickly by MDA teams and helicopters to hospitals.' A total of 115 units of blood were sent to Hillel Yaffe for the 36 soldiers admitted there, while another 40 units were delivered to Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv. Dr. Yehoram Klein, head of emergency surgery and trauma at Sheba, said three soldiers were airlifted to the hospital, including two transferred from Hillel Yaffe in serious condition. 'All of them were wounded by shrapnel,' he said. Earlier on Sunday evening, Hezbollah launched two drones. Israel's air defense intercepted one after alarms were triggered at 6:50 p.m. in the Western Galilee, including Acre and Nahariya. However, a second drone penetrated deeper into Israel, striking the military base near Binyamina without triggering an alarm. The IDF is investigating why no warning was sounded. Preliminary findings indicate that both drones entered Israel from Lebanon via the sea. The drones, likely Iranian-made Sayyad 107 models, were detected by Israeli monitoring systems. One was intercepted off the coast of Nahariya, while the second was tracked by Israeli aircraft until contact was lost. Minutes later, it exploded, causing mass casualties. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, particularly in Beirut. A Hezbollah official cited by Al Jazeera said the organization had launched a 'swarm of drones' during the attack, claiming the terrorist group's capabilities remain strong and capable of reaching deep into Israel.

4 soldiers killed in drone attack on army base near Binyamina	UAV launched on Sunday by the Hezbollah terrorist organization hit an army base adjacent to Binyamina, the IDF announced; 67 soldiers were injured in the attack, including the 4 dead soldiers and 7 more seriously injured; 'The incident is being investigated' The UAV launched on Sunday by the Hezbollah terrorist organization hit an army base adjacent to Binyamina, the IDF announced early Monday morning, hours after the attack that injured at least 67. Four IDF soldiers were killed in the incident and an additional seven were severely injured, according to the IDF. All the injured individuals have been evacuated to hospitals and their families have been notified. The IDF said that the incident is being examined. 'The IDF shares in the grief of the bereaved families and will continue to accompany them,' the IDF said in a statement, adding: .'We ask to refrain from spreading rumors and the names of injured individuals, and to respect the families.' The drone attack is the highest number of casualties in a single event since the October 7 massacre. Hezbollah launched two UAVs on Sunday evening. Air defense systems intercepted one of them after alarms in the Western Galilee, including in Acre and Nahariya. But one of the two UAVs penetrated deep into Israel, and the explosion occurred in the Binyamina area without triggering an alarm. 'There was a crazy boom, without any warning,' said an eyewitness. Emek Medical Center in Afula declared a mass-casualty event. Some of the injured were evacuated by helicopter to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer and Rambam Hospital in Haifa, and others were also evacuated to Hillel Yaffe Hospital in Hadera and Emek Hospital in Afula.

Israel can't go back to same situation it had on the border with ...	There were 1,000 first aid kits, hundreds of blood units, and thousands of weapons from Iran and Russia: Hezbollah’s deadly invasion plan reached Israel’s doorstep, but now the IDF is clearing it out; 'It takes a decade to build something like this, we knew about the plan, but the scale on the ground surprised us,' says IDF commander In recent days, the reservists of Division 146 have entered the hidden lairs of Hezbollah’s Radwan Force in southern Lebanon —the rocket launch positions that Hezbollah built over years in the dense, thick foliage along the border with Israel. From these positions, Hezbollah had a commanding view over the entire western Galilee, all the way to the outskirts of Haifa and the Krayot/Haifa Bay region. Division 146, composed of the Carmeli Brigade, Iron Fist Brigade, 300th Brigade and 646th Brigade, is the first reserve division to operate in southern Lebanon. Over the past week, the troops uncovered dozens of tunnels in the rugged and mountainous terrain. These tunnels lead to underground combat facilities and Hezbollah positions, from which rockets had been fired at Israel in recent months. So far, in targeted raids, the soldiers have eliminated over 100 terrorists, destroyed dozens of tunnels and terror infrastructure, and neutralized more than 50 rocket launchers and over 60 Hezbollah command centers. The Carmeli and Iron Fist brigades, accustomed to defensive missions along the Israeli side of the western Lebanon front, received the green light last week to cross into Lebanon where they discovered a whole new world – a hidden terror army lurking beneath the dense bushes, tightly-packed trees and 'natural' tunnels built over the past decade by the Shiite terror organization for an invasion force. The forces are also operating in a nearby village, moving through narrow alleys and streets. However, Hezbollah's main focus was on fortified positions in the thick terrain, where three of Radwan Force’s battalions had been stationed, ready to invade Israel. Fortunately, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, did not give the order during the critical morning hours of October 7 last year. At that time, these reserve forces were mobilized from their homes even before receiving emergency call-up orders, bolstering the Northern Command as Israel reeled from the Hamas attack in the south. The findings uncovered by Division 146 show how easily thousands of Hezbollah's elite fighters could have stormed Israeli military bases near Haifa, the Jezreel Valley, and Galilee’s lower regions, while the IDF was in shock and rushing to deal with Hamas' deadly attacks in the Negev. In the past few days, the reservists of Division 146 have uncovered hidden combat positions right under the noses of Israeli outposts and UNIFIL positions. Hezbollah had been digging tunnels 10 meters deep, only tens of meters apart. These were designed to conceal Hezbollah forces, allowing them to surface at the border for an invasion. In areas where Israel built security walls in recent years, explosives were found in these tunnels, specifically designed to demolish the 14-meter-high barrier. The IDF reported that Iron Fist Brigade forces destroyed a 120-meter-long underground facility located about half a kilometer inside Lebanon, equipped with electrical systems, ventilation and storage for weapons and ammunition. This tunnel was discovered months ago but was destroyed only recently. 'These positions contain combat trenches, living quarters and hidden firing posts, all with traps around every corner. We found personal weapons, neatly packaged uniforms, and endless ammunition –everything a Radwan Force operative would need upon arriving at the border,' described Brigadier General Yiftach Norkin, commander of Division 146. 'We discovered tunnels reminiscent of Vietnam. It took a decade to build something like this. We didn’t know the full extent of it over the years, but we were aware of Hezbollah’s plans.' The division also uncovered over 1,000 first aid kits, hundreds of blood units, and supplies meant for long-term stays in enemy territory, dwarfing the findings from Hamas’ October 7 invasion. They also found thousands of Russian- and Iranian-made weapons. The reservist officers, who are less bound by the constraints of political correctness compared to regular forces, are making it clear to the political leadership what the situation will be 'the day after' the ground operation ends in a few weeks: 'We will not allow Hezbollah to establish this kind of presence along our border and near our communities – no matter the cost. That decision will rest with the political leadership, but we cannot afford to let this happen again.'

This is the new air defense system the US is sending to Israel	Mobile and capable of intercepting missiles outside the atmosphere, the new THAAD system reportedly will be operated by US troops in Israel to counter Iran's retaliation threats Israel announced on Saturday that the U.S. had agreed to deploy a THAAD air defense system to help intercept ballistic missiles, with the U.S. confirming on Sunday that the system would arrive soon. This comes amid a potential Israeli retaliation to Iran's ballistic missile attack and the possibility of a significant and rapid escalation in regional tensions in the Middle East. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi issued a veiled threat against U.S. forces operating in Israel, in a post addressing the THAAD system’s deployment. 'The United States is putting the lives of its people at risk by deploying an American missile system in Israel. While we’ve made enormous efforts to reduce the likelihood of a full-scale war in the region in recent days, I must say, we have no red lines when it comes to defending our people and assets.' The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that around 100 U.S. troops will be responsible for operating the system, a detail later confirmed by the Pentagon. The system will represent a significant air defense capability that could serve as a 'force multiplier' for Israel against the various threats surrounding the country, particularly against Iran. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system is a mobile, high-altitude regional defense system, similar in capability to Israel's Arrow system. It can intercept missiles outside the atmosphere, using kinetic energy to neutralize them. THAAD is designed to target various stages of an enemy missile's flight path, as well as other threats. The system’s deployment comes following an Israeli request to the U.S. It’s also seen as a show of strength by sending additional military assets to the region. A Tehran-based source cited by CNN said Iran has informed the U.S. that it will retaliate against any new attack by Israel. What makes this system special? 'The system is comparable to the Israeli Arrow system; it’s not intended to add another layer of defense or replace an existing system. It’s about providing additional firepower and each of these batteries comes with dozens of interceptors, significantly boosting firepower,' former IDF Air Defense commander Brig.-Gen. (res.) Zvika Haimovich told Ynet. 'We saw around 200 interceptors used in the last barrage after 100 were used in April. If the next attack includes more munitions, this addition provides more opportunities and enhances your ability to defend against Iran’s more intense scenarios,' he explained. What’s the significance of deploying THAAD beyond just boosting firepower? 'In essence, it's part of a defensive alliance and U.S.-Israeli partnership. This system is one of several components we’ve seen over the past year including elements on the ground, at sea and detection systems in space.' 'It sends a regional message of a strong, stable strategic alliance, with the U.S. literally standing by Israel's defense. It’s both a deterrent and a practical threat that could eventually manifest in the interception of missiles fired at Israel from the ground by American forces. This dual significance is incredibly important,' Haimovich said. What has U.S.-Israel cooperation in this field looked like so far? 'During the first Gulf War, the Americans deployed air defense forces in the region but there’s been an ongoing process with the U.S. since the early 2000s where hundreds and thousands of American troops come to Israel every two years and we practice the response to a complex, multi-front threat landscape that didn’t only emerge this past year. 'These are personal connections, reciprocated on a daily and weekly basis and not just in biannual exercises. This doesn’t just start with an order from the U.S. president – it’s built on a longstanding, very personal relationship, as close as it can get. When people say 'fighting shoulder to shoulder' – it's not a cliché; that’s exactly what it is,' Haimovich added.

Man arrested near Trump rally in California on gun charges	A man arrested at a security checkpoint near Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's California rally on Saturday faces gun charges after he was found in possession of two guns and a high-capacity magazine, authorities said on Sunday. The 49-year-old man, a resident of Las Vegas, was stopped in a black SUV by deputies from the Riverside County sheriff's office on Saturday and taken into custody without incident, according to the office. 'The incident did not impact the safety of former President Trump or attendees of the event,' the sheriff's office said in a press release. Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July. Trump's rally on Saturday took place in the Coachella Valley, an area known for its annual music and arts festival. The sheriff's office said the man arrested, identified as Vem Miller, was charged with possession of a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine. More details about the charges were not available.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rychznfkkg	2024-10-13T13:47:35-07:00	
Lawmakers direct IDF to lower number of attacks on Beirut after N...	Decision comes after U.S. president asks to refrain from attacking Lebanon's capital amid fears escalations could expand scope of Israeli ground operation The Israeli Air Force hasn't conducted strikes on Beirut for three days following U.S. President Joe Biden's request to scale back operations in the area during his recent conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. The slowing of attacks was directed by Israel's political echelon. The last attack in the Lebanese capital targeted the city center, reportedly aiming at Wafiq Safa, a trusted confidant of the former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was eliminated in an Israeli strike in Dahieh about two weeks ago. During Biden's conversation with Netanyahu, after a prolonged period of no communication between the two leaders, the U.S. president asked the prime minister to reduce the scale of Israeli strikes in Beirut. Israel has refrained from attacking the capital since. Following the call with Biden, the Prime Minister's Office described Netanyahu's call with him as 'businesslike. Israel always listens attentively to the issues raised by our ally, the United States, but the prime minister ultimately makes decisions based on Israel's national interests.' Regarding coordination with the U.S., the Prime Minister's Office said: 'There is ongoing communication with them and we listen to their concerns, just as we explain our perspective and analysis. Israel will do whatever is necessary to protect itself.'

Hezbollah has less than a third of its missiles', Gallant says	During a Cabinet security briefing, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Maj. Gen. Eliezer Toledano reported that hundreds of Hezbollah combat vests and fully equipped battle kits were located, indicating a possible incursion was planned; Gallant also added that Israel 'is still dependent on American munitions and aircraft, but we are working at full speed to promote domestic production' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Strategy Division Chief, Maj. Gen. Eliezer Toledano, provided a security briefing to Israel's Cabinet on Sunday, reporting that Hezbollah has less than one-third of the missiles it once possessed. Gallant also revealed that hundreds of combat vests and fully equipped combat packs prepared for battle were located, indicating a possible incursion was planned. Since the start of the war, Hezbollah has fired more than 14,000 rockets, with many more destroyed in Israeli Air Force strikes. When asked about Israel’s munitions stockpiles, Gallant acknowledged that there was a significant shortfall when he took office as defense minister. He added that, even before the war, he had already ordered ammunition to close those gaps. However, Gallant noted: 'We are still dependent on American air munitions and aircraft.' Gallant emphasized that Israel is working 'at full speed to promote domestic production and develop independence' in terms of munitions. Gallant and Toledano also reported that the operation in southern Lebanon is progressing as planned. Unlike in the 2006 Lebanon War, this time the objectives are very clear: clearing enemy infrastructure from rural areas. The forces are highly experienced and well-equipped, encountering minimal direct contact with Hezbollah fighters. A large cache of weapons has been uncovered, including hundreds of anti-tank missiles, launchers and ammunition. Maj. Gen. Toledano stated: 'Previously, there was a man with an organization and an organization with a state. Now there is no man, and the organization is weakened.' According to Gallant and Toledano, Hezbollah's senior command structure has been almost entirely eliminated. Gallant also addressed the recent injuries to UNIFIL personnel by Israeli fire in southern Lebanon, explaining that they were caught in a Hezbollah ambush. Earlier on Sunday, the IDF Spokesperson's Unit released drone footage of a Hezbollah tunnel shaft discovered in a civilian area in a southern Lebanese village. The IDF also provided updates on ongoing operations by the 8th Brigade's combat team, in collaboration with the IDF’s counter-terrorism unit and under the command of the 91st Division, in southern Lebanon. The forces are engaged in close-quarters combat, eliminating terrorists and destroying Hezbollah's infrastructure along the border. The forces have uncovered, confiscated and destroyed large quantities of weaponry, including dozens of rockets, AK-47 rifles, Kornet missiles, grenades, and ammunition intended for Hezbollah's elite Radwan Unit. They have also discovered several weapons caches hidden in civilian homes stocked with dozens of missiles. Underground, troops found and dismantled terrorist infrastructure, including tunnels and underground chambers used by militants for shelter and weapon storage. The 36th Division also continued its focused operations in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah's terror infrastructure. The Israeli Air Force, in collaboration with the division, struck dozens of Hezbollah targets, including launchers, anti-tank positions, weapons depots, and other terror assets. The IDF reported that in the last 24 hours, the Israeli Air Force and Northern Command have struck approximately 200 Hezbollah targets across southern and deeper parts of Lebanon. These included terror cells, launchers, military structures, anti-tank positions, and command centers.

Zelensky says North Koreans fighting with Russians in Ukraine	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that defense relationships with his country's partners would have to change in light of North Korean transfers of people as well as weapons to Russian forces in Ukraine. The Kremlin on Thursday dismissed South Korean assertions that North Korea may have sent some military personnel to help Russia against Ukraine and might be weighing a bigger deployment. 'We see that the alliance between Russia and such regimes as the North Korean one is getting stronger,' Zelensky said in his nightly video address. 'This is not just about the transfer of weapons, this is in fact about the transfer of people from North Korea to the armed forces of the occupiers. South Korea's Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun said on Tuesday that 'there was a high possibility' North Korea could deploy troops to help Russia in the war with Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked on Thursday if North Korea was sending its troops to fight in Ukraine, told reporters: 'This looks like another bit of fake news.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by5m39yy1l	2024-10-13T12:16:23-07:00

Meet Poland's new ambassador to Israel: This is what he answered ...	Maciej Hunia has previously visited Israel and has held several senior positions in his homeland, including head of Poland's intelligence service and military intelligence agency; Poland has not had an envoy in Israel for a long time For the first time in over three years, Poland finally has an ambassador in Israel. Maciej Hunia, Poland's new ambassador, arrived in Israel on the eve of Yom Kippur to begin his role. The 63-year-old Hunia has visited Israel several times in the past and held various senior positions, including head of Poland's intelligence service and military intelligence agency. His appointment was announced a month and a half ago, and during his confirmation hearing in the Polish parliament, he was asked if he believes Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Hunia replied that military actions causing unintended civilian casualties cannot be characterized as genocide, explaining: 'We saw this in Iraq and Afghanistan.' Poland’s embassy in Israel confirmed the ambassador’s arrival in a post on its X account on Sunday. Israel's ambassador to Poland, Dr. Yacov Livne, welcomed Hunia, saying: 'Wishing you much success, dear colleague. I look forward to working with you. Welcome!' However, Hunia cannot yet present his credentials to Israel's President Isaac Herzog, since Polish President Andrzej Duda has not signed off on the letter of credence due to an internal political dispute with the government. Poland currently has over 50 ambassadors without official letters of credence for the same reason. Despite this, Hunia can still fully function as an ambassador to Israel. Poland’s previous ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski, was recalled over a diplomatic crisis between the two countries over Poland's controversial property restitution law. Israel returned its ambassador to Poland two years ago, but Poland delayed sending its own, despite repeated promises. The diplomatic rift began in 2021 when Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Paweł Jabłoński announced a review of the Israeli youth trips to Poland, which had been paused during the COVID-19 pandemic. He claimed the trips were spreading 'hatred of Poland.' Jabłoński later helped negotiate the renewal of the youth delegations, and in June of last year he stated that relations between the two countries had improved. 'We will discuss the hundreds or thousands who collaborated with the Nazis, but not at the expense of the victims. The agreement on youth delegations aims to encourage Israelis to also learn about modern Polish-Israeli relations. We want them to understand what happened without identifying Poland solely with the death camps,' he said during a visit to Israel.

World's first drone war' taking place in Middle East	Israel’s multilayered defense is under increasing pressure from drone strikes, marking a new chapter in regional conflict; Ukraine’s air force has improved its drone interception capabilities against attacks from Russia; Drones are 'cheap to manufacture and easy to operate' Since the onset of the conflict between Israel and Iranian proxy groups in the region, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been deployed to target Israel, putting its multilayered defense systems to the test. The most recent such attack on Sunday night has left at least 67 people injured in the Binyamina area of central Israel. Four of the injured are in critical condition. This follows an attack on Friday night during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, when a drone launched from Lebanon struck a retirement home in Herzliya, also in central Israel. Although no casualties were reported, the attack caused extensive damage to the home, nearby buildings and vehicles. 'This is the world’s first drone war,' according to Brig. Gen. (ret.) Zvika Haimovich, commander of the Israeli Air Force Air Defense Command from 2015 to 2018. 'All of the regional players recognized the potential and the complex challenges that Israel faces in dealing with them. We will see this challenge continue.' Data from the Institute of National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University shows that since the conflict began a year ago, 180 drones have been launched by Houthi rebels, 150 by Shia militias in Iraq, and 170 by Iran. Most of these drones have been intercepted, many before entering Israeli airspace. The number of drones launched by Hezbollah in Lebanon is believed to be significantly higher, though the exact figure has not been disclosed by the Israel Defense Forces. According to the Alma Research and Education Center, which specializes in terrorism studies, there have been 556 incidents involving Hezbollah drones targeting Israel, with at least 1,500 drones involved. The Israeli military also employs UAVs in offensive operations across the region. According to the London-based Royal United Services Institute, Israel is one of the largest drone operators in the Middle East and has accounted for over 60% of global UAV exports in the past three decades. Dr. Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at INSS, explained that UAVs are typically small, offering several advantages to their operators. Many drones used by Israel’s adversaries are produced in Iran, the primary supporter of these proxies, or in factories in Syria overseen by Iranian engineers. Israel has reportedly struck drone production sites in Syria. 'They are cheap to manufacture and easy to operate,' Kalisky said. 'Their small radar signature makes them difficult to detect, and they can easily maneuver to evade interception. Their slow flight speed also makes them challenging for Israeli fighter jets to intercept.' While single drones are occasionally launched, more frequently—particularly from Lebanon—they are fired in salvos, increasing their effectiveness and overwhelming defense systems. Hamas, the Gaza-based terrorist organization, used drones in its surprise offensive against southern Israel on October 7 of last year, the attack that ignited the current multifront war in the Middle East. Videos on social media showed numerous Hamas operatives launching drones into Israeli territory, with some drones targeting Israeli military tanks and detonating explosives. The use of drones by terrorist organizations has helped narrow the gap between them and conventional militaries, adding a significant new threat to their arsenals. 'They can stay in the air for a long time in order to carry out offensive, intelligence, or other missions that pose no danger to their operators,' he added. 'UAVs have the ability to communicate with their ground operators.' Alongside UAV attacks, Israel has faced heavy rocket fire. According to data released by the IDF on the first anniversary of the war, 13,200 rockets have been launched from Gaza since last October, with an additional 12,400 fired from Lebanon. 'The drone threat is not more significant or more lethal than missiles,' said Haimovich. 'But there is a matter of how such an attack is perceived as an infiltration of the territory with an aircraft. It sounds much more significant and troublesome than a rocket or missile.' Footage of the drone launched toward central Israel over the weekend spread on social media, prompting alarmed citizens to rush to bomb shelters. Israeli radars detected the UAV, triggering sirens and sending civilians to safety. 'The main challenge is the interception, not the detection,' Haimovich explained. 'This is due to several levels of asymmetry.' Haimovich noted that Hezbollah’s main advantage is the geography and topography of Lebanon, with its higher, mountainous terrain just a few kilometers from the Israeli border. There is also asymmetry in the weapons systems and technology employed by both sides. F-35 fighter jets are deployed to counter drones, some of which are purchased on eBay or AliExpress before being modified for warfare. 'This asymmetry is part of the challenge,' Haimovich said. 'State-of-the-art systems are faced with threats that are far less sophisticated. But this is the mission, and it must be dealt with.' In recent decades, Iran has developed the Mohajer UAV, whose 10th generation was unveiled last year. It can carry up to 300 kilograms of cargo, giving it significant firepower. The Houthis in Yemen are believed to possess the Samad 3, a long-range drone with a 1,800-kilometer range, though it is highly inaccurate. In July, a Houthi drone that was not intercepted struck a building in Tel Aviv, killing one civilian and injuring 10 others. 'Israel is dealing with the threat by using its air defense systems—fighter jets and helicopters and the Iron Dome system,' said Kalisky. 'In the future, it will use radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery or a laser system developed in Israel.' Israeli defense technology firm Rafael recently unveiled the Iron Beam system, claimed to be the first laser-based system designed to intercept UAVs 'quickly and effectively … with almost zero cost per interception' and causing 'minimal collateral damage,' according to its website. Israeli media reports suggest it is nearly operational and expected to greatly simplify drone interceptions. 'There has definitely been a success so far, especially in thwarting drones that are launched from afar,' Kalisky said. 'The UAVs from Lebanon come from a shorter distance, so when they are intercepted, it is usually already within Israeli territory which can cause secondary damage from debris of the drone and the interceptor.' For over two years, Ukraine and Russia have faced a similar threat, with frequent and often deadly drone attacks on both sides. The use of drones and UAVs in military operations is not new. While UAVs have been used in warfare since the 1970s, their first widespread deployment occurred in the Russo-Ukrainian War. Russia continues to receive Iranian-made drones. Throughout the war, Ukraine’s air force has improved its drone interception capabilities, using electronic warfare, shoulder-fired air defense systems, and other publicly disclosed methods. 'The Ukrainians use slow piston-driven planes to intercept UAVs and in order to overcome their low radar signature, they use simple voice amplifiers and cellular applications to recognize the drone sound from a distance,' said Kalisky. 'Ukraine’s large territory compared to that of Israel means there is a large margin of error. Israel does not have the privilege to miss an interception, and this is not an easy task.' Israeli media have quoted Ukrainian sources claiming that Ukraine offered Israel the knowledge it gained in its war with Russia. The offer was reportedly declined, as Israel appears to prefer relying on its own solutions. 'Ukraine has developed acoustic sensor systems which help to detect drones,' said Haimovich. Drones emit a distinct humming sound, which becomes more noticeable near the ground, resembling the sound of a swarm of bees, adding to their psychological impact. 'Israel’s systems and air force are more advanced, larger, and more skilled than Ukraine’s.' In April, Israel faced a massive ballistic missile and drone attack from Iran, during which 170 drones were launched simultaneously. With support from a regional alliance led by the US, most of the drones and missiles were intercepted. One child was seriously injured, but no major damage was reported. As the war continues, drone attacks are expected to persist, with both sides advancing their tactics, potentially fueling another arms race in the Middle East.

Trump: 'Bibi has been very strong, not listening to Biden'	U.S. Republican candidate says in Fox News interview prime minister met with him in Florida despite his office saying no such meeting took place U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed on Sunday he spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'like two days ago,' despite the Prime Minister's Office saying no such conversation took place. In an interview with Fox News aired on Sunday, the Republican candidate was asked about the fact that U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu only after a seven-week hiatus, to which he responded it was 'pathetic.' 'Like two days ago and he came to my house in Florida, Mar-a-Lago with his wife who was lovely,' Trump said, referring to Netanyahu and his wife, Sara. 'I can tell you that Bibi has been very strong. He's not listening to Biden,' he added, calling the prime minister by his nickname. During the call that the U.S. president had with Netanyahu after the extended silence, Biden asked the prime minister to scale back Israeli strikes in Beirut. Indeed, in the days following, Israel refrained from attacking the Lebanese capital. The Prime Minister's Office said Netanyahu's call with Biden was 'businesslike. Israel always listens attentively to the issues raised by our ally, the United States, but the prime minister ultimately makes decisions based on Israel's national interests.' Regarding coordination with the U.S., the Prime Minister's Office said: 'There's ongoing communication with them and we listen to their concerns, just as we explain our perspective and analysis. Israel will do whatever is necessary to protect itself.'

At least 20 injured in drone strike in Binyamina, 3 in critical c...	Emergency rescue teams, including helicopters, are on the scene following the explosion on Sunday evening Many casualties have been sustained from a drone strike in the Binyamin area of northern Israel. Magen David Adom Director General Eli Bin said that at least 20 people were injured Sunday evening from a drone strike launched by Hezbollah that exploded near Binyamina in northern Israel. Three of the injured are defined as critical, five others were seriously injured and another 14 were in moderate condition. Emek medical center in Afula has declared a mass-casualty event. Hezbollah launched three UAVs. Air defense systems intercepted one of them after alarms in the Western Galilee, including in Acre and Nahariya. But one of the two UAVs penetrated deep into Israel, and the explosion occurred in the Binyamins area without triggering an alarm. 'There was a crazy boom, without any warning,' said an eyewitness. The serious incident comes in the wake of several other serious injuries recorded by Hezbollah's incessant barrages on Israeli communities at the same time as the battles that are currently taking place in the IDF's limited ground operation in southern Lebanon. On Wednesday, Dvir Sharvit, 43, and Revital Yehud, 45, were killed by a direct hit in Kiryat Shmona. Israel is also still struggling to deal with the threat of Hezbollah's UAVs, and an example of this came on the eve of Yom Kippur with the direct hit of a UAV launched from Lebanon on a sheltered housing facility for the elderly in Herzliya, in which there were no casualties, after the residents followed the directives of the Home Front Command.

US to send THAAD anti-missile system to Israel, says Pentagon	The United States said on Sunday it will send to Israel an advanced anti-missile system - and U.S. troops to operate it - in a bid to bolster the country's air defenses following missile attacks by Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden said he was sending the system 'to defend Israel.' Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said the deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery would augment Israel's integrated air defense system. 'It is part of the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months, to support the defense of Israel and protect Americans from attacks by Iran and Iranian-aligned militias,' Ryder said in a statement. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi warned earlier on Sunday that the United States was putting the lives of its troops 'at risk by deploying them to operate U.S. missile systems in Israel.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjc0outykx	2024-10-13T09:45:41-07:00

Israeli bombardments blow holes in Hezbollah budget, report says	Terror group's access to money is drying up amid increased IDF operations in the country according to experts in new report diving into Hezbollah's financial situation as war continues Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah is running out of funds to finance its continued assault on Israel amid the IDF’s deepening operation in Lebanon, researchers told U.S.-based outlet Voice of America (VOA). The news outlet reported on Friday, citing authorities in the U.S. and Lebanon, that the terror group’s source of funds is Al-Qard al-Hasan (AQAH), a quasi-banking group operating in Lebanon without a proper license. Israel's Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (ITIC) told VOA the terror group funded the financial body in 1982 as a charity fund providing loans to needy, mainly Shi’ite, Lebanese citizens. The body has since grown into a major financial player across Hezbollah-dominated Lebanon including inside of Beirut and the terror group’s Dahieh district. The outlet added that the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on AQAH in 2007. In a 2021 announcement about further sanctions targeting AQAH employees, the department said the institution had accumulated around half a billion dollars. According to MTV Lebanon, one of the country’s major TV networks, Israel's initial airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Beirut’s Dahieh in late September dealt a significant blow to AQAH. On September 30, an Arabic-language report from MTV Lebanon stated that the Israeli strikes had targeted Hezbollah’s 'cash storage centers, including a large part of the AQAH vaults,' resulting in what the network described as a 'financial crisis' for the group, according to the report. Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut, told the outlet that Israel 'destroyed' most of AQAH’s branches during the strikes. 'Hezbollah is facing a very serious financial problem. They are unable to pay rank and file members who have fled their homes and need to feed their families,' he said. The U.S. Treasury Department's 2021 statement regarding sanctions on six AQAH employees revealed that these individuals had used personal accounts at licensed Lebanese banks to move over $500 million to and from AQAH over the past decade. This arrangement allowed AQAH access to the global financial system through the employees’ personal accounts at Lebanese banks, the report added. David Asher, a former U.S. Defense and State department official who worked on targeting Hezbollah’s global drug trafficking and money laundering operations, told VOA that the group is in 'deep trouble' as it also loses access to the Lebanese banking system. 'I’m hearing from Lebanese bankers, including Hezbollah financiers, that Lebanon’s wealthiest bankers who can afford to fly have fled to Europe and the Gulf, fearing they could be targeted next by Israel for helping Hezbollah,' Asher, now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, said. 'These Lebanese bankers, most of them billionaires, see the wind is blowing against Hezbollah, so they are not going to let it take millions of dollars out of their banks, which still have cash despite being bankrupt on paper,' he added. 'They know that if they do, Israel probably will eliminate them, too.' Asher and Khashan also pointed out that another funding source for Hezbollah has dried up: cash deliveries on planes flying to Beirut’s airport, mainly from the group’s Iranian patron. 'I’ve heard from my Israeli counterparts that the Iranians are scared to send money to Lebanon right now because Israel is threatening to target flights into Beirut. The Israelis are warning they will target flights full of money, not just weapons,' Asher said. Khashan told the outlet that Iran previously arranged regular flights from Tehran to Beirut to smuggle cash to Hezbollah, bypassing Lebanese government customs. 'Since Israel escalated its attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs, the Lebanese government has asserted more control over the airport, and now there is no cash flow to Hezbollah,' he said. Lebanese Public Works and Transport Minister Ali Hamieh told APF last week that Beirut airport 'is subject to Lebanese laws and to the scrutiny of various relevant departments and security agencies.' He added that any plane carrying weapons must receive approval from the Lebanese army and be licensed by his ministry. In a Thursday report, Saudi outlet Al Arabiya cited a Lebanese army source saying the army and other security agencies have been 'scrambling' to establish control over the airport by initiating cargo inspections to verify declared contents. Despite the lack of cash, Khashan told VOA it was unlikely Hezbollah's operatives would halt their fight against Israeli forces anytime soon. 'Keeping up the fight depends more on the availability of food and ammunition,' he said. 'When your fight is motivated by religious zeal, you have more fundamental issues to worry about than the availability of cash.'

Nazi Party member killed during hike on Hitler's favorite mountai...	Andreas Münzhuber, a member of the far-right The Third Way party in Bavaria, tripped over an exposed tree root and fell 60 meters to his death A prominent German neo-Nazi activist, Andreas Münzhuber, fell to his death about two weeks ago while hiking on Mount Untersberg in Bavaria, near the Austrian border. He was hiking with around 30 others on a mountain once favored by Adolf Hitler. The view from the 1,972-meter-high peak was so beloved by the Nazi leader that he chose to build his infamous retreat, the Eagle’s Nest, in the area. German police reported that Münzhuber likely tripped over an exposed tree root and fell 60 meters to his death. He was killed instantly. The recovery of his body involved two helicopters. According to the German news site T-Online, Münzhuber was a senior member of The Third Way, a far-right neo-Nazi political party in Germany, serving as treasurer for its Bavaria branch. The party was founded in 2013 by former officials of the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and activists from the banned Free Network South. The party is estimated to have around 600 members across Germany. In the German news reports, Münzhuber was identified only as Andreas M. due to privacy laws, but media outlets worldwide covering the incident over the weekend published his full name. The British Telegraph reported that his full name also appeared on a crowdfunding page set up to cover his funeral expenses. 'Munzi, as everyone called him, was only 37 and still had so many plans in life. His death hit us hard,' read the post. 'The biggest void is felt at the dinner table in his home. His wife now has to raise their daughter alone. She is less than four months old and was the light of Munzi’s life. She looks just like him. He will continue to live on in her and in our hearts.' So far, about €12,000 has been raised for the funeral costs.

Columbus holiday in Latin America revives centuries-old historica...	After a 22-year investigation using DNA analysis, Spanish scientists argue Christopher Columbus, who was traditionally thought to have been from Genoa, Italy, was a Sephardic Jew from somewhere in Western Europe An Argentine claim that European contact brought civilization to the Americas has provoked rebukes from across Latin America, where heated debates often flare up over the era's contested historical legacy. Commemorating Christopher Columbus' landing in the Americas on Oct. 12, 1492, the office of Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei posted on social media on Saturday that the Italian explorer's arrival introduced enlightenment to the region. 'It marked the beginning of civilization in the American continent,' the post boasted, accompanied by a slick video set to triumphant music that elaborated on the claim. Columbus' arrival in the present-day Bahamas led to centuries of Spanish and Portuguese domination of a region stretching from much of today's United States to near Antarctica. The conquests and subsequent colonial experience have long generated impassioned debate. Many Latin American leaders now embrace a more critical view, acknowledging the abuses committed, including massacres, forced labor and widespread looting. Columbus, traditionally thought to have been from Genoa, Italy, was a Sephardic Jew from somewhere in Western Europe, Spanish scientists said on Saturday after a 22-year investigation using DNA analysis. The debates about his legacy often fall along ideological lines, with leftists especially sensitive to suggestions that the region's Indigenous cultures are inferior. Mexico's new leftist leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, ended a speech on Saturday outside the nation's capital with a repudiation of the view represented by Milei. 'For many years, they told us that they come from over there to civilize us. No! There were already great cultures here,' said Sheinbaum, who took office earlier this month, ticking off contributions from the Olmecs and Aztecs, among others. 'It's more than that, Mexico is great because of its original peoples,' she said, speaking in the working class city of Nezahualcoyotl, named for the 15th century king of Texcoco, famed for his poetry, engineering feats and skill on the battlefield. In 2020 when she was Mexico City mayor, Sheinbaum ordered the removal of a statue of Columbus that had adorned the capital's most prominent avenue since 1877. Sheinbaum and her like-minded predecessor have urged Spain's King Felipe VI to apologize for atrocities committed during the 16th century conquest of Mexico, a request that led to a rare royal snub ahead of her inauguration. The holiday is recognized across Latin America. But it has taken on different names, including in Argentina, where it was changed by a 2010 presidential decree from Day of the Race, a nod to Spanish culture, to Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity. In the United States, Columbus Day, observed on Monday this year, remains a national holiday. President Joe Biden also commemorated the day as Indigenous Peoples' Day in a proclamation in 2021. The holiday in Venezuela has been called Day of Indigenous Resistance for the past couple of decades. On Saturday, embattled President Nicolas Maduro accused Milei of seeking to rewrite history. 'Did you see what he published?' Maduro scoffed, referring to Milei's post. 'Remembering Oct. 12 as the great day when they civilized us,' he said. 'They want to impose their false narrative.'

Israel contemplates a response to Iran missile strike, two weeks ...	Israel has yet to retaliate against the Iranian regime's missile barrage while the US warns against attacking oil or nuclear facilities in Iran; 'Not procrastination, there is a strategy' After Iran's first direct missile attack on April 14, Israel took six days to respond. However, it has been almost two weeks since Iran's largest direct attack, which included about 200 ballistic missiles and was greater in scope and in the severity of its threat. This delay raises the question of whether Israel is procrastinating or if there is a plan to attack altogether. Sources privy to the details emphasize that there is no delay in the planned attack. According to them, 'Israel acts according to different considerations and what was true for the previous attack does not correspond to the current situation.' In addition, they stressed that 'Israel is not procrastinating, and is acting according to an orderly plan and a clear strategy.' Sources in Israel explain that the response will arrive and be significant, but so far it has not been officially decided regarding how, when and where. As part of the discussions on the nature of the expected retaliation, cabinet members were presented with options but no decisions were made concerning the attack. Also, unlike the last attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were not authorized to make the decision. Amid deliberations, the delay may be due to operational considerations and the desire to coordinate with the Americans. Despite Israel not coordinating Nasrallah's assassination, Israel wishes to keep the Americans in the loop to ensure Israel's defense, based on the assumption that Iran will retaliate. Israeli and American defense counterparts have been discussing the potential plan to respond to the Iranian strike. While Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden held several calls, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer spoke with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Defense Minister Gallant was supposed to meet Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the U.S. and Ambassador Mike Herzog has been talking to his counterparts in the White House. Meanwhile, the talks between Israel and the U.S. show that the Americans want to avoid attacking Iran's nuclear and oil facilities. Israel, nevertheless, wants to strike 'two birds with one stone', since damage to the oil facilities will significantly damage Tehran's sources of income, and will make it difficult for it to finance the continuation of the program nuclear and the financing of global terrorism. Still, Israel may be losing valuable time waiting to respond. The more it waits after the Iranian attack, the less the world will accept a significant Israeli attack, even if it is retaliatory. However, it seems that Israel is doing to the Iranians what Iran did to Israel after the assassination of the head of the political bureau of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, on July 31, for which Israel has not taken responsibility.

Officials to decide urgent defense needs as IDF shopping list gro...	Israel's senior political leadership will discuss the defense budget, with priority given to immediate IDF requests for bombs, missiles, and interceptor purchases, extending compulsory military service, and procuring JLTVs from the U.S. for ground forces Senior Israeli officials are expected on Sunday to discuss Israel's defense budget including whether to approve or reject a series of urgent requests from the IDF, given the constraints and strategic considerations of expanding combat across all fronts. The meeting comes ahead of the government approving the next national budget, expected by the end of the month. Deputy IDF Chief of Staff Major General Amir Baram is spearheading the army's force-building strategy, pressing for the immediate approval of a substantial purchase of thousands of bombs and missiles for the Air Force, driven by ongoing use and increasing demand across all sectors. Some of these acquisitions will be sourced domestically from Israeli industries. Additionally, the military plans to request a significant immediate purchase of interceptor missiles for the air defense system. Regarding manpower, IDF is pushing for several budget-related changes to alleviate the heavy burden on regular, reserve, and permanent forces. One proposal involves extending compulsory service for regular soldiers by four months, restoring the service period to three years as it was previously, thereby allowing many reserve battalions longer rest periods between call-ups. The interim recommendations also suggest improvements in the conditions for young career personnel, although this reform is expected to be delayed until the committee's final conclusions are submitted in a few months. Concerning the naval ships that the IDF seeks to reinforce through procurement, it appears the committee is currently postponing these recommendations, considering the ongoing acquisition of missile boats and batteries already strengthening the naval forces. The committee is anticipated to approve another IDF request for the immediate procurement from the U.S. of hundreds of light armored vehicles, specifically JLTVs, to benefit maneuvering brigades among ground forces. Other matters, which the IDF sought to advance financially and are likely to be deferred to the committee's forthcoming conclusions, pertain to plans for strengthening the eastern border with Jordan. This includes upgrading barriers and establishing an eastern division for defense, as reported by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth last month, accelerating production of armored vehicles such as tanks and Namer APCs, and setting up a dedicated emergency procurement management for weapons acquisition.

Troops taken aback by Radwan arsenal in South Lebanon	Cars with full gas tanks with machine guns loaded on them, weapons, munitions found meters from a kindergarten in Metula: 'Commander says only troops on the ground could locate what Radwan had been hiding IDF troops were amazed at the amount and quality of military, equipment and weapons they found mere meters away from the border town of Metulah and a kindergarten there. Since the IDF began its offensive in southern Lebanon, the troops discovered the scope of the failure to prepare for the danger posed by Hezbollah's elite Radwan force that was preparing for an invasion of Israel along the about 130 km of border, close to civilian centers. Troops operating in villages close to the border uncovered hundreds of weapons, wrapped and packed vehicles with which the terrorists planned to invade the Galilee to occupy bases and settlements as far south as Haifa. The vehicles were filled with gas, armed with heavy machine guns, packed with combat uniforms, personal weapons, and medical supplies, and were ready to emerge from hiding places. The soldiers who operated in the northern part of Kfarkila found Hezbollah's weapons stores up a ridge that was hidden from view from the Israeli side. They located anti-tank missiles of various types and ranges, a bounty of ammunition for full-scale combat, machine guns of various types, and explosives. 'We found real headquarters to control and command what they planned with maps on the walls, computers, offices for briefing, and safes for their classified documents,' the commander of the IDF force said. 'Because it is a relatively large village, you can only see a part of it from the Israeli side. That's why we operated at its edge and the whole brigade took it apart. I saw the preparation that was going on for years by Radwan.' The battalion commander commented on the limited operation, emphasizing that the Air Force cannot locate such complex structures with aerial photographs and they can only be found by ground maneuvers. 'Fighting in the Gaza Strip did not cause burnout and was an advantage,' he said. 'We are now much more experienced, even though we are fighting a different, more professional enemy in a different terrain.'

Netanyahu urges UN's Guterres to move UNIFIL forces away from fig...	In a clip Netanyahu addresses the UN General Secretary in English telling him that removing the peacekeepers from harm's way must be done immediately after repeated requests from Israel and repeated rejections from the UN Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday made an English, on-camera appeal to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to pull UNIFIL forces away from the fighting in South Lebanon. 'Mr. Secretary General, Get the UNIFIL forces out of harm's way. It should be done right now, immediately,' Netanyahu said in a video posted by his office. In Hebrew Netanyahu said the IDF had repeatedly asked that UNIFIL move out of the area where fighting was taking place and was repeatedly refused, thereby providing the Hezbollah terror group with human shields. 'Your refusal to remove the troops makes the UNIFIL forces hostages in the hands of Hezbollah,' Netanyahu said. He said Israel regrets any harm caused to the peacekeeping troops and does everything possible to prevent such harm but the simple way to avoid such events is simply to remove the troops from danger. Netanyahu went on to say that regrettably, some European leaders are exerting pressure in the wrong place. 'Instead of criticizing Israel, they should direct the criticism to Hezbollah which is using the peacekeepers as human shields just like Hamas used UNRWA in Gaza. Guterres condemned the shooting at UNIFIL forces, calling it a violation of humanitarian international law and the UN Security Council also condemned the incidents. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Saturday expressed deep concern over IDF's fire on UNIFIL positions. At least two members of the force had suffered mild injuries. The leaders of France and Italy condemned Israel for firing at the UN troops earlier calling it outrageous. Italy lodged its protest after the report that shots were fired, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said. An emergency meeting will be held at the UN Security Council later on Thursday following the incident. Firing on UNIFIL bases was 'totally unacceptable' and clearly flouts international law, Crosetto added in a statement. Italy has summoned Israel's ambassador to the country, Jonathan Peled, to Rome following the incident. France said it was waiting for explanations from Israel. 'France expresses its deep concern following the Israeli shots that hit the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and condemns any attack on the security of UNIFIL,' the foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that none of its 700 troops in the mission had been wounded. On Monday the IDF asked the UNIFIL forces to move out of the fighting area for their safety but was rejected. 'There is an obligation on Israel and Hezbollah to respect the role of UN peacekeepers and their mandate, and do nothing that would put peacekeepers and our troops in particular in harm’s way,' Irish President Michael Higgins, whose troops are part of the UNIFIL deployment, said.
