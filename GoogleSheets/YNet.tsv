Palestinian president makes overtures to President-Elect Trump	Mahmoud Abbas uses Trump daughter's husband's family connections; condemns the assassination attempts in a letter, and is quick to congratulates his electoral victory in effort to mend relations with the returning President President Mahmoud Abbas has been crafting a strategy as intricate as a chess game to rekindle ties with the United States' freshly re-elected President, Donald Trump, especially after Trump's supposed backing of Israel during his initial tenure. This narrative unfolds in a comprehensive report by The New York Times, detailing Abbas' maneuvers before and after Trump's electoral victory. Before the ballots were even cast, Abbas was laying the groundwork to reach out to Trump. Often playing the role of intermediary was Massad Boulos, father-in-law to Trump's daughter Tiffany. This Lebanese-American businessman, now deeply entrenched in Trump's inner circle since his son Michael wed Tiffany, has become a pivotal player. Boulos had been a Trump supporter from the get-go, becoming increasingly enmeshed in American politics following a Christmas 2019 rendezvous at the White House. His influence ballooned after his son's 2022 marriage to Tiffany, culminating in a significant role during the latest campaign, where he successfully wooed Arab-American voters in pivotal states. Abbas crossed paths with Boulos at the fringes of the UN General Assembly in September. While Palestinian officials branded this meeting as Abbas' diplomatic overture to Trump, Boulos told The New York Times the encounter was 'completely personal,' and he kept Trump in the dark about it. Palestinian official Ziad Abu Amr, who was present and is seen as Abbas' confidant, relayed Boulos' message of Trump's intent to 'end wars worldwide, including in Gaza.' Boulos, along with Dr. Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American Trump enthusiast, managed to deliver a letter from Abbas to Trump in July, condemning the assassination attempt. Trump responded, calling it 'very nice,' and declared, 'everything will be fine.' 'We want to maintain a good working relationship because one cannot ignore the United States' role in resolving the conflict,' Abu Amr remarked. In their September meeting, Abbas expressed readiness for peace with Israel based on a two-state solution and openness to international monitors in a future Palestinian state to secure Israel's safety, according to Bahbah. Boulos, speaking to Lebanon's LBCI network, mentioned Trump is gearing up for a new Iran deal, one that would be 'acceptable to the Iranians, neighboring countries, and the USA.' Boulos, dubbed by the Lebanese network as 'Trump's adviser on Arab affairs,' emphasized his policy of advancing Middle Eastern peace. On Lebanon, he stated there was no issue with Lebanese entities holding 'personal or medium weapons,' but the crux of the problem lay with 'strategic and heavy weapons,' namely those held by Hezbollah. Upon Trump's victory, Abbas was among the first to extend congratulations, paralleling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions. Abbas has maintained contact with Trump in recent months, with both parties affirming that the Palestinian leader assured Trump of 'no fighting, no invasions and no attacks' from a prospective Palestinian state. A statement from Abbas' office revealed he spoke with Trump, wishing him success and expressing a desire to work together 'to achieve a just and comprehensive peace.' It was noted that Trump confirmed his commitment to ending the war and showed willingness to collaborate with Abbas and other regional players to secure peace. The Palestinian leader underlined their 'commitment to achieving freedom, self-determination, and statehood, in accordance with international law,' stating, 'We will remain steadfast in our commitment to peace, and we are confident that under your leadership, the USA will support the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.' A senior Palestinian official confided to Ynet that Abbas has fostered 'very good contact' with the newly elected president, a bond forged over the past year, surpassing the relationship with outgoing President Joe Biden. The official opined that the Authority welcomes Trump's election, albeit with slight reservations, 'if indeed Trump will act to establish a Palestinian state in practice.' Palestinians harbor grim memories from Trump's first term, marked by funding cuts to UNRWA and the PLO office in Washington, following the relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and its recognition as Israel's united capital. In 2020, Trump unveiled the 'Deal of the Century' for a political settlement with Israel, a proposal the Palestinians resoundingly rejected as a 'disaster that harms their rights' for its exclusion of a Palestinian state.

Progress in US brokered Israel-Lebanon deal	Drafts exchanged between Jerusalem US envoy Hochstein and Lebanon PM Mikati; Security cabinet convenes to discuss potential deal Israel and Lebanon exchanged drafts through the mediation of U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein in what was described as progress in efforts to reach an agreement to end the fighting across the Lebanon border. The security cabinet convened Sunday after Hochstein, President Joe Biden's special envoy, has also exchanged drafts with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. The cabinet was expected to review all pressing issues, including updates on the ceasefire negotiations in Lebanon, the status of prisoners of war and missing persons, and the humanitarian situation. The Biden administration has set a firm demand for Israel to significantly improve humanitarian aid access to Gaza within 30 days, warning that failure to do so could lead to a U.S. arms embargo. Sources close to the negotiations report substantial progress, with an increasingly realistic chance of reaching an agreement. They attribute this to Donald Trump’s recent victory in the U.S. presidential election, suggesting that both Biden and Trump administrations share a desire to end the war before Trump's January 20 inauguration, ideally before winter sets in. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer flew to Washington on Saturday to meet senior White House officials. Last week, he also visited Russia to promote a Middle Eastern ceasefire, specifically focused on reducing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah in northern Israel. Israel recognizes Russia's influence over Hezbollah, Syria, and Iran and believes Moscow would welcome a ceasefire. In turn, Israel seeks assurances from Russia to prevent weapons smuggling from Syria to Lebanon, aiming to curb Hezbollah’s armament. The emerging agreement includes principles requiring Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River. For the first 60 days, the IDF will remain in the initial line of Lebanese villages to allow the Lebanese army to dismantle Hezbollah's infrastructure in the buffer area between the border and the Litani. After this period, the IDF would pull back to the Blue Line. The ceasefire agreement outlines an enforcement mechanism. Israel insists on preserving military freedom if the mechanism fails, reserving the right to respond to any violations, a condition included in a side letter attached to the agreement. Hezbollah sources told Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hadath that the organization is willing to withdraw north of the Litani but rejects one term—Israel's freedom of movement in Lebanon. 'Hezbollah agrees to most of the stated terms, including avoiding rearmament,' the sources added. Israeli sources emphasize the importance of sealing off weapon smuggling channels, saying, 'If we don't, Hezbollah will rearm, and our efforts would be wasted.' They clarified that Israel's objective isn’t to destroy Hezbollah as it did with Hamas but noted, 'We have achieved significant progress against Hezbollah, and it’s fortunate we didn’t finalize a deal before achieving these goals.' According to these sources, the ceasefire will allow residents to return safely only if they genuinely feel secure, without Hezbollah snipers targeting them. 'This goal is achievable through the ceasefire, while we continue to target enemy positions, as we did today in Syria.' Discussions are ongoing between Israel and the U.S. to finalize the enforcement mechanism and Israel's operational flexibility. 'This doesn’t mean we need to be in Lebanon, but ultimately we need the capacity to enforce and act, and I’m confident we will have it,' one source said. Israel has also highlighted the strong alignment between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President-elect Trump. They share a common vision: an end to hostilities on all fronts that culminates in a decisive victory. Meanwhile, Dermer is expected to meet with Trump and his team to address two critical issues: ensuring Iran does not achieve nuclear capabilities and advancing normalization with Saudi Arabia. Dermer will present Trump with intelligence on Iran’s nuclear progress. 'Trump is determined to stop Iran, initially with sanctions, but our message is that only a credible military option will sway Tehran,' Israeli sources noted. One Israeli source pointed out that Netanyahu spoke with Trump three times in recent days, adding, 'We are aligned with Trump and share a unified vision.'

Saudi armed forces chief of staff in Iran for talks with official...	Iran state media says the leaders of the two militaries discussed development of defense diplomacy and the expansion of bilateral cooperation' The chief of staff of Saudi Arabia's armed forces, Fayyad al-Ruwaili, visited Tehran on Sunday to meet with his Iranian counterpart and discuss defense ties, state media reported the Iranian Armed Forces General Staff as saying. The visit follows the election of Donald Trump, who will take office for a second term as U.S. President in January, and who has promised to bring peace to the Middle East. During his first term, Trump initiated normalizations between Arab states and Iran's regional arch-enemy Israel, known as the Abraham Accords. Saudi Arabia has not established ties with Israel, but Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has discussed the possibility with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman multiple times over the last years, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Iran's state media said al-Ruwaili headed a high-level Saudi military delegation in Tehran and met Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri and said the two military officials discussed various issues, including 'the development of defense diplomacy and the expansion of bilateral cooperation'. State media added that Bagheri held a phone call with Saudi Arabia's Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud last year to discuss regional developments and improve defense cooperation between the two countries. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal in October, Iran threatened Arab nations that if they assist Israel in its retaliatory attack on Iranian targets, they would be punished Earlier, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the phone, Iranian media said. Pezeshkian told the crown prince he would not be able to attend a summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Riyadh on Monday due to his busy schedule, and would be dispatching the Iranian first vice president as a representative, the Mehr news agency said. Tehran and Riyadh agreed in March 2023, via Chinese intermediation, to re-establish relations after seven years of hostility that had threatened stability and security in the Gulf and helped to fuel conflicts in the Middle East from Yemen to Syria.

IDF destroys Hezbollah complex under South Lebanon cemetery	Compound extends nearly one kilometer in length, reaches 2 meters in height, located approximately one and a half kilometers from the border The IDF destroyed an underground Hezbollah terror complex near the border with Israel, the military said on Sunday. The fortification was dug under a local cemetery. 'During activity in the area, troops identified several tunnel shafts leading into the compound, which led to the exposure of the full tunnel, the IDF spokesperson said. 'The forces investigated and dismantled the compound, which extended approximately one kilometer in length, reached approximately two meters in height and was located approximately one and a half kilometers from the border, and did not extend into Israeli territory. The spokesperson said hundreds of trucks and concrete mixers poured approximately 4,500 cubic meters of concrete into the underground compound. Earlier, Lebanese media said there were injuries in an IDF strike on a residential building in the village of Kharaib in the south of the country. Other reports claimed one person was killed and another injured in an attack on the village of Al-Marwaniya in the south, as well as additional casualties in strikes in various regions of Lebanon. Israel's new defense minister Israel Katz said Israel defeated Hezbollah, during a ceremony in the Defense Ministry. Soon after he spoke, sirens warned of rockets targeting the Upper Galilee region. 'When the moment came [to launch an offensive on Hezbollah] we did so with full momentum, and the blows dealt will be studied in warfare and military schools, Katz said. 'These are the blows that defeated Hezbollah. Now our task is to continue the pressure and realize the fruits of this victory by ensuring a change in the security situation in Lebanon, including preventing rearmament.'

Israel kills Hezbollah operative behind Hariri assassination, rep...	Salim Jamil Ayyash convicted of leading the hit squad that planted a car bomb killing then-Lebanese prime minister on orders from Nasrallah; US had $10 million bounty on his head A Hezbollah commander, who was convicted for the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, was killed in an Israeli strike, Saudi Arabia's Al-Arabiya network reported on Sunday. Salim Jamil Ayyash was reportedly killed in an Israeli strike on al-Qusayr, in Syria’s Homs region on Saturday. Ayyash, 61, born in the village of Harouf in southern Lebanon, holds American citizenship. The U.S. had offered a reward of up to $10 million for information on his whereabouts. He was a member of Hezbollah's Unit 121, the terror group’s 'assassinations unit,' which took orders directly from Hezbollah’s slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The U.S. Department of State said in a statement that Ayyash had also been involved in efforts to harm U.S. military personnel. On Dec. 11, 2020, the international tribunal established to rule on Hariri's assassination sentenced Ayyash in absentia to five life terms on terrorism charges connected to a February 2005 truck bomb attack in Beirut that killed Hariri along with 21 others, and injured 226 people. The court found that Ayyash led the hit squad behind the bombing and was actively involved in Hariri’s assassination. In June 2022, the U.N. Special Tribunal for Lebanon also sentenced two other Hezbollah operatives, Hassan Habib Merhi and Hussein Hassan Oneissi, to life in prison for Hariri’s assassination. The two were convicted in absentia by the tribunal in The Hague. Hezbollah then announced it would not surrender the two, just as it had refused to hand over Ayyash. The court found that Merhi and Oneissi had circulated a video clip in which a fictitious group claimed responsibility for Hariri’s killing, intending to shield Hezbollah’s operatives who had carried out the attack.

Pakistan criminalizes Zionist activity, sparking accusations of i...	Pakistan is home to at most 200 Jews and has no Zionist movement, raising questions about the rationale behind a new law that makes Zionism punishable by up to three years in prison Promoting Zionist ideas or displaying Zionist symbols is now a criminal offense in Pakistan following newly passed legislation. On Thursday, the Senate Standing Committee on Interior approved a bill that imposes a maximum three-year prison sentence for 'promoting Zionism to incite hatred' and a maximum two-year prison sentence for 'displaying Zionist symbols with the intent to create public unrest.' The bill was introduced by Afnan Ullah Khan of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N) party. In his speech, Afnan said that 'the books of Zionism' call for killing dissenters. 'They are martyring children in Gaza under this ideology,' he said. No committee member opposed the bill Joshua S. Krug, a visiting professor at Germany’s Center for Jewish Studies Heidelberg, told The Media Line that Afnan 'seems to misunderstand the nature, history, and realities of Zionism and the modern Middle East.' 'There are no specific books of Zionism,' Krug said. 'Perhaps the senator incorrectly refers to the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a work long used to misrepresent Jews.' He noted that Zionists and non-Zionists coexist in Israel. 'Despite challenges, people from varied backgrounds, including Arabs and Jews, live and develop freely,' he said. In a short conversation with The Media Line, Afnan noted that the bill 'precisely opposes Zionism.' 'It does not target Judaism as a whole,' he said. 'In a civilized world, there is no place for an ideology that indiscriminately targets women and children,' Afnan said. 'Such acts of violence perpetuate fear, trauma, and suffering, causing lasting damage to affected individuals and communities.' He did not explain his rationale for introducing the bill in a country that has no Zionist movement to speak of. Before Pakistan’s independence, a significant Jewish community resided in the cities of Karachi and Rawalpindi. Jews lived peacefully for the most part and had several communal institutions. With the establishment of the state of Israel, antisemitism in Pakistan grew rapidly, and many Pakistani Jews fled to Israel. Today, no Jews are believed to remain in Pakistan. But for those who know to look for it, Jewish history in Pakistan is still visible. Karachi’s Merewether Clock Tower features a Star of David, and gravestones in the Juda Shahi cemetery have Hebrew inscriptions. This tower, named after Sir William L. Merewether, the Commissioner of Sindh at the time, built in 1892, stands as a testament to the multicultural history of this vibrant city. However, as time passed, a bustling transit hub emerged around this historic landmark Sajjad Azhar, a Rawalpindi-based historian, told The Media Line that the religious freedom that once characterized India and Pakistan has significantly diminished over the past century. 'The new bill reflects this intolerance,' he said. 'Pakistan’s recent anti-Zionism bill is perplexing because there is no active advocacy of Zionism or Jewish population remaining in the nation. It begs the question, what is the point of passing such a bill?' The bill, which stipulates that arrests for promoting Zionism will require a warrant and be classified as bailable offenses, appears to be largely symbolic. The symbolism may be intended to communicate Pakistan’s stance on international issues or to reinforce ideological unity within the country. Kaswar Klasra, an Islamabad-based geopolitics expert, said that the bill aligns Pakistan with the Palestinian cause. That alignment may 'complicate Pakistan’s diplomatic relations with countries taking a more nuanced view on Israel and Zionism,' he told The Media Line. He added that the new legislation may also curtail freedom of expression in Pakistan.

Resident of Amsterdam says violence against Israelis not a surpri...	Levi (alias) who himself was attacked by pro-Hamas protesters says he wasn't surprised by the events, and he witnessed similar antisemitism and violence at his university Following the attacks on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam by pro-Palestinians, a Jewish Amsterdam resident, who spoke under the alias Levi, shared what's like being a Jew in the city, and how he has to hide his Jewish identity or pro-Israel stance. 'We should say this is a fake name, Levi. Why do you choose to speak with us? Not under your real name? 'Well, frankly, it's just not safe for me to be here with my face and with my real name, we see what happens to anyone in Amsterdam that really has any sort of relationship to Israel. So I'm not gonna take any risks.' Levi, a few months ago, you were attacked by pro-Hamas protesters in Amsterdam, I assume the pogrom on Friday wasn't a surprise for you. 'No, it was not a surprise at all to be fair. We've seen pure Jew hatred and global antisemitism, and I've been a witness to it at my university. Even though they have not attacked Jews like that, just for being Jewish yet, we've seen now that they've been attacking Israelis and it was not a surprise for me at all.' Is it safe to be a young Jewish man in Amsterdam these days? 'Ever since October 7, we've seen the attacks in the universities. You cannot be openly pro-Israeli Zionist people don't even know the definition of Zionism to be fair. So, saying that you are a Zionist is not safe and I think 99% of the Jews are Zionists. I have a Star of David necklace. Usually, I don't wear it on the streets in Amsterdam. So, you're safe as long as you're not openly Jewish or pro-Israel.' So, what is the reason you still live and study in Amsterdam? 'Well, it's extremely sad that I don't even think that's an unfair question to ask. I'm fully Dutch, I'm from Amsterdam. I was born here. My parents are Dutch, My grandparents are Dutch, so for me to just move to another country, because of the fact that I cannot openly show a big very important part of my identity it's something I'm not gonna do now, but to be fair, I've been thinking about it, I've been talking about it, and it's not a crazy thing at all. But, yeah, let's hope I'm not forced to, and let's hope this is a tipping point for the government to show.' Speaking about the government, what are your thoughts on the authorities' actions towards the rising antisemitism, the riots against Jewish people, and Israeli soccer fans? 'Well, obviously there have been made a lot of mistakes. The fact that what happened on Thursday night, that's something like that can happen in Amsterdam, it's insane, we've all seen it coming. And the fact that our security agency apparently did not expect something like this to happen or at least did not maneuver themselves in such a way to prevent this from happening, it's crazy. Our coalition itself, our government itself is actually very pro-Jewish right now and a lot of politicians said that they are disturbed by the events. But there are also obviously a lot of politicians that are more lenient towards understanding, and some of them find to justify what happens. But our government itself right now is actually not antisemitic.'

Police crack down on pro-Palestinian protesters challenging prote...	After posting on X that the demonstration at Dam Square was illegal, police remove 100 demonstrators, putting them on buses to take them away from the city Amsterdam police on Sunday forcefully removed some 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who gathered at the Dam Square in contradiction of a ban on demonstrations imposed after the violent attacks against Israeli soccer fans last week. They were put on buses and dropped off on the outskirts of the city, police spokesperson Ramona van den Ochtend said, without confirming how many had been picked up. The police posted an announcement on X in the afternoon, declaring the gathering at the city's main square as illegal and warning that demonstrators would be arrested. Some 200 Palestinian supporters still showed up chanting familiar lines such as 'from the river to the sea Palestine will be free.' The standoff escalated swiftly as officers began removing protesters, and within the hour, the Dutch 'Telegraaf' reported numerous arrests. Scenes of confrontation spread in the press and on social media showing the police clashing with the demonstrators who shouted abuse at them. A member of the Amsterdam city council was arrested, having orchestrated his own arrest as a gesture of solidarity. Amsterdam's authorities had announced a three-day demonstration ban after the violence on Thursday According to reports, primarily immigrants and their descendants targeted Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, ambushing them at train stations and other city points post-match, wielding knives, batons, and fists. Some fans were deliberately run over, their passports and possessions stolen. At least one Israeli was documented in the canal waters, coerced to shout 'Free Palestine' under threat from the assailants. These disturbances, occurring just days before the Kristallnacht anniversary, sent shockwaves not only through Israel but also among Dutch and European communities. Amsterdam's mayor condemned the perpetrators as 'antisemitic hit-and-run gangs.' Initially, Dutch police announced the arrest of over 60 suspects. However, recent updates revealed that only four remain detained, including two minors, while more than 40 others received fines for 'disturbing public order.' Ten individuals face various charges, including vandalism, with further arrests anticipated. Olivier Dutilleux, the Dutch police chief, told a court that the bann on demonstrations was necessary after ongoing reports of antisemitic incidents. He said people were being ejected from taxis and threatened on the streets, merely for appearing Israeli.

Israel tells citizens abroad to stay clear of International sport...	National Security Council says observed indications of organized plans to attack Israelis, Jews in large gatherings using demonstrations as cover including in Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and cities in the UK The National Security Council on Sunday cautioned Israelis abroad to stay away from cultural and sporting events with the participation of Israelis, days after the violent attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam. According to the NSC, Pro-Palestinians groups were calling to attack Israelis and Jews under the guise of protests and demonstration, and while taking advantage of public gatherings at the events, in order to maximize harm and exposure in the media. The council said organized plans to attack Israelis were observed in several European cities including Brussels, Amsterdam, Paris and some major cities in the UK. Israel's national team is expected to play in a Paris on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that he would attend the match to show support for Israel after events in Amsterdam. On its web site the security council urged Israelis to exercise caution including avoiding any Jewish and Israeli markings, out of concern that terrorists or others will attempt to insert themselves into events and carry out attacks. The NSC recommended that Israelis refrain from attending any sporting or cultural event in the coming week, stay away from demonstrations of any kind, mask their Israeli identity when ordering taxis on apps and be aware of areas at risk when traveling around, including neighborhoods with predominately migrant populations from countries who are adversaries of Israel.

At least 7 dead in a strike attributed to Israel on Damascus	Strike on residential building in Damascus' Sayeda Zainab district, reportedly targets senior Hezbollah member in charge of Golan Heights; his son also killed in a drone strike on the Syria-Lebanon border in September At least seven people were killed and some 15 wounded in a strike attributed to Israel, on a residential building in the Sayeda Zainab district south of the Syrian capital Damascus on Sunday, the Syrian state news agency said. The target of the attack, according to Saudi Arabian media, was Ali Moussa Dakdouk charged with Hezbollah's operation on the Golan Heights, who acted as a military adviser to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iraq and Yemen and is wanted for his involvement in the murder of American troops in Iraq. His son Hassan Ali Dakdouk, a former commander in the Radwan force was killed in an attack in a drone strike on the Syria-Lebanon border area last September Sayeda Zainab, a stronghold of armed group Hezbollah and the site of a major Shi'ite shrine, has been the target in previous strikes. Israel has ramped up strikes in Syria since the Oct. 7 attack by militant group Hamas on Israel in 2023 and particularly since the escalation of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict.

PM dispatches close ally to Trump, Herzog to visit Biden	Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Netanyahu's closest ally in the cabinet to D.C. to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration; Strategic talks focus on regional stability, Iranian threats, and potential ceasefire with Hezbollah Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will dispatch Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to meet U.S. president elect Donald Trump in Washington. Dermer is scheduled to visit to the capital for meetings with administration officials. Dermer recently visited Russia in efforts to advance a cease fire in the war with an emphasis on Lebanon. On Sunday, Netanyahu said he had already spoken to Trump three times since his elections last week. He told ministers during the weekly cabinet meeting that he and the president elect were in agreement on the threats from Iran adding that Israel has not changed its objective to ensure Iran does not obtain nuclear capabilities. The primary focus of Dermer's meetings with Trump and his team will be on northern border stabilization, discussions on a hostage deal, normalization with Saudi Arabia, and post-war plans for Gaza. Dermer will present Trump with intelligence gathered by Israel regarding Iran's nuclear program and the potential threat of Tehran advancing toward nuclear armament. On Saturday, U.S. political sources confirmed progress in negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. They noted an increasing likelihood of a settlement in Lebanon, spearheaded by President Biden’s envoy Amos Hochstein, with encouragement from Trump. There is also a concerted effort toward achieving a limited hostage exchange. Israeli officials believe Trump is keen to see a Lebanese settlement before assuming office. According to these sources, there is a significant push for a small-scale hostage deal. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Sunday that Hamas was an obstacle for a deal. Sulivan said the administration was reviewing the steps taken by Israel to improve the provision of humanitarian aid to Gazan civilians after an ultimatum presented by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warning Israel of measures that may be taken if the humanitarian situation in the Strip does not improve. U.S. officials said that Qatar's announcement to set back from its role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, was intended to exert pressure on the terror group. According to the officials, Qatar aims to clear diplomatic obstacles before Trump enters office, countering perceptions of inadequate pressure on Hamas. They said it was not likely that the Biden administration would impose an arms embargo on Israel during the remaining time in office. President Issac Herzog will also travel to Washington and is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden.

Netanyahu: Israel responsible for coordinated pager attack, Nasra...	Prime minister tells ministers he insisted on strikes, in the first official Israeli confirmation of responsibility; alludes his now ousted defense minister opposed but he insisted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel was behind the coordinated explosion of Hezbollah's communication devices. This was the first time Israel officially claimed responsibility for the attack. Netanyahu spoke at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting and also announced that Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The prime minister's comments came as he conducted the first meeting of his cabinet after sacking Yoav Gallant from his ministerial position as Defense Minister and replacing him with former Foreign Minister Israel Katz, a move that drew criticizm because Katz lacks any military and defense experience and while Israel was in the midst of war. In his address to the ministers, Netanyahu alluded to Gallant opposing the Israeli operations against the Iran-backed terror group and claimed he insisted that the attacks be carried out. He said there was a false media campaign being conducted against him and claimed that contrary to reporting, Hamas only increased its demands for a cease-fire and hostage release deal, after the murder of six Israeli hostages.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkyq6e011jx	2024-11-10T05:28:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/rJ9N3ePTA/rJ9N3ePTA_0_0_809_456_0_small.jpg

'I disagreed and pursued the mission to its end.'

Shackled and whipped: IDF discovers 'thousands of hours' of Hamas...	Video and photographic evidence uncovered during Israeli raid show detainees enduring severe abuse at Hamas base in Jabaliya; one prisoner appears handcuffed to ceiling, another beaten with sticks during interrogations More than a year into the Israel-Gaza war, the IDF has obtained a trove of harrowing videos and photos alleged to show Hamas operatives interrogating and torturing Palestinian detainees, the Daily Mail reported on Wednesday. The footage, captured by CCTV cameras inside a Hamas base in the Jabaliya refugee camp and found on computers seized during an Israeli raid in March, reportedly includes thousands of hours of interrogation sessions. The footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, depicts detainees in distressing conditions, including being chained to floors and ceilings with bags over their heads. In one video, a man is shown crying out in pain. Another segment reportedly shows a Hamas operative leisurely reclining in a chair with his hands behind his head as a prisoner is seen handcuffed and hanging from the ceiling beside him. A third clip shows a man brutally tied up with a red sack over his head. One of the guards is later seen strangling the man. The IDF’s discovery comes amid ongoing concerns for 101 hostages still held in Gaza, more than 400 days after the October 7 massacre. Human rights groups have previously highlighted instances of Palestinian citizens—allegedly including political dissidents, LGBTQ individuals, suspected adulterers and those accused of collaborating with Israel—who were reportedly detained and subjected to abuse by Hamas. A senior IDF official told the Daily Mail that the military 'found these CCTV images in March. It took months to go through them all.' Hamas torture victim, Hamza Howidy, 27, told The Mail how he was detained for protesting against the regime in Gaza. 'They would torture you until you broke and say whatever it is they wanted,' he said. 'I could hear my fellow protesters scream in the next room.' Howidy, an accountant who later fled Gaza, estimated that he was held somewhere in West Jabaliya in 2019, but it is not clear if he appears in the videos obtained by the IDF. 'Hamas controls everything. They confiscated my laptop and had issues with my conversations with my girlfriend,' he said. He said that one of the men had been detained for three years and tortured three times a week. 'He had objects inserted into him,' Howidy added. 'One man was given electric shocks for two years before his innocence was eventually discovered. The first thing he did was shoot dead the Hamas officer who reported him – his uncle. 'You would never get a lawyer and your family would have no idea what happened to you. I was lucky because my family paid a price for me. I managed to leave for Europe via the Egyptian border in September last year, which cost a fortune, but my family there were told that should I return I'd be a dead man walking. Luckily I got them safe passage too.' He added: 'You just cannot tell who is a Hamas snitch or not.' 'One friend of mine was forced to divorce his wife when he got caught for something. There is a growing hatred toward Hamas now, especially after the war, but because Hamas controls the media and people are afraid, we hardly hear of it,' Howidy said. 'People outside of Gaza call Hamas freedom fighters when they are killing innocent Palestinians for nothing. Hamas is holding the people of Gaza hostage.' A former Israeli intelligence officer, known as Guy C, told the newspaper that Hamas' leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by the IDF last month, was 'obsessed with finding collaborators and held thousands against their will.' 'Some are electrocuted on electricity pylons or dragged on a chain from a vehicle until they die,' he said. 'Even worse, they won't allow the families a proper burial, and the bodies have a sign on saying they were collaborating.'

Who are the Hamas leaders set to be deported from Qatar?	Terror group officials say pushing leaders out of Gulf state isn't in US and Israel's interest, warning of complications in hostage deal negotiations Reports of Qatar agreeing to a U.S. request to close Hamas’ offices in Doha have raised the possibility of the terror group’s officials being removed from the country entirely. The Islamist terrorist organization claimed that pressure on Doha to expel its members would complicate cease-fire negotiations in light of Qatar announcing it was freezing its involvement in mediating a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. 'This isn’t in U.S. or Israel’s interest,' Hamas officials said. Hamas sources told Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat the group favors a model similar to that of the Afghan Taliban, which maintained offices in Qatar while fighting American forces and played a central role in negotiations that led to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Hamas leaders have been based in Qatar since leaving Syria in 2011, following agreements with Doha and between the U.S. and Israel on conditions for their stay. Hamas has backup plans should its leadership be forced to leave Qatar’s capital, including relocating to Turkey, Iran or Lebanon. Hamas’ leadership believes Turkey offers a suitable base, as Hamas leaders frequently visit Ankara, maintain close ties with the Turkish government and enjoy wide public support, as well as significant aid sent from Turkey to Gaza throughout the war. Relocation to Iran is also a possibility, though this option could hinder efforts to reach a deal as it would likely strengthen militant elements within Hamas at the expense of more pragmatic voices. Hamas leaders in Qatar Hamas’ Qatar-based leadership primarily consists of its politburo. Former bureau head Ismail Haniyeh resided there until his assassination in Tehran in July. Khaled Mashal is Hamas’ envoy abroad. The U.S. Senate announced that several prominent members have requested federal agencies to extradite Mashaal to the United States and freeze Hamas assets in Qatar. Mashal’s wealth is estimated at $2-5 billion and he has lived a life of luxury in Doha for the past 10 years. He faced harsh criticism during the war for urging Gazans to hold their ground while he himself moved between Qatar’s upmarket hotels. Khalil al-Hayya is Hamas’ Gaza envoy and former deputy to former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, serving as his right-hand man. Al-Hayya is considered a key figure in negotiations with Israel, was one of the architects of the October 7 massacre and arrived in Qatar from Gaza shortly before the surprise attack. Trained by Sinwar to establish good relations with Iran, al-Hayya managed to climb to the top of the group’s hierarchy. Zaher Jabarin is Hamas’ West Bank envoy and it’s unclear when he moved to Qatar. Jabarin is regarded as Hamas’ 'financial mastermind.' He previously held the position of the group’s prisoner portfolio head and served as deputy leader of Hamas in the West Bank until Saleh al-Arouri’s assassination in Beirut in January. Ghazi Hamad is a member of Hamas’ politburo and left Gaza in August 2023, previously serving as the organization’s deputy foreign policy chief and as an advisor to Ismail Haniyeh and Hamas’ military chief Ahmed Jabari, who was killed in 2012. Hamad played a role as a mediator for Hamas in the deal to release Gilad Shalit in 2011 and is considered one of the most pragmatic leaders in the organization. While there’s no precise estimate of his wealth, he and his children are known to enjoy a lavish lifestyle. Mousa Abu Marzouk served as the Hamas politburo’s deputy head until Haniyeh’s assassination, living with his family in Qatar. He lived in the United States for 14 years and was arrested in 1994 for supporting terrorism. Two years later, he was deported to Jordan, then to Syria and Cairo in 2012. Despite his arrest, Abu Marzouk held onto his assets, with Germany’s Bild newspaper estimating his wealth at $2 billion. According to the Israeli embassy in Washington, he possesses $3 billion. During the war, his brother Yusuf was killed in an attack in Rafah.

Amsterdam pogrom against Israeli soccer fans premeditated, new ev...	Testimonies, evidence and video footage collected by Dutch police and Israeli security confirm violence not spontaneous as initially believed; taxi and Uber drivers reportedly participated, directing rioters to Israeli fans' locations Testimonies and forensic evidence collected by the Dutch police and Israeli security services, along with videos gathered by various security forces and intercepted messages from organizers of the pogrom against Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans in Amsterdam and provided to investigators show that the violence was premeditated and not spontaneous as initially believed. In addition, the attacks do not appear to be a response to provocations by Maccabi Tel Aviv fans as has been suggested in Dutch media. According to testimonies of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, they were escorted by police only as far as the train station after leaving the stadium at the end of their team's Europa League match against Ajax. However, they reported that no security had been present as they boarded trains and arrived at the city's central station. Upon leaving the station, a large mob was waiting for them in different locations around the city. The attackers had been equipped in advance with tools such as knives, clubs and brass knuckles, along with smoke grenades and firecrackers. According to the evidence, taxi and Uber drivers were active partners in the pogrom and shared the location of Israelis in internal group chats. The message conveyed to each of those rioters was clear: 'Attack anyone who speaks Hebrew, wears Jewish symbols or comes with a yellow-blue shirt (Maccabi's colors).' Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Ministry alerted Dutch police in advance of a planned pro-Palestinian protest outside the Johan Cruyff Arena, but Israeli fans weren’t informed of the potential danger. This lack of communication left them unprepared for the violence that followed, attributed partly to insufficient planning by Amsterdam’s police. The assailants, who refrained from using knives, reportedly aimed to inflict severe beatings on the fans as a show of solidarity with Gaza. Many recorded the assaults, allegedly to further humiliate their victims. Initial reports of missing fans mostly involved those who had hidden, returned late to their hotels or whose phones ran out of battery. In the first hours, the Shin Bet security agency offered to dispatch a special team to locate the missing fans, though it was ultimately deemed unnecessary.

Targeting the head of the octopus': The Israeli Air Force divisi...	Established in February to execute years of planning, the Air Force’s Iran Division stripped the Islamic Republic of its defenses; 'When you’re prepared, nothing surprises you,' officers say The Israeli Air Force established an Iran-focused operations department in February amid escalating tensions in the region, recognizing the need for dedicated planning and operational support against Iran. While Israel’s military has long monitored Iran through various branches, including intelligence and the Air Force, officials say recent months have underscored the need for a specialized unit as threats became more tangible. 'This initiative was born out of necessity,' said Capt. A., an officer in the new Iran Division who took part in the historic October 26 strike against Iran. Iran is considered part of Israel's 'third circle' of threats, characterized by its distance from Israel and its independence as a regional power, Capt. A explained. 'Iran is a sovereign power capable of operating independently, which makes it unique among our adversaries,' he added. Initially, the military’s focus at the onset of the current war was closer to home. But as fighting evolved, the northern front, including Iran and its proxies, came into focus, prompting the IDF to expand resources toward those areas. At the start of the war, Capt. A was assigned to the Gaza theater. Similarly, Capt. N., head of the Air Force’s intelligence deep-operations division, had also been focused on Gaza. Capt. N led the intelligence efforts supporting Israel’s air raid in Iran. Parallel to the operational department, the intelligence wing has a 'Depth Division,' tasked with monitoring the second and third threat circles. Intelligence-gathering agencies provide essential insights that inform Israel’s strategic assessments and operational readiness. 'This is a massive, coordinated effort,' said Capt. N., describing her role in directing the flow of intelligence to operational commanders. 'Our work supports Capt. A, who directs aircraft in real time.' Concern for peers in the air The night of the strike was unlike any other attack in Air Force history, yet it felt similar to training exercises. 'That’s the beauty of it,' says Capt. A. 'When you’re prepared, nothing surprises you.' Maj. A., head of strikes in the Iran Division, recalls that night in the command center: 'The only thing on your mind is carrying out the mission, hitting targets and bringing everyone back safely. Hours of planning all lead up to this moment. Those pilots out there are my brothers in arms. You hear your closest friends over the radio, and you just want them to do their job well and make it back home.' When does the tension finally lift? 'When the operation ends, the last pilot lands and everyone’s back safely,' says Capt. N. Maj. A. adds, 'You breathe half a sigh of relief when you know the strikes were successful. The second half is when everyone’s landed. In the shower, it hits you—the magnitude of what we did. You feel it wash over you.' How do you start planning a strike on Iran? 'By identifying the what, who and where alongside the how,' explains Capt. A. 'Refueling, for instance, is a basic skill for every fighter pilot. Ultimately, we can reach anywhere.' Capt. N. adds: 'It begins with setting targets and defining our objectives. Then we build a picture of what we want to achieve, bringing intelligence on targets to the initial planning process. The intel is highly focused, ensuring we’re hitting precisely the right targets, refining where we’re certain and where we’re not.' The outcomes aren’t always immediately clear. Iran initially denied that Israel had hit anything significant, later admitting minor damage. But over time, Israel’s success became apparent, and Iranian threats intensified. Tehran’s officials now warn of an 'appropriate' response in their own time. Capt. N. notes that some immediate feedback can indicate success, but building the full picture takes time. 'I believe we succeeded,' she says. With the division’s formation, some ask whether more operations like Days of Repentance will become routine. 'This is an active front, and it will remain so as long as there’s an Iranian threat,' says Maj. A. 'We’ve shifted the dynamics—Nasrallah’s no longer relevant. We’re in a different event,' Capt. A. says, 'and establishing an Iran Division is our statement.' The Iran front differs from the Yemen front, though the Iran Division oversees both. Could increased Houthi activity open the Yemeni front too? 'The division was founded on the need to engage with Iran and its proxies,' says Maj. A. 'The Houthi enemy is funded by Iran. We need to tackle the head of the octopus.' Concern for hostages in Gaza The Air Force’s Iran Division didn’t start its intelligence work from scratch; it had a solid foundation to build on. Yet, establishing a new office was essential, and setting it up was part of the process. Maj. A. describes the team that has taken shape: 'We have an incredible group here. The planners, intelligence officers and reservists all share one focus—the success of the mission.' There was a lot of chatter after the first wave of strikes, even while our planes were still in the air. Are you aware of that in real time? 'Nothing distracts us when our planes are out there,' says Capt. N. 'I felt completely focused on the objective.' Are we already preparing a response to the response to the response? 'We’re always ready,' says Capt. A. He believes the war is far from over. 'At least, that’s how I see it. It all begins and ends with the hostages. That’s our focus and our goal. When we reach the end of this, I think we’ll see changes across the region—and I expect this division will keep expanding.'

Trump's win may be a rejection of 'woke' ideology - here's why	Analysis: Some Trump voters were seeking a president who will let them 'unapologetically worship God' For the first time in three campaigns, U.S. President Donald Trump won the popular vote—a rare achievement for any Republican since 1988. What led to such a sweeping victory? Many of the American citizens who voted for Trump may not have been endorsing him personally; instead, their votes were perhaps a rejection of 'woke' ideology and the ultra-liberal values associated with Kamala Harris. This election was, for them, a vote to 'make America great again' by realigning the country with its foundational principles, rooted in faith and the motto 'In God We Trust.' Many people of faith viewed the presidential election as a spiritual battle between good and evil, with Trump's supporters seeking to restore Christian or conservative values to the country. As such, for some in this group, Trump's victory—and his survival of two assassination attempts—was seen as the fulfillment of God's will. In his victory speech, Trump told his supporters that he was reelected 'to save our country and to restore America to greatness. And now we are going to fulfill that mission together.' According to Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family, who spoke to the Washington Times, the election outcome 'confirms that American families are hungry to live in a nation where they can raise their children in an environment that is physically safe, economically viable, and where moms and dads and kids can unapologetically worship God.' What is woke? The term 'woke' began gaining popularity about fifteen years ago and has continued to evolve in meaning. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, in modern days, 'woke' figuratively refers to being 'aware' or 'well-informed' in a political or cultural sense. Originally, it signified support for pro-Black and pro-feminist causes and opposition to oppression—admirable qualities. However, in recent years, the term and the associated culture have shifted, increasingly embodying progressive extremism, cancel culture, and secularism. Today, 'wokeism' is related to ideas like sexual binarism, intersectionality and a strong anti-religion and state stance. Harris has advocated for 'staying woke.' Trump's win may suggest that the majority of Americans do not share that goal. Among Trump's supporters are 80% of white Evangelicals, nearly 70% of Latino Evangelicals, and more than 10% of Black Evangelicals. They seek a country that, in their view, embraces the Christian values upon which America was founded—even if some of these supporters are considered extreme in their own beliefs. 'I thank our Lord for having prevented the United States and the Western world from definitively falling into the tentacles of the deep state and globalist tyranny,' former Roman Catholic Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano wrote on X, urging Americans to pray that Trump resists 'the lobby of corrupt and perverted people.' Trump promised Christians they would have 'power at a level that you've never used before.' He vowed to crack down on the acceptance of transgender identities in schools and society and to stop the persecution of Christianity in America. Though Trump may not appear to be a conventional leader for a devout Christian community, many Evangelicals and others of faith have looked beyond his personal shortcomings. They believe God anointed him to serve in the White House—a belief that gained even more traction after he survived two assassination attempts. According to a CBS report analyzing voting percentages across various demographics, Trump gained approximately 30% of the vote in New York—outperforming every Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan 40 years ago. The report also noted Trump's increased support among young voters, including in Florida's Miami-Dade County, where he captured about 55% of the votes, becoming the first Republican to win there in 36 years. The Washington Post highlighted Trump's gains among non-Christian voters as well. In 2020, 29% of non-Christian people of faith voted for Trump, while 69% supported Biden. In 2024, Trump's share rose to 33%, with 60% voting for Harris, according to the Post. Among Jewish voters, about 66% voted for Harris, while 32% supported Trump, according to Fox News. However, in states like New York, he garnered as much as 50% of the Jewish vote, likely due to the higher proportion of Orthodox Jews compared to other parts of the country. Notably, the incoming president also secured 32% of the Muslim vote, matching his share among Jewish voters. Finally, Trump saw a rise in his share of the Catholic vote, with 56% voting for him this time compared to 47% in 2020, as reported by the Washington Post. The shift of younger people toward more conservative values is also evident in Israel. A poll released by the Israel Democracy Institute just before the U.S. election showed that among Israelis aged 18-34, an overwhelming majority believed Trump was better for Israel's interests than Harris, with 90% supporting Trump and only 2% favoring Harris. Several reports on Israel's judicial reform protests have shown that the attendees skewed older, suggesting that the older liberal left elite were more likely to oppose the reforms than younger generations. According to the IDI's latest Democracy Index, 73% of Jewish Israelis aged 18-24 identify as right-wing, compared to only 46% of Jewish Israelis over 65. According to polls, it was largely these young Jewish voters who helped elect Israel's most right-wing government to date in November 2022. The IDI noted that 'there is a significant overlap between religiosity and political orientation. In all religious groups, a majority define themselves as being on the right, with the exception of the secular group.' Since October 7, it is likely that this percentage has only grown. Whether Trump's promises and policies will ultimately fulfill his constituents' vision remains to be seen. Still, his victory should signal to American leaders a growing desire among young and faithful voters for a future more rooted in tradition and faith.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjbapl0zye	2024-11-10T00:17:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/15/r15pfn460/r15pfn460_0_0_1985_1361_0_small.jpg

D9 bulldozer shipment stalled by US embargo, leaving Israeli sold...	Security officials say over 100 new bulldozers ordered by Defense Ministry stuck in US amid growing contention over use to raze homes in Gaza; Washington approves purchase of additional APCs for IDF The partial U.S. arms embargo on Israel is affecting the battlefield in Gaza and Lebanon and could pose a risk to IDF soldiers. The U.S. is silently halting various arms shipments to the country but continues to support Israel in other ways, including a large-scale deal to acquire around 1,000 new APCs. New details reveal that an extensive shipment of 134 D9 bulldozers, which Israel ordered and paid for but are awaiting export approval from the U.S. State Department in Washington, according to two security sources who spoke with Ynet on condition of anonymity. The use of these bulldozers, primarily for flattening structures in the Gaza Strip, has led to significant internal criticism in the U.S., protests and intense pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, which has succumbed and frozen deliveries for several months. The impact on the battlefield is already apparent in both combat theaters: Ynet’s inquiry shows that many of the existing D9 bulldozers, heavily used in the IDF maneuver in Gaza for months require maintenance. Additionally, the IDF has been engaged in a new ground operation in southern Lebanon, where these bulldozers are also needed. 'At the height of the fighting in Gaza, about a year ago, battalion commanders were ‘fighting’ between them over D9 bulldozers; now they need maintenance,' say commanders leading the fighting in Gaza. The IDF struggled to directly link the deadly outcomes of the raid in Jabaliya — in which 21 soldiers were killed, many due to explosive devices — to the number of D9 bulldozers allocated for operations. 'The bulldozers in these operations often lead the brigade’s combat teams, clearing ‘contaminated’ areas from explosive charges intended to detonate against infantry and armor troops. However, it’s clear that these machines aren’t only operationally effective against terror tunnels and in urban areas but also help save soldiers’ lives. Forces on the northern front are required to clear thousands of acres of dense thicket, which Hezbollah uses to conceal bunkers and weapons depots close to Israeli towns while preparing to invade the Galilee. The scope of the deal is estimated at several billion shekels, with the vehicles’ armor intended to be manufactured in Israeli facilities. The halt to bulldozer deliveries will likely delay another significant operation by IDF Southern Command that remains incomplete: establishing a one-kilometer-wide buffer zone between the Gaza Strip and the western Negev, on the Gazan side of the border — involving the leveling of hundreds of Palestinian buildings and agricultural lands. A substantial portion of these buildings has already been razed to the ground, but the operation is still incomplete. The U.S. has vehemently opposed this action, mirroring its anger over the ongoing demolition of thousands of Palestinian structures in Gaza on a daily basis. 'The fact there are videos of American D9 bulldozers demolishing homes in Gaza isn’t helpful, but it’s a necessity,' IDF sources said. 'These homes are used by terrorists.' In addition to using bulldozers, the IDF employs several other alternatives, some of which are more costly. These include controlled blasts using thousands of tons of various explosives and targeted airstrikes to demolish buildings, though more sparingly. This restrained approach is due to the need to manage munitions as the fighting expands and persists across seven active fronts. Another reason lies in the fact that the U.S. is still freezing the shipment of around 1,300 munitions purchased by Israel from Boeing — paid in shekels rather than with U.S. aid funds — each weighing nearly a ton, citing similar concerns that the IDF could use them against civilian populations. Half of this shipment, which was frozen in May ago by the Biden administration, has been released and delivered to the IDF, but the other half remains in U.S. warehouses. Israel is also renting engineering equipment from private contractors to support field operations. The delay in delivering the bulldozers and heavy munitions adds to the cold shoulder Israel received from Washington regarding the purchase of Apache attack helicopters earlier this year. At first, the Americans rejected Israel’s urgent requests to supply the Air Force with high-maneuverability attack helicopters. Later, Washington also opposed diverting part of the hundreds of new helicopters ordered from Boeing for the U.S. Army to Israel, a measure sometimes customary in such cases. 'Not all U.S. defense officials are completely on our side. While the administration has significantly increased aid by billions of dollars, sending tens of thousands of munitions and various armaments to the IDF, they’re still giving us a ‘penalty’ in the form of these embargoes,' defense sources explained. 'There are officials in the U.S. State Department, the White House and Joint Chiefs of Staff who aren’t quick to approve every one of our requests, in addition to the similar aid the U.S. has pledged to provide Ukraine in its war with Russia,' the sources added. However, the IDF is encouraged by another significant purchase the Americans have approved for ground forces: a dramatic increase in the acquisition of JLTVs, or Joint Light Tactical Vehicles. Around 300 vehicles were ordered initially, dozens of which have already arrived for the IDF, but this has now been expanded to approximately 1,000 vehicles. These fast-wheeled armored personnel carriers will replace the older M-113 APCs and will likely be deployed beyond the exclusive use of elite units. These large JLTVs will be outfitted with 30 mm cannons and remotely operated machine guns, with the deal’s cost estimated to reach about NIS 4 billion (approximately $1.1 billion).

Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 32 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war in 2022, forcing flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports and injuring at least one person. Russian air defenses shot down 32 drones flying toward Moscow over the Ramenskoye and Kolomensky districts of the Moscow region, as well as in Domodedovo city, home to one of the city's biggest airports, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. He reported no major damage, though Russia's federal air transport agency said the airports of Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovo had diverted flights. The airports have since resumed their operations, Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said. Moscow and its surrounding region, with a population of at least 21 million people, is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Europe, alongside Istanbul.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h13negrwkl	2024-11-09T23:36:35-08:00

Coming here is like playing Russian roulette, but this is our he...	Eight farmers have lost their lives in recent weeks due to Hezbollah rocket fire, yet northern Israel’s farmers refuse to abandon their fields despite the heavy toll and lack of state support; 'Farmers are stubborn; we won’t be the ones to abandon our land' As olive harvest season begins, the Israeli olive oil industry faces significant challenges. Farmers in the north had hoped that by harvest time, the threat of cross-border fire from Lebanon would have receded, but that hasn’t happened. Harvest workers are forced to contend with ongoing risks in open fields, leaving many olives unpicked and at risk of becoming bitter and unusable. 'I know coming here is like playing Russian roulette, but what can I do? These are trees I planted in 1988—this is our heritage,' said Roni Bahmutski, who owns an olive grove near Metula on the Lebanese border. Last year, Bahmutski lost over 90% of his crop, unable to access his trees or hire workers to pick the fruit. This year, he’s gathering olives by himself, trying to salvage what he can. 'So far, the government hasn’t settled compensation for our 2023 losses. For some reason, olives were excluded from other fruit crop compensations,' he added, noting that aside from an advance payment covering part of his lost revenue, he has received no other support. Nearly 16 tons of olives went to waste. Tragedy struck last week when, just minutes after a heavy barrage on Metula, Bahmutski learned that his friend’s son, Omer Weinstein, had been killed with four workers in an apple orchard nearby. Despite the heartbreak and personal danger, Bahmutski continues working in his grove, even as he struggles to find laborers willing to help. 'When I heard Omer was gone, I cried like a child. He was family to us,' he shared. 'My home in Metula was hit too—windows and shutters shattered, the yard destroyed. We farmers risk our lives just stepping into our fields, but this is my livelihood and life’s work. My family and friends ask why I keep going, but I can’t let everything just fall apart.' Two weeks ago, eight farmers were killed while working in fields, orchards and groves unprotected from rocket fire out of Lebanon. Olive growers, too, have suffered: at a grove in Kibbutz Afek near Shefa-Amr, mother and son Mina and Karmi Hassan were killed. Just five days ago, teenager Sivan Sadeh lost his life while working in the broccoli fields near Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk, miles from the Lebanese border. 'When they report ‘strikes in open fields,’ they’re talking about our workplaces,' said Yossi Barash, owner of Barash Farm in Yesud Hama’ala. He acknowledges that, ideally, the Iron Dome air defense system would protect the entire country, even areas with minimal risk of casualties, though he understands this isn’t feasible. 'It feels like history is repeating itself,' he said—not nostalgically. 'Before the Six-Day War, farmers in Yesud HaMa’ala struggled to tend their fields due to Syrian shelling, and now we’re dealing with Hezbollah’s fire. Harvesting olives this year has been even harder than last year. When the war began, volunteers from pre-military programs and various organizations came to help, but now they aren’t allowed to come under Home Front Command orders.' Despite the challenges, Barash is determined to hand-pick every last olive himself, with a few foreign workers by his side. 'My ancestors dried out swamps here and fought malaria. Farmers are stubborn and resilient. We won’t be the ones to abandon our land or forsake agriculture.' Their dedication to the land may be hard for outsiders to understand, but farmers explain that it’s driven by Zionism—and, of course, the need to make a living. Eyal Ovadia, chair of the Banana Growers Council and CEO of Western Galilee Banana Growers, noted that 'since October 7, Israeli farmers have been forced to work under rocket threats, with only limited access to their crops, some of them evacuated and often without any shelter at all.' He sees farmers as 'the first line of defense in the battle for food security, paying with their lives so that Israeli citizens can continue to have a steady supply of fresh food.' Ovadia added that the eight farmers killed across the Galilee in one week 'were following the guidelines—when the sirens go off, they lie on the ground, hands on their heads and pray. I send my deepest condolences to all the families, and I hope that Sivan Sadeh will be the last victim.' Despite the sacrifices and constant danger, Ovadia hopes the public will show their appreciation, 'We’re coping with an almost impossible reality, and the fire only intensifies. The public needs to support us by buying more locally grown produce.'

Trump says Haley, Pompeo will not join second administration	US president-elect actively meeting with candidates for key positions, preparing for January inauguration, with former CIA director Pompeo and ex-UN Ambassador Haley now confirmed not to be part of new lineup U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. 'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' Trump posted on social media. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our country.' Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his Jan. 20 inauguration as president. Reuters reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee. Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries. 'I was proud to work with President Trump defending America at the United Nations,' Haley said on social media. 'I wish him, and all who serve, great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America over the next four years.' Pompeo, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Trump, has been mentioned in some media reports as a possible defense secretary and had been also seen as a potential Republican presidential candidate, before he announced in April 2023 that he would not run. Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday. During his first term as president, Trump made some key personnel announcements via social media posts. Separately, Trump said the 2025 presidential inauguration will be co-chaired by real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff and former Senator Kelly Loeffler.

Chances of settlement in Lebanon rising as Trump gets involved, o...	Political officials confirm there is 'progress'; Families of Gaza hostages head to Washington amid efforts to bring about a 'small deal'; In 1st, Netanyahu not invited to Jewish Federations of North America Families of hostages in Gaza set off to Washington overnight, where they are expected to meet with senior officials regarding the promotion of a deal in the near term, before a new U.S. government takes over in January. The families are set to meet with senior White House officials, alongside a series of meetings with Republican senators. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump sent a message to the administration of outgoing President Joe Biden, calling for progress to be made toward a settlement of the violence in the north, and U.S. officials claim, according to one, that 'the chances of settlement in Lebanon under (Biden envoy Amos) Hochstein's leadership - and with Trump's encouragement - are increasing.' Officials also claim that there is great effort going into arranging a 'small hostage deal.' Another report indicates that the Qatari announcement that it would suspend its mediation between Israel and Hamas is intended to 'increase the pressure on Hamas.' Qatar wants to clear the table before Trump arrives in order to correct the impression that it did not really exert pressure on Hamas, according to sources. In addition, the sources said that 'the chance that the Biden administration will impose an arms embargo on Israel in the remaining time is low.' The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar announced Saturday night that mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas are frozen, but noted that 'the reports about their permanent cessation are not accurate.' Earlier, Israel had reservations about news agency reports about the end of the mediation and claimed that 'the decision is reversible.' 'Qatar will renew its efforts with its partners when there is the necessary seriousness to end the war. In that case, all efforts will be made to end the war and return the hostages.' Qatar's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A security source said that Israel 'received an indication' that Qatar was about to expel the Hamas leadership. 'It seems that the Qataris are terrified of Trump. They understand that he will change the American direction toward them. They understand that they support terrorism. The Qataris are very afraid and want to look like good kids,' said the source. Hamas has denied the claims, and a source close to one of the senior members of the terrorist organization told Ynet that Qatar made the move in response to 'massive pressure from the US.' Is the U.S. Jewish community moving away from Netanyahu? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not invited to speak at the annual conference of the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) for the first time since taking office. The conference, which is being held Sunday in Washington, is one of the main events of the organized U.S. Jewish community. The move indicates the growing division around Netanyahu is also occurring among Jewish organizations in the U.S. In addition, several left-wing Jewish organizations announced that they would boycott this year's conference on the grounds that their participation might be interpreted as an expression of support for the current government's policies in Israel. Among the organizations are the American branch of Peace Now, the Habonim Dror North America, J Street and the New Israel Fund. Instead of Netanyahu, Israel will be represented at the conference by President Isaac Herzog.

The four sins: What drives Israelis to spy for Iran?	In recent months, several Israeli citizens, mostly Jewish, were arrested and charged with contacting Iranian operatives; some were allegedly recruited for sabotage and assassination attempts; investigations aim to uncover what leads Israelis to become agents for their enemy, and it's not just money Natalia started getting worried when she hadn’t heard from her husband Moti for a whole day. All she knew was that he was away on a business trip in Turkey somewhere near the Iranian border and that he wasn’t answering his phone. 'Moti hasn’t been answering for a whole day. He’s not online,' she wrote to a friend who called her to try to calm her down. Natalia updated her friend on the afternoon of Sunday, August 25, 'I’ve found him. He left his phone and went to the border for three days. He’ll only be back at the hotel tomorrow. Such an adventurer.' According to the indictment, however, this 'adventure' of Moti Maman’s involved entering Iran twice and meetings with Iranian intelligence personnel in which they discussed missions to be carried out in Israel, including assassinating Israeli leaders. Maman is a 72-year-old pensioner living with his wife in Ashkelon. He’s originally from Bustan Hagalil where he owns holiday chalets and rental warehouses. Investigations reveal that he had fallen into debt resulting in loans he’d given out, and that he was having trouble providing his new 39-year-old wife Natalia from Belarus with her desired lifestyle of hotels, restaurants and vacations. He'd spent several years living in Turkey’s Samandağ municipality where his interrogators say he was working in the fruit and vegetable trade. This is where he met the Turkish Aslan family, including Andrey and Junayd, with whom he became good friends. In light of his financial situation, in April of this year, he asked them if they had any business ventures to offer him. They invited him to come to Turkey to meet an Iranian tycoon known as Adi. In April, Maman flew to Turkey where he spent a few days with Natalia. Adi, however, didn’t show up. Maman and his wife returned to Cyprus en route to Belarus where Natalia was living at the time. He then received a call from Adi. Adi said to him 'Hi. I’m so sorry. I tried getting to Hatay (district in southern Turkey bordering Syria), but my people in Turkey told me it wasn’t safe. So, come meet my people here. It’s very important. After we meet, we’ll be able to start off big, I promise. No problem. You show up, have the meeting and leave.' Maman responded, 'I believe you. Give me a day or two. I’ll be there.' Maman left Natalia, who traveled alone to Belarus, and he traveled to Turkey. His hosts picked him up and took him to a five-star hotel in a village near the Turkey-Iran border. Adi then, however, informed him that legal restrictions meant he couldn’t leave Iran and that the solution would be for Maman to come to him, inside Iran and that Adi would arrange the entry. So, after a hold-up of several hours at the border, Maman and his entourage entered Iranian territory where they met Adi and another man known as Hajja. The two took Maman to a fancy villa and then to an upmarket hotel, both of which Adi claimed to own. At some stage, Adi asked whether Maman would be willing to carry out missions for the Iranian regime. According to his lawyer, Eyal Besserglick, Maman initially believed this to be a legitimate business meeting. There, in enemy territory, however, he didn’t want to rock the boat and agreed to hear the offer. The investigation reveals that Adi suggested a few 'easy' missions including depositing money and weapons at predetermined locations to be collected by a third party, photographing crowded locations in Israel and making threats against Israeli Arabs opposing the Iranian regime. Maman told them he’d check and get back to them. Late that evening, Maman hid inside a truck and crossed back across the border back into Turkey. He was given $1,300 for the trip. Maman then flew to Belarus and returned to Israel with his wife Natalia. He didn’t report either his visit to Iran or the espionage proposal to Israeli authorities. Why didn’t he report his visit to Iran? Maman’s lawyer, Eyal Besserglick: 'Maman was told that they’d just be doing business. At the meeting, he found himself in an unimaginably difficult situation, fearing for his life. He nevertheless agreed to discuss the missions proposed to him. For decades, he aided the Mossad and Israeli defense authorities and has the evidence to prove it – but he was shunned by them when he needed their help. Having lost faith in the authorities, he didn’t contact them on his own initiative.' According to the indictment, Maman continued conducting conversations with his Turkish friend Andrey and talked to him about the possibilities of business with Adi. Three months later, he asked his wife Natalia to order plane tickets to the Turkish city of Van adjacent to the Iranian border. Natalia wasn’t enthralled by the idea: Interrogators: Why didn’t you want him to fly to Van? What’s dangerous about it? Natalia: 'I thought he was doing business by the Iranian border and that it was illegal because it’s connected to Iran, a country that’s Israel’s enemy. I was afraid he’d be arrested or that they’d kill him.' Interrogators: If you understood how problematic it was to wander around there, why did you buy him the tickets? Natalia: 'What, am I his boss? Moti is very stubborn and I did what he asked me to do. He’s my husband.' On Friday, August 23, Maman once again returned to the hotel in the Turkish village near the Iranian border. Natalia wrote to him 'Shabbat Shalom my dearest husband. Lotz of luck tomorrow.' Maman responded 'Lots.' Natalia responded 'Amen.' Early the following morning, Maman got into the back of a truck and lay down on a 'bed.' Why did he agree to go to Iran again? 'Money blinds the discerning and perverts the words of the righteous,' Maman told Supt. Maor Goren in the interrogation. 'I’m under a lot of pressure. I’m dying to settle a few of my debts.' Two Iranian intelligence personnel were waiting for him in Adi’s villa. This time, the proposals were much more targeted: Killing key figures in Israel, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The four sins Maman isn’t alone. In recent months, no less than seven separate incidents of Israelis communicating with foreign agents operated by Iran have been made public. So far, 20 people have been charged, 14 with the most severe clauses on Israel’s law books: Aiding the enemy at times of war - a crime punishable by life sentence or execution. Over the past weeks, we’ve looked into these cases and talked to interrogators, experts, prosecutors and defense attorneys. We asked them the most important questions: What motivates Israelis, almost all of whom hold blue ID cards, mainly Jewish, to make contact with Israel’s bitterest enemy, and in the worst cases, become agents in their service? 'Firstly – money,' said Supt. Goren, a security division commander at Israel’s Unit of International Crime Investigations at Lahav 443 in charge of these investigations. 'Some are people who don’t care about the country so much, people with no sense of affiliation or commitment to the state.' Money is indeed an important and the chief motive for most of the accused – but certainly not the only one. 'The CIA conducted a 12-year study of dozens of traitors,' says Dr. Ilan Diamant, clinical psychologist and defense establishment alumnus. 'They found four basic motives for treason: Money, deterioration, ego and ideology.' These are the four sins likely to lead a person to commit treason against their country. In many cases it’s not just one single 'sin,' but rather the four sins interconnecting: monetary temptation can meet ideological justification. A sophisticated handler can stage by stage, exploit a spy’s ego to cause him to deteriorate to carry out evermore serious actions. 'The CIA says that there are no happy traitors. For all of them, it’s a solution to historic emotional problems,' says Dr. Diamant who, with organizational psychologist Shlomo Peled, former commander of one of the defense organizations, recently published 'Treason in the Kingdom of Secrets: A Journey into the Psyches of Spies Who Betrayed Their Country' (Matar Press). Diamant: 'Without knowing the accused parties, you can’t really diagnose them, but based on the indictments, one can give a general estimate based on our professional knowledge of at-risk groups.' Who are the people usually in these at-risk groups? 'People who reach a point of despair, with a background of personality and family problems. They’re generally impulsive and not fully mature. Easy money is a big temptation for them, and they don’t factor in what it all means. Some are addicted to breaching trust, their basis being lies and deception. In terms of ego, many are narcissists, with an incessant need for attention and whose self-esteem demands external affirmation – which this kind of activity provides. ‘I’m worth something. I’m of value. They need me’.' Those committing these 'four sins' of money, deterioration, ego and ideology may one day find themselves in handcuffs in a Shin Bet or a police interrogation room facing serious charges. This has been the fate of 20 Israelis accused in recent months of communicating with a foreign agent – or of actually working for the Islamic Republic of Iran. First sin: Money The first sin, money, was certainly a central component in Moti Maman’s motives. When he got to his second visit to Iran beyond the border in that concealed compartment in the truck, the Iranian businessman Adi was waiting for him along with Hajja, who seemed to hold some kind of security position. According to investigation material, they got into a brand-new Suzuki jeep and set off. While driving, Adi chatted to Maman in English about business plans and working for his country. The meeting’s subject matter was not concealed. Adi said that two intelligence personnel would be coming to the villa to meet Maman, with an 'open check' for operations in revenge for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil. Maman agreed to discuss the mission, but laid down certain conditions for each operation: $1 million upfront. At the villa, Maman was welcomed with a fancy banquet. Half an hour later, the two arrived. 'One with a wig, the other with a briefcase,' Maman told his interrogators. Adi translated to and from English and Persian. The agent with the wig was particularly knowledgeable and even spoke a little Hebrew. The conversation quickly got to the point. Maman said, 'I first want a million dollars.' The agents talked of lower figures, of a few hundred thousand dollars, for a shooting. As candidates, the Iranians offered: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Maman, however, said that the security around these individuals was too high. At this point, the agent with the wig asked him. 'Do you know what’s in Ra’anana?' meaning the home of former prime minister Naftali Bennet. 'I know what’s in Ra’anana,' replied Maman. 'He’s former, so his security has to be lower,' said the Iranian. Negotiations carried on into the evening, but Maman refused to operate for less than $1 million. The meeting wrapped up with no agreement. We’ll soon get back to that meeting and what happened next. The 'first sin,' money, was apparently the primary motive in the case of 35-year-old Vladimir Verhovsky who made Aliyah from Ukraine eight years ago, and has since managed to get involved in criminal activity and has been sentenced to community service. His financial situation wasn’t promising, so when 'Eli' contacted him by Telegram presenting himself as an Israeli living in Canada, he was quickly tempted to carry out missions in exchange for money transferred to him in digital currency. It started with spray-painting graffiti in Tel Aviv reading things like 'Netanyahu=Hitler.' Verhovsky was asked to photograph demonstrators in Tel Aviv in an effort to recruit them. As the Iranians saw Verhovsky cooperating, they stepped up a gear. According to the indictment, Verhovsky was asked to collect a gun from a hiding place and, with it, murder an Israeli scientist for $100,000, and that he would be spirited away to Russia. Verhovsky reached the Tel Aviv address he had been given and started looking for the scientist. Investigation materials reveal that he asked people, showed them a picture and knocked on the scientist’s door - but couldn’t find him. The Iranian handlers, who had meanwhile recruited several networks inside Israel, assigned intelligence gathering to another cell. 'The cells are isolated from one another, each acting separately,' says Supt. Goren. 'But sometimes, missions overlap and they’ll ask someone to hide petrol or equipment for someone else.' In Verhovsky’s case, he was told that there was another cell that would prepare the mission for hi, and asked him to pick up the gun and wait for instructions. He went to pick up the gun that had been hidden for him in a field in Modi'in. 'Wait a moment,' he told the taxi driver and came back a few minutes later with a bag containing a gun, a magazine and 15 bullets. Upon returning home that day, he was arrested by the Shin Bet. The Public Defender’s Office representing Verhovsky has not responded. Money was the central component in the case of 30-year-old Vladislav (Vlad) Victorsson from Ramat Gan, formerly convicted of sexual offenses involving minors and who was also recruited over Telegram. An Iranian handler calling himself Mari Hossi contacted him offering him several operations and Victorsson agreed. He brought his 18-year-old partner on board and, according to the indictment, set out on his first operation in September. This involved setting cars on fire for $500 each and leaving anti-Netanyahu fliers at the scene. He was then asked to murder someone for $100,000 and was promised that he and his partner would be smuggled to Russia. Victorsson started trying to get hold of a gun, but the two were arrested the following day. The Public Defender’s Office representing Victorsson has not responded. 'The moment an individual with low self-esteem has a secret, that self-esteem suddenly shoots up,' says Peled. 'A person who sees themselves as a doormat is suddenly playing in the big leagues. He’s a player between states. The recruiters know all about this need, and employ a method known as ‘deterioration.'' Second sin: Deterioration This is a time-honored method used to handle agents. The idea is to initially give the agent small, simple, invariably worthless missions to carry out. 'These are all kinds of minor missions that don’t necessarily need to be conducted for operational purposes,' explains Diamant. 'But they’re designed to test the object’s capabilities, consequently reinforcing the manly side and deconstructing caution and braking mechanisms.' Elimelech Stern, a 22-year-old Vishnitz Hassid from Bet Shemesh, is possibly the furthest thing from a person who might be involved in espionage. According to the indictment against him, his deterioration was almost a textbook case. It started with a mission of putting up posters in the street of bloodstained hands calling to protest the killing of children, reading 'Let’s stand on the right side of history.' Stern did it, his lawyer claims, without knowing that he was dealing with an Iranian agent. After making it through this stage, Stern was assigned a larger mission: setting fire to a forest next to Jerusalem’s Valley of the Holy Cross. 'They’ve elevated my rank to that of a fully-fledged member,' he wrote to Yonatan, the man for whom he put up the posters. 'I’m talking straight to the boss,' Yonatan replied. Stern later added, 'I just don’t understand why they’re doing this.' Yonatan responded 'Because they’re anti-Israel. Clearly.' Stern, apparently regarding himself as having stepped up a rank, himself became a handler and recruited Netanel, who he found in a jobseekers’ Telegram group. 'There’s now a mission to set off a fire, and that’s a bit scary. You need a lot of courage.' Netanel avoided carrying out the mission, and Stern also ultimately refused. He also didn’t carry out more serious missions for fear of being caught and made do with picking up a secure cellphone and burying money via his operatives. Stern’s lawyer, Adv. Akiva Meir, claims there to be no connection between his client and the other incidents. 'Stern didn’t know he who was dealing with, innocently believing this to be some kind of left-wing anarchist wanting to make their voice heard. Stern refused to carry out any mission that is forbidden, or that he regarded as unethical. He wasn’t aware that he was part of widescale Iranian recruitment efforts.' Moti Maman, on the other hand, understood exactly what his handler wanted of him, but claimed in his interrogation that he didn’t intend to do anything, just take the money and disappear. The Iranian agents, however, were sure to convey a veiled message. According to the indictment, following the meeting at the villa in which he demanded $1 million upfront prior to the operation, he stayed the night at the fancy hotel, returning the next day to the villa. In this meeting, the Iranians once again proposed a series of possible missions, including assassinations of Israeli Arabs who had received money from Iran, and who had not carried out the missions. Diamant says, 'When agents talk about assassinating Arabs, what they’re doing is sending a warning message: Look what happens to those who don’t cooperate with us.' Peled explains that this is also part of the deterioration method. 'This is how they push you further and further down into the tunnel. You have no way out. You’ll either fall into Iranian hands or get caught by the Shin Bet.' In Maman’s case, it was the latter. He received €5,000 for the meeting, came back to Israel and was then arrested here. Adv. Besserglick, why did he reenter Iran? 'The second time, he was supposed to meet a businessman about fruit, vegetable and spice ventures in Turkey. He waited there for two days. This time, the contact misled him, telling him he couldn’t get to Turkey, and so found himself again at a meeting point across the border. He certainly made an error of judgment in agreeing to the new meeting point across the border. He couldn’t have expected, or known, that they would ask him to do things to which he wouldn’t agree or that the individuals brought to the meeting would be there. The indictment states otherwise. Following his arrest, Maman cooperated completely with security authorities and this cooperation has helped security authorities.' Third sin: Ego Ego is possibly the most complex of them all. There are people who, after years of mundane and tiresome lives in low-level jobs, are offered the chance of becoming an agent and, all of a sudden, they finally feel important. Some people’s egos are nourished by the 'mind games' with their handlers. Eden Debs, a 30-year-old psychology student from Ramat Gan, played a double-edged game with his Iranian handlers for the duration of most of their communication. He was contacted over Telegram by an Iranian handler offering him the chance to make money by putting up posters in the street. This is known in the Shin Bet as 'Spray and Pray'. A huge number of messages are sent out to Israelis across social media, hoping that as many as possible will respond. 'In most cases, it’s a general message like 'Cast your bread upon the waters,' says Adi Carmi, senior Shin Bet official. 'There are links on websites and bots on social media generating temptations, such as making easy money. As soon as the connection is made, the Iranian handler is activated and he starts developing the relationship.' According to the indictment, following negotiations regarding the payment amount, 50 posters for NIS 2,500, Debs put up posters, took pictures and sent the photographs to his handlers, and then took them down. He referred the Iranian handler to another Telegram account with lots of members, that he also owns, i.e., the other profile was also run by Debs. 'These manipulations provide the operative further justification for his action - as if he’s not committing treason, but rather making fun of the handler,' says Diamant. 'It also reinforces his ego. He says to himself, ‘You think you’re handling me, but actually, I’m playing you.' As soon as the stops are gone and you’re in the process of treason, you’ve no way out.' According to the incitement, the Iranian agent recognized Deb’s capabilities and asked him to add fake followers to his 'The People’s Army' Telegram group to be used for recruiting further agents. Debs complied, adding a further 2,000 followers to the group, providing greater exposure. Iranian agents posted messages along the lines of 'Military coup is the only way to save the country. Join us before it’s too late. Message us if you want to cooperate with us and make some money.' Debs received $150 in digital currency. The Iranians got a group that thousands of potential recruits could join. But Deb’s games with the Iranians didn’t end there. At some stage, he was asked to make threats against a senior defense official. The mission was to decapitate a doll of a sheep, paint it red and place it in a box beside a knife outside the home of the defense official. Debs asked his mother to buy a toy sheep. He removed the head and placed it in a box outside his father’s home and sent a video of it to the handler as if it was outside the home of the defense official. 'This sense of adventure obscures what lies beneath, be it despair, pessimism, loneliness or depression,' says Diamant. 'When they’re performing missions, they less feel everything that’s bothering them, and get a different sensation – one of competence and self-esteem.' When asked to set a car on fire, Debs downloaded from the Internet a video clip of a car on fire and sent it to his handler. He turned down more complex missions that were hard to fake. According to the indictment, he received $12,000 and quite a bit of action. 'This sense of adventure obscures what lies beneath, be it despair, pessimism, loneliness or depression,' says Diamant. 'When they’re performing missions, they less feel everything that’s bothering them, and get a different sensation – one of competence and self-esteem.' Debs isn’t represented by an attorney at this stage. At the time of his arrest, his then-attorney claimed, 'The accused, in fact, deceived the foreign agent, defrauded him to get money out of him for being Iranian. When the court is exposed to all the evidence, like myself, it will understand that a mountain has been made out of a molehill.' Moti Maman’s interrogation reveals that, for him too, ego played no small part and that his handler seems to have recognized this. At the end of the second meeting in the villa in Iran, as mentioned, a night in Adi’s hotel was ordered for him where he was allotted an entire floor complete with waiters and staff serving his every desire. 'These displays constitute a very important component for the ego,' says Diamant. 'He was given respect. They were showing him that he could trust them.' When arrested upon his return to Israel, his ego crashed into reality. 'Do you know who we are?' Shin Bet personnel asked him at Ben Gurion Airport. 'I don’t give a f**k who you are,' replied Maman. As mentioned, in his interrogation, Maman claimed to have acted for the Mossad in the past, and so derided the Shin Bet personnel arresting him. 'The whites have ruined the country,' he said. 'For the Shin Bet, arresting someone like me on the right side of the political map, who’s contributed to the country’s security their whole life rather than arresting traitors like Ami Ayalon, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, is more important.' His attorney, Besserglick claims that he has in his possession proof that he had aided Israeli state security. We asked Supt. Goren about Maman’s security history. 'BS,' he says. 'It’s been checked out and dismissed.' In the Lahav 433 interrogation cell, Supt. Goren asked him what would have happened had he really received the $1 million from the Iranians. 'I don’t know what would have happened if they’d have given me the money. A million bucks. What would you do?' replied Maman. 'We’re only human.' Fourth sin: Ideology Ideology is among the world’s greatest motives for recruiting agents. An agent sharing the same ideology as his handler will need much less coaxing. Ideology was a dominant component in the case of the most recent network caught. Seven members of a cell from East Jerusalem’s Bet Zafafa - six of whom are Israeli citizens - were recently indicted. According to the indictment, 23-year-old cell leader Rami Alian was contacted via Telegram by a profile named The Timon. Here too, initial missions included putting up protest posters and spray-painting graffiti. The deterioration, however, was quick. Alian, it’s claimed, recruited a friend from the neighborhood and, together, they set cars on fire for NIS 4,000 ($1080) in digital currency. After carrying out this mission, the handler presented himself to Alian as a 38-year-old Shi’ite Muslim working for the Iranian Intelligence Ministry. Alian shared these details with his friends, adding that the great goal toward which they would be assisting was the destruction of the State of Israel. With ideological persuasion of the mission’s virtue, the Iranian handler proposed the next stage of assassinating a 'nuclear scientist at the Weizmann Institute' for NIS 200,000 ($54,000). Alian procured a Glock pistol and started checking out the addresses his Iranian handler had given him. The scientist apparently lived at one of the addresses. He brought more friends on board and built up a cell that went to the Weizmann Institute at midnight but was stopped by security. The group later found the scientist’s home, took photos and sent them to the Iranian handler. According to the indictment, Alian thought the pistol wasn’t the right weapon for the job, so paid a weapons dealer NIS 13,500 ($3,645) for a bomb. At this stage, Alian was arrested by the Shin Bet along with the entire cell. The Public Defenders Office has not responded. Lack of ideology can also play a part in the recruitment of agents. The Shin Bet describes it as 'low attachment to the state.' Apparently, this is what helped the Iranians recruit their most effective network so far of Haifa and Nof Hagalil residents, including two minors, all immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Over a two-year period, they carried out over 600 missions inside Israel. Their handlers equipped the cell with maps of military bases and infrastructure facilities and trained them how to gather intelligence without getting caught. Their target banks included military bases and infrastructure facilities that were targets for the Iranian missile attacks. According to the indictment, following the Iranian attack in April, the cell members were even sent to inspect the damage the missiles had caused at IAF bases. The cell was headed by 43-year-old Aziz Nisanov from Haifa who had made Aliyah from Azerbaijan in the 1990s. Aziz worked unloading containers at ports, but the company closed down two years ago and he ran into financial difficulties. In his time of need, he contacted a friend living in Azerbaijan, Iran’s northern neighbor. According to the investigation, Aziz’s Azerbaijani friend put him in touch with an individual named Elkhan Agayev, who was in contact with Iran and could help provide him with financial assistance in exchange for carrying out missions. Nisanov accepted the offer. As the relationship took shape, Nisanov recruited, to the ever-increasing missions, acquaintances also originally from the Soviet Union. Apparently, unlike most Olim from the Soviet Union, this group had not integrated into Israeli society and had kept themselves separate. At this stage, communication was transferred directly to Elkhan and the man presenting himself as his Iranian commander, a handler known as 'Orkhan.' 'In this case,' says Supt. Goren, 'the handler mapped out Israel’s military and strategic installations from north to south, and transferred them to the target bank via an encrypted app. They gave a nickname to each target, and would move over to a different encrypted app to run these missions.' What were the missions? 'Taking stills photos and videos, giving precise GPS locations, filming routine and security arrangements (at sensitive sites).' And did they manage to reach all these strategic points? 'They didn’t get inside any facility. But they found good vantage points – very tall buildings or adjacent hills - from which they filmed. They were asked to purchase appropriate equipment such as mobile phones, laptops, cameras, tripods, etc. They were even asked to buy a jeep and took an offroad driving course to get to various locations in the north and south that are hard to reach.' 'They got lots of attention from their handlers,' says a State Attorney source. 'It reinforced their self-esteem to the point that they suggested missions themselves.' According to a defense establishment official, during one of their tours in the north, they encountered the IDF’s Sky Dew observation balloon. Without knowing what this balloon does exactly, they filmed it and sent it to the Iranians. Last May, the balloon was attacked by Hezbollah. Last April, the Iranians tried sending this cell to carry out an assignment. The target was a female scientist dealing with the Iranian issue. Orkhan sent Nisanov her picture and asked him to find out details about her. Nisanov went to the university where she taught but was stopped at the gate by security. Oh, and it’s been a decade since the scientist herself taught at this university. It's unclear how much intelligence damage has been caused by the cell. Some of the material they filmed is freely available to anyone with Internet access. 'But,' they say at the State Attorney’s office, 'they also took pictures of flight training and aircraft armament at a proximity no Iranian could reach.' The Public Defender's Office, representing Nisanov has not responded. Shlomo Peled, the picture of the accused in all shades – Haredi, a young secular guy, a pensioner, Israeli Arabs, Olim from the former Soviet Union – raises the possibility that anyone could actually be a spy. Peled: 'No. We’re actually saying the very opposite. Let’s not get too paranoid. Spies and traitors are people in certain at-risk groups, and most people aren’t there. Iranian motivation has now met technology allowing them to easily reach lots of people. So yes, we shouldn’t ignore it, and definitely not sweep under the rug or hide it. On the other hand, we don’t need to build it up. It’s not COVID and there’s no pandemic.'

Israel pushes back on reports of Qatar halting Hamas mediation	Qatar reportedly orders Hamas to close offices, but Hamas insider says unclear if leaders will be expelled; Israeli officials call Doha’s decision to halt mediation 'reversible'; diplomatic sources say Qatar will only engage if talks become serious Israeli officials on Saturday downplayed reports from major international news agencies that Qatar has ceased its mediation between Israel and Hamas, asserting that the decision is 'reversible.' Diplomats cited in the reports said Doha had decided to suspend its mediation role until both parties 'demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table.' However, Israeli sources confirmed that senior officials had been informed of Qatar’s move, reportedly driven by U.S. pressure, to demand that senior Hamas figures leave the country. Qatar has served as a mediator in indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, alongside Egypt and the United States, for the past 13 months. Hamas officials, speaking to Arab media and AFP, denied they had been ordered to leave Qatar but acknowledged that their offices may soon be shut down. For now, Hamas operations are set to continue from Doha, though senior Hamas officials reportedly received a message indicating their office closures were imminent. An insider close to a senior Hamas leader told Ynet that 'the decision by Qatar came under massive pressure from the U.S.' Israel welcomed Qatar’s decision to expel Hamas leaders, a long-sought goal by both Jerusalem and Washington. 'Hamas is a murderous terrorist organization that should be pursued worldwide, not offered sanctuary in any country,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that Qatar’s expulsion of Hamas leaders logically diminishes its role as mediator. 'Once they expel Hamas leaders, there is no further advantage in Qatar’s mediation.' A government source further remarked that 'all parties now recognize that key decisions in negotiations lie with Israel and Hamas, not with mediators, so the impact is limited.' The official noted that, despite Qatar’s mediation attempts, no agreements had been reached. He added that Hamas leaders had enjoyed 'luxury hotels while continuing to orchestrate terror within an axis that includes Iran and Hezbollah.'

Israel says Amsterdam violence calmed, advises ongoing vigilance	National Security Council says violence following Maccabi Tel Aviv's match in Amsterdam has subsided; Netherlands remains under Level 2 advisory, urging Israelis to exercise caution, avoid visible Israeli symbols and stay vigilant The National Security Council (NSC) updated its travel advisory on Saturday, saying that security officials now assess the wave of violence that followed Thursday’s Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer match in Amsterdam has subsided. 'There is no reason to prevent Israelis from moving around the city,' according to a statement. However, the NSC cautioned that the Netherlands remains under a Level 2 travel advisory, recommending Israelis exercise heightened caution, minimize visible Israeli symbols and stay vigilant for any unusual events amid ongoing sensitivities in Amsterdam. The NSC advised Israeli travelers to contact local security forces immediately in the event of any incident and to also notify the NSC’s travel advisory center at +972-2-6667444. In Amsterdam, local authorities have imposed fines for public disorder on 40 suspects, 10 of whom face further charges, including vandalism. Judges are examining whether the violence was premeditated, with court officials saying, 'more arrests are expected.' The violence erupted after Maccabi Tel Aviv’s Europa League match against Ajax, when pro-Palestinian groups targeted Israeli fans near the Johan Cruyff Arena, attacking dozens of fans in what was described as one of Amsterdam's most violent nights in recent memory. Video footage circulating online showed attackers checking passports, physically assaulting those they identified as Israeli and threatening fans until they repeated 'Free Palestine.' Amsterdam police arrested 62 people suspected of assault during attempts to restore order, with four remaining in custody on public violence charges. Police later identified a 26-year-old suspect from security footage, who was arrested on Friday. A police spokesperson told the New York Times that the release of some does not mean they are no longer suspects, and additional arrests may follow, adding that charges have yet to be filed. Official reports indicate five Israelis were hospitalized after the attacks but were later discharged. Another 20 suffered minor injuries, with eight receiving treatment at Sheba Medical Center in Israel upon their return and subsequently being released.

Cell towers and water lines: A closer look at Israel’s expanding ...	As military focus shifts to Lebanon, the Netzarim Corridor has quietly expanded into a 22 square-mile Israeli enclave, lined with IDF posts and flags, echoing Gaza’s pre-2005 configuration Along the Netzarim Corridor, Israeli flags line a central road extending westward to a large military outpost on the Mediterranean coast, south of Gaza’s Sheikh Ijlin district. The IDF has transformed this outpost into a fully operational base with temporary detention facilities, interrogation rooms and permanent quarters for a brigade command and combat units. Trenches are being dug around the complex to fortify it as construction crews and engineering officers work to complete the fortifications. The critical part of this base lies between it and the coast: an advanced coastal checkpoint through which, the military hopes, a large portion of the Palestinian population will soon pass southward within Gaza as pressure mounts on the Jabaliya area. This base is part of Israel's expanding hold in Gaza, marking a significant phase in the ongoing ground campaign. The Netzarim corridor is currently held by two combined IDF reserve brigades, supporting both infantry and armor divisions. These units differ from the regular defensive brigades stationed along Gaza’s southern border in Israel’s western Negev, where Hamas terrorists launched their deadly October 7 attack. The current brigades resemble those that once maintained Israel’s hold over Gaza before the 2005 disengagement. Further south, another brigade holds the Philadelphi Corridor between Rafah and the Sinai, a strip Israel captured in May. Over recent months, the Netzarim corridor has expanded to cover approximately 56 square kilometers (22 square miles), forming an Israeli military enclave at the heart of northern Gaza. Stretched along an eight-kilometer (five-mile) axis from the Be'eri region to the sea, this corridor is the result of the IDF 36th Division’s ground incursion a year ago to secure the area as a potential leverage point in hostage negotiations. The proposal, initially positioned as a bargaining tool, suggested Israel would withdraw and allow one million displaced Gazans to return to their homes if Hamas released roughly 100 hostages. However, negotiations have stalled repeatedly, with no resolution in sight. According to IDF sources, two trends have emerged following Israel’s ground incursion into southern Lebanon, as Gaza becomes a secondary front. First, Israel’s territorial control within Gaza is steadily expanding, with a similar plan reportedly under development for the Philadelphi Corridor. Second, government efforts to resolve the hostage crisis have slowed, leaving the fate of the hostages uncertain. Intelligence briefings presented to Israel’s Security Cabinet warn that the hostages’ conditions worsen by the week, with Hamas reportedly prepared to execute them if IDF forces advance on their positions. Without renewed negotiations, officials fear the crisis will end in tragedy. Right-wing ministers, who oppose prisoner releases in exchange for hostages, view this outcome as inevitable. This scenario, they argue, would naturally resolve the hostage issue and could strengthen Israel’s resolve to retain its current foothold in Gaza. Israeli leaders and right-wing lawmakers, some openly advocating the establishment of new settlements in Gaza, maintain that retaining control over this newly claimed territory is essential. As public anger would likely focus on Hamas, government officials anticipate that calls for withdrawal would diminish, solidifying Israel's extended presence in Gaza. The withdrawal order is ready At the beginning of the war, the border checkpoint here was called 'Crossing 96.' Once the IDF realized that the Netzarim Corridor would remain under Israeli control, it established 'Checkpoint 3' (Point 3), with a small team to monitor the movement of forces in and out of the corridor. Today, it has developed into 'Terminal 3,' a large, organized military base at the edge of Be’eri Forest, currently in advanced stages of construction. Private vehicles can no longer enter Gaza from this area, nor can anyone gain unauthorized entry by posing as reserve soldiers, as was previously possible. Security infrastructure includes checkpoint gates with staffed booths, three inspection points at the entrance corridor, and coordination between the Gaza Division and Netzarim Division (now the 252nd Reserve Division). Open-sided Humvees, along with armored Defender jeeps (known as 'David' vehicles used primarily in security operations in the West Bank), regularly enter and exit, joined by a steady flow of construction trucks, cranes and drills in what looks like a major highway. The westernmost checkpoint within Terminal 3 is still known as Crossing 96, situated along the border fence and now divided into two parts: one entrance for light vehicles and trucks, and another for armored vehicles such as tanks and APCs several hundred feet away. Crossing 96 is operated by a joint infantry and armor unit. The first IDF post operates smoothly, aptly named 'The Cement Plant' after the IDF cement plant that facilitated the large-scale engineering work establishing the corridor and rebuilding the border barrier damaged at the war’s outset. Previously, this area was home to a Palestinian grain facility, as these fields—bordering Gaza’s main landfill and close to Israel—were farmed by Palestinians until October 7, interspersed with Hamas positions. In the post’s yard, surrounded by concrete Jersey barriers and earth embankments, stands a grill frequently used by reservists. Soldiers here enjoy fortified and comfortable sleeping quarters in modular containers, a shaded smoking and relaxation area and proper shower and restroom facilities that have replaced the portable toilets used initially. Overall, the post has the feel of a small, permanent base that’s pleasant to stay in. The IDF has installed a new water line from Israel, and soldiers’ cell phones remain fully operational. There’s no longer a need to leave devices behind or set them to airplane mode upon entry, as the IDF installed a dedicated cell tower in the corridor, allowing soldiers to stay in touch with family without needing to climb onto rooftops to reach signal. From the post, the northern end of the corridor is fully visible—completely exposed, with hundreds of buildings that the IDF flattened to expand the area up to the outskirts of Gaza City neighborhoods such as Zeitoun and Sabra. 'The operational tension has eased here a bit, so I treat soldiers returning from missions with various snacks, like these sfinge,' says Dotan Ben-Tovim, a 54-year-old building engineer from Ramat Gan and a seasoned fighter, as he flips the deep-fried doughnuts in sizzling oil. In line with the relaxed atmosphere, soldiers on base wear partial uniforms, forgoing helmets and body armor typically worn during the early months. They dress casually, wearing sports clothes and only gear up in full protective equipment when heading out on operational activity. Driving along the Netzarim Corridor, not a single tank is visible. The IDF’s armored units are dispersed across a security and maintenance zone, which has now expanded to seven or eight kilometers wide. Initially, IDF plans spoke of widening the corridor by just one to two kilometers from the main route. The road itself will soon be repaved with asphalt in preparation for the IDF's second winter in Gaza. Posts along the corridor are of two primary types: structures built by the IDF, mainly modular containers and military facilities, or repurposed Gazan buildings previously used for other functions but now adapted by the IDF as soldier posts. One such post is a large Palestinian public building that stands out in the area. 'Everything here is modular and removable,' say IDF sources. 'Most of these structures can be loaded onto trucks and engineering vehicles and quickly dismantled.' The Southern Command has strict orders to disassemble everything and fully withdraw to Israeli territory if necessary. Between posts along the dual-lane corridor, the IDF is conducting extensive drilling operations to ensure no cross-border tunnels run beneath the route. Led by the 252nd Division’s engineering battalion and involving civilian contractors, this project is designed to prevent potential explosive traps or exit points for attackers from below. The latest tunnel under the route was discovered in late October, more than 20 meters (65 feet) deep; it has been mapped and will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the search drill campaign is being expanded throughout the corridor’s area. A few months ago, during the latest clash in the region, a Hamas cell killed an IDF soldier stationed at a corridor post, likely with tunnel support. Hamas terrorists can potentially dig tunnels from Gaza City, located only a few miles away. In response, the IDF is determined to neutralize this threat. At the start of the year, many Gazans approached IDF posts, primarily from south to north, but were either fired upon or pushed back. Hamas also sent drugged Gazans toward IDF positions to gauge the soldiers' responses. These incidents have since declined, as has the surge of hundreds of Gazans—some armed—toward the corridor posts during the Iranian offensive on October 1, which was forcefully halted and has not been repeated. IDF forces occasionally receive alerts of potential Hamas raids on the corridor's forward posts, often small-scale guerrilla units. Though mortar and rocket fire on the positions still occurs, it is much less frequent, with entire weeks passing peacefully at some posts. When necessary, loudspeakers connected to detection sensors warn of incoming fire. Currently, the IDF is permitting and even encouraging the roughly 300,000 Gazans remaining in the northern region to cross south, though Hamas actively prevents this, and many Gazans prefer to remain in the ruins and shelters around Gaza City. Recently, Hamas established a tent compound not far from the port, just a few miles west of the corridor. The IDF is preparing its large coastal post to screen the tens of thousands it hopes will soon cross southward—a movement the military anticipates will increase with the ground incursion's expansion from Jabaliya into additional areas and neighborhoods within Gaza itself. The coastal base is equipped with interrogation rooms, temporary detention enclosures and inspection stations to minimize direct interaction between soldiers and Gazans. Erez East, Erez West The second checkpoint in the Netzarim Corridor lies on Gaza's internal north-south route, referred to by the IDF as 'Tenzer' and by Gazans as Salah al-Din. Currently, it is unmanned by soldiers and staffed only when needed to coordinate the transfer of sick or wounded Gazans with Israeli approval across both sides of the Palestinian enclave. The checkpoint area is surrounded by concrete barriers and fences, Israeli flags and a beginning stretch of small paving stones for easier westward travel. Earlier this year, when I crossed this position with an IDF unit, it was encircled by Gazan structures that soldiers used as temporary posts. Today, these buildings—some three or four stories high—are entirely flattened. The maintenance and expansion of the Netzarim territory have been enabled through Israel’s efforts to secure international legitimacy, especially from the United States, which occasionally issues rebukes or threats but takes no further action. Through the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the IDF regularly escorts foreign journalists to witness and document the hundreds of aid trucks Israel allows into Gaza carrying food, water, fuel and medical supplies, including to northern Gaza. This aid flows from the newly expanded Erez Crossing, which now includes two terminals: Erez East and Erez West. This aid ultimately reaches Hamas, which exerts control over the population and regroups militarily despite consistent blows from the IDF. As a result, Israel is facilitating two core conditions: sustaining Hamas as a weakened asset that nonetheless retains control over Gaza’s civilian population, with surviving commanders still active, even in Jabaliya and northern Gaza; and expanding Israeli-held territories in Gaza without advancing a deal for hostages. Southern Command has not received any instructions to launch U.S.-contracted companies to distribute food directly to Gazans rather than through Hamas, an idea dismissed by commanders leading operations against Hamas as nothing more than a rumor. 'We’ve heard nothing about it, nor have we been instructed to prepare for such a possibility,' one commander said. 'For now, we’re broadening humanitarian supply lines, though it’s difficult to prevent Hamas from intercepting the aid, as they frequently seize trucks post-unloading and threaten the lives of Gazan drivers.' Patterns of combat in the Netzarim Corridor have also solidified over the months: Hamas continuously attempts to harass IDF battalion raids that chip away at Palestinian territory at the corridor’s periphery, with recent operations focused mainly in the Nuseirat area. Hamas, in turn, exploits the static nature of activity in Netzarim by deploying snipers. 'The terrorists here operate guerrilla-style, planting explosives and fleeing in an effort to harm our forces,' described Col. Yonatan Meir, commander of the 179th Brigade, one of the two brigades active in the corridor in recent weeks. 'We’re working around the clock. The corridor hinders Hamas’ ability to regroup and makes it harder for them to recover. My reservist troops have been here for ten months, and we’re doing our best to set them a stable and manageable schedule.' Expansion efforts are not limited to the Netzarim Corridor. For the first time since the 2005 disengagement, the IDF is reestablishing the Kissufim Crossing to create an additional facility for the transfer of goods (and forces if necessary) to Palestinians in central Gaza. Moreover, plans are moving forward to replicate the Netzarim Corridor model along the Philadelphi Corridor, which is gradually expanding and taking shape in southern Gaza, reaching toward the historic Gush Katif and the edges of Rafah.

Qatar to pull out of Gaza cease-fire mediation, source says	Official says Doha suspends mediation efforts until Israel and Hamas 'demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table'; Israeli officials welcome Qatar's decision to expel Hamas leaders Qatar will stop trying to mediate a Gaza cease-fire deal until Hamas and Israel 'demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table,' an official briefed on the matter told Reuters on Saturday. The Gulf country has also concluded that Hamas' political office in Doha 'no longer serves its purpose,' the official added. The move marks the biggest setback in efforts to reach a cease-fire since Hamas triggered the Gaza war by attacking Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. 'The Qataris have said since the start of the conflict that they can only mediate when both parties demonstrate a genuine interest in finding a resolution,' the official said, adding that Qatar had notified Hamas, Israel and the U.S. administration of its decision. Israeli officials welcomed Qatar's decision to expel Hamas leaders. 'Hamas is a murderous terrorist organization that should be pursued worldwide, not offered sanctuary in any country,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that Qatar’s expulsion of Hamas leaders logically diminishes its role as mediator. 'Once they expel Hamas leaders, there is no further advantage in Qatar’s mediation.' The move comes just a day after a Reuters report indicating that Qatar relayed a message to Hamas leaders at the request of the U.S. last week, warning that the presence of the organization in Doha 'should no longer be welcome,' according to a senior U.S. official. U.S. and Qatari officials told CNN that Doha has effectively agreed in recent weeks to the American demand to remove Hamas from its territory due to prolonged, unsuccessful efforts to secure a hostage exchange agreement with the group. This development comes 400 days into the war and after the October 7 massacre, marking a prolonged period of unsuccessful negotiations. Earlier this week, Israeli officials expressed deep pessimism about the possibility of a hostage deal. Hamas reportedly informed mediators that it would not compromise on any agreement that fell short of a permanent cease-fire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, rejecting incremental proposals for smaller-scale exchanges. 'Truth must be told, there is no sliver of a deal. The question is whether now we must save the surviving hostages and end the war in Gaza,' said officials familiar with the negotiations. 'We must face facts. The big question is whether the time has come to save the remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza. That is the entire discussion behind the scenes: there will be no deal without convergence toward ending the war in Gaza.' Israeli officials also believe there could be 'renewed momentum' for a deal following the U.S. elections. Sources indicated that dialogue with mediators is ongoing, primarily to assess whether Hamas may shift its stance. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set an offer of millions of dollars for each hostage released, with officials working on broadcasting the proposal across various platforms. The offer aims to incentivize those holding hostages to facilitate their release, with a reward of $5 million per hostage and safe passage to a third country for those who agree.

Jordan's tourism industry struggling as Gaza war deters visitors	Jordan’s tourism sector, crucial to its economy, facing severe losses as Middle East tensions deter Western travelers; Petra’s hotel occupancy drops as low as 10%, with operators reporting 90-95% drop in future bookings and international airlines canceling flights Enas Al Hinti has cut staff pay in half and asked workers to take unpaid leave in an effort to keep her hotel in ancient Petra open as Western holidaymakers fearful of conflict shun destinations in the Middle East. A crisis across the region's tourism industry since the start of the Israel-Hamas war 13 months ago is being felt acutely in Jordan, whose border with Israel along the Red Sea and Dead Sea is studded with beach resorts. Sites such as Petra, Wadi Rum and crusader castles have been drawing visitors for decades - more than one million a year before the war, mainly Americans and Europeans. But Reuters reporters on a recent trip to the city carved from rose-colored rock - Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction - found businesses boarded up by their owners. 'There are no revenues, it's all losses,' Al Hinti, who runs the Nomads hotel, told Reuters. Data and interviews with seven hotel and business owners and tour operators underline the damage to the tourist industry, which made up 12.5% of the economy last year. Flight ticket bookings to Jordan, which is not involved in the conflict, were down 35% year-on-year between Sept. 16 and Oct. 4, data from travel intelligence firm ForwardKeys shows. The situation has worsened since Iran's drone and missile attack on Israel in April and following tit-for-tat military strikes between Israel and Iran, said Seif Saudi, the managing director of Amman-based Jordan Direct Tours. Long-term damage The tourist industry across the Middle East is struggling. Flight bookings to the region are down 6% year-on-year since the war erupted after Hamas-led terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, ForwardKeys data shows. Bookings to Israel and Lebanon fell even more sharply than those to Jordan between Sept. 16 and Oct. 4, while Oman, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have seen smaller declines. The recent regional escalation of the conflict, including intensified Israeli attacks on Lebanon's Hezbollah terrorist group, has dashed hopes for a recovery in the cooler autumn months, a key season for Middle East tourism. International tour groups like Intrepid and Riviera Travel said they canceled tours to Jordan and Egypt after Iran showered Israel with ballistic missiles on Oct. 1. Hotel occupancy rates in Petra have fallen on average to as low as 10%, estimates Abdullah Hasanat, president of the Petra Hotels Association. 'We are searching for a savior. All the investments in Petra are in intensive care. When tourism stopped, bookings stopped,' Hasanat, who owns a hotel himself, told Reuters. Most international carriers have halted flights to Beirut and Tel Aviv, but some, such as Ryanair have also paused flights to Jordan, in part due to its proximity to Israeli and Lebanese airspace. Hotel owners said Ryanair's decision in particular meant far fewer Western tourists came to the country. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters in October it was a 'sensible' move given the closure of airspace at the time. Before the war, Christian tourists making pilgrimages to Israel often also tagged on a trip to Jordan. What's next Business owners say the damage will be long-term. Future bookings have evaporated, forcing hotel managers like Al Hinti to dip into their financial reserves to continue paying salaries. She is keeping her hotel open, but with fewer floors available. 'We are facing next year with a drop of not less than 90-95% (in bookings),' said Nabih Riyal, CEO of Plaza Tours, which runs vacations with European and American operators. Jordan's tourism sector has survived previous crises related to the prolonged conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, Tourism Minister Lina Annab told Reuters. 'This calls for us to really focus on our most resilient markets, which are not as affected by the situation,' Annab said, adding that visitors are still coming from neighboring countries. Some Western tourists are undeterred too. 'We knew that the trip would be canceled if it was really risky,' said Dorothy Lawson, a tourist from California, walking around Petra in late October. 'They said we could come. So we came and we're really glad we did.' But businesses that rely on big crowds are struggling to survive. 'We used to have 4,000 visitors every day,' said Marcus Massoud, a salesman in one of Petra's many souvenir shops. 'Now we have 300 to 400. It's not like before.'

Hezbollah fire targets major cities in Israel's north	Acre, Haifa, Safed, Tiberias all come under rocket attacks during Saturday; Hezbollah claims it shot down an IDF drone over South Lebanon using a surface-to-air missile Hezbollah continued to target Israel's north on Saturday firing dozens of rockets at vast areas of the Galilee and the Haifa Bay area including Acre and Haifa and Tiberias, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee The IDF said most projectiles were intercepted or fell in open areas. At the same time Lebanese media reported Israeli strikes on the South Lebanon city of Nabatiyeh and other town and villages in the region. According to the Iran-backed terror group at least seven people were killed in Israeli strikes on Friday. Hezbollah claimed its forces shot down an Israeli Hermes 450 drone with a surface-to-air missile. The IDF said its planes attacked Beirut's Dahieh quarter overnight and its forces on the ground found and destroyed Hezbollah launch pads and infrastructure near the village of Shabaa on the foothills of Mt. Hermon. The military said the launch pad was used to target Israel including a missile attack on the Druze village of Majdal Shams earlier this year where 12 children were murdered. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper quoted sources claiming Israel warned UNIFIL peacekeepers to avoid travel south of the Litani River, amid Israeli strikes. According to the report, Israel asked UNIFIL to coordinate its troop movements with the IDF and linked those requests to plans to expand the Israeli offensive.

US lifts ban on troops on the ground in Ukraine	Biden administration allows American technical teams to be in the war-torn country to maintain F-16 fighter jets and Patriot missiles provided by the U.S. and Western allies; Musk joins Trump-Zelensky call The Biden administration for the first time lifted its ban on the presence of U.S. forces in Ukraine, CNN reported on Saturday. The decision that was made ahead of the elections, cleared American military technical teams to be in Ukraine so that they can repair and maintain U.S. and allied equipment provided to Kyiv for its fight against the invading Russian forces. A security officials said the American technical teams would be stationed away from the front lines and not be involved in the fighting against the Russian troops. He also said the U.S. decided to proceed with the plans because the equipment, including F-16 fighter jets, and Patriot missiles, require experienced technical maintenance. Meanwhile Axios reported that Elon Musk participated for 25 minutes, in the first conversation between Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenski and Donald Trump. Trump said he would continue to support Ukraine but did not go into specifics in the call. Republican's in Congress and many of Trump's close allies have advocated for Ukraine to concede territory occupied by Russian after its invasion and for the war to end. Zelensky said he had a good call and that he and the incoming president agreed to continue close dialogue and cooperation. He said a strong American leadership is vital for peace and justice in the world. Musk himself has been accused of supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin in the conflict. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal earlier this month, Musk had been in regular contact with Putin since 2022 and at least in one conversation the men discussed the Starlink service. The journal also said Putin asked Musk not to activate the satellites over Taiwan as a favor the Chinese President Xi, a claim Musk denied.

Trump plans radical revamp of US higher education	Incoming president says pro-Palestinian foreign students participating in protests to be deported; says will go after Woke agenda and promote 'American tradition,' Western civilization' through funding and accreditation process Donald Trump is planning a radical change to American academic institutions and studies once he takes office next year. The incoming president said he planned to free universities from what he calls 'crazy radical Marxist control,' and transform them to conservative institutions that value 'American tradition' and 'Western civilization,' through a reform of how universities are funded and their educational programs. Among other things, Trump plans to establish a free of charge 'American Academy' that will fight Woke, he plans to deport foreign students who take part in pro-Palestinian protests on campus and to limit the authority of the federal government over universities. He also plans to ban transgender students from college sports. During his campaign Trump said he would allow police intervention in campuses dealing with protests from Hamas supporters and promised to fine institutions who fail to take action against them. He also vowed to deal with antisemitism on college campuses and go after affirmative action, claiming colleges should teach reading, writing and arithmetic and not gender and race and threatened to end funding for schools that teach about slavery or systemic racism. Trump intends to replace the federal accreditation system- that determines how higher education institutions meet the criteria for federal funding. He said he intends to fire the current officials whom he claims are under the control of the 'radical left,' and establish new bodies that will demand universities and collages promote what he termed 'real standards,' without detailing what they would be. Among other things, there would be an emphasis on programs dealing with 'American history and legacy' and improve preparations for students to enter the workforce. His new American Academy will recognize credits from other schools and offer degrees focused on 'clear employment results, including in the federal government and its subcontractors. The Trump reforms will go after high tuition costs after they exceeded $100,000 a year. but rather than increase the cost of an undergraduate degree, he plans to offer cheaper 4-year programs. He promised subsidies for technical education and funding for schools who offer hands-on practical experience in summer internships. The Republican Party has long advocated closing down the Department of Education, a move Trump was now considering. He said he believed transferring the power to the individual states would encourage them to compete for better academic results. Trump can expect an uphill battle in Congress and his plans currently appear to have little chance of success. However, his return to power could make the matter of American higher education into a point of contention in the coming years. What the incoming president is proposing could change American academia and deapen the social divisions already plaguing the country.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryqhrtnzyx	2024-11-09T02:28:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/09/Sy4SvF2Z1e/Sy4SvF2Z1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

ICC to probe chief prosecutor sexual misconduct	Court launches an external investigation into the allegations against chief prosecutor Karim Khan; calls for him to step down while inquiry ongoing The International Criminal Court's governing body will launch an external investigation into its chief prosecutor Karim Khan over alleged sexual misconduct, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. Khan is called on in an internal document circulated to member states to temporarily step down from his role at the world's permanent war crimes court, based in The Hague, while an inquiry is ongoing. The undated and unsigned document, seen by Reuters, was circulated to member states by ICC staff. Khan's office referred questions to his attorney and phone calls and repeated requests for comment sent to his lawyers went unanswered. He has denied allegations of misconduct that were reported to the court's governing body last month. At that time he asked the court's own internal oversight body to investigate them. A source with knowledge of the matter said an external probe was agreed at a meeting on Thursday of a core group of the court's governing body, the Assembly of States Parties. Reuters couldn't determine who would conduct the investigation. ICC judges are currently reviewing a request Khan made in May for arrest warrants against Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense chief and Hamas leaders. Khan has said the misconduct allegations coincided with a campaign of misinformation against his office. The internal document, circulated for discussion, argued that the court's independent, internal body for assessing matters of conduct should have launched a formal inquiry into the allegations when they were first reported. A source familiar with the matter said the alleged victim in the Khan case does not have confidence in the independence of the court's internal body, whose incoming head is a former member of Khan's staff, because details of reports to it about the alleged misconduct were leaked. The current and future head of the independent body did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The document also shows pressure is mounting on Khan to temporarily step aside and let one of his deputy prosecutors take over while the investigation takes place. 'The prosecutor should step aside with immediate effect to pave the way for an independent investigation,' the document says. It was unclear if the court's governing body has asked Khan to do so. The ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression in member states or by their nationals. It's governing body holds its annual meeting early next month.

Amsterdam casino staffer was in co hoots with pro-Palestine riote...	Local media identifies the man working at the Holland Casino, where some victims of the violence sought refuge; Dutch justice minister says the Israelis were targeted because they were Jews Dutch media reported on Sunday that a man working at a city casino, was involved in the violent attacks on Israeli soccer fans late last week. The man who was employed by a subcontractor of the Holland Casino, was found to have been part of a social media group coordinating the violent assaults on Amsterdam streets after the match between Israel's Maccabi Tel Aviv team and Ajax. The hours-long attacks began as the fans returned to the city center after the game. Violent gangs awaited them on street corners and around their hotels. The Holland Casino, where some of the Israelis sought shelter during the violence, condemned the attacks and said they have launched an investigation, the NOS channel reported. 'We informed his employers that he is no longer welcome here,' the Holland Casino said in a statement. 'Staff working for the casino directly or through subcontractors of the casino, serve interests of the establishment, our employees and our guests, first and foremost, and that was not the case here.' According to the headline in De Telegraph, Holland's most read newspaper, the attacks were carried out by 'boys on scooters' and cab drivers. The paper also wrote that in Telegram pages a call was made for a 'hunt on Jews.' The local media also reported that Israelis were still avoiding the use of taxis or Uber. The Jewish community organized an alternative pool of rides. 'We helped them make their flights to Israel as quickly as possible,' one man told the paper. 'They were given food, medical care if needed and were transported to the airport.' The reports went on to say that of the 62 people who were arrested, only six remain in police custody. 'They are suspected of violence and subverting public order. The prosecution will employ quick measures to bring them to trial.' de Volkskrant reported that the coordinator for counter-terrorism and security (NCTV) said in an official statement that the attack on the Israeli soccer fans took place in parallel to the annual commemoration of Christal Nacht. Netherland's justice minister David Van Weel said there were indications of possible threats but not any concrete information about attacks on the memorial events or in other parts of the city, when 800 police officers were deployed in Amsterdam and elsewhere around the country. He said there may have been some disregard to Israeli warnings. The minister added that in his view, everything points to the attacks being carried out against people because they were Jews.

No one tells you how to run a school after 15 students, faculty ...	Ben-Gurion University President, Prof. Daniel Chamovitz navigates real and political minefields after Hamas massacre and the abduction of 10 members of student body or staff Ben-Gurion University President, Prof. Daniel Chamovitz, will never forget his recent conversation with student Noa Argamani, who following 7 months as a Hama hostage in Gaza, was rescued by the IDF and returned to her studies in the summer semester. 'When I met with her, before her mother passed away, what worried her most was whether she could complete her Information Systems Engineering degree with her class, with her friends. I told her, 'Noa, give yourself space and credit. Completing a full year in one month is almost impossible. But I promise you one thing: when the time comes to receive the degree, even if you haven't completed everything, we'll let you walk with your friends. You won't have the diploma yet, but many people don't finish their degree in four years for various reasons.'' But he never imagined this is what he'd face as president. Chamovitz: 'True. Our faculty member Nili Margalit, who was kidnapped from Nir Oz and returned in the deal after 55 days in captivity, returned to teach in the Nursing Department. From Ben-Gurion, we had ten hostages, only Noa and Nili returned. As far as we know, three others are considered alive - Sasha Trupanov, Avinatan Or, and Sagiv Kalfon - and the rest were murdered. After October 7, we had a management meeting to determine who we count as university casualties. It was decided that we count students, employees, first-degree relatives of employees, and alumni.' How many are there? Chamovitz: 'We've reached 115 so far. Just on October 7, there were 75 casualties. Dina Kapshitzer z'l, who was murdered in her car with her husband and children, worked in our Human Resources. It was the most terrible shiva (mourning period) I've visited. In summer 2019, when I took a course at Harvard for new presidents, there wasn't a chapter on how to manage a university after a massacre.' Broken but strong This academic year, like its predecessor, looks different, skewed: out of 350,000 students in higher education, 70,000 students were called up for reserve duty. From Ben-Gurion University alone in the Negev capital, 6,495 students and 369 faculty members were mobilized. More than half of them served over 100 days in the past academic year. 'We'll do everything to enable students in reserves to succeed, but we don't want the doctor who says: 'You have this disease, I think it starts with an 'C', but I didn't learn that lesson' or an engineer who says: 'I just built a bridge, but I didn't study loads.'' Last year, you were criticized for your approach. Chamovitz: 'True. Each institution had a different policy, so in the same unit in Jabaliya, for example, one student got X accommodations and another got a Y because one studies at Ben-Gurion and the other at Bar-Ilan. Last year we learned while running. When the war started, the Chief Reserve Officer told us: 'We think the war will end by January,' 'by March most reservists will be released.' It sounds funny now. Since then we've learned, we're improving, and we've done something seemingly impossible - all higher education institutions agreed on a unified policy. Do you know what it means to get 50 presidents to agree on a unified approach? This was negotiated with the Chief Reserve Officer and student unions. We created a policy that addresses 90 percent of the issues. Obviously, it won't be enough for everyone, but it will reduce some pressure, and that's an achievement.' So what has changed? Chamovitz: 'This year we have levels based on the number of reserve duty days, and we've included spouses in the accommodations policy. We understood that a spouse of a reservist, if they have children, can't attend classes when their partner is in reserves. We've also included security system workers and career military personnel who weren't part of the policy because they're in study-while-serving programs.' Collision course Since the government's formation, says Prof. Chamovitz, relations between Education Minister Yoav Kisch and the Committee of University Heads have been on a collision course. 'No need to sugar-coat it. But there's been a learning process on both the minister's side and the Ministry of Education about the place of higher education and political involvement in it.' Wasn't this obvious? Chamovitz: 'It's not obvious to many people in the country.' Please explain. Chamovitz: 'It seems that managing higher education is a profession that everyone in the country thinks they can do. No one would think to tell the Transportation Ministry how to conduct driving tests, or tell a hospital director: 'Why do you insist on having an emergency room?' But when it comes to higher education, it's different. Not just with Minister Kisch but with Israeli governments throughout generations. Do people know what it takes to train a doctor or an engineer? Academic freedom isn't some 'leftist concept.' It means you have the right to research what you want, provided you can get the resources to do that research, and it meets the established standards of higher education. And that you can teach how you want, as long as it's within the approved curriculum. 'Academic freedom is what allowed the Western world to reach where it is today. Think about Israel: a quarter century before the state was established, the Hebrew University and the Technion were founded. This year marks 100 years for the Technion, and next year will mark 100 years for the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Imagine the state without these institutions. When they were established, there was no state to supervise them, and they built modern Zionism as we know it - all the engineers who built the state, all the lawyers, all the politicians, all the teachers are graduates of these two institutions, the Haganah, the defense industries. What is Start-Up Nation? When we talk about Mobileye, where did it come from? From basic research at the Hebrew University. Or Copaxone, which is the Parkinson's drug that brought hundreds of millions to Israel in royalties - it started with basic research at the Weizmann Institute.' You're basically saying the Ministry of Education thinks its role is to control academia. Chamovitz: 'Not the Ministry of Education as much as politicians. There were calls to legislate all kinds of things affecting universities that we manage to stop.' Like what? Chamovitz: 'The Silencing Law, for example. There's a law against incitement to terrorism. You can't be a terrorism supporter in Israel. If you are, they arrest you. So they promoted a law against incitement to terrorism in higher education. Meaning, if someone here breaks the law they need to arrest them, but only professors, not employees within the university, only a very specific population.' Logic says that someone who supports the October 7 massacre shouldn't be able to teach in Israeli academia. Chamovitz: 'That's against the law, we don't need a separate law for that. There's the criminal threshold for all Israeli citizens, and then there's a proposed law just for professors in universities. Everyone thinks they know how to run a university, like how many credit points to give for a degree. People want to influence universities through legislation, as if we're the enemy of the people. This was true in the previous government, the one before that, and it's getting more extreme. 'The State of Israel, with great wisdom, created a buffer between the government and higher education - the Planning and Budgeting Committee in the Council for Higher Education. This is supposed to block political influences on higher education. I spoke with a certain politician who couldn't believe that when I appoint a professor to a position, I don't know and don't care about their political views. I only care about excellence and commitment to higher education. People are convinced that if the university offers someone a position, it's because they vote left. At a meeting this week, someone threw at me: 'You leftists!'' Well, are you leftists? Chamovitz: 'Such a leftist stronghold!' he chuckles. 'It's funny because here at Ben-Gurion, in a university management meeting, I think you'd find voters from eight different parties around the table. But politicians are convinced everything is political. There are people who have an interest in creating this narrative, but it's a minority that wants political control over the university. There are countries like Turkey, Hungary, Russia, and Iran where the ruler appoints university presidents.' Do you think we're heading there? Chamovitz: 'No. But there are people who would like it to be that way.' What is the role of higher education institutions in social and political protests? Chamovitz: 'Excellent question. Historically, most protests were supported by or emerged from university students. In the American War of Independence, it was Harvard and Columbia College graduates. In France in the '60s with 'Red Danny' (Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who led the student rebellion in May 1968), it was students who took to the streets. In Israel in the '70s with the protest against Golda, 'Peace Now' - these were protests that came from universities, these were the students. As presidents, we want to push our students to be active citizens, thinkers, activists. It's their duty. When there were protests against the constitutional reform, we told students 'go demonstrate.' We allowed students from both sides to go to demonstrations, those for and those against. Everyone got exemptions. And simultaneously at Ben-Gurion, we held dialogue circles for students from both sides of the divide, to understand what we can agree on and what we can't. And why were universities so active? Because we had no doubt that this process could lead to erosion in the independence of higher education. We see this in all countries where this process happened - first the courts, then the media, and then higher education.' A reader might ask themselves: What's the significance of government control over higher education institutions? Chamovitz: 'Innovation, genius, and ideas flourish where there is free thinking. There's a reason why universities in the U.S. and Western Europe are productive, and universities in Iran or Russia or Hungary or Turkey are not. With all the investments in China, they don't have Nobel Prizes. Why? Because people there are afraid to fail, afraid of being fired.' If a right-wing government fully controls higher education institutions, could they decide, for example, to exclude Arabs? Chamovitz: 'That's not one of my concerns. It's in the interest of the entire country, right and left. Take the Bedouin population for example. If we don't bring them into Israeli higher education, they'll go study in Hebron and Nablus. How does it serve the State of Israel to have Israeli citizens studying at an Islamic college in Hebron because they weren't accepted to colleges within Israel, and returning with the ideas they received there? It's everyone's aspiration for people to advance. There's no greater engine for social change than higher education. If we look at Arab society, the percentage of students in universities is almost equal to their percentage in the general population.' To what extent can a student who identifies as Palestinian express their opinion on campus today? Chamovitz: 'We're seeing across all campuses that this was perhaps the quietest year in terms of friction between right and left or between Arabs and Jews, and that's because of our commitment to our shared space. Everyone understands that we're sitting on a powder keg and there are elements that want it to explode, and people also understand that not everything that's acceptable in peacetime will be acceptable during wartime. An Arab professor I work with told me something very interesting after October 7: 'I never understood Jewish paranoia. You're the strong ones. You have the police, you have the army, you have the wealth. Why are you so afraid of us? After October 7, I understand Jewish paranoia.' And this understanding makes the dialogue between us more equal. Because the discourse of 'you're the strong ones, we're the weak ones' doesn't serve anyone except politicians. The first two victims who arrived at Soroka on the morning of October 7 were Bedouin girls who died from a rocket hit on their encampment. Our Bedouin employee, Ahmad Abu-Latif, was killed in reserve duty in Gaza. And at the same time, we estimate that quite a few Bedouins here in the Negev have family in Gaza. It's very, very complex, but that's also our strength as Israelis.' Can students raise Palestinian flags on campus? Chamovitz: 'In the State of Israel, it's still legal to raise a Palestinian flag. However, we won't allow such demonstrations inside the campus while I have thousands of reservists fighting. It's possible that the Palestinian guy raising the flag is saying, 'I'm just identifying with my national identity, I'm not suggesting that Israel shouldn't exist.' That's true, but everyone who sees it thinks that he does mean that. The president of Arizona University said something very correct, that there is freedom of expression but there's another freedom, and that's freedom from fear. And if your freedom of expression causes me to fear - we must find an agreement. Most Jews who see Palestinian demonstrations today are afraid, and rightfully so. I must maintain a space where people can come, learn, succeed. It's not one-sided. Years ago, a group of Bedouin community leaders came to me requesting that we ban Palestinian demonstrations, for example on Nakba Day. They said these demonstrations create a negative atmosphere that prevents people from sending their children to study at the university, and that made me switch my thinking that things aren't one-dimensional, that there's a lot of gray here. The campus must be a place where we challenge students, challenge each other. That's the whole essence of learning. It doesn't have to be pleasant, doesn't have to be comfortable, but you need to be physically safe. Sometimes that means there won't be a demonstration. It doesn't mean you don't have freedom of expression.' DNA of cauliflower and lettuce At 61, married plus three, he lives on the Hod HaSharon-Beer Sheva line. Originally from a small town in Pennsylvania, which he compares in our conversation to Yeruham. A person who speaks with the same passion about politics and plant genetics, his scientific base. On his office walls are two photographs, close-ups of lettuce and cauliflower DNA. In 2012, he published the book 'What a Plant Knows,' which ranked that year among Amazon's ten best-selling science books. He also served as Dean of the Faculty of Life Sciences at Tel Aviv University and founded the Manna Center - the Food Security Program. As a former student at Columbia University, which in the past year has become representative of the 'woke' generation calling to free Palestine from the river to the sea while holding low-fat Starbucks coffee, he explains the paradox well: 'I knew this would happen. I know what it's like to be American. I was at Columbia University in the early 80s, during the First Lebanon War. Even then there were demonstrations against Israel showing Sharon with fangs and Palestinian children's blood dripping from them. There were very large social movements against apartheid in South Africa then, and there was a huge demonstration calling for Columbia University to divest its money from there. Students raised flags with slogans like 'Blacks Against Apartheid,' 'Chemistry Students Against Apartheid,' 'Lesbians Against Apartheid,' and the flag we raised - 'Zionists Against Apartheid' - they took down from us because 'you can't be part of this.' It's an inability to contain complexity, along with guilt that I'm rich and privileged. I don't blame these kids. They're 18-21, their lives are very protected. And we need to be honest enough to say that what they see on TV is not what we see on TV. We don't see the suffering of Gaza residents. People can say they deserve it, that they don't deserve it, but that's a fact. We look very bad on TV in the United States, and Americans have a very short memory. Who there remembers October 7? And there's a lack of academic leadership willing to set boundaries and say: 'True, there's complexity, but rape is always wrong,' for example.' Would you have believed Harvard would go to this place? Chamovitz: 'Yes. What did Harvard, Penn, and Columbia have in common? They all had presidents, coincidentally all new female presidents, with no experience. Nothing prepared them for this. When I became president, I thought I'd have lots of parties and meetings with rich people around the world, and instead I got Corona, protests, and war. And alongside academic leadership, there are academic currents that fueled the protests, especially in social sciences. 'Intersectionality' (a theoretical framework that examines the intersection between forms or systems of oppression, control, and discrimination), which is the dominant current in social sciences, perhaps also in humanities, says for example that the Palestinian struggle is the same struggle as LGBTQ+. That's how you also get to 'Queers for Gaza.' In November, I was interviewed by one of the newspapers in the U.S., and I said that I want Jews and Israelis to receive the same treatment as gender identity receives on U.S. campuses. There, if a professor addresses a student with the wrong gender pronoun, they can be brought before a disciplinary committee. Of course, I got into trouble and was attacked for being anti-gender.' How will this affect the American academic world? Chamovitz: 'I feel this will end up in the dustbin of academia. These things won't have a long-term impact.'

Qatar agrees to oust Hamas officials after US request, report	American and Qatari officials confirm Doha agrees to the move after the Biden administration says the continued presence of leaders of the terror group in Qatar is unacceptable American and Qatari officials said the Qataris have agreed to an American request to oust Hamas officials from the country after the terror group rejected proposals for a cease-fire and hostage exchange, CNN reported early on Saturday. The news came 400 days after the Hamas massacre of October 7 2023. The U.S. has told Qatar that the presence of Hamas in Doha was no longer acceptable. The tiny Gulf state Qatar, alongside the U.S. and Egypt, has played a major role in rounds of so-far fruitless talks to broker a ceasefire to the year-long war in Gaza. The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. 'After rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner. We made that clear to Qatar following Hamas's rejection weeks ago of another hostage release proposal,' the senior official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Qatar then made the demand to Hamas leaders about 10 days ago, the official said. Washington has been in touch with Qatar over when to close the group's political office, and it told Doha that now was the time. Three Hamas officials denied Qatar had told Hamas leaders they were no longer welcome in the country. The spokesperson for Qatar's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was unclear if the Qataris provided a specific deadline to the Hamas leaders to leave the country. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has been preparing to make a final push to end the war in Gaza and Lebanon. Republican Donald Trump's election this week as the next U.S. president has significantly diminished Biden's leverage during his last weeks in office. In previous rounds of ceasefire talks, disagreements over new demands that Israel introduced about future military presence in Gaza obstructed a deal, even after Hamas accepted a version of a ceasefire proposal that Biden unveiled in May. Hamas at the time viewed Israel as having moved the goal post for a deal 'last-minute,' and worried any concessions it made would be met by more demands, a source close to the talks told Reuters in August. Last November, this negotiation track in Doha led to a seven-day truce in Gaza, permitting the release of dozens of hostages held there in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian aid also flowed into the shattered coastal strip but hostilities swiftly resumed and have continued ever since. 'End hospitality to Hamas' Qatar, an influential Gulf state designated as a major non-NATO ally by Washington, has hosted Hamas' political leaders since 2012 as part of an agreement with the U.S. Following last year's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which Hamas killed 1,200 people and abducted 250 others, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told leaders in Qatar and elsewhere in the region that there could be 'no more business as usual' with Hamas. Qataris told Blinken they were open to reconsidering the presence of Hamas in the country when the time comes. Doha has come under criticism from U.S. lawmakers over its ties with the group. On Friday, 14 Republican U.S. senators wrote a letter to the Department of State asking Washington to immediately freeze the assets of Hamas officials living in Qatar, extradite several senior Hamas officials living in Qatar and ask Qatar 'to end its hospitality to Hamas' senior leadership.' Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has said repeatedly over the last year that the Hamas office exists in Doha to allow negotiations with the group and that as long as the channel remained useful Qatar would allow the Hamas office to remain open. It is unclear how many Hamas officials live in Doha, but they include several leaders touted as possible replacements for leader Yahya Sinwar, whom Israeli forces killed in Gaza last month.

Spain blocks docking of 2 US ships 'suspected of carrying arms to...	Spanish Foreign Ministry says the ships Maersk Denver and Maersk Saltaire, will not be allowed to dock at the country’s ports arguing ships' arrival would violate the country's criminal law A spokesman for Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Friday that the ships Maersk Denver, which departed New York on October 31, and Maersk Saltaire, which left New York on November 4, will not be allowed to dock in Spain following suspicions that the ships are carrying weapons destined for Israel or potentially reaching it. The move came after MP Enrique Santiago requested that the Attorney General take action, arguing that the ships' arrival would violate the country's criminal law. 'We are reviewing the information with the relevant departments that control the entry of goods into the country to clarify what happened,' a spokesman for the Spanish Foreign Ministry told the media in response to the investigation. 'If the information is confirmed, all necessary measures will be taken. The ministry continues to call for stricter oversight to ensure full compliance with its decisions on this matter.' In May, the Spanish government announced it would ban ships carrying ammunition and military equipment destined for Israel from docking at its ports. However, earlier this week reports from left-wing organizations and pro-Palestinian movements claimed that at least 25 U.S. weapons shipments to Israel stopped at the port of Algeciras between May and September this year. European Parliament member Irene Montero stated, 'We can clearly say that Spain is violating the law. The law on arms trade requires suspending approval for the transfer of weapons and ammunition if there are ‘reasonable indications’ that the material will be used to exacerbate conflicts, violate human dignity, or cause human rights violations. This means that even if the official destination of the military equipment is not Israel if there are indications that it could end up there and be used in a way that violates human rights, Spain’s government must also block its transfer.' Last week, Madrid canceled a contract to purchase ammunition for its Civil Guard from an Israeli security company. 'The Spanish government has upheld its commitment not to sell arms to Israel since the outbreak of the Gaza war. Although this was an ammunition purchase, the Interior Ministry initiated the administrative process to cancel the purchase,' the Spanish Interior Ministry announced.

Blinken holds calls in final Middle East diplomacy push	US officials say it is unclear how much leverage they have over Israel and other actors in the region now focused on the incoming administration of former President Donald Trump The outgoing Biden administration pressed ahead on Friday with diplomacy aimed at reaching deals to end Israel's war in Gaza and Lebanon, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaking to counterparts in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials have said they will make a final push to reach deals, although it is unclear how much leverage they have over Israel and other actors in the region now focused on the incoming administration of former President Donald Trump. Blinken in his calls on Friday affirmed the administration's continued desire to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible and a diplomatic resolution to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict in Lebanon, as well as discussing the conflict in Sudan, spokesperson Matthew Miller said. In his call with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, Blinken discussed 'efforts to secure the release of hostages and establish a path forward that allows Palestinians in Gaza to rebuild their lives and advance governance, security and reconstruction,' Miller said. With the UAE's Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Blinken 'discussed efforts to achieve a diplomatic resolution in Lebanon that allows civilians on both sides of the Blue Line to return to their homes,' Miller said. On Thursday Blinken also spoke to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot about both efforts.

Amsterdam bans protests after 'antisemitic squads' attack Israeli...	Mayor Femke Halsema says following attacks of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans by 'antisemitic hit-and-run squads' demonstrations are banned for 3 days; fans recount overnight events after landing safely in Israel Amsterdam banned demonstrations for three days from Friday after overnight attacks on Israeli soccer supporters by what the mayor called 'antisemitic hit-and-run squads', and Israel sent planes to the Netherlands to fly fans home. Mayor Femke Halsema said Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had been 'attacked, abused and pelted with fireworks' around the city, and that riot police intervened to protect them and escort them to hotels. Alon, a 26-year-old fan from Tel Aviv, arrived in Amsterdam on Tuesday with modest hopes for a win but high expectations for a memorable experience. In his worst nightmares, he hadn’t imagined leaving Schiphol Airport on a rescue flight, nursing a bandaged nose from punches to his face. 'Everything felt normal before the game,' Alon said. 'Sure, we know there are Arabs in Europe, and we sensed their presence. They arrived in groups, and after we split up outside the subway station at Dam Square, it all began. They started shouting ‘murderers’ at us. I, along with two others, tried to reach the nearest police station, but it was closed. We were directed to another station, and on the way, around 25 of them, some masked attacked us. The two with me managed to escape, but I took the punches. Luckily, being near the station prevented them from doing worse.' Now boarding a rescue flight, Alon expressed relief. 'I feel fine. We’re used to these things in Israel. I’ve never been afraid at an away game, and I won’t be in the future—we’ll just go in bigger groups.' A taxi driver saved me Oz Mahlev, 22, from Herzliya, arrived in Amsterdam after watching Tuesday’s match between Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid, where home fans held a 'Free Palestine' banner. 'The game was fine, but as soon as we left and got off the subway, chaos began,' he recounted. 'When we reached the square, we saw at least 100–150 Palestinians, Turks, and Moroccans waiting for us, chanting ‘Free Palestine.’' 'There were about 30 or 40 of us fans, so we weren’t scared at first. We decided to head to the hotel. But soon, a hundred people were chasing us. We tried to hold our ground, but they outnumbered us—four to one. They surrounded us, some carrying clubs, all of them prepared. It felt organized, like a planned assault. They told me to say ‘Free Palestine.’ I replied I’d never say it and recited the Shema prayer. Amazingly, after two minutes, a man came and rescued me. He was a taxi driver who pulled me out and yelled at the crowd, then drove me to safety. He truly saved me.' Oz was treated for dizziness but was mainly concerned for his friends who had scattered. 'We didn’t sleep that night. I had no idea where everyone was. We all got separated, and no one answered until 4 am. I couldn’t even check because I had to figure out how to reach my hotel and care for myself. When I finally arrived, I wanted to find everyone, but one friend didn’t respond, another hid in a different hotel’s lobby. We hadn’t expected this—everyone ran and hid. One fan had his leg broken and was taken by ambulance.' 'No more traveling for matches' Roy Hadia, 22, from Rishon LeZion, decided at the airport terminal that he’s finished with Maccabi away games. 'I’m never going abroad for Maccabi matches again, seriously. I regret leaving Israel in the first place. I went because there’s camaraderie between Ajax and Maccabi fans. We sing together, there’s a bond. We never thought they’d ambush us in the streets and attack us so brutally.' 'I ended up thinking this was it, that I was about to be killed and that people would see me on the news tomorrow, murdered in the street. I saw people getting stabbed and beaten; they were coming out of cars, attacking everyone who tried to run. Even the taxi drivers were against us—they wouldn’t pick us up, leaving us stranded. They knew we were Israeli, and they cursed us. All the taxi drivers were Muslim.' But one Jewish driver, living in the Netherlands, came to help. 'He got us to a hotel and the hospital,' Roy said. 'At first, I fought back, but they kept coming, one after another. I managed until it was ten on one, and I fell. They kicked me in the face while I was on the ground. I tried to shield myself, but they robbed me, taking my watch, then left.'

US charges Iranian man in plot to kill Donald Trump, Justice Dept...	Statement reveals that Farhad Shakeri informed law enforcement 'that he was tasked on October 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill' Trump The United States has charged an Iranian man in connection with an alleged plot ordered by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump, the Justice Department said on Friday. In a statement, the department said that Farhad Shakeri had informed law enforcement 'that he was tasked on October 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill' Trump, the department said. Shakeri allegedly told law enforcement he had no plans to formulate a plan to kill Trump within the IRGC's timeline. The department described Shakeri, 51, as an IRGC asset residing in Tehran. It said he immigrated to the U.S. as a child and was deported in or about 2008 following a robbery conviction. Shakeri is at large and believed to be in Iran, the prosecutors said. Two New York residents whom Shakeri had met in prison, Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt, have also been charged for helping Shakeri plot to kill a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin in New York, described as an outspoken critic of Iran's government who had previously been targeted for murder. Prosecutors did not identify the target, but it matched the description of Masih Alinejad, a journalist and activist who has criticized Iran's head-covering laws for women. Four Iranians were charged in 2021 in connection with a plot to kidnap her, and in 2022 a man was arrested with a rifle outside her home. Rivera and Loadholt have both been ordered detained pending trial. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Hezbollah rocket destroys a home in northern Arab village: 'I fel...	IDF says 4 rockets were intercepted, but one hit a home in Kafr Yasif, as shortly afterward some 30 additional rockets were fired and Hezbollah claimed responsibility, saying, it targeted the Tel Nof Airbase Five rockets were launched from Lebanon on Friday afternoon, striking areas in the Galilee, Yokneam, South Sharon, and central Israel’s Gush Dan region. The IDF reported that 4 rockets were intercepted, but one hit a home in Kafr Yasif, a village in the Western Galilee, causing heavy damage. No injuries were reported. Shortly afterward, about 30 additional rockets were launched toward Nahariya, Acre, Tamra, and surrounding areas. Between 3:18 and 3:20 pm, rocket sirens sounded in several cities, including Yokneam, Petah Tikva, Kiryat Ata, Yarka, Shefa-Amr, Hod Hasharon, Kfar Saba, Rosh Ha’ayin, Megiddo, and communities in South Sharon and Ramot Menashe. Hezbollah claimed responsibility, saying, 'We launched a salvo of precision rockets at Tel Nof Airbase.' 'The rocket hit a three-story home near a road,' said a resident of Kafr Yasif, who suffered minor injuries from shrapnel. 'I was nearby when I heard the explosion. It was terrifying—I felt like I was facing death.' 'Fortunately, there were only minor injuries this time, but a future hit could end worse, especially since we lack bomb shelters,' added another resident, Ibrahim Jeris. 'We’re living in a serious situation, unsure what comes next.' Abed al-Rahim, whose home was narrowly missed, recounted that he had just been in the area moments before the strike. 'I wasn’t a casualty by sheer luck,' he said. 'It’s time to end the fighting, or there will be more deaths. How much longer can we live with this constant dread? We need a solution. We don’t even have shelters, and our lives are at risk most of the time.' Shortly afterward, sirens blared again in Nahariya, Acre, Tamra, and nearby areas, as well as in the northern Galilee, in response to both rocket fire and suspected drone incursions. The IDF confirmed that 'all aerial vehicles crossing from Lebanon were intercepted.'

IDF uncovers Hezbollah training site near UN base in southern Leb...	Military says facility situated approximately 200 meters from UNIFIL base; rocket and drone alerts triggered across northern, central Israel; rocket hits Kfar Yassif home, causing property damage but no injuries The IDF reported on Friday that during ground operations in southern Lebanon against Hezbollah infrastructure, 9th Brigade reserve forces uncovered a Hezbollah training base, situated approximately 200 meters (650 feet) from a UNIFIL base. According to the military, the site was used to train operatives and store weapons. Among the items found were rocket launch sites aimed at Israeli towns, combat training manuals and operational maps of Israel. Meanwhile, Hezbollah attacks continued to target northern and central Israel on Friday, triggering rocket and drone alerts across multiple regions, including the Galilee, Sharon and Haifa Bay areas, as well as parts of the central Dan region. Rocket sirens sounded repeatedly in Acre, Tamra, Jullis, Kfar Masaryk, Nahariya and other communities throughout the Western Galilee, with some alerts extending into densely populated areas further south. According to the IDF, five rockets were launched from Lebanon, most of which were intercepted. However, one rocket hit a house in Kfar Yassif in the Western Galilee, causing property damage but no reported injuries. The IDF also reported ongoing efforts to track multiple suspected drones entering from Lebanon. Residents in affected areas were instructed to remain in sheltered areas and follow updated Home Front Command alerts. In addition to the rocket fire, several communities in the Upper Galilee, including Kibbutzim Kfar Giladi and Misgav Am, briefly faced concerns over potential ground infiltrations, prompting emergency protocols, local lockdowns and roadblocks along Highway 99. These infiltration alerts were later lifted.

Trump wants war over, sees peace with Saudi Arabia next year'	Evangelical leader Mike Evans, a former adviser to the president-elect, discusses bankrupting Iran and the Gulf States' reaction to America’s next president U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s staggering victory on Tuesday left many asking themselves what drove many Americans to support the former president at the polls. But in Israel, posters congratulating Trump had been printed and were already adorning buildings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. In a conversation with The Media Line, former Trump adviser Mike Evans stands out as a pioneer of Christian Zionism. Evans, who led the banner movement in the Jewish State, said that Trump’s views on Israel played a decisive role. 'Every Bible-believer in America believes that Israel is the Bible land,' Evans said. He cited chapter 12 of Genesis, in which God tells Abraham he will 'bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee.' 'They were very worried. They knew Donald Trump would bless Israel, and they weren’t convinced that Kamala Harris would,' he said. Evans, who is the founder of the Friends of Zion Heritage Center, which also houses the Friends of Zion Museum in Jerusalem, has devoted his career to evangelical Christian support for Israel. He said that the war in Israel will likely come to a close by the time Trump takes office. 'Trump has no desire to be a wartime president,' he said. 'He was adamantly against the Iraq war, the Afghanistan war, and he was adamantly against the Ukraine war. So, I think that President Trump is basically sending a signal to the state of Israel, to [Prime Minister] Bibi Netanyahu, even though he’s not president right now, to get everything completed by January 20.' 'Netanyahu can finish the war by January, seeing as both Hezbollah and Hamas have been significantly weakened,' Evans said. But in order to do so, he continued, Israel will have to confront Iran. 'Israel cannot strike the nuclear reactors. I wrote three books on this,' Evans noted. 'Number one, they’re hardened. Number two, they don’t even have the armaments that would destroy them completely. And unless they use low-yield nuclear, which they’ll not do, these are high-population cities.' What Israel can do, he said, is collapse Iran’s economy by striking the country’s oil refineries and ports. 'They’ll have no more money to fund Hamas, fund Hezbollah, or even make their own ballistic missiles against the state of Israel,' he noted. If Israel wants to accomplish that before Trump takes office, time is short. But Evans said that Israel is '100%' ready to do so. 'Israel has the cyber ability. They have the technology. They can knock it out,' he said. Once Iran is bankrupt, the Iranian people will rise up against their leaders, Evans predicted. 'Remember, the Shah was overthrown by an oil strike. You collapse, you bankrupt Iran, you've got 85 million people. Who are really upset about the living hell they've gone through and their country being hijacked.' 'Eighty-five percent of the population, which is 85 million, despise the mullahs,' he said. 'They can overthrow those mullahs. The mullahs will not have money to even fund terror within their own country.' Since Trump was elected, Iran has experienced an economic shockwave, Evans said, noting that Iranians have been drinking alcohol and throwing parties since the election despite official bans. 'They are going against the mullahs, and the mullahs can’t do anything because there’s too many of them,' he said. 'The window is open now. I believe Donald Trump will be extremely happy if Israel bankrupts Iran. Remember, this is the president who had the strongest sanctions,' Evans said. 'If he bankrupts Iran and knocks them out, it’s going to be wonderful.' More difficult than taking out Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, Evans said, is the matter of bringing the hostages back home. 'I don’t believe for a second that Hamas has any intention of negotiating a resolution to this crisis using the hostages,' he said. Evans said that eliminating the Iranian threat would allow Trump to facilitate peace between Israel and the Sunni world. Peace with Saudi Arabia is achievable within a year and would be the 'jewel of the Abraham Accords,' the normalization deals between Israel and four Arab countries achieved during Trump’s first term. Making peace between Israel and the Sunni world would be 'a game changer for Israel,' he said. In such a world, Iran would no longer pose a threat to Israel, funding would dry up for Palestinian terrorism, and an international coalition would emerge that could temporarily rule Gaza, he said. He noted that Saudi Arabia, which has been mentioned as a potential player in postwar Gaza, has 'zero tolerance' for antisemitism. 'When I met with the crown prince, I found him astonishingly pro-Israel,' Evans said. 'More pro-Israel than most Jewish people in America.' Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman even told Evans that his own mother was a Jew, he reported. When asked about the continued plights of the UAE during the war, Evans noted that Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi, also 'can't say enough nice things about Israel.' The positive relationship between Israel and the UAE is evident in Emirates Air and Fly Dubai’s continued service to Israel throughout the war. Evans said that the Palestinian people have been exploited by Iran. 'I believe that the Palestinians have been used as cannon fodder by the Persians who don’t want to die killing Jews. They want other people to die for them. So, they’ve gamed these people. They’ve gamed them in Lebanon. They gamed them here in Gaza. But all that’s going to stop. And when it stops, there’s an opportunity to reform, rebuild, reeducate,' he said. He said that the October 7 attack was not a result of the Palestinians’ desire for a state but rather the 'radical Islamic ideology' that Palestinians have been exposed to. 'You can’t take people that believe in their hearts that Jews invented the diseases of the world, the wars of the world, and the deceit of Satan and expect them to be reeducated in a short process. It’s going to take time. It’s going to take patience,' Evans said. He noted that some 'bad actors' will not be willing to be reeducated and will have to 'get out of there.' Eventually, peace can be achieved, but 'it’s certainly not going to happen in a peace summit that is going to talk about land,' Evans said. 'They still want to kill Jews.' Evans described Netanyahu as 'the most brilliant man on the planet.' 'The only advice that I have for him is the advice that I’ve told him many times in the past: Put all of your faith in God and seek his strength and wisdom and power,' he said. With God’s help, Evans said, Netanyahu might go down in history as 'the 21st century Winston Churchill.' Political differences, especially regarding Trump, mark some of the starkest differences between Jews in Israel and Jews in America. According to preliminary exit polls, about 79% of American Jews voted for Harris. Only about 13% of Israelis polled said they preferred Harris to Trump. Evans suggested that American Jewish support for the Democratic party could be explained in part by the sense among American Jews that promoting tolerance might protect them from antisemitism. He described the current relationship between Jewish and Christian Zionists as at an all-time high. During Prime Minister Menachem Begin’s initial courtship of the Christian Zionist movement, many Israeli Jews were suspicious of Christians’ motives. 'As the years went by, they started seeing [Christian Zionists] do good deeds and make sacrifices. And they thought, wow, they really care about us. And it’s not a hidden agenda. They really do care about us. And so this day is a brand-new day,' he said. 'The State of Israel now knows something about Christians. They know what a real Christian is,' he said. 'And Mother Teresa said to me, real Christians can’t kill Jews. They have to love Jews. Because Jesus was Jewish. And love is not something you say. It’s something you do.' It’s hard to question Evan’s love of the Jewish State. He jokingly recounted telling his wife that there was another woman in his life. 'She said, who? What?' he laughed. 'I said, yes, her name is Israel. I’ve been with her over 200 times since we got married. … So, Israel is the love of my life, and I have to be with her always.'

They ran over children, adults and women, it was plain antisemit...	Israeli witness who was present at the soccer game in Amsterdam shares details about the attacks: 'It had nothing to do with soccer, they came to lynch Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, I will never return here' Many Israelis were injured following Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans were violently chased and attacked after attending the match in Amsterdam Thursday night against Ajax. In videos on social networks, Maccabi Tel Aviv fans are seen being attacked by masked assailants and with Palestinian flags in several locations in the city. The network was flooded with shocking videos in which the tourists from Israel are seen being attacked by an angry mob in helplessness. The model Tomer Talias, a Maccabi Tel Aviv fan who came to watch the game told Ynet about the incident. 'We had a crazy night in Amsterdam,' Talias said. 'We came for a crazy experience and it ended in the most shocking way possible. 3,000 yellow fans: families, children, women, adults, all came to see Maccabi Tel Aviv play against Ajax. 'At the end of the game, after we lost and the result was unpleasant for us, we all went towards the hotel. We dispersed, some came by public transportation by train, and some by taxi. It turns out that the Muslims organized an unforgettable evening here for them, and attacked all the Israelis, all the Jews, and all the Maccabi fans. It had nothing to do with soccer, it was plain antisemitism. 'They came to lynch Maccabi Tel Aviv fans. Guys that are 16-17 years old, adults, women. They spat on them, ran over them, humiliated them, pushed them. People hid, and the attackers blew firecrackers and flares at them, and there are guys here with me who got severe injuries. The antisemitism here in Amsterdam is something I have never encountered in my life, it's crazy, everyone here hates us.' Talias also pointed out the incompetence of the local security authorities. 'The police did nothing and didn't protect the fans here. The whole way they managed security here is disgraceful, I can tell you that I will never come back here again in my life.' Talias recorded the young men on the streets looking for Israeli tourists from the hotel room he was staying in. 'We are now in the airport. We were surrounded in the hotel, I took a video that was published on my Instagram, they really tried to beat us and tried to hit us, but it's okay, we had better days, there's nothing we could do. We'll pray for the best.'

Optimism and anxiety: Arabs hope for change under Trump’s leaders...	Many in the Arab world believe Donald Trump’s reelection will address regional challenges and security concerns Significant optimism has emerged across the Arab world following former U.S. President Donald Trump’s reelection, with many officials hopeful that his second term will address longstanding regional challenges. Iran and its allied Iraqi militias, on the other hand, expressed concern about the potential reinstatement of U.S. sanctions, which targeted many of their leaders during Trump’s first term. Iran has publicly dismissed the significance of the U.S. election results, with state media reporting that there is 'no big difference' between the candidates. 'The general policies of the U.S. and Iran have not changed' following the election, Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said. Iranian-backed militias and political factions in Iraq declared Trump 'wanted' for his role in ordering the 2020 assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Popular Mobilization Forces leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The militias also warned that those celebrating Trump’s victory would face punishment. Reactions to the news were mixed across the Arab world. Gulf states largely view Trump’s presidency as a potential solution to regional crises. Sunni religious groups, on the other hand, including the Muslim Brotherhood, expressed fears that the perceived opportunities offered by previous Democratic administrations would be replaced by suppression. Speaking at the Gateway Gulf economic forum in Bahrain days before the U.S. elections, Bahrain’s minister of finance and national economy, Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, highlighted the long history of US-Bahrain cooperation. 'In the Kingdom of Bahrain, as you know, we established a free trade agreement with the United States many years ago, and our relationship with the U.S. dates back to the late 19th century, with strategic military cooperation beginning at the end of World War II,' Al Khalifa said. At the same forum, Saudi Minister of Investment Khalid A. Al-Falih remarked, 'The relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States has always been stable and growing. Regardless of which U.S. administration is in power, we have agreements and a strong strategic relationship spanning several decades.' These nonpartisan public remarks would suggest that both candidates would be equally satisfactory to Gulf leaders. But a Gulf official who asked to remain anonymous told The Media Line that 'all the Gulf countries' would prefer to deal with Trump. 'He is a very straightforward official and has nothing to hide,' the official said. 'When you sit with him, he speaks very frankly, there are no hidden matters, and when he speaks frankly, you can reach an agreement with him, but if someone does not speak frankly, you cannot trust him.' Military implications Many experts in the Arab world predict that Trump’s policies will bring an end to the fighting between Israel, Gaza, and Lebanon and contribute to an economic recovery, particularly in the oil sector. They also expect Trump to expand the Abraham Accords, the normalization deals signed between Israel and four Arab countries during Trump’s first term. 'Now we will see an end to the bloodshed in the Middle East,' Bassem Al-Khazraji, an Iraqi politician, said. 'The first step was the dismissal of Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, which will end this conflict in Palestine, Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and even Iran and Iraq.' Al-Khazraji said that 'some airstrikes' may continue in order to weaken Iran, after which the overall conflict will come to an end. 'The Trump Administration will then begin the reconstruction phase, and the Abraham Accords will expand with several countries, including Gulf and Arab states, but Iraq, Kuwait, and Algeria may be the last countries to sign these agreements, and we may see the declaration of the state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital,' he continued. Saudi journalist Saud Al-Muqhim also expressed confidence that Trump would bring 'all these wars and conflicts' to an end. 'In the next two months, we will see a cessation of war in Gaza and Lebanon, these militias will end, and I personally expect a final agreement on Palestine,' Al-Muqhim said. 'The cessation of wars must include the ongoing conflict in Sudan, and perhaps this will be possible with the cessation of all other conflicts in the world.' Omar Kaabneh, a Jordanian journalist, agreed that Trump would establish a Palestinian state—but only after eliminating Hamas and other resistance groups, he said. 'It will be headed by whoever he wants, not whoever the Palestinian people want,' Kaabneh told The Media Line. He predicted that Israel would try to escalate the conflict in the months before Trump takes office. Expanding the Abraham Accords Like Al-Khazraji, Saudi writer Abdulrazzaq Al-Mohammadi said that Trump’s second term would bring about an expansion of the Abraham Accords. 'Perhaps Trump will be a mediator between Saudi Arabia and Israel and will reach an agreement on the Saudi conditions for establishing a Palestinian state before any peace talks with Israel, and if this agreement is reached, a peace agreement will be possible,' Al-Mohammadi said. Hisham Al-Quraini, a Yemeni politician based in Britain, said the countries that made peace with Israel during Trump’s last presidency now have shaky relationships with Israel due to the ongoing war. 'Trump must work to restore them before he embarks on new agreements,' he said. Al-Quraini said that Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, Syria, and Yemen will likely reject the idea of normalizing relations with Israel. 'We may see agreements with Tunisia or Lebanon and perhaps Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the Sultanate of Oman,' he noted. Former Iraqi officer Ali al-Askar said that Trump would likely put pressure on Iraq into joining the Abraham Accords. 'Iraq will not enter, and there may be understandings regarding the Iranian militias in Iraq,' he told said. 'But we will witness how Iraq moves towards more stability.' Economic impact Abbas al-Jubouri, an Iraqi economic analyst, told The Media Line that Trump will not push for reduced oil production or increased reliance on alternative energy, resulting in lower oil prices. 'Trump will impose sanctions on Iran, the problems of foreign currency shortages and the dollar in Iraq will return again, and we may see the collapse of the Iraqi currency against the dollar,' al-Jubouri said. He said that Gulf countries will benefit economically from Trump’s election. 'Even his trade war with China will be in the interest of the world,' al-Jubouri said. 'China will increase its exports to the countries of the world and move away from the American market a little.' Khalid Al-Ajlan, a Saudi economist, offered a similar analysis. 'The Gulf countries benefited greatly from Trump’s presidency. There were pressures in the area of ​​oil prices, but there were many other areas to agree on economically,' Al-Ajlan said. He described Trump as a businessman who knows what he wants to achieve economically. 'Trump will certainly have many solutions to these crises,' Al-Ajlan said. 'We will wait and see.'

Dutch PMs condemns violent attacks on Israelis, in call with Neta...	Schoof says perpetrators will be prosecuted; Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof condemned the violent attack against Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam overnight as unacceptable. 'I followed the news from Amsterdam with disgust,' he said in a post on X . Schoof said he spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and assured him the perpetrators of the attacks would face prosecution. Netanyahu stressed the utmost importance that the Dutch government ensure the safety of all Israelis who are in the Netherlands, including those injured and affected by the events, the Prime Minister's office said in a statement. Netanyahu said he regarded this attack as an antisemitic plot against the citizens of Israel and asked for increased security for the Jewish community in the Netherlands. Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked Schoof for his response to shocking antisemitic events that unfolded overnight. The National Security Council advised Israelis earlier to remain in their hotels and if they ventured outside, to avoid wearing markings that could identify them as Israeli or Jewish. Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders tweeted about the incident. 'Looks like a Jew hunt in the streets of Amsterdam. Arrest and deport the multicultural scum that attacked Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters in our streets. Ashamed that this can happen in The Netherlands. Totally unacceptable,' he said in a post on X. 'This morning we saw shocking photos and videos, which we had hoped not to see again since October 7, of the antisemitic pogrom being carried out against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans and Israeli citizens in the heart of the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands,' President Issac Herzog said in a post. 'This serious incident is a warning sign to any country that wants to preserve its values. I trust the cooperation that is now taking place between the governments. The authorities in the Netherlands must act immediately and take all the necessary steps to protect, locate, and rescue all the Israelis and Jews under attack and eradicate the violence towards Jewish and Israeli citizens by all necessary means,' he added. Israelis who were victims of the violent attacks said Dutch police did not stop the attacks that were pre-planned and coordinated. One man identified only as Dan said in an interview that as Israeli soccer fans walked from the central train station down the main road to the Dam Square, they were accosted by groups of 10 to 15 men waiting on every block who attacked them, beating with batons, for over an hour before any police arrived. 'They were waiting on every street corner, some on motorbikes and after asking us where we were from, tried to block our way or run us over,' another man said. 'If you don't answer them, they start beating you up. Within seconds more people join in. Me and my friend were captured a number of times, I can barely walk,' he said. 'No one offered to help us but we will not go to hospital. I don't trust anyone here,' he said. 'The police beat us with their batons because they were afraid of the pro-Palestinians. We are now in the hotel and outside, cars and motorbikes drive by taking pictures.'

Israel calls on citizens in Amsterdam to return home	National Security Council issues warning to Israelis visiting the city to avoid Jewish and Israeli markings, remain in their hotels while violent attackers were out to find them; Israel's national security council on Friday, called on Israelis visiting Amsterdam to return to Israel as soon as possible. They were told first to shelter in place in their hotels if and they leave, to avoid wearing any Jewish or Israeli markings. The warning came after dozens of men some masked or carrying Palestinian flags, attacked Israeli soccer fans in the city after a match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local Ajax team, in Europe's premier league games. At least 10 Israelis were hurt and two remained out of contact, the Foreign Ministry said. 'Running away to the hotel, bringing the wounded in with you, hearing about people who can't find them, hearing crazy explosions from all sides. Fuck football, just let everyone return safely from here,' one man posted on social media. Eye witnesses said the attacks included car-ramming, stabbing and beatings in several locations around the city including attempts to break into hotels where Israeli fans were staying. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed flights to evacuate Israelis to be sent to Amsterdam on Friday. In its statement the National Security Council said Israelis who are threatened or attacked must alert the Israeli mission at +31646312161 or call the Foreign Ministry's situation room at 025303155. According to accounts from some Israelis who were attacked, Dutch police was deployed in small numbers and unable to respond to what seemed to be a coordinated attack by groups hunting down Israelis. 'I finished a four-month reserve in Gaza, and what I experienced here is no less scary. There is a war out here. They ran over me and pulled a knife on me. I am slightly injured, but I am not ready to receive treatment here, only in Israel,' one said. 'They are everywhere. No police, complete chaos. Everything was pre-planned. The police here abandoned us. Every fourth person walking the street is a Muslim who has come to attack Jews. Me and several hundred other fans are surrounded in the hotel, the police don't allow us to leave. They just want to fly home,' he said. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said the violence should be a warning sign to all of Europe from radical Islam's violence. 'Those who ignore Islamic terrorism in the Middle East will encounter it at home, in Europe and the West. Today the victims are Israelis, tomorrow it will be you, the Europeans,' he said.

Former Israeli Ambassador: Biden tied Israel's hands	ILTV speaks with former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration 'tied our hands behind our backs' and prolonged the war against Hamas, according to former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon. Speaking to ILTV News on Thursday, Ayalon said that he expects incoming U.S. President Donald Trump to be 'much more lenient' on Israel. Ayalon added that without any political pressure or considerations, he expects Trump to try to leave a legacy for himself in the Middle East. 'He has mentioned many times that he would like to bring about peace in the Middle East,' Ayalon said, noting that Israel would welcome any peace initiative that does not compromise the country's national security. He said Trump will also likely extend the Abraham Accords, which were signed under his auspices during his first tenure in the White House. 'I do not doubt that Israel will benefit from Trump's presidency,' Ayalon said.

UN to Israel: No replacement for UNRWA in Gaza and West Bank	Ambassador Danny Danon: 'We in Israel are focused on the hostages.' The United Nations has issued a strong statement, saying it's not responsible for replacing UNRWA, the Palestinian relief agency in Gaza and the West Bank, signaling that Israel will need to step in if the agency is unable to continue its work. This comes as Israel moves to cut ties with UNRWA under a new law that could end the agency's protections, movement rights, and diplomatic immunity within Israel by late January. In a letter addressed to Israel, the U.N. makes clear that it won't be taking over the responsibilities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, noting that the U.N. doesn't have the capacity—nor the obligation—to replace UNRWA's services. The decision follows Israel's announcement that it is ending a 1967 cooperation agreement with UNRWA, accusing the agency of enabling terrorism. Israel says that some UNRWA members were involved in the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israelis, while. UNRWA denies that a significant portion of its staff are affiliated with terrorist groups. While Israel has yet to respond to the recent U.N. statements formally, its current priority is addressing the ongoing hostage crisis. Israel's U.N. ambassador, Danny Danon, spoke at the U.N. alongside Mia Schem, a former hostage held by Hamas and released in a hostage exchange last November. Dannon emphasized Israel's concerns about lacking U.N. support on this critical hostage issue. 'We in Israel are focused on the hostages - the 101 innocent human beings still held captive, tortured daily by Hamas,' said Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon. 'The U.N.'s complete moral failure is unforgivable. 'It is unforgivable that while Mia was locked in a cage alongside other women, none of the U.N. bodies, neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly, found the decency to condemn Hamas and demand the hostages' release,' Danon added. He said the U.N. will continue to focus on UNRWA, 'but we will always stay focused on bringing our people home.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s12igzj11yg	2024-11-07T18:19:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/01/29/BJnW97Bqa/BJnW97Bqa_0_100_1000_563_0_small.jpg
Trump’s win sparks hope and fear: How Jewish and Christian leader...	Evangelical Christians say that Trump's reelection is 'divinely ordained.' Former President Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris has exposed some of the deep divisions within the Jewish community. Some groups labeled the outcome 'terrifying' and a 'dark moment,' while others expressed optimism for future cooperation. Jewish organizations shared statements that highlighted their priorities: fighting antisemitism, securing the U.S.-Israel relationship, defending reproductive rights, and protecting minority rights. Trump's support among Jewish voters was notably strong, reaching nearly 50% in New York, for example. The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations congratulated Trump and Vice President-elect Sen. J.D. Vance, stating, 'We trust the new administration will work to combat antisemitism and strengthen U.S.-Israel relations.' Similarly, the Jewish Federations of North America expressed readiness to 'promote our values, fight antisemitism, secure our community, and support Israel' alongside the administration. Jews from both ends of the religious spectrum – Reform and Orthodox – had something to say. The Reform movement said, 'We hope and pray that he will be a president for all Americans,' although it did criticize some of Trump's policies. The Orthodox Union said it looked forward to working with Trump to 'bring the country together to overcome the current challenges we face.' On the other end of the spectrum, HIAS called Trump’s win 'a dark moment,' while J Street described it as 'a punch in the gut.' Evangelicals, who helped put Trump in office, celebrated his victory as 'divinely ordained' and leaders called on their constituencies to pray. Evangelist Franklin Graham wrote on X, 'Congratulations to Donald Trump… I pray you look to God for guidance.' In a separate post, California pastor Greg Laurie called for prayers, adding, 'America needs restoration.' About 80% of white evangelicals backed Trump in Tuesday’s election, according to the most recent polls. He also won an estimated 67% of Latino evangelicals and 14% of Black evangelicals.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjsggwj11kl	2024-11-07T18:10:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/03/Syb86DZBW1l/Syb86DZBW1l_0_166_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Why Netanyahu Called Trump Before Kamala Harris’s Concession	Iran's spokesperson says Trump win does not make a difference. Prime Minister Netanyahu called President-elect Donald Trump even before the concession call from Vice President Kamala Harris. Vice President Kamala Harris has now called Trump to concede the race. She and Biden promised that there would be an orderly transfer of power on January 20th. 'We must accept the results of this election,' Harris said. 'Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.' Netanyahu and Trump have a strong relationship dating back to the first Trump presidency. Netanyahu visited Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago in the closing days of the political campaign. That meeting came after a tough conversation at the White House with Netanyahu and Harris about the conduct of the war in Gaza. At the time, the meeting between Netanyahu and Trump was seen as a sign that Netanyahu longed for Trump's return to the White House. Netanyahu and Trump reportedly discussed the various security threats Israel is facing. Details of the conversation were not released, except to say that security matters were discussed. Topics likely included the threats from Iran, Iranian nuclearization, and the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. During the election campaign, Iran reportedly plotted to assassinate Trump. In public statements, they now say the election changed nothing. 'Right now, the country isn’t overly concerned about Trump winning,' said Fatemeh Mohajerani, Iran's government spokesperson. 'What difference does it make? Was there really a big difference [between the two U.S. candidates]? For many of us, it doesn’t matter much.' Hamas called for Trump to end what it called the 'blind U.S. pro-Israel bias.' Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris administration remains in office until January 20. Until then, Washington and Jerusalem need to closely coordinate on the many aspects of Israel’s multi-front war. The question is how much, if at all, President-elect Trump plans to be involved in the meantime.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1f00jeiwyg	2024-11-07T17:53:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/26/S1hxu8bt0/S1hxu8bt0_0_24_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Self-described Nazi becomes first person jailed in Australia for ...	A self-described Nazi became the first person in Australia to be sentenced to prison for performing an outlawed salute when he was ordered by a magistrate on Friday to spend one month behind bars. Jacob Hersant, 25, is also the first person in Victoria state to be convicted of performing the Nazi salute. The gesture has been outlawed nationwide since he committed the offense. He was convicted in the Melbourne Magistrates Court last month of performing the salute before news cameras outside the Victoria County Court on Oct. 27, 2023. Performing a Nazi salute had been outlawed by the state parliament days earlier. Hersant was a member of the National Socialist Network, an organization that promoted white supremacy, deportation of immigrants and far-right actors, Magistrate Brett Sonnet said. While performing the salute last year, he praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and said, 'Australia for the white man.' Sonnet said his words were 'clearly racist and seek to promote white supremacy in Australia.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcpsyo11kl	2024-11-07T16:39:27-08:00

Stabbings, car ramming as Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans violently ...	Attacks throughout the city after Europa League game; Fans say: 'We were attacked, it seemed planned'; Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar: 'Serious events in the Netherlands' Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans who attended the match in Amsterdam Thursday night against Ajax were violently attacked in several locations in the city after the game. In videos on social networks, Maccabi Tel Aviv fans are seen being attacked in several locations in the city. 'They attacked fans, it looked like it was planned,' said one of the fans. In several videos posted on social media, masked men are seen trying to break into hotels where Israelis are staying. Dutch media reported that there were clashes in several locations throughout the city, and that the police are trying to control the violence.

A 30-year-old Maccabi Tel Aviv fan describes the moments of horror: 'I finished a four-month reserve in Gaza, and what I experienced here is no less scary. There is a war out here. They ran over me and pulled a knife on me. I am slightly injured, but I am not ready to receive treatment here, only in Israel. We were ambushed. I'm in the market. I saw with my own eyes children who were caught in explosions. They are everywhere. No police, complete chaos. Everything was pre-planned. The police here abandoned us.

Israeli-American businessman admits to smuggling advanced technol...	Israeli-American businessman Ilya Khan, 66, who also holds Russian citizenship, pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. federal court in Brooklyn to conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act for his role in a transnational, multi-million-dollar scheme to secure and illegally export dual-use semiconductors and other sensitive technology to Joint Stock Company Research and Development Center ELVEES (Elvees) and other entities in Russia. Elvees, one of the leading Russian developers of microchips, was sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2022 for contributing to Russia’s security services, military and defense sectors. Kahn also pleaded guilty to attempted tax evasion for failing to pay taxes on the illicit income he earned from the scheme. He agreed to pay a fine of approximately $4.92 million, and an additional $1.89 million as income tax that was not reported to the U.S. authorities. The maximum sentence he faces for the convictions is up to 20 years in prison.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk7zihq11kg	2024-11-07T13:14:35-08:00	
Destroyed terror tunnels and rocket launch pads in southern Leban...	IDF reserve forces successfully destroy over 100 terror hotbeds across southern Lebanon while facing off against Hezbollah terrorists and tunnels IDF reserve forces have eliminated hundreds of Hezbollah assets and strategic targets across southern Lebanon. The IDF’s 6th Reserve Brigade (Etzioni)is expected to be one of the reserve brigades continuing ground operations in southern Lebanon, following the withdrawal of some other reserve brigades for a much-needed leave. Meanwhile, the brigade combat team under the IDF Northern Command wraps up a successful month-long period of ground operations aimed at removing the threat of Radwan Forces' potential invasion into the Galilee. The brigade, which was the first reserve brigade to enter southern Lebanon as part of the Northern Command Brigade, has destroyed 154 Hezbollah terror structures near the border. Footage shows the commanders on Lebanese soil dedicating these achievements to all IDF soldiers and to the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Additionally, reservists have destroyed approximately 20 of Hezbollah’s underground combat tunnels and launch pads near the border, cleared around 600 dunams (about 148 acres) of dense terrorist vegetation that concealed launch infrastructure toward the Galilee and killed at least 14 terrorists without any fatalities within the brigade. One video showed how forces identified a Hezbollah terrorist squad in dense, fortified terrain in daylight. The Hezbollah squad included a lookout and combat soldiers, who were only revealed after a few minutes due to their use of the thick vegetation. With the help of tanks and drones, the brigade neutralized the squad. The soldiers were also surprised to encounter a cynical Hezbollah sign, warning in English against entry, hunting or cutting trees and vegetation at the entrance to one of the 'nature reserves' located between Bint Jbeil and the Israeli border. Over a decade ago, Hezbollah established a front organization called Green Without Borders purportedly to protect the environment with 'rangers' who are actually terrorists, preserving these 'nature reserves' as combat zones meant to allow the Radwan Force’s thousands of fighters from its 12 battalions to invade Israel in the future. Reserve troops also destroyed hundreds of buildings in southern Lebanese Shiite villages, effectively flattening entire terror-infested neighborhoods that had been transformed into military bases, including the densely populated casbahs of some of these villages. Given the growing need and demand for engineering tools, the brigade used not only bulldozers from its combat engineering battalion, which operated non-stop in Lebanese territory to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure but also engineering teams comprised of civilian tractors leased by the IDF and operated by IDF Home Front Command heavy equipment operators. 'Hezbollah took advantage of both the terrain and the open areas to build itself up,' said the brigade’s commander, Col. (res.) Sarel Sabag. 'We saw the entire area as one unified combat zone – and this is what Hezbollah did as part of its plan to invade the Galilee. 'Hezbollah has built itself up over the years, with the ability to study the enemy and observe where it's positioned – I think this has made us more prepared. Ultimately, it’s also about the power of maneuvering and the locations we've entered.' He noted that the fighting in urban and dense areas is very complex. 'The biggest achievement is ultimately the ability to destroy these infrastructures and create an area that looks entirely different,' he explained. He also described his close encounters with terrorists, saying: 'The enemy tried to pull us into the terrain,' while dealing with anti-tank fire and rockets. 'That didn’t stop us. We pushed forward with full force to accomplish the mission,' he stressed.

Israels ambassador to US will end tenure on day of Trump's inaugu...	Amb. Mike Herzog's term has been extended until January 20, inauguration day in the US; Netanyahu plans to announce his new envoy in the coming days; These are the possible candidates to fill the plum position Israel's ambassador to the United States will end his duties on the day of Donald Trump's inauguration, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he will name a new ambassador in the next day or so. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he has extended Herzog's term until Inauguration Day, on January 20, but not beyond that. 'The prime minister will, in the coming days, announce the appointment of a new ambassador who will soon leave for the transition period,' the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. Netanyahu, according to the announcement, 'thanked Ambassador Herzog for his work over the last three years, and for for his significant and professional contribution, especially during the challenging war period. Ambassador Herzog has honorably represented the State of Israel before administration officials, Congress, civil society organizations, the global media, and the American Jewish community.' The assessment in the political echelon is that Netanyahu would like to see current Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer return to the position of ambassador in Washington, but Dermer refused. Netanyahu's political advisor, Ophir Falk, reportedly has thrown his hat into the ring, but it is not likely that he will be appointed. Other candidates for the position are Knesset member Boaz Bismuth who is considered close to Netanyahu and previously served as ambassador to Mauritania, as well as the Israeli consul in New York, Ofir Akunis. A statement on behalf of Akunis says that 'contrary to reports, he did not pressure and is not pressing to accept the position of ambassador in Washington.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ofsocwyl	2024-11-07T12:31:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2022/07/01/HJ9o8jn95/HJ9o8jn95_0_89_2048_1153_0_small.jpg

France furious over diplomats detained in Jerusalem during state ...	Shin Bet operatives detain two two French guards with diplomatic visas after confronting them over request by French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot to enter a Jerusalem church alone; French minister says incident 'liable to weaken ties' An unusual diplomatic incident took place on Thursday during a state visit by French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot in Jerusalem. Upon his arrival at the Eleona Church, also known as the Church of the Pater Noste, on the Mount of Olives, a site Paris claims is under French government control, Barrot refused to allow Shin Bet security guards to enter with him. A commotion ensued, during which two security guards from the French consulate – both fully recognized diplomats who carry diplomatic visas – were detained. The two French security guards refused to identify themselves and were taken into custody, though the Foreign Ministry said they were 'immediately released' after identifying themselves as diplomats. Footage of the incident, taken in front of French journalists accompanying Barrot, shows the two men being placed into separate police cars. In partial footage circulated on social media, police officers are seen confronting one of the French guards, attempting to detain him. The guard, shouting angrily in French and refusing to be touched, yelled: 'Take your hands off me.' The confrontation escalated, with the French guard shouting 'Don’t touch me!' in English before officers forced him to the ground. Israeli officials claimed that the French guards pushed a police officer during the altercation, while French sources denied any use of violence by their guards. The two men – described in the French media as members of the gendarmerie, a French military-police force – were released after presenting their diplomatic IDs. Barrot himself canceled his visit to the church following the incident, telling accompanying reporters that 'I will not enter the Eleona Domain today, because Israeli security forces entered with weapons, without prior French authorization, without agreeing to leave.' The French news agency AFP reported that the foreign minister, calling the incident 'unacceptable,' expressed anger over the conduct of the Israeli security personnel. 'The integrity of the four domains that France is responsible for here in Jerusalem must be respected,' he said. Barrot added that this diplomatic incident was 'liable to weaken the ties that I came here to cultivate with Israel, at a time when all of us need to help the region advance on the path toward peace.' The Chapel of the Ascension, located within the larger complex known as the Pater Noster Church, houses a Benedictine monastery and serves as a historic pilgrimage site for Christians. France administers the area and claims ownership of it — as well as several other locations in Jerusalem, which have previously been sites of tense diplomatic incidents due to a refusal to allow Israeli forces entry. 'Every foreign minister visiting Israel on an official visit is accompanied by state security and this security follows the minister throughout all parts of their visit. The French Foreign Minister's visit to the Pater Noster Church was also accompanied by the Personal Security Unit,' the Foreign Ministry said following the incident. 'This was done to ensure the safety of the visiting minister and these arrangements were clarified in advance in preparatory discussions with the French Embassy in Israel. During the visit, a dispute arose between the Israeli security forces and two French guards who refused to identify themselves. The two were detained by the police and released immediately after identifying as diplomats.' The French Foreign Ministry expressed outrage over the incident and announced that Israel’s ambassador to France would be summoned for clarification in Paris. A French diplomatic source commented on the objectives of Foreign Minister Barrot's visit, saying that in his meetings with outgoing Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer Barrot held 'substantive discussions' regarding Lebanon, Gaza, Iran and the West Bank. Regarding Lebanon, the source said discussions focused on the 'security guarantees Israel expects as part of a diplomatic cease-fire solution, based on efforts led by the U.S. and France.' The source expressed concern over Israeli policy in the West Bank, which, according to them, 'undermines the Palestinian Authority, particularly in the economic and financial sectors,' as well as the ongoing settlement expansion and what was described as 'impunity for violent settlers.' The source added that Barrot also conveyed concern over Israel's decision to sever ties with the UN Palestinian aid agency UNRWA, warning the move would harm humanitarian aid for Palestinians. 'France calls for defining a credible and responsible 'post-war' plan, including the return of the Palestinian Authority.'

Hezbollah operates from heritage sites in Lebanon, but Israel get...	Lebanon turns to UNESCO claiming Israel is trying to 'erase' the country's cultural heritage; Hezbollah uses the ancient sites to store weapons and launch rocket attacks on Israel Lebanon blamed Israel for trying to 'erase' the country's cultural heritage after several UNESCO World Heritage sites in the country, used by Hezbollah to operate and fire rockets against Israel, were targeted by the Israeli Air Force to combat the terror group’s operations. The recent strikes in the area targeted Hezbollah terrorists. The IDF says it exercises discretion in every strike near sensitive structures, something Lebanon claims is false. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati addressed the issue this week, saying that Lebanese officials 'call for an immediate cease-fire to halt the violence and protect our country’s cultural heritage and the ancient archaeological sites in Baalbek and Tyre.' Lebanon hosts numerous heritage sites that attract tourists, significantly contributing to the national economy. A few days ago, the Qatari outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed published an article about the strikes on the sensitive sites, alleging that Israel intends to destroy antiquities and heritage sites in its strikes on Lebanon. According to the article, one of the sites recently impacted by the strikes is the Dome of Duris in Baalbek. Reports from Lebanon indicate part of the structure was damaged and the stability of the ancient columns was compromised. This ancient structure holds historical significance, featuring a type of temple supported by eight red granite columns. There are also claims that the Baalbek temples were subject to strikes within approximately 500 meters (0.3 miles) of their location. Baalbek’s temple complex was recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984. The strikes have also targeted Tyre’s historical legacy, according to reports. Tyre is one of the oldest cities in the Mediterranean region and holds significant historical value. Its antiquities span various historical periods from 5,000 BCE to the 19th century. Al-Araby Al-Jadeed also alleged that Israel struck the famous market in Nabatieh in southern Lebanon, destroying it. The market is part of the city’s heritage and cultural and social identity. The laws of war prohibit actions against cultural assets and use them to support war efforts, the article noted. It also included a list of numerous religious sites in southern Lebanon that were reportedly attacked by Israel. These included mosques in various border towns and villages. It failed to mention, however, that Hezbollah terrorists had hidden weapons in these locations. During the war, the IDF revealed that terrorist organizations both in Gaza and Lebanon operate from places that are forbidden to be used in war under international law, such as mosques. Lebanese Culture Minister Mohammad Mortada told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that, since the beginning of the war, 'Israel has targeted cultural sites, like the attack on the fortress in the village of Tebnine.' According to him, Israel is attempting to erase the Lebanese people’s identity, memory and history. He added that Lebanon has signed numerous international agreements related to the protection of antiquities. 'We respect international conventions and hope for reciprocity from all sides,' he said. He called on the international community 'to compel Israel to adhere to and respect international conventions.' The minister also issued a letter to UNESCO, demanding the protection of cultural sites in the country, and said that the Lebanese Culture Ministry 'has begun developing approaches to restoring and rebuilding cultural heritage alongside friendly nations and a support fund will be established for this purpose.' A UNESCO meeting on the matter is scheduled for November 12.

Pakistan Senate panel passes bill criminalizing 'promotion of Zio...	Legislation introduces prison terms for promoting Zionism, displaying Zionist symbols in effort to curb incitement amid concerns over Gaza war; 'They are martyring children in Gaza under this ideology' In an unprecedented move, Pakistan's Senate Standing Committee on Interior approved a bill on Thursday imposing prison sentences for promoting Zionism. The legislation aims to curb incitement to communal hatred amid concerns over the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The new bill stipulates that promoting Zionism to incite communal hatred can lead to a prison term of up to three years. Displaying Zionist symbols with the intent to cause public unrest carries a sentence of up to two years. Senator Afnanullah Khan of the ruling Muslim League-N party introduced the Criminal Law Amendment Bill. Khan claimed that the ideology of Zionism promotes violence, citing the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Speaking during a session led by Senator Faisal Saleem Rehman, Khan asserted that the world is currently influenced by Zionist ideologies. He stated, 'It is written in the books of Zionism that those who do not agree with you should be killed. They are martyring children in Gaza under this ideology.' Khan further emphasized that Zionist propaganda and symbols would be banned in Pakistan, adding that there are individuals in the country with Zionist beliefs. The bill faced no opposition from committee members or the Interior Ministry during the meeting and was subsequently approved. Under the bill, arrests for promoting Zionism or displaying Zionist symbols must be carried out with a warrant and will be classified as bailable offenses. The introduction of this legislation is notable given the lack of reported cases of Zionist promotion or propaganda in Pakistan. Historically, a notable Jewish community lived in Karachi, Pakistan’s commercial center, and Rawalpindi, its garrison city, prior to the nation’s establishment. In central Karachi, the landmark Merewether Clock Tower still bears the Star of David, reflecting the lasting legacy of this community. Over time, a busy transit hub has developed around this historic site, with hundreds of thousands of Muslims passing by daily on their way to work. -This article is written by Arshad Mehmood and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjzhmfcwyg	2024-11-07T09:24:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2017/12/07/8201998/8201998_0_0_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Lithuanian haredi leader meets IDF officials while urging followe...	As IDF intensifies efforts to recruit Haredim, issuing hundreds of draft notices, Rabbi Moshe Hillel Hirsch met with senior military officials while leading a determined campaign to prevent enlistment A leader of the Lithuanian ultra-Orthodox faction, Rabbi Moshe Hillel Hirsch, met recently with top military officials to discuss the issue of Haredi enlistment in the IDF. At the same time, he held meetings with young men who had received their initial draft notices, urging them not to report for service. This comes as the ultra-Orthodox leadership fights to protect the Torah world from what they see as the disruptive influence of military service, emphasizing that yeshiva students belong in study halls, not in the army. In his message to the young men, Hirsch, a senior figure in the ultra-Orthodox community and a leader of the Degel HaTorah party, said: 'I bless you to have the strength to dedicate yourselves to Torah, so that you may grow into Torah scholars. Do not be afraid – you are part of Olam Hatorah and have a higher calling.' Earlier this week, outgoing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant met with Rabbi Baruch Shochat, the Karlin-Stolin Rebbe, leader of one of the oldest and most recognized Hasidic sects. 'It was a significant, positive meeting, covering matters of security and the importance of IDF enlistment,' Gallant’s associates said. Yet recently, even young men who are not yeshiva students have faced concerted efforts to discourage their enlistment. Army representatives have visited some yeshivas to persuade students at least to attend their initial draft call, promising to explore options for deferment or other arrangements afterward. Military leadership emphasized, however, that each individual is personally responsible for responding to their draft notice and, if they do not comply, they will face consequences.

Hezbollah launches continuous rocket barrages on Israel's north	Dozens of rockets launched in three barrages over less than two hours Thursday afternoon, striking the Galilee, Haifa, and Haifa Bay area; Rocket scored direct hit on vehicle next to a house in Kiryat Yam, and a kindergarten in Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk was damaged Dozens of Hezbollah rockets were fired over less than two and a half hours in barrages targeting the Galilee, Haifa and the Haifa Bay area on Thursday. Around 2 p.m., some 40 rockets were launched at the western Galilee, Haifa Bay and the upper Galilee. Some of the rockets were intercepted, though there were also direct hits. An 85-year-old man sustained minor injuries from shrapnel to his lower limbs, while another person was hospitalized in Nahariya with anxiety. One rocket hit Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk, where 18-year-old Sivan Sadeh was killed on Wednesday while working in the kibbutz’s orchards. This time, the debris – possibly from intercepted fragments – landed near a kindergarten. The children took shelter and were unharmed, though the kindergarten sustained damage. Shortly after 3:03 p.m., hundreds of thousands of residents again entered protected areas as sirens blared across Haifa and nearby communities. The IDF later confirmed that multiple rockets had crossed from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted, while others landed in open areas. An hour later, a new wave of sirens sounded in the Haifa Bay area and western Galilee. Videos from Haifa and Acre showed numerous interceptions lighting up the sky. Meanwhile, the IDF continued its strikes in Lebanon, where three people reportedly were killed in an Israeli drone attack on a vehicle in Sidon. According to reports, six others were injured, including five UN peacekeeping troops from UNIFIL, whose injuries were described as minor. Al-Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper, reported that three people were in the vehicle at the time of the strike, saying: 'They slowed down at a military checkpoint, and then a drone fired a missile at them.' The Lebanese army issued a statement, saying that 'Israel attacked a vehicle at the Al-Awali checkpoint in Sidon. Three civilians in the vehicle were killed, three soldiers at the checkpoint were injured, and four members of UNIFIL's Malaysian unit, which were passing by, also were wounded.'

Spanish airline Air Europa cancels flights to Israel through end ...	Spanish airline Air Europa announced Thursday the cancellation of its flights to Israel until November 30 . On Wednesday, we will recall, a company plane that was on its way to land in Israel turned around in the air and returned to Madrid due to the firing of missiles from Lebanon. An alarm was sounded twice in the Israel region, and in one of the cases a missile fell near the airport causing the activity on the runways to stop for several minutes.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryxz5l5zke	2024-11-07T06:19:51-08:00	
Ukrainians feel both hope and pragmatism over Trump election	Ukraine fears Trump might now push them to lay down arms and cede a fifth of their territory to Russia, as soldiers on the front lines are questioning if US support will be cut off; The president-elect has previously criticized ongoing aid to Kyiv, calling Zelensky the 'best salesman in the world' with a hint of sarcasm and pledging to end the war 'in a day' Soldiers in a Ukrainian artillery battery on the front lines in the country’s east were only vaguely aware Wednesday of American election results pointing to Donald Trump’s victory. But they were firm in their hopes for the next president of the United States. Their entrenched artillery battery fires on Russian forces daily — and takes fire nearly as often. Just the other day, one of their overhead nets snared a Russian drone. 'I hope that the quantity of weapons, the quantity of guns for our victory will increase,' the unit’s 39-year-old commander, who goes by the name Mozart, said in the hours before Trump’s win was confirmed. 'We don’t care who the president is, as long as they don’t cut us off from help, because we need it.' Trump’s election throws into doubt American support for Ukraine – and ultimately whether Kyiv can beat back Russia’s invasion. But Mozart – who like other soldiers Wednesday did not give his name in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol – is among many Ukrainians who hope that Trump will hold the line on American support for their country. Russian forces have recently made gains in the east, although the commander described the front-line situation as 'static.' Yurii Fedorenko, commander of a Ukrainian drone unit also in the Kharkiv region, wears an American flag patch on his uniform. He is keenly aware of how critical American support has been for Ukraine. 'Suppose I were told that there was some country across the ocean that I didn’t even know where it was, and that I had to pay money from my taxes to this country so that it could exist,' said Fedorenko, whose call-sign is Achilles – the same name as his battalion. 'I don’t know how I would react. Therefore, I really thank the Americans and I really believe that they have a good education system, because the vast majority of people understand why the United States helps third countries, and in particular now Ukraine.' It was under Trump that the United States first sent weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, in 2017. Those Javelin anti-tank missiles were crucial to Ukraine’s ability to fend off the full-scale invasion in 2022. But Trump overall is wary of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts. Trump, who has touted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. He characterized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid. Zelensky was among the first world leaders to publicly congratulate Trump, and said the two discussed how to end 'Russian aggression against Ukraine' when they met in September. 'I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together,' he wrote on the social media platform X. Zelensky later wrote that he had spoken to Trump and congratulated him on 'his historic landslide victory — his tremendous campaign made this result possible. I praised his family and team for their great work. We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation.' Trump has said repeatedly he would have a peace deal done between Ukraine and Russia within a day if elected, although he has not said how. During his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win – raising concerns that Kyiv would be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations he oversaw. In Kyiv, which comes under attack from Russian drones near daily, 18-year-old Viktoriia Zubrytska was pragmatic about her expectations for the next American president. She thinks Ukraine will be forced to give up territory in exchange for peace under a Trump presidency. But she said she preferred that to what she called the false hope that the Biden administration offered. 'We will live in a world of facts where we will be certain what awaits us,' said the law student. 'Certainty and objective truth is much better than lies and life in illusions.' According to VoteCast, 74% of voters who supported Harris favored continuing aid to Ukraine, while only 36% of Trump’s voters did. AP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. On the front lines in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region, Andriy, who goes by 'Rodych' or 'Relative,' said Ukraine would 'come up with something' no matter what happened in the U.S. vote. 'We are a shield between Europe and Russia,' he added. 'Other countries do not understand what is happening here, they see it on TV and for them it is far away.' America’s NATO allies were closely watching the election. France and Germany arranged a last-minute, top-level defense meeting Wednesday in Paris to discuss the results, and Ukraine is likely to be central to the meeting. The two leading powers in the European Union provide significant support to Ukraine to defend it against Russia’s war. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, citing a 'more aggressive Russia,' also invoked Trump’s motto of 'peace through strength.' Rutte praised Trump for his work during his first term to persuade countries in the alliance to ramp up defense spending. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had no information on whether Putin plans to congratulate Trump, but he emphasized that Moscow views the U.S. as an 'unfriendly' country. Peskov reaffirmed the Kremlin’s claim that U.S. support for Ukraine amounted to involvement in the conflict, telling reporters: 'Let’s not forget that we are talking about the unfriendly country that is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.' Still, he noted Trump’s promise to end the war swiftly once elected. 'The U.S. can help end the conflict,' Peskov said, adding that 'it certainly can’t be done overnight.' In rare agreement with the Kremlin, Fiona Hill, a former intelligence expert in the George W. Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, said it was increasingly clear that Europe had to step up its capacities. 'If Trump is saying, I’m going to sit down and resolve this in 24 hours, it’s highly unlikely that’s going to be the case,' Hill said in a podcast with the European Council on Foreign Relations a few days ahead of the election. 'You can say the United States is going to stop supplying weapons, and you can hold everything out for leverage, but it’s not for the United States to do at this particular point. Because there are already other Europeans in the game in terms of assistance to the Ukraine.'

Iran says US elections are an opportunity to review 'wrong approa...	Foreign ministry says Tehran had bitter experiences with various US governments' past policies, and the elections are an opportunity to review Middle East policy The U.S. elections are an opportunity to review the 'wrong approaches' of the American government, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Thursday according to state media, after Donald Trump won the presidency on Wednesday. Former President Donald Trump's return to the White House could mean tougher enforcement of U.S. oil sanctions against Iran, which he initiated in 2018 after exiting a nuclear pact between Tehran and global powers. 'We had bitter experiences with various U.S. governments' past policies and approaches. Elections are an opportunity to review the wrong approaches of the past,' Baghaei said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in September that Tehran is ready to end its nuclear standoff with the West, which accuses it of seeking the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only. Outgoing President Joe Biden attempted to revive the nuclear deal with Iran in negotiations but failed to reach a new agreement. Trump has not made clear whether he might reopen the issue. 'What is important for Iran will be how we evaluate the actions of the U.S. government,' Baghaei added. Meanwhile, when asked about Donald Trump's election victory, Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim al-Moussawi said on Thursday that the Lebanese terrorist group welcomes any effort to stop the war in Lebanon but does not pin its hopes for a cease-fire on a particular U.S. administration, 'It might be a change in the party who is in power, but when it comes to Israel, they have more or less the same policy,' Moussawi told Reuters. 'We want to see actions, we want to see decisions taken,' he said. In addition, Arab and Western sources said Wednesday that Trump might reimpose his 'maximum pressure' policy through increased sanctions on Iran’s oil industry. They also suggested he may encourage Israel to target Iran's nuclear sites and conduct 'targeted assassinations.'

Assaf Sadeh says he tried calling his son Sivan, but he didn't answer, so he rushed to the field and already had a feeling something was wrong; 'He followed Home Front Command instructions but it didn't help,' he adds Assaf Sadeh, the father of Sivan Sadeh, 18, from Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk, who was killed by a Hezbollah rocket strike while working in a field in Western Galilee, spoke with Ynet about the tragedy: 'I spoke to him five minutes before and asked if I could bring him something to eat. He was working in the fields and had gone to check on the broccoli crops. We returned to the kibbutz and tried calling him, but he didn’t answer. That’s when we started to understand it might be him.' He continued, 'I grabbed the car and raced to the field. When I got there, I saw police and ambulances. I sent the manager, a close friend of ours, and told him, ‘I can’t go near—I need you to tell me.’ He said Sivan had an earring, and then I knew it was him. When I left the house, I already had a feeling it was him. It’s the most unexpected and senseless thing in the world.' Assaf added that, as always, his son had followed Home Front Command’s instructions. 'He had experienced rocket fire before, knew to get out of the car, and lay in the ditch—but it didn’t help. He was the most beautiful and unique kid there was,' he said. 'He worked hard and fought for what he believed in, in his own way.' Sivan had been set to join the combat forces. 'He had a perfect health profile and was called up to the paratroopers,' his father shared. 'I’m a man of action. I don’t trust anything that’s just talk. A year has passed, the hostages are still there, and my son is no longer here—yet they keep talking. I want to see action.' The young man’s body was discovered on Wednesday in an agricultural field near the cemetery at the kibbutz. A farmer passing by spotted him and alerted emergency responders, who were forced to declare him dead at the scene. 'He was unconscious with severe shrapnel injuries,' said Magen David Adom medic Netanel Ben-Yehuda. 'We checked his vital signs, but he had no pulse and was not breathing. His injuries were fatal, and we had no choice but to declare his death.' In Sivan’s senior yearbook photo, a quote reads, 'He who fears taking risks, risks a life of mediocrity.'

How residents are expected to even consider returning when rocke...	Border residents grow frustrated as heavy Hezbollah rocket fire persists, with single barrage on town of Avivim damaging property, wounding civilians and killing soldier; 'Homes, property, packing houses and farmland—the damage is heartbreaking' As Hezbollah rockets continue to rain down on northern Israel, residents of border communities like Avivim say they no longer feel safe returning home. Wednesday’s heavy barrage, which left three residents wounded and caused extensive property damage, underscored the community’s fears. In Avivim alone, 12 homes and agricultural facilities were hit, while fires raged through the village. The IDF confirmed Thursday that Sergeant Ariel Sosnov, 20, of Jerusalem, a soldier in the 605th Engineering Battalion of the 188th Armored Brigade, was killed in Wednesday’s attacks. Sosnov died when a Hezbollah rocket struck the moshav, making him the latest casualty in the ongoing violence. Amid Sofer, head of the Merom HaGalil Regional Council, voiced his frustration: 'I don’t understand how residents are expected to even consider returning when rockets are still falling. Security means no sirens, no rockets.' With more than 50 rockets fired from Lebanon on Wednesday, over ten reportedly landed in Avivim alone, striking homes and igniting fires that took 15 fire crews hours to control. 'Large parts of the moshav were destroyed,' said Eyal Peretz, a community board member. 'Homes, property, packing houses and farmland—the damage is heartbreaking.' Residents, already weary from decades of conflict, are calling for a long-term solution. 'We’ve been told repeatedly it’s safe to come back, but then the rockets hit,' said Ammi Dahan, who returned to Avivim last month. 'To truly bring people back, we need restoration, jobs and infrastructure.' Emergency responders have been actively working in Avivim to contain fires and assist residents. Meanwhile, the IDF has continued strikes on Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon as hostilities along the border persist.

Defense Ministry says jet deliveries will begin in 2031, with 4–6 planes arriving annually; agreement includes option for 25 additional jets; 'Deal marks major milestone in deepening US-Israel defense cooperation,' ministry says The Defense Ministry signed a $5.2 billion agreement with Boeing on Wednesday to purchase 25 advanced F-15IA fighter jets, funded through U.S. military aid. The deal includes an option for 25 additional jets in the future. According to the ministry, jet deliveries will begin in 2031, with 4–6 planes arriving annually. The authorization was signed by Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir during a visit to the U.S. last month, following negotiations led by Israel’s procurement delegation and the Israeli Air Force. The new F-15IA jets will feature advanced weapon systems, including cutting-edge Israeli technology, as well as enhancements to extend flight range, increase payload capacity and improve performance in various operational scenarios. 'These upgrades will enable the Israeli Air Force to maintain its strategic superiority in facing current and future challenges in the Middle East,' the Defense Ministry said. 'This deal marks a major milestone in deepening U.S.-Israel defense cooperation and demonstrates our mutual commitment to regional security.' 'The Defense Ministry is constantly working, according to a structured plan, to strengthen the resilience and force-building capacity of the IDF,' Defense Ministry Director-General Zamir said. 'Since the start of the war, we have signed deals valued at roughly NIS 150 billion ($40 billion). Alongside unprecedented procurement of advanced munitions and weaponry, we are continuing to advance long-term buildup agreements. 'The new F-15 squadron will join the third F-35 squadron we signed for this year. This represents an unprecedented enhancement for our air force and the IDF’s long-term strategic capabilities, whose critical value was demonstrated in the Iron Swords war. At this time, the Defense Ministry is promoting deals to strengthen all branches of the IDF—in the air, at sea, on land, in intelligence and beyond.' 'Boeing is proud of its longstanding partnership with Israel, spanning from the nation’s founding until today,' Boeing Israel President Maj. Gen. (res.) Ido Nehushtan. 'The company will continue to work closely with the U.S. and Israeli governments to supply the advanced F-15IA aircraft within established military sales procedures.'

Ron and Orna Netura, parents of Omer who holds American citizenship, say Gallant was a real ambassador for them in the government, and they hope outgoing and incoming US administrations will work together to bring the hostages back Ron and Orna Neutra, parents of Omer, a dual Israeli-American citizen who is currently held hostage in Gaza, shared Wednesday their feelings following the dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and also spoke about their thoughts on how Donald Trump’s return to the White House might impact the potential release of their son, who holds American citizenship. 'We feel very anxious. Firing a defense minister at a time of war is obviously anxiety-inducing and specifically Minister Gallant who has been an advocate for our son who is a soldier and for the hostages. And who has been claiming for months that the situation in Gaza has reached a point where getting out the hostages and reaching an agreement is a top priority morally and the situation on the ground is ripe for a deal. And so him being fired right now leaves us, you know, with a lot of anxiety about the future and about the future of our child.' What are your thoughts after the dismission? 'Our son was born here in New York, made a decision to immigrate to Israel, become Oleh Chadash, a new immigrant. He became a lone soldier. He was fighting for Israel as a true Zionist and now for close to 400 days, we've been fighting to get him back together with the other hostages.' 'Minister Gallant was a real ambassador for us in the government. In his absence, we are very concerned that Netanyahu's government is not completely focused on bringing the hostages and leaving them behind for so long knowing that they are dying there. And that's very concerning to us. And we urge the Israeli government to do everything in its power now and work with the new administration and President Biden until he leaves office to finish the war and bring the hostages back. It's time it's long overdue.' Yes, you mentioned President Biden. Let's talk about the presidential election you have both ties with the Democratic and Republican parties with both parties. Will Trump as a president will bring us closer maybe to a deal? 'Well, Trump has already said that he would really like to see the war in Gaza end by the time he's inaugurated. And we see this as a window of opportunity where we have a president that is an outgoing president that would want to instill his legacy. This has always been important to Biden. The release of the hostages has been something that he's been working on tirelessly for the whole year. And we really hope that both administrations, the incoming and the outgoing work together to get this done.'

IDF identifies soldier killed in combat in north	Army names Sergeant Ariel Sosnov, 20, of Jerusalem, a soldier in the 188th Armored Brigade's 605th Engineering Battalion; Kfir Brigade soldiers seriously wounded in Gaza; IDF death toll in war reaches 781 The IDF on Thursday morning identified Sergeant Ariel Sosnov (Sasonov), 20, of Jerusalem, a soldier in the 188th Armored Brigade's 605th Engineering Battalion, as having been killed in combat in northern Israel. In a separate incident, a soldier from the Kfir Brigade's 90th Nahshon Battalion was severely wounded during fighting in northern Gaza on Wednesday, the IDF confirmed. Since the outbreak of the war, 781 IDF personnel have been killed in action. Meanwhile, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi suggested that Israel could expand its ground operations in Lebanon. 'Alongside diplomatic efforts for understandings in Lebanon, we must continue planning for further combat in Lebanon, including deepening ground operations,' he said during a situation assessment, noting that Israel will act as needed. 'We continue targeting Hezbollah assets across the region—in southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, Beirut and Syria.' Over the weekend, the IDF reported that two soldiers were killed in combat in Jabaliya, northern Gaza. They were named as Staff Sgt. Itay Parizat, 20, from Petah Tikva, and Staff Sgt. Yair Hananya, 22, from Mitzpe Netofa. Both soldiers served with the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade. A day earlier, the military reported on Friday that Captain Yarden Zakay, 21, from Hadera, a platoon commander in the Givati Brigade's Shaked Battalion, succumbed to his injuries after being severely wounded during combat in southern Gaza on September 17, 2024.

‘Iran exposed and vulnerable’—attack on Israel unlikely	Jonathan Conricus: Israel is ready for Iran's nuclear threat, but regime change is long-term solution Iran is unlikely to attack Israel – if it knows what’s good for it, according to former IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus. 'It does not make sense for them to strike at Israel again and attack Israel again,' Conricus said during this week’s recording of the new ILTV News Podcast. 'They are very exposed and vulnerable. I would turn down the rhetoric, and I would be very careful.' He explained that if Iran chose to attack Israel a third time, Israel would have 'justification' to respond more forcefully than before. Currently, 'the situation on the ground… is that Iran, its capital, its most important military infrastructure, its nuclear sites, its economic infrastructure, all of that is now exposed because of what the Israeli Air Force did last round. We peeled away almost all strategic air defenses.' He added, 'The Iranians can talk tough, but in terms of actually doing anything, I would be very surprised if they actually mustered the courage to do it.' Conricus noted that while Israel could already strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, the question is whether such an attack would be effective. After witnessing Israel’s destruction of Iraq’s nuclear reactor in 1981 and Syria’s in 2007, Iran developed a more clandestine, dispersed, and even underground nuclear program. To inflict long-term strategic consequences, Israel would need much stronger bombs, which it currently lacks. 'I think that what Israel would be able to do would be to deliver a significant blow to the Iranian nuclear military program,' Conricus said. 'I am not sure that Israel would be able to take it out in its entirety, and I’m not sure that that would be the wisest thing to do, because it could invite additional Iranian steps and escalate the situation in a way that wouldn’t be good for Israel.' Instead, he suggested, Israel should focus on applying pressure on the Iranian regime and supporting the Iranian people who have been suffering under its oppression. Conricus pointed out that tens of millions of Iranians oppose the regime, and there is significant internal unrest in the country. 'I think what the West should be doing… and what Israel is doing is actually thinking about that strategy of helping the Iranian people and opposing the regime. Once that happens, it can set into motion a lot of positive things that would really influence the Middle East. Kinetic action against the Iranian nuclear program is one thing, but I think it’s limited in terms of its scope. 'Attacking the regime itself and supporting the Iranian people is of a totally different dimension, and I think it’s the much smarter, long-term approach.'

Watch: Hezbollah missile lands near Israel’s main airport	Sirens sound at Ben Gurion Airport, briefly disrupting operations for several minutes; passengers, however, remained calm; 'Hezbollah won't disrupt our lives' The missile barrage on Wednesday morning targeting central Israel, which triggered sirens in many localities and led to missile fragments falling in Ra'anana and an Iranian-made Hezbollah Fateh-110 solid-fueled surface-to-surface ballistic missile landing near Ben Gurion Airport, did not cause significant delays in the flight schedule. The airspace was closed for a few minutes, but the airport quickly resumed operations without major delays in departures and arrivals. The morning barrage was not the only incident in the area. In the afternoon, another launch triggered sirens in dozens of communities around Ben Gurion Airport. The IDF reported that a single projectile was intercepted, and there were no effects on the airspace. 'We heard the loud boom. I was in one of the parking lots when the sirens started, and we ran to a shelter. It was a bit scary,' said Eden Zarka, a taxi dispatcher. Other airport workers were less concerned: 'Nothing different happened this time. We did what we always do during a siren—went to the shelter. Even what happened here with the falling fragment isn't really scary. It's quite far from the terminal.' Currently, mostly Israeli airlines are operating at Ben Gurion Airport, with only about 16,000 passengers passing through the airport daily. Nevertheless, Wednesday's barrage caused disruptions already visible in the aviation industry. Air Europa, whose flight was en route to land, turned back with passengers to Madrid. Additionally, the company's Thursday flight from Madrid to Tel Aviv was canceled, with passengers notified that they could choose an alternative flight from Barcelona to Tel Aviv or receive a refund. Lital Bachar, 38, a resident of the Jordan Valley, decided on Tuesday to surprise her husband for his birthday, and the two arrived at the airport with tickets to Athens. 'We heard about what happened before we left the house, but it didn't cause us to cancel our plans,' she said. 'We know the kids are with their grandparents in a place with a shelter. We live in the Jordan Valley, so we're always armed and alert. Missiles are not under my control, so we went on a much-needed vacation. We wish it would end, but we want to keep living.' Tal and Tomer Ben David arrived at the airport with 28 other salsa enthusiasts, on their way to Belgrade for an international salsa festival this weekend. They started their morning in a safe room at their apartment in Netanya, and when they heard about the incident near Ben Gurion Airport, they got a bit anxious. 'There was some buzz about it,' Tomer said, and Tal added casually, 'We dealt with it matter-of-factly. It was four hours before the flight, and we thought everything would return to normal. Part of winning is that they won't disrupt our lives, so we came.' The cancellation of Air Europa's morning flight to Madrid caused trouble for many, but Yechiel Attias from Ra'anana, who was supposed to fly with his wife and brother to celebrate a birthday, quickly found a layover through Athens. 'The surprise was that they didn't inform us about the cancellation until we got here, but we're here and found a way to get to the Spanish capital, and here we are.'

Hezbollah rocket barrage kills man in northern Israel field	Farmer finds body of 18-year-old, apparently killed while attempting to take cover in ditch as rocket landed just feet away; IDF reports 25 rockets launched from Lebanon, with only some intercepted; army chief hints at possible expansion of Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon The body of an 18-year-old male was found in an agricultural field in northern Israel on Wednesday evening after he was fatally wounded by shrapnel during a rocket attack from Lebanon. Magen David Adom (MDA) medics who arrived at the scene near the cemetery in the Western Galilee town of Kfar Masaryk had to pronounce him dead on the spot, and authorities are working to confirm his identity. The young man, who was employed in local agriculture, was reportedly outside his vehicle seeking shelter in a nearby ditch when one of approximately 25 rockets fired by Hezbollah struck just feet away, causing severe injuries that proved fatal. Another farmer later found him and called emergency services, who could only confirm his death. The rocket barrage triggered air raid sirens in Acre and several Galilee and Haifa Bay communities, including Kfar Masaryk, around 6:02 p.m. Only some of the rockets were intercepted, with the IDF reporting 'impacts in open areas.' At 7:11 p.m., MDA received an emergency call reporting an unconscious man with critical injuries in a field near Kfar Masaryk. MDA medic Netanel Ben-Yehuda, who responded to the scene, recounted, 'A local farmer led us to the area, where we found the victim lying in the field, unconscious and critically injured from shrapnel wounds. We performed medical checks but found no pulse or signs of breathing. Unfortunately, we had no choice but to pronounce him dead.' Shortly afterward, new alerts sounded in the Western Galilee for an incoming unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from Lebanon, which was successfully intercepted by the Air Force, according to the military. Meanwhile, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi suggested that Israel could expand its ground operations in Lebanon. 'Alongside diplomatic efforts for understandings in Lebanon, we must continue planning for further combat in Lebanon, including deepening ground operations,' he said during a situation assessment, noting that Israel will act as needed. 'We continue targeting Hezbollah assets across the region—in southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, Beirut and Syria.' Following Halevi’s remarks, Air Force fighter jets carried out strikes on Hezbollah targets in the Dahieh district of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. The IDF confirmed that intelligence-guided strikes hit Hezbollah command centers, weapons depots and military infrastructure. The military emphasized that the targets were embedded within civilian areas, illustrating Hezbollah’s use of Lebanese citizens as human shields. 'Numerous measures were taken to minimize civilian risk, including precision munitions, surveillance and advance warnings to the local population,' the IDF said.

Following Trump's decisive win, Harris supporters are looking for...	They were optimistic early on, as the polls suggested Harris would carry the Rust Belt states, but as time moved along and state after state went into the red column, Harris supporters were left wondering how their world came tumbling down around them Around 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the crowd that gathered at Kamala Harris’s watch party at Howard University started realizing the night would end in tears. When campaign chair Cedric Richmond took the stage to announce that Harris would not be speaking that night, the crowd quickly dispersed. 'I don't know what I was thinking; it should have been clear to me that a Black woman can't win in this country,' said a tearful student as she left the campus. Harris' campaign tried to maintain hope until the last moment, when Donald Trump was officially declared the winner of the U.S. presidential election. Campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon managed to send an email to the team saying, 'We always knew our path went through Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan,' just minutes before Trump's victory in Pennsylvania was announced. When it became clear that the story was over, the campaign went silent. 'Black women woke up this morning with a dream and are going to sleep tonight with a nightmare,' said CNN Democratic commentator Van Jones. 'But we'll have to do some deep soul-searching to understand how what were considered the strengths of the Democratic Party shifted to the Republicans.' For many Democrats, this felt like a replay of the 2016 election, only more painful this time because unlike then, there was a sense that Harris had significant momentum. 'We see a chance to win in all seven swing states,' said Harris campaign advisor David Plouffe before the polls opened. That feeling quickly changed. 'When we saw the scale of Trump's victory in Florida, I got déjà vu from 2016,' said a Democratic strategist. 'We came tonight thinking our chances were good. Our internal polls put us in a good position. It's simply unbelievable that this happened to us again. We’ll have to start all over, because it turns out America doesn’t want the optimistic vision we tried to sell it.' Liberal commentator Joy-Ann Reid noted, 'This is the second time most white women in America have let the patriarchy win,' and liberal commentator Elie Mystal concluded, 'The last time Trump won, there was a resistance movement that helped restrain him. I don’t think that will happen again. He won clearly. This is what people want, so this is what it will be.' 'Maybe there will be another Trump' In a bar in New York, Roni, an Israeli Trump supporter, told Ynet, 'I'm very happy with the victory. I feel that months of searching for every possible poll and digging into every piece of information that could decide the results are over. In my view, these are crucial elections for the future of the State of Israel and the Free World in general.' A young American added that the Democratic camp needs to understand why so many voted for Trump: 'It's mainly economic issues related to the gap between rich and poor. If we understand this and can solve these problems, then I think there will be another candidate besides Trump, one who nurtures society more. If we don't do this, there will probably be another Trump.' A man watching TV at the bar commented on the Israeli issue, saying, 'I actually don't think Trump really cares about Israel at all. Yes, his daughter and son-in-law are Jewish, and he did some things in his last presidency like moving the U.S. Embassy, but generally, I don’t think he cares about Israel. In this election, he tried to play both sides. Just yesterday, he was in Michigan with a Palestinian mayor of a major city, saying he would be good for the Palestinians. 'He also said he didn't think a two-state solution is feasible, and probably people on the far right in Israel and people who are the most radical on the Palestinian side probably agree with that. I don't think it's necessarily in the long-term interest of Israel. President Biden and Kamala Harris have been extremely supportive of Israel to the point where they were getting criticized and losing votes among young people in the United States who think they've been too pro-Israeli. I think Kamala Harris sincerely believes that Israel has a right to exist and wants to continue to support that.'

Anglos in Israel make ‘huge impact’ on business scene	Jerusalem to host business conference for English-speaking community The Association of Americans & Canadians in Israel and Nefesh B’Nefesh will hold their third annual Jerusalem Business Conference on November 18. The event brings together men and women from across the business world—entrepreneurs, companies, and anyone interested in the business scene—to network and learn.

In addition, former Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem Fleur Hassan-Nahoum and ILTV Executive Editor Maayan Hoffman are featured speakers. Kaplan said the English-speaking community is 'making a fabulous contribution to Israel.' She has been in business in the country for 35 years and has watched as more immigrants have gotten involved. 'We’re making a huge impact on Israeli society and, basically, on businesses in Jerusalem and around the country,' she said.

AP calls Michigan race for Donald Trump	Former U.S. President Donald Trump won Michigan on Wednesday, reclaiming the battleground state and its 15 electoral votes for the Republicans after Joe Biden flipped it in 2020 on his way to the White House. Trump won Michigan in 2016 by just over 10,000 votes, marking the first time a Republican presidential candidate had secured the state in nearly three decades. Trump's Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, faced concerns that discontent among Democrats in metro Detroit over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war could jeopardize her campaign.

Why did so many Jews vote for Donald Trump?	Trump received nearly 50% of Jewish votes in New York Rising antisemitism likely drove many Jewish voters to cast their ballots for President-elect Donald Trump, according to Ari Harrow, former chief of staff to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Speaking with ILTV on Wednesday, Harrow noted that Trump garnered the highest percentage of Jewish support for a Republican in years, particularly in key states. For example, in New York, Trump nabbed around 45% of the Jewish vote, compared to 30% in the 2020 election, according to a Fox News exit poll. 'The last four years have been difficult for Jews in the United States,' Harrow said. 'It started before the October 7 tragedy in Israel, with antisemitism rising steadily year after year. After October 7, it really exploded.' Harrow highlighted the incidents, campus protests, and unsettling scenes that brought back painful historical memories for Americans. 'There’s no question that this had an impact on the Jewish population, leading many to seek a presidency they hoped would bring change on that front,' he added.

Trump's red wave sends Democrats back to the drawing board	Hispanics, college graduates and non-graduates, young men and even black voters - Trump was able to exceed expectations among the vast majority of groups nationwide, securing a win that dashed Harris' hopes of becoming the first female president In cities and suburbs, among college graduates and non-graduates, and particularly among Latinos, support for Donald Trump has gone up compared to four years ago, resulting in a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in a historic election that could significantly impact both the United States and the world at large. Until now, only one American president, Grover Cleveland, had served two non-consecutive terms, back in 1893. Trump became the second, four years after losing to Joe Biden. He currently leads Kamala Harris with 280 to 226 in the Electoral College and is expected to win all seven key states, reaching 312 electors—a feat not achieved by any Republican candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1988. As the 45th president, who will become the 47th president upon his second inauguration on January 20, 2025, Trump leads Harris by a significant margin of 5 million in the popular vote. This marks the first time in 20 years, since George W. Bush's victory over John Kerry, that a Republican candidate has won the popular vote. In Trump's previous victory eight years ago, Hillary Clinton garnered a majority of votes nationwide. A comprehensive analysis by the New York Times revealed that Trump's victory was not only due to success in key states but also crossed districts and sectors. Of the districts where vote counting was completed, more than 90% shifted toward Trump, indicating an increase in support compared to 2020. Trump improved his performance in no less than 2,367 districts compared to the previous election, while his support decreased in only 240 districts. Another 536 districts were not included in the calculation due to a small number of votes. He also won in Starr County, South Texas, a Democratic stronghold since 1896. In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton received 76% of the votes there compared to Trump's 19%. Four years later, Biden won by a narrow majority of 52%, and now Trump has completed the turnaround. The main reason for this is likely the dramatic increase in the number of illegal immigrants arriving from Mexico to the area since Biden's election as president. In states where Trump was expected to win by a small margin, like Florida, Texas, and Iowa—where the pollster with the best record in the United States even predicted he would lose to Harris—he won by a double-digit margin. Conversely, in states where Harris was expected to win but not easily, like Minnesota, Virginia, and New Hampshire, her advantage was much narrower, at 5% or less. Her main failure was in the key states. Trump won in all four decided states—North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania—and is also confidently leading in the remaining three: Nevada, Arizona, and Michigan. One of the main factors in Trump's decisive victory was the change in voting patterns among Latinos and a smaller change among Black voters. Harris focused her campaign on attacking Trump as a dangerous former president seeking revenge, but exit polls showed that voters believed he would better address their top priority—cost of living and inflation. Trump did not win a majority among these two groups, but among Latinos, he received 45%, a significant increase from 32% in the 2020 election against Joe Biden. Among Black voters, his support was 13%, compared to only 8% in 2020. Most of Trump's support among these minorities came from Latino men, leading to a dramatic increase in his support in Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit, and other major cities in key states. According to NBC's exit polls, Trump received 54% support among Latino men, compared to only 36% in 2020. The Times analysis also showed that the biggest change was among Hispanics. In 228 districts where at least a quarter of the population is Hispanic, Trump received 9.5% more compared to the previous election. In 290 districts where less of the population is white, his support increased by 6.9%. But the increase in support crossed sectors, including districts where Trump won by more than 20% in 2020, as well as those where Biden won big that year. In 460 suburban districts, support for Trump increased by 4.3%, compared to an almost opposite change in 2020. In the cities themselves, the jump in support was even greater—5.2%. A significant increase in support for the Republican candidate was also recorded in districts where at least half of the population is college-educated, in those where many did not continue post-secondary education, in districts with a large elderly population, and in those with a large population of young people aged 18 to 34. In the final stretch, many believed that a joke made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at a Trump rally—where he compared Puerto Rico to a 'floating garbage island'—would bring many Hispanic voters back to the Democrats. But that did not happen. Arturo Munoz, a truck driver from Phoenix, told 'USA Today' that this statement did not cause him to change his decision to vote for Trump, citing the economic distress compared to four years ago as the main reason not to vote for Democrats. 'Hispanic and Latino men work in hard physical jobs. We bust our asses every day. And we clearly see the gap compared to 2020 in wages, hours, cuts, the ability to help the family,' he said. Trump achieved the best result for a Republican candidate among Latinos, who make up 12% of the electorate, since George W. Bush received 44% of their votes in 2004. The issue of abortion was expected to play a central role following the dramatic Supreme Court decision, and according to voters, it was the third most important issue—but still, the economy and the future of democracy superseded it. Trump won by a large margin among those who prioritized the economy, while most who viewed the future of democracy as the main issue chose Harris. Ultimately, economic difficulties made the difference—Trump won by a huge margin of 40% among the two-thirds of voters who stated that the economy was 'not so good' or 'bad.'

Trump’s top nine pro-Israel moves worth remembering	Listicle looks back at what Trump did for Israel when he was in office from 2017 to 2021 U.S. President Donald Trump is considered one of the most pro-Israel presidents of our generation. During his tenure from 2017 to 2021, Trump and his administration implemented several policies to demonstrate their support for the Jewish state and its security. Here are the top nine: No. 1 - Trump moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, fulfilling the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which Congress passed in 1995 but had been delayed by all presidents until Trump. No. 2 - Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel had effectively annexed in 1981. No. 3 - He announced the 'Pompeo Doctrine,' named after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, which stated that Israel is not an occupying force in Judea and Samaria, affirming that the area is disputed territory. No. 4 - The Trump administration withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the Iranian nuclear deal, which experts argued enriched the Iranian regime and enabled its destabilizing activities. No. 5 - Trump defunded the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). This organization has been linked to Hamas, particularly in connection with the October 7 massacre and its ongoing ties to the group. Last week, Israel’s parliament passed two bills that will effectively remove UNRWA operations in Israel. No. 6 - The U.S. withdrew from UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, after it issued statements denying the Jewish historic connection to the Temple Mount. No. 7 - Trump signed the Taylor Force Act, halting American economic assistance to the Palestinian Authority until the PA stops making payments through its Martyr's Fund to individuals who commit acts of terrorism and to the families of those who have died in such acts. No. 8 - Trump closed the Palestinian Mission in Washington. No. 9 - He signed an Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism, reinforcing his administration’s commitment to addressing antisemitism.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkssfmkz1e	2024-11-06T08:12:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2020/09/15/B1u00lKRVP/B1u00lKRVP_0_0_6242_3515_0_small.jpg

Attorney general to defend Gallant’s dismissal as High Court push...	Gali Baharav-Miara must articulate legal rationale behind defense minister's ouster, as top court demands response to petitions questioning potential ulterior motives at odds with Netanyahu’s conflict of interest arrangement The High Court of Justice on Wednesday ordered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to provide a response by noon on Thursday to an interim injunction request challenging his dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as petitioners claim the firing was politically motivated Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara convened a meeting Wednesday to discuss the government’s stance on the case. Sources close to the matter suggest she will argue that Israeli law grants the prime minister broad authority to dismiss ministers. However, the court may examine whether Netanyahu's decision was influenced by factors unrelated to his duties, which could potentially conflict with his legal restrictions due to his ongoing criminal trial. The petition asserts that Gallant’s firing amid an active war is driven by political interests—namely, efforts to advance draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox scholars and stabilize the coalition—at the expense of national security. The petition argues that replacing Gallant, who has 35 years of military experience, with a less experienced minister endangers Israel at a time of significant security threats. Justice Minister Yariv Levin criticized Justice Yael Willner, who is overseeing the case, accusing her of overreaching by issuing the injunction. 'Justice Willner has taken on the role of justice minister with this unprecedented order, effectively controlling the Judicial Selection Committee. Now, she seems set on stepping into the prime minister’s shoes, deciding on ministerial appointments instead of dismissing the petition,' Levin remarked. With sarcasm, he added, 'We look forward to January 20, to see if Justice Willner will also weigh in on the American presidential election.'

Zelensky quick to congratulate Trump amid concerns over Russian e...	Ukrainian president expresses confidence in 'Trump’s decisive leadership' amid uncertainty in Kyiv about Republican leader's pledge to swiftly end war with Russia, leaving Ukrainian officials questioning what his approach might mean for territories taken by Moscow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was quick to congratulate U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday following his victory in the U.S. elections, despite the uncertainty it casts over the future of U.S. support for Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russia. Trump has been vocal in his criticism of the extent of U.S. backing for Kyiv, raising questions about the future trajectory of the conflict. Recently, Ukraine has faced accelerated territorial losses, with Russian forces gaining ground in key eastern sectors, the site of intense battles since the February 2022 invasion. In his message following Trump's victory announcement, Zelensky expressed anticipation for an 'era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership,' aiming to quickly establish ties with the incoming administration amid the uncertainties of what Trump's presidency might entail for the war. Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. provided substantial military and financial aid to Ukraine, though Ukrainian officials have been frustrated by restrictions on using Western long-range weapon systems to strike deep within Russia. Zelensky voiced appreciation for Trump's 'peace through strength' approach, believing it could bring a just peace in Ukraine closer and expressing hope to implement it together. Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko suggested Trump might pursue rapid negotiations to end the war, but cautioned that any concessions to Russia might be limited. 'He wants a quick result, and there is a risk that certain concessions could be made to Russia,' Fesenko told Reuters. However, he added, 'I don't think that Trump would agree to peace only on Russia's terms, as this would look like a defeat for the U.S., and his advisers understand this.' Peace talks have stalled since the early months of the conflict, with Russia occupying about 20% of Ukrainian territory and demanding recognition of its annexations, while Kyiv insists on reclaiming all its land.

Hezbollah chief Qassem speaks at the end of the 40 mourning period for his slain predecessor Nasrallah; says U.S. elections have no bearing on the war and says indirect negotiations through the Beirut government possible only if the fighting stops Hezbollah fired a missile at central Israel in its second attack of the day sending towns in the Sharon planes, Tel Aviv metropolitan area and the areas surrounding the Ben Gurion Airport, into shelters. Loud explosions were heard as intercepts were launched at the incoming projectiles. the attack came soon after Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said in a pre-recorded televised address that there would be a road to indirect negotiations through the Lebanese state only if Israel stopped its attacks on Lebanon. He said that the results of the American elections were of no consequence to the war with Israel and only developments on the battlefield, not political moves, would bring an end to the hostilities. He said if Israel was hoping for a war of attrition it will have one. In a pre-recorded televised address, Qassem said there would be a road to indirect negotiations through the Lebanese state only if Israel stopped its attacks on Lebanon. The new head of the Iran-backed terror group spoke on the 40th day – the end of the Muslim mourning period - after the assassination of his predecessor Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike on his bunker in Beirut's Dahieh last September. 'Our missiles and rockets will reach everywhere in Israel,' Qassem said hours after Hezbollah launched a barrage of at least 10 missiles and rockets at central Israel, including the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. Shrapnel from the rockets landed in a parking area inside the Ben Gurion International Airport and caused flight delays but no injuries were reported. Shrapnel also fell in Raanana, north of Tel Aviv, and landed in a parked car but no injuries were reported there either. The IDF said most of the projectiles were intercepted. Rocket fire also targeted the Upper Galilee repeatedly with at least 50 projectiles, in the early afternoon with some landing in open areas and one making a direct hit in the evacuated Avivim border community, where some 12 homes suffered damage. While Qassem's speech was broadcast, the IDF Arabic language spokesperson issued a warning to civilians in the Dahieh, to move at least 500 meters away from any Hezbollah site or instillation ahead of an Israeli strike. 'For the safety of yourselves and your families, you must immediately evacuate building nearby to a distance of at least 500 meters,' Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee said. The IDF warnings often come up to 4 hours before an attack.

Iran sentences 4 people to death over charges of spying for Israe...	Three of the condemned were said to have assisted Mossad in the assassination of nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020; no information was given about the charges against the fourth Four people were sentenced to death by a revolutionary court in northwestern Iran over charges of spying for Israel, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Wednesday. Fars said three of the defendants - whose nationalities it did not give - were accused of helping Israel's spy agency Mossad move equipment used in the 2020 assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Fakhrizadeh was viewed by Western intelligence services as the mastermind of a covert Iranian program to develop nuclear weapons capability. The Islamic Republic has long denied any such ambition. The Jewish Chronicle newspaper reported in February 2021, citing intelligence sources, that Fakhrizadeh was killed by a one-ton gun smuggled into Iran in pieces by Mossad agents, both Israeli and Iranian nationals. Israel declined to comment at the time of his killing and on Wednesday an Israeli government spokesman said in response to the Fars report: 'We never comment on such matters. There has been no change in our position.' Fars said the fourth defendant sentenced to death was linked to another unspecified espionage case.

Iran repeats threats of attack on Israel after Trump win	IRGC official does not rule out a pre-emptive Israeli-American attack; Western officials say Trump may urge Israel to strike Iranian oil industry and nuclear sites; four sentenced to death for spying for Israel Iran on Wednesday repeated its threat to launch a substantial attack on Israel in retaliation for the Israeli strike on Iran last month. 'The Zionists do not have the power to confront us and they must wait for our response... our depots have enough weapons for that,' deputy chief of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Ali Fadavi adding Tehran does not rule out a potential U.S.-Israel pre-emptive strike to prevent it from retaliating against Israel. Israel is facing the threat of an Iranian attack while its defense minister has been fired and a new and inexperienced politician with no military or security background is supposed to take his place. Iran also announced on Wednesday that it had sentenced four people to death in a revolutionary court in the northwest of the country over charges of spying for Israel. Western officials told Reuters that Trump may reimpose his Maximum pressure campaign placing increased sanctions on Iran's oil industry and may also encourage Israel to attack the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities and assassinate senior Iranian officials. 'The U.S. elections are not really our business. Our policies are steady and don't change based on individuals. We made the necessary predictions before and there will not be change in people's livelihoods,' government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani, said to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. The reinstatement of U.S. sanctions in 2018 hit Iran's oil exports, slashing government revenues and forcing it to take unpopular steps, such as increasing taxes and running big budget deficits, policies that have kept annual inflation close to 40%. Iran's national currency has weakened at the prospect of a Trump presidency, reaching an all-time low of 700,000 rials to the U.S dollar on the free market, according to Iranian currency tracking website Bonbast.com.

Netanyahu unfit, choses draft dodgers over fighting troops, enda...	Leaders of opposition parties slam Netanyahu's ouster of Yoav Gallant, say his motives are political and fear of investigations into misdeeds of his close surrounding Leaders of most of Israel's opposition parties united on Wednesday in their condemnation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ouster of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, amid war and his replacement with a minister lacking security or meaningful military experience. Ahead of their statements, the leaders of the parties met to discuss the controversial political move. They all alluded to the apparent connection of Gallant's firing to the scandals being investigated in the Prime Minister's Office and their potential to implicate the prime minister in security and or criminal offenses. Two matters were under investigation. One relating to serious security breaches, which is being probed by the Shin Bet and another being investigated by the police, is a criminal matter. Both are under gag orders issued by the courts. Opposition leader Yair Lapid was the first to make a statement. He said the ousting of the defense minister was an act of madness by a prime minister who unfit to rule. 'In the midst of war, while Israel is fighting on seven fronts, Netanyahu is weakening the IDF and the fighting forces only to pass a draft dodging bill,' referring to legislation that Netanyahu is advancing to exempt Haredi men from military service after his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners threatened to bring down the government. 'Don't let his lies fool you,' Lapid said. 'Gallant was not fired over professional differences. Just last week Netanyahu stood at the Knesset podium and talks about the assassination of [Hassan] Nasrallah, [Ismail] Haniyeh, [Mohammed] Deif and [Yahya] Sinwar and then he sacked his defense minister, who brought him all those achievements.' Lapid said Gallant was sacked only for political reasons and that Netanyahu chose draft dodgers over those who serve. 'What happened yesterday was not normal and illogical. Every Hebrew mother must know she has no one to rely on. She cannot rely on the prime minister or his cabinet. The only one she could trust, was fired. Netanyahu is unfit, he cannot lead Israel in times of war. He cannot be trusted by the troops. He had a choice and chose a disgrace.' Benny Gantz who was a defense minister in a previous Netanyahu government said Israel has already seen what its enemies do when Israelis are torn apart from within. 'What are they troops fighting in Lebanon today, to think when their defense minister is fired, soon after he issues draft notices to 7,000 Haredi men?' he asked. He said Israel must not be in the position it was last October, before the Hamas massacre. 'We don't have that privilege in the Middle East.' Gantz said Netanyahu has hurt Israel's security and its people's spirit but it will not break it. Avigdor Liberman who also once served as Netanyahu's defense minister said the only place celebrating Netanyahu's political ousting of Gallant was Iran. 'Anyone following Iranian media, and there are many in Israel who do, saw the celebrations and enthusiasm.' Liberman warned that Netanyahu will next move to remove the chair of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Yuli Edelstein who also put obstacles in the path of legislation allowing the Haredi men to dodge the draft. 'I expect that will happen in the coming days and then he will go after the Attorney General.' He then appealed directly to members of Netanyahu's ruling Likud party and urged them to oppose the prime minister's legislation and his new pick for defense minister. Last to speak was Yair Golan, a former IDF deputy chief of staff and head of the left-wing labor alliance. 'In my 38 years of military service, I never thought I would see a prime minister will knowingly harm Israel's security. There has never been such a wide gap between the troops who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country and the leader whose heart is cold to bereavement,' he said. 'He has never known what it was like to escape sleep because his son is on the frontlines, he does not bow his head in the face of hundreds who were murdered on his watch, he chooses his own interests before those of the citizens of Israel,' Golan said. 'We have an illegitimate government and prime minister,' he said and called on the public to come out and bring the country to a standstill in protest.

Israel fears Biden's 'revenge' after Trump wins elections	Analysis: Officials worry about several scenarios Biden could take against Jerusalem in his remaining months in office regarding the war in Gaza and issues in the UN 'There’s room for optimism.' one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s advisors said on Wednesday after a sleepless night spent monitoring the U.S. election results. Shortly afterward, even before major U.S. networks declared Donald Trump the winner, Netanyahu was already among the first to congratulate him. It could be said that Netanyahu placed all his bets on Trump’s victory. This was his preferred outcome, despite past tensions and the unflattering remarks Trump made about him. The prime minister believes he can work well with Trump and thinks those who influence him 'are on the right side.' Compared to the Democratic administration that despised him and sought his downfall, Netanyahu is convinced Trump is the right choice for Israel. But what does this mean for Israel? First, it’s essential to recognize that the country is entering a critical period. From now until Trump’s inauguration on January 20, U.S. President Joe Biden holds full authority to act as he wishes. Israel must consider the possibility that Biden will use this time to settle scores with Netanyahu. Officials are concerned about a repeat of the December 23, 2016, UN Security Council resolution, when Barack Obama, in his final days in office — took the unusual step of refraining from using America’s veto power in the Council, allowing a resolution against Jewish settlements to pass. The move complicated Israel legally and opened the door to potential lawsuits in international courts in The Hague. Now, Netanyahu fears a similar scenario. It seems Biden will use his last two months in office to ramp up pressure for a hostage deal and demand concessions from Netanyahu, such as a withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor and similar moves. Biden will likely push to advance the diplomatic agreement between Israel and Lebanon — a direction Netanyahu appears to support, unlike the efforts to end the war in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, Netanyahu will aim to establish full cooperation with Trump and his team regarding postwar Israel on all fronts: Lebanon, Gaza, Iran and the hostages. It’s likely that Netanyahu will also receive an invitation to the White House shortly after the president's inauguration. Until then, he’ll need to navigate some turbulent waters over these two months. However, no one is thinking life with Trump will be a bed of roses for Netanyahu. Trump, too, wants to end the wars in Lebanon and Gaza. He has said this several times and genuinely believes in ending these conflicts. Therefore, Netanyahu will need to coordinate with him closely to reach this goal with as many achievements — as few concessions — for Israel as possible. The prime minister will also have to decide on his new ambassador to Washington soon. It’s likely he won’t extend Mike Herzog’s term but will instead choose a new ambassador. Netanyahu wishes to see Ron Dermer return to Washington — but Dermer is unwilling to do so. One of the candidates mentioned for the role is Netanyahu’s political advisor, Ophir Falk. One of the key questions is who will be in Trump's inner circle. Israel hopes to see someone like Mike Pompeo as defense secretary. Trump’s former ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, could also take a prominent role, which would greatly please the Jewish settler sector. Friedman, a staunch pro-Israel and pro-settlement advocate, has published a political plan for Israel’s future, a significant part of which involves applying sovereignty over the West Bank. Trump’s victory revives the right-wing dream of doing so. Furthermore, the Republican victory could significantly advance normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Biden's chances of securing a normalization deal in the two months he has left are low since it won’t happen without a cease-fire — and Netanyahu is more likely to save that achievement for Trump. Another issue is Iran. On one hand, if it attacks Israel, Tehran risks a harsh response from Biden, who’s now free from political pressures. On the other hand, Iran may avoid escalating tensions with Israel just before Trump assumes office, given his aggressive stance against Iran during his previous term. Either way, Trump’s victory will factor into Iran’s final decision on whether to strike Israel or to refrain from the planned response. Trump’s victory may also reduce the likelihood of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as Biden previously blocked sanctions against the ICC — which Trump could now threaten to reimpose.

Republican presidential candidate celebrates his triumph in the presidential race saying he'll make the U.S. 'great again' and 'end wars' Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. president Donald Trump declared his victory in the country’s elections on Wednesday in a speech to his supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida. 'This was the greatest political movement of all time. We’re going to help our country heal,' Trump said. 'We have a country that needs help very badly. We’re going to fix our borders. We made history for a reason, we overcame obstacles nobody thought possible and it’s not clear that we’ve achieved the most incredible political victory that our country has never seen before.' Trump added he will work to fight for American families 'with every breath in my body. This will truly be the golden age of America.' He also said the victory would ensure Trump and his party could 'Make America great again.' He thanked his campaign team and said the U.S. had 'given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate, we have to take it back.' He also addressed the Republican victory in running for control in the U.S. Senate. 'The number of victories was incredible.' 'We’re going to have a great four years, we’re going to turn our country around. We’re going to seal up those borders, we want people to come back in, but they have to come in legally,' Trump said. 'I want to thank the millions of hard-working Americans across the nation who have always been the heart and soul of this movement. We’re going to pay you back.' Trump said, adding his administration will be 'paying down debt, reducing taxes, do things that nobody else can do.' Trump also hinted at the situation ongoing across the globe with Israel’s war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying, 'I’m not going to start a war, I’m going to stop wars.' 'Many people told me God spared my life for a reason,' Trump added at the tail end of his speech, referring to his attempted assassination at the onset of the campaign. 'And that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness. Now, we’re going to fulfill that mission. We have to put our country first.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued an early congratulatory message to Trump as updated voting results came in on Wednesday, writing, 'Dear Donald and Melania Trump, Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback! Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!' Israeli ministers celebrated Trump’s victory. 'Yesssss, God bless Trump,' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on X. Finance Minister Bezalel Smitrich said: 'God bless Israel, God bless America.' Culture Minister Miki Zohar added, 'We are looking forward to the next four years.'

Settlers euphoric over Trump win	Settler leaders forged close ties with key republican figures including Trump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who has been a frequent visitor to the settlements; Smotrich plans to advance Israeli annexation, legalize West Bank outposts and establish new ones in Gaza West Bank settlers cheered on Wednesday after the results of the U.S. presidential race showed Donald Trump heading back to a second term in the White House. 'One Strong Trump – One Jewish State', Israel Gantz, head of the Binyamin regional council, said in a post on X indicating the expectations of the settlers from Trump's next term. 'This is a historic opportunity that must not be missed,' some said. The settler movement is poised to legalize outposts under the direction of far-right Bezalel Smotrich who serves as a minister in the Defense Ministry along with his role as Finance Minister. Smotrich plans to expand settlement constructions, lift restrictions on settlers and begin imposing Israeli sovereignty on some of the areas. He also intends to begin establishing outposts in the norther parts of the Gaza Strip. With the removal of Yoav Gallant who was fired as defense minister by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, Smotrich's path is even clearer. Leaders in the settler community have strengthened times with key figures in republican circles. Mike Pompeo who served as Trump's Secretary of State during his first term, is a frequent visitor to the West Bank settlement. Trump's ambassador to Israel David Freidman was a recent guest at the book launch for Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan's new book outlining his position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that he said must be solved by extending Israeli law to the West Bank settlements. Although Trump has not named his next cabinet, it is clear to the settlers that the doors in Washington will be open to them. Smotrich along with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer established a system of dealing with the Americans. The obstacles placed in his path by the Biden administration will soon be removed, the settlers hope. Leaders of the settler community will likely travel to the U.S. shortly. Trump was close to approving Israel's annexation of the West Bank in his last term and refrained from giving Netanyahu the green light only upon the advice of his son-in-law Jared Kushner. There was also intensive construction in the settlements during those years and the administration at the time did not block plans to advance settlements in E1 and Hebron, where democratic administrations blocked them. But alongside the optimism some worry that Trump's next term will not be the same as his first. He is a businessman after making deals and no one knows now, how he will respond to Israel's ongoing wars and the question of a Palestinian state.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1enrn00zke	2024-11-06T01:11:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/07/H1WQ0RPwC/H1WQ0RPwC_0_260_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Harris wins Jewish vote, loses in America's Arab capital	Exit polls show voters in Dearborn Michigan gave Trump 45% of the votes after 88% support for Biden in 2020; Trump campaigned hard to keep Muslim and Jewish voters at home and may have succeeded Democratic candidate Kamala Harris won 67% of the American Jewish vote while Republican Donald Trump received 31%, similar to the results of the 2020 elections, according to an AP exit poll. Then, President Joe Biden was supported by 69% of the American Jewish voters and Trump received 31%. Harris also won 61% of the American Muslim votes, according to the exit poll, close to Biden's 63% in 2020. Trump won 30%, 5% less than in 2020. In Dearborn Michigan, America's most Arab-populated city, Trump was supported by 45% of the vote, although the count is not final and independent candidate Jill Stein won 15% of Harris voters. This is a dramatic change in Dearborn, which was branded 'American's Jihad capital,' in the Wall Street Journal. In 2020, Democrats won 88% of votes for Biden. The reasons are clear. Muslim Americans strongly opposed the Biden administration's policies over Israel's war in Gaza. In the days leading up to the elections, the parties were projected to be close and both candidates aggressively courted Muslim voters. In a Fox News poll, voters were asked if they support continued aid to Israel in its war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Of those who said they did, just 25% supported Harris. Some 69% cast their votes for Trump. Among those who opposed continued support for Israel, 55% voted for Haris and 40% for Trump. Still, according to NBC's exit poll, Harris had 77% of the Jewish vote and Trump only 22%. The final numbers for Jewish and Muslim votes are still unknown. Trump campaigned hard to keep these voters at home and he may have succeeded. In Pennsylvania, where some 300,000 Jewish Americans live, every vote is critical. Concern for the Jewish vote was historically spared for Democratic presidential candidates. Most American Jews are liberals and their support for the Democrats was always assured. Although their share in the general population is small, just 2.4%, they have considerable weight in American society and in its politics, giving them disproportionate importance, especially for the Democrats. In 1988, George Bush Sr. won 35% of the Jewish vote, which was considered to be a great achievement, but after he refused to guarantee loans for Israel in order to assist in the absorption of the mass immigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union, Jewish support for him dropped in the next elections, down to 11%.

He's not a Netanyahu fan, but he doesn't threaten him either: Isr...	From his childhood in small village to his rise in Likud, Katz has seen both successes and setbacks; Critics say that Israel’s global standing has declined under his watch at a critical juncture; He brings experience from his time in the cabinet, but can a mere captain in the reserves handle a 7-front conflict? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Foreign Minister Israel Katz as the country's new defense minister Tuesday, replacing Yoav Gallant, who was dismissed for the second time in the current administration and in the middle of a war. This marks the most senior position Katz has held to date and one that could bolster his path to potential leadership, following his two terms as foreign minister and previous stints as finance, transportation, energy, agriculture and intelligence ministers. Katz, 69,has not been among Netanyahu's closest allies, yet he has shown loyalty in the current government, proving himself to be non-threatening in Netanyahu’s eyes. The prime minister likely believes that appointing Katz, a seasoned political figure, will alleviate public surprise and discontent over Gallant’s dismissal, as Gallant was widely seen as a competent defense minister with favorable ratings among Israelis. Netanyahu understood that an alternative appointment, such as Avi Dichter, might not receive public approval. Over the years, Katz has built a reputation as a political 'bulldozer,' especially during his tenure as transportation minister. However, in the past year, he faced significant criticism, particularly over the perceived decline in Israel’s international standing. Katz has since lowered his profile, focusing his efforts on consolidating his influence within the Likud party. From rural beginnings to the political summit Katz was born in Ashkelon in 1955 to Holocaust survivors from Romania who lost most of their families in concentration camps. He grew up in the farming community of Kfar Ahim, studied at the Or Etzion yeshiva, and served in the IDF paratroopers, reaching the rank of captain. As a student, Katz chaired the Hebrew University Student Association in Jerusalem, actively fighting what he and colleague Tzachi Hanegbi labeled as 'incitement and violence against Israel' by Arab students on campus. Their actions received media coverage calling them violent, with allegations that Katz disrupted gatherings of Arab students using iron chains and once took a microphone from a dean during a university debate, leading to a clash with Rector Gideon Shpitz. He was later charged in a disciplinary trial but acquitted. In March 1981, Katz locked the university's rector in his office as a protest, resulting in his suspension from school for one year. Rise through Likud Party ranks Early in his political career, Katz aligned with Ariel Sharon, establishing the 'Sharon Camp' in the Likud Party following the Lebanon War and Sharon's ousting as defense minister. Katz later became Sharon’s assistant at the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Since 1998, Katz has served in the Knesset, holding numerous influential roles. Twice, he was elected president of the Likud convention and twice as chairman of the Likud Secretariat, most recently in 2013, when he won by a landslide over Miri Regev. Katz remains in that role today. Achievements and unfulfilled plans Among Katz’s notable achievements is the 'Open Skies' agreement with the European Union in 2013, which made low-cost flights to Israel more accessible. He also proposed the 'Separation Plan' from Gaza, envisioning an international artificial island with a seaport and essential infrastructure linked to Gaza via a bridge. This plan, which aimed to lessen Israel's responsibility for Gaza's civilian life, did not materialize, and the status quo between Gaza and Israel remained. Katz also initiated the Regional Peace Rail Project. Foreign relations and controversy Katz was appointed acting foreign minister in February 2019 and later as permanent minister in May 2019. On his first day in the role, he sparked a diplomatic crisis with Poland, saying, 'Poles suckle antisemitism with their mothers' milk.' Navigating the pandemic as Finance Minister In May 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Katz was appointed finance minister. He authorized three lockdowns with limited financial support for businesses, resulting in the closure of around 70,000 small enterprises. Under Katz's leadership, the Ministry of Finance faced high-profile resignations, including the director of the Budget Department, the Accountant General, and the Ministry's CEO, all of whom criticized Katz's management. Foreign policy challenges Returning as foreign minister in early 2023, Katz faced challenges related to Israel's declining global standing. His term coincided with the Gaza conflict and the recognition of a Palestinian state by Spain, Norway and Ireland. Katz recalled Israel's ambassadors from these nations, escalating diplomatic tensions. He further declared UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres persona non grata and barred EU foreign minister Josep Borrell from visiting Israel. He publicly criticized Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, sharing AI-generated images of Erdoğan with Hamas leaders, which garnered millions of shares in Turkey. However, Katz’s term has also seen efforts to secure Israel’s international legitimacy, including pushing for a ceasefire contingent upon the release of hostages. Relationship with Netanyahu and questions surrounding the appointment Katz understands the dynamics with Netanyahu, leaving U.S. relations to Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer while focusing on the EU and the UN. Recently, Netanyahu has drawn Katz closer, inviting him into Israel’s wartime decision-making forum. Though Katz has experience as a member of the Security Cabinet, questions remain about whether a former IDF captain like Katz has the requisite experience to lead the Defense Ministry amid a multifront war. Some argue, however, that high-ranking military credentials have not guaranteed successful defense ministers, suggesting it may be time for a civilian leader less beholden to military norms. In the coming period, Netanyahu is expected to play a dual role as both foreign and defense minister, with Katz as a figurehead defense minister.

NY voters pass constitution change to protect abortion, trans rig...	New York voters have approved an amendment to the state's constitution barring discrimination based on things including 'gender identity' and 'pregnancy outcomes', changes supporters say will further protect transgender and abortion rights. Supporters and opponents disagreed sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1. It was fiercely opposed by conservatives who said it would enshrine a legal right for transgender athletes to play on girls' sports teams. The amendment adds language to the state constitution saying someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or 'reproductive health care and autonomy.' Previously, the constitution forbid discrimination based on race, creed or religion.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjewpud11yg	2024-11-05T18:09:39-08:00	
Chinese accounts boost Russian election disinformation	Russian disinformation aiming to reduce trust in the U.S. election received some last-minute help from China, according to research from the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. Investigators identified several videos linked to Russia that made false claims about voting. Some of the videos mimicked legitimate U.S. news outlets and featured fake audio clips of law enforcement officials supposedly acknowledging widespread voter fraud. The researchers found the videos were being amplified by a network of fake social media accounts that originated in China. The accounts had spread pro-China propaganda in the past and shifted their focus to the U.S. election only recently.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk2bhlu11yg	2024-11-05T18:03:45-08:00

NYT's 'The Needle' is back and predicting a Trump victory	The statistical tool that predicts the results of the US presidential election indicates an advantage for the Republican candidate in the battle for the presidency but Harris is expected to win the popular vote Four years ago, 'The Needle' feature of the New York Times was perhaps the main statistical tool for predicting the results of the elections, from the moment the votes began to be counted. Tonight, while in the various states the polling stations close one after the other and the counting begins - and with it the intermediate results that sometimes do not reflect what is expected in the end - the famous 'Needle' is back. Shortly after 4 a.m. on Wednesday, when, according to the interim result, Donald Trump had a large advantage over Kamala Harris in the number of electors the needle showed that Trump, at least for the moment, was on his way to victory in a close battle. According to the forecast currently appearing in the Times, Trump will win 281 electors and return to the White House, while the Democratic candidate Harris will win 257 electors. At least for now, the vice president is expected to win the majority of votes cast - almost a million more than Trump - but according to the American electoral system, this will not help her. The decision in the battle for the presidency will come down to seven key states: Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. These seven states 'equal' 93 electors; And if Harris wins in all the states that are considered blue - she needs 44 electors from those four states to become the first female president in the history of the United States. Trump needs 51 electors out of those 93 to become the first since the 19th century to win a non-consecutive second term.

Jordan made an unsuccessful bid to become speaker when eight Republicans joined with Democrats in ousting then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Trump endorsed Jordan, but more centrist Republicans viewed him as too extreme and objected to rewarding someone on the party's right flank after some had helped oust McCarthy.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1oahs00bje	2024-11-05T16:58:19-08:00

Robinson, the Southern state's lieutenant governor, has denied the allegations and filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN. Robinson was endorsed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who previously praised him as 'Martin Luther King on steroids' but whose campaign distanced itself after the scandal broke in September. Robinson advocated for bringing back slavery for some people and posted 'gratuitously sexual and lewd' posts on the site, CNN reported, comments the Republican has denied making. Stein, the state's attorney general, will be the first Jewish governor of North Carolina. He has said he will prioritize helping the western part of the state recover after Hurricane Helene devastated the region in September, and has proposed investing more in public education	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bymd6vubyx	2024-11-05T15:52:27-08:00

White House, Pentagon shocked at Gallant's dismissal	Senior US officials are surprised, angry over Netanyahu's firing of his Defense Minister, who they say has been a 'reliable liaison' with the Israeli government; Timing of the dismissal, as Americans are headed to the polls and Iran is threatening massive attack, adds to their concern Senior officials in the U.S. administration expressed deep shock at the dismissal of Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, highlighting the timing as especially concerning - coinciding with the Election Day in the U.S. and on the brink of a potential Iranian attack. They described the move as 'bizarre and incomprehensible.' Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder emphasized Gallant's role as a reliable partner throughout his tenure as Israel's Defense Minister, reaffirming the U.S.'s unwavering commitment to Israel's security and continued collaboration with Gallant's successor. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council also acknowledged Gallant's contributions to Israel's defense and pledged ongoing cooperation with the incoming Defense Minister Israel Katz. New Hope party head Gideon Sa'ar is set to take over Katz's previous role as Foreign Minister. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of Gallant's dismissal and the ensuing cabinet reshuffle incited widespread protests including in the streets of Tel Aviv and the rest of the country and intense political debate. The dismissals prompted discussions among business leaders and the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) about potentially striking the economy on Wednesday. However, there were doubts about the feasibility of a broad strike, with many large union branches under the influence of the ruling Likud party. Some in the business sector expressed regret over past strikes against the prime minister's political actions, noting the lack of participation in recent strikes demanding the release of hostages. A senior economic figure told Ynet that a strike is unlikely at this juncture. In a media statement, Gallant attributed his dismissal to three key issues: 1) His firm stance on mandatory military service for all eligible individuals, which he deemed vital for Israel's security and future; 2) The urgency of securing the release of hostages held by Hamas, asserting it is achievable with IDF support; 3) The absence of a state inquiry into the October 7 massacre. Gallant stressed the importance of learning from both triumphs and failures, warning of ongoing challenges from Iran and its affiliates in the north. He vowed to defend the IDF from top to bottom, emphasizing its crucial role in safeguarding the nation.

Philadelphia DA contests Trump' claim of'massive cheating' in cit...	Ahead of poll closures in Pennsylvania, Trump said on his social media platform that there was 'talk about massive cheating in Philadelphia' and said law enforcement was on the way. He did not provide details, and there was no immediate indication of what he was referring to, and his spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment about what he meant. Election Day voting had proceeded relatively smoothly across Pennsylvania, with a few counties reporting problems with ballot tabulators. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner issued a statement responding to Trump's post, saying the only suggestion of cheating was coming from the Republican presidential nominee. 'There is no factual basis whatsoever within law enforcement to support this wild allegation,â' Krasner said.'We have invited complaints and allegations of improprieties all day. If Donald J. Trump has any facts to support his wild allegations, we want them now. Right now. We are not holding our breath.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1jnhmo11ye	2024-11-05T14:40:48-08:00	
Trump could torpedo Harris' victory in Congress: These are some U...	US elections polls reveal a tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, but the contest could also result in a decisive victory for one of the candidates; Here are the scenarios at play and Trump's expected behavior if he loses Polls in the U.S. elections indicate a tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with the candidates statistically tied in several battleground states that will determine the winner. Despite this deadlock, it's possible that one of the candidates could secure a decisive victory in a majority of those states, leading to a significant overall win. Several scenarios are at play: A narrow victory for Kamala Harris: This outcome could lead to the greatest tension. Trump may declare victory Tuesday night, even before official results confirm it, and he is unlikely to acknowledge a Harris win. Throughout his campaign, Trump has maintained that the only result he considers legitimate is his own victory. If Harris wins by a slim margin, it is anticipated that Trump's camp would file numerous lawsuits, ultimately bringing the matter before the Supreme Court. This is not unprecedented; In 2000, a slim conservative majority on the Supreme Court halted a recount in Florida, awarding the presidency to George W. Bush over Al Gore. Even if the legal challenges fail, the certification of the results will still need congressional approval on January 6. Prior to the events of January 6, 2021, this date was a symbolic celebration of American democracy, but the Capitol riot changed everything. If Democrats secure a majority in Congress, the certification process will likely proceed without issues. However, if Republicans retain control of the House, it is possible that House Speaker Mike Johnson could refuse to bring the certification to a vote. Trump has already hinted at a 'secret plan' with Johnson. A landslide victory for Harris: While Trump is unlikely to accept this outcome, the chances of him successfully contesting the results would be significantly lower. Any victory for Trump: In this case, Harris is expected to concede gracefully, regardless of the margin. As the sitting vice president, she would also sign the results on January 6.

Elon Musk is sued over $1 million election giveaway	Elon Musk was sued in a proposed class action on Tuesday by registered voters who signed his petition to support the Constitution for a chance to win his $1 million-a-day giveaway, and now claim it was a fraud. The complaint filed by Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty in the Austin, Texas federal court said Musk and his America PAC organization falsely induced voters to sign by claiming they would choose winners randomly, though they were predetermined. She also said the defendants profited from the giveaway by driving traffic and attention to Musk's X social media platform, and by collecting personal information such as her name, address and phone number that they could sell. McAferty sued one day after a Philadelphia judge denied a request by that city's district attorney Larry Krasner to end the giveaway, which Krasner called an illegal lottery. The world's richest person opened the giveaway to voters in seven battleground states who signed a petition to support free speech and gun rights. Tuesday's lawsuit seeks at least $5 million in damages for everyone who signed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy8dsqo11ke	2024-11-05T14:09:46-08:00

Massive vote turnout on Election Day goes smoothly, Trump promise...	Despite some concerns about irregularities regarding voting amid massive turnouts in early voting, reports suggest it has gone relatively smoothly, with few noticeable incidents; Donald Trump says he will accept a loss if it is 'fair election' After an election season marked by concerns over disinformation, foreign influence and worrisome threats to election workers and voting systems, Election Day unfolded relatively smoothly nationwide with only scattered disruptions and delays. Leading into Tuesday, more than 82 million Americans had already cast their ballots in a largely successful early voting period with high turnout despite some hiccups and frustrations in the presidential battleground of Pennsylvania. And when the final day of voting came, the problems that cropped up were 'largely expected routine and planned-for events,' said Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. She said the agency was not currently tracking any national, significant incidents impacting election security. Issues affecting voters on Tuesday included typical election mishaps, from a worker forgetting a key in Arizona’s largest county to an election judge failing to show up at the polls in Pennsylvania’s Allegheny County. Some precincts around the country faced issues with voter check-in processes and e-pollbooks, causing some delays for voters trying to cast ballots. Some areas had ballot printing mistakes and were printing new ballots and extending voting hours accordingly. Extreme weather across the midsection of the country also caused flooding and some other isolated problems, including knocking out power for at least one Missouri polling place that resorted to a generator to keep voting up and running. Still, in various states affected by rain, voters enthusiastically huddled under umbrellas as they lined up to cast their ballots, not deterred in a presidential election that many U.S. voters view as crucially important to the future of U.S. democracy. Congressional election updates: Senate, House control could be decided by handful of races In the western part of the key swing state of Pennsylvania, a few counties saw reports of issues with tabulator machines that scan and count paper ballots filled out by voters. A Pennsylvania state judge ordered polls to remain open for two extra hours in Cambria County, which voted 68% for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The county sought the extension after a software malfunction affected the ballot-scanning machines, though county officials said no one was turned away from the polls and all ballots would be counted. It was yet to be seen how the extension might affect vote-counting timelines in the tight battleground. In Georgia, another presidential swing state, fewer than a dozen precincts were set to stay open late because of delayed openings or evacuations due to alleged bomb threats that were found to be non-credible, according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. That included two precincts in Cobb County, which is northwest of Atlanta. They were staying open until 7:20 p.m. because they opened late due to equipment issues. The FBI on Tuesday afternoon said it was aware of multiple non-credible bomb threats to polling locations in several states and said many of them appeared to originate from Russian email domains. The massive early voting turnout before Tuesday — slightly more than half the total number of votes in the presidential election four years earlier — was driven partly by Republican voters, who cast early ballots at a higher rate than in recent previous elections after a campaign by Trump and the Republican National Committee to counter the Democrats’ longstanding advantage in the early vote. The early voting period faced minimal problems, even in western North Carolina, which was hammered last month by Hurricane Helene. State and local election officials, benefiting from changes made by the Republican-controlled legislature, pulled off a herculean effort to ensure residents could cast their ballots as they dealt with power outages, lack of water and washed out roads. That appeared to continue on Tuesday, with the North Carolina Board of Elections reporting no voting issues. Besides the hurricanes in North Carolina and Florida, the most worrisome disruptions to the election season so far were arson attacks that damaged ballots in two drop boxes near the Oregon-Washington border. Authorities there were still searching for the person responsible. The absence of any significant, widespread problems has not stopped Trump, the Republican nominee, or the RNC, which is now under his sway, from making numerous claims of fraud or election interference during the early voting period, a possible prelude to challenges after Election Day. Trump on Tuesday suggested he wouldn’t challenge the results of the election — as long as it’s 'fair' 'If it’s a fair elections, I’d be the first one to acknowledge' the results, Trump said, though what meets that definition wasn’t clear. A late effort by Republicans to challenge Atlanta-area election offices’ collection of mail ballots last weekend after early voting had ended was rejected as 'frivolous,' with Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge R. Stan Baker saying the GOP argument 'does not withstand even the most basic level of statutory review and reading comprehension.' Trump’s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, has urged voters not to fall for Trump’s tactic of casting doubt on elections. She was spending Tuesday afternoon turning out her own vote at a phone bank hosted by the Democratic National Committee, and said phone banking represents 'the best of who we are.' This is the first presidential vote since Trump lost to Joe Biden four years ago and began various attempts to circumvent the outcome and remain in power. That climaxed with the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to halt certification of the results after Trump told his supporters to 'fight like hell.' Even now, a solid majority of Republicans believe Trump’s lie that Biden was not legitimately elected, despite reviews, audits and recounts in the battleground states that all affirmed Biden’s win. Through four years of election lies and voting-related conspiracy theories, local election officials have faced harassment and even death threats. That has prompted high turnover and led to heightened security for election offices and polling sites that includes panic buttons and bullet-proof glass. While there have been no major reports of any malicious cyberactivity affecting election offices, foreign actors have been active in using fake social media profiles and websites to drum up partisan vitriol and disinformation. In the final weeks, U.S. intelligence officials have attributed to Russia multiple fake videos alleging election fraud in presidential swing states. On the eve of Election Day, officials issued a joint statement with federal law enforcement agencies warning that Russia in particular was ramping up its influence operations, including in ways that could incite violence, and likely would continue those efforts well after the votes had been cast. Jen Easterly, the nation’s top election security official, urged Americans to rely on state and local election officials for information about elections. 'This is especially important as we are in an election cycle with an unprecedented amount of disinformation, including disinformation being aggressively peddled and amplified by our foreign adversaries at a greater scale than ever before,' she said. 'We cannot allow our foreign adversaries to have a vote in our democracy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkytjzu111l	2024-11-05T13:51:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/15/r15pfn460/r15pfn460_0_0_1985_1361_0_small.jpg

How Israel's future ties with the U.S. hang on Tuesday’s vote	Experts say US election results could significantly change US-Israel elections, and how Biden will handle the region until inauguration The outcome of Tuesday’s U.S. elections could significantly alter the future of U.S.-Israel relations, predicts Dr. Eric Mandel, founder and director of the Middle East Political and Information Network (MEPIN). However, another critical question is how President Joe Biden will approach the Middle East from November 5 until the January 20 inauguration. In an interview with ILTV News, Mandel explained that if Vice President Kamala Harris secures victory, Biden is likely to seek stability in the region over the next three months. But if former President Donald Trump wins, the situation becomes less predictable. Biden has long identified as a strong supporter of Israel, even calling himself a 'Zionist.' Mandel suggested that Biden might want to solidify this legacy by supporting a resolution to the Iranian nuclear threat. Alternatively, Biden could follow a path similar to former President Barack Obama, whose administration endorsed UN Security Council Resolution 2334, declaring Israeli settlements beyond the Green Line illegal. However, Israelis shouldn’t assume that a Trump return to office on January 20 would bring the same policies or peace as during his first term, warns Bar-Ilan University Professor Eytan Gilboa. 'We know from history and the theory of presidential elections and behavior that a president in a second term is very different from a first term, especially in this case, where Trump lost the 2020 election and is now coming back in 2024,' he explained. 'Many things have happened, both in the United States and Israel. And so I think the expectation that the golden age of the first term will repeat itself is uncertain.' Gilboa advised Israel to 'prepare itself' for the possibility of a different Trump in office or a Harris presidency. He stressed that Israel needs 'a plan for how to deal with all kinds of constraints that the country is going to be under, primarily due to pressure from the progressive branch of the Democratic Party' if Harris wins. Under Biden, Gilboa explained, this progressive constituency was largely ignored. But Harris, who would seek re-election, may align more closely with this group, which he described as 'hostile to Israel and often antisemitic.' 'This would be a major challenge for the Israeli government,' Gilboa said. Watch the full episode of Insider here.

Harvard University must face narrowed lawsuit over antisemitism	A U.S. judge overseeing lawsuits accusing Harvard University of antisemitism on Tuesday narrowed but refused to dismiss a case by two advocacy groups accusing the Ivy League school of making it unbearable for Jewish students to study there. U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns said the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and Jewish Americans for Fairness in Education can pursue a hostile educational environment claim on behalf of students. The Boston-based judge dismissed claims that Harvard directly discriminated against Jewish and Israeli students, and retaliated against them for complaining about antisemitism. In August, Stearns refused to dismiss a related lawsuit by Jewish students who accused Harvard of letting its Cambridge, Massachusetts campus become a bastion of rampant antisemitism. Both lawsuits accused Harvard of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars federal funds recipients from allowing discrimination based on race, religion and national origin, and sought to stop further violations. Tuesday's decision primarily concerned Harvard's alleged mishandling of incidents from the spring and fall of 2023.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjfb00m00wyx	2024-11-05T13:12:14-08:00	
Election night: Trump vs. Harris showdown running down to the wir...	As US election campaign enters its final hours, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are locked in a fight for undecided voters, with polls showing a tight race in key battleground states; 82 million Americans have cast their ballots in early voting The U.S. presidential election unfolded against the backdrop of the ongoing Gaza war, which played a central role in the campaigns of both major parties. Candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump each emphasized their support for Israel while pledging to end the war. Supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are hoping for a Trump victory, fearing potential friction between Netanyahu and Harris if she wins. Trump's popularity remains high in Israel compared to the rest of the world, with billboards supporting him appearing in Tel Aviv, including one that paraphrased his campaign slogan: 'Make Israel Great Again.' U.S. Capitol Police arrested on Tuesday a man attempting to enter the Capitol Visitor Center carrying a flare gun and emitting a strong smell of gasoline. He was stopped during security checks, and an investigation has been opened. Donald Trump will watch the election results from his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, surrounded by a small group of family and friends, including tech billionaire Elon Musk. CNN reported that Trump’s campaign is discussing the timing of his departure from Mar-a-Lago to deliver a public statement. Campaign officials are preparing for a tight race against Kamala Harris, which, according to polls, could remain undecided by the end of the night. However, Trump expressed confidence earlier Tuesday, telling voters at a Florida polling station that he expects a large victory, claiming that the race against Harris 'won’t even be close.' The FBI issued a warning on Tuesday about three fake videos circulating online, falsely claiming to be from the bureau, which warn of terror threats and urge voters to avoid polling stations and vote remotely. Another video falsely claims the FBI is warning of vote rigging in prisons in several swing states. The U.S. presidential race is unfolding under the shadow of warnings from the American government about foreign interference, particularly from Russia, attempting to influence the election results. In recent months, U.S. intelligence agencies have cautioned the public about disinformation campaigns on social media aimed at undermining trust in American democracy.

US to test hypersonic nuclear missile on election night, report s...	US military to conduct routine test of unarmed Minuteman III ICBM from Vandenberg Space Force Base just hours after polls close; officials say test, scheduled years in advance, demonstrates nuclear readiness amid rising global tensions The U.S. military is set to conduct a test launch of an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) late Tuesday night, hours after polls close in the U.S. presidential election, the UK's Daily Mail reported. The missile is scheduled to launch between 11:01 p.m. and 5:01 a.m. Pacific Time from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base. Some Americans have raised concerns about the timing of the test coinciding with election day, but military officials emphasized that the launch is routine and was planned years in advance. The test is intended to demonstrate the readiness of U.S. nuclear forces and to maintain confidence in the country's nuclear deterrence, especially amid growing global tensions. The missile will travel 4,200 miles from California to Kwajalein Atoll in the North Pacific in approximately 22 minutes. Capable of reaching speeds over 15,000 mph, the ICBM can hit targets worldwide within 30 minutes of launch. The test comes amid rising fears of potential conflict with Russia and China, both seen as major threats to U.S. security. The Minuteman III is one of two types of nuclear missiles currently deployed by the U.S., alongside submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The Minuteman III has been in service for over 50 years but is set to be phased out by 2029, replaced by the LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM. The U.S. Air Force has said that the Sentinel system is a cost-effective solution for maintaining a secure land-based nuclear deterrent and is expected to remain in service through 2075. This test follows a similar launch conducted from Vandenberg in June. Col. Bryan Titus, vice commander of Space Launch Delta 30, described the test as a significant moment for the base, saying, 'These tests are vital not only for our national defense but also showcase the exceptional capabilities of our team.' The test also comes just days after North Korea reaffirmed its support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, and amid warnings from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the U.S. and Russia are on the brink of direct military conflict.

Outgoing defense minister expresses pride in Israel's recent military achievements but emphasizes need to learn from past mistakes, underscoring his commitment to national security Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, responding to his dismissal earlier Tuesday, said that he was fired due to disagreements with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on key security issues. In a special statement, Gallant said his firm stance that all Israeli youth must serve in the IDF, his push for the recovery of hostages, and his call for a national inquiry into the security failures that led to the events of the October 7 Hamas attack. 'There is no forgiveness for abandoning the hostages. We can bring them back,' Gallant stressed, while also highlighting his responsibility for both successes and failures during his tenure. 'My priorities have always been clear: the State of Israel, the IDF, and the defense establishment—only then comes my personal future,' he said. Gallant emphasized that his dismissal follows what he described as 'remarkable achievements' by the defense establishment. 'We struck in Gaza and Lebanon, eliminated terrorist leaders across the Middle East, and for the first time ever, delivered a precise, lethal and swift blow to Iran. I am proud of the defense establishment's accomplishments.' He also highlighted the importance of learning from past mistakes. 'I am responsible for the successes—but also for the failures and the pain,' he said. Gallant concluded by underscoring his unwavering support for the IDF and other security agencies, stating, 'I have not, and will not, allow any harm to come to the IDF, its commanders or its soldiers—from the highest ranks to the last soldier.' He urged political leaders to follow the moral compass of the defense establishment, saying, 'In times of darkness and uncertainty, we must navigate by our compass.' Gallant ended his statement with a salute to the fallen and their families. Gallant believed as recently as Monday in private conversations that Netanyahu would hesitate to fire him, not wanting to position himself as the moderate and pragmatic figure in an increasingly hardline Cabinet. Nevertheless, Gallant conveyed to those close to him a sense of satisfaction with how he managed the war, saying that he was at peace with himself and calling it 'the most important role of his life.' Netanyahu reportedly informed Gallant of his dismissal just 10 minutes before the public announcement. The meeting lasted only a few minutes, after which Gallant’s chief of staff arrived to collect the official dismissal letter. Gallant's associates were not surprised by the move, acknowledging that the decision to fire him had already been made in principle. However, they were caught off guard by the timing, which they believe is tied to both the daycare funding bill—a derivative of the draft exemption law for Haredi men, which Gallant strongly opposed—and a new security investigation involving events following the October 7 massacre, with a senior Netanyahu aide under scrutiny. They also believe the timing was influenced by the U.S. elections, claiming that 'Netanyahu thought the move would catch the protest movement off guard while everyone’s attention was focused on America.' Netanyahu had considered firing Gallant as early as September, intending to replace him with Minister Gideon Sa'ar, but the pager operation in Lebanon, which saw thousands of Hezbollah pagers explode simultaneously, thwarted the plan. Netanyahu realized that firing a defense minister on the eve of a war would be seen as irresponsible. The dismissal was delayed due to Israel's unprecedented air raid in Iran, and even now, Netanyahu is taking a calculated risk in removing Gallant ahead of a possible Iranian retaliation.

Gallant: 'My priorities have always been clear Israel, only then ...	Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, informed of his dismissal earlier Tuesday, issued a statement affirming that his priorities remain unchanged. 'My priorities have always been clear: the State of Israel, the IDF and the defense establishment—only then comes my personal future,' he said. Gallant noted that his dismissal comes after what he described as 'remarkable achievements' by the IDF, Shin Bet, Mossad and the entire defense establishment. 'We struck in Gaza and Lebanon, eliminated terrorist leaders across the Middle East, and for the first time ever delivered a precise, lethal and swift blow to Iran. I am proud of the defense establishment's accomplishments,' he added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bymvbboz1x	2024-11-05T11:53:41-08:00

Sources close to PM suggest IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar next on the chopping block; 'We are not there yet,' says senior official close to Netanyahu Following the dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and his replacement by Israel Katz, sources close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested on Tuesday that additional changes in Israel's security leadership could be forthcoming. Netanyahu is reportedly considering replacing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar in the near future. However, a senior official close to Netanyahu said, 'We are not there yet,' but did not rule out such moves down the line. In a statement released shortly after Gallant's firing, Netanyahu said that while there had been productive cooperation in the early months of the war, significant differences in strategy had emerged between him and Gallant in recent months. 'At a time of war, full trust between the prime minister and the defense minister is critical,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, this trust has eroded, and attempts to bridge the gaps have failed.' He noted that the differences were not only made public in an 'unacceptable manner' but had also reached Israel's enemies, who had 'derived great benefit' from the situation. The prime minister announced that Foreign Minister Israel Katz will assume the role of defense minister. Gideon Sa'ar is set to take over as foreign minister. In response to his dismissal, Gallant issued a brief statement on X, writing, 'The security of the State of Israel has been and will always remain my life’s mission.'

IDF shifts tactics in Gaza offensive, causing higher Hamas casual...	Military says 1,000 Hamas terrorists killed in Jabaliya, with around 500 remaining alongside thousands of civilians; elite Ghost Unit using low-cost tech to target terrorists; 'Hamas booby-trapped 200 buildings, but only detonated two,' officials say Israeli forces have entered the second month of their prolonged operation in Jabaliya, in the northern third of the Gaza Strip, effectively placing the area under siege, the IDF confirmed Tuesday. During an overnight sniper operation, Givati, Kfir and 401st Brigade units eliminated around 50 Hamas terrorists near the city’s refugee camp. These casualties add to the roughly 1,000 Hamas terrorists killed since the operation began over a month and a half ago, according to figures from the 162nd Division leading the offensive. The IDF estimates that 500-600 terrorists remain entrenched within the core of Jabaliya’s refugee camp or in nearby towns such as Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, with some blending into the civilian population still present in the area. Meanwhile, of the approximately 70,000 Palestinians originally in the Jabaliya region, the IDF has managed to evacuate around 55,000 southward, mostly to Gaza City. The army continues to apply heavy pressure on those remaining, urging them to move south. 'There is no humanitarian aid reaching the besieged area,' an IDF official said. 'Jabaliya is collapsing, and we are neutralizing the remaining hundreds of terrorists. The enemy is on the run and resorting to guerrilla tactics to strike at us.' The IDF also addressed allegations of civilian casualties and the burning of a school in the area, denying any such incidents. 'We’ve investigated claims of mass civilian deaths and the burning of a school—these did not happen,' the army emphasized. Additionally, the IDF acknowledged the creation of a new cross-Gaza corridor that stretches from the northern border to the sea, effectively cutting the northern part of the Palestinian enclave off from Gaza City. The army is not ruling out maintaining a permanent presence along this corridor. Hundreds of booby-trapped buildings and elite Ghost Unit at work in Jabaliya Despite most residents having been evacuated, Israeli forces continue to face numerous challenges in their prolonged operation in Jabaliya, with explosive traps posing the greatest threat. Since the beginning of the raid, IDF forces have discovered over 200 booby-trapped buildings in the area. In two incidents, explosives were triggered inside homes, killing six soldiers—two from the Givati Brigade’s Shaked Battalion and four from the elite Ghost Unit. For the past several months, the Ghost Unit has been operating in Gaza as part of the 162nd Division’s special forces. Established in 2019 to develop and implement advanced combat techniques and technologies for IDF ground forces, the unit suffered the loss of its commander, Lt. Col. Roy Levy, who was killed in battle at Kibbutz Re’im on October 7. The unit, small in size with just a company and a half crossing into Gaza, faces the challenge of compensating for limited munitions. With resources diverted to the northern front in Lebanon, forces in Jabaliya have fewer munitions, D9 bulldozers and air support compared to earlier operations. To counter these shortages, Ghost fighters deploy large reconnaissance drones when unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are unavailable, providing continuous surveillance of the built-up areas for soldiers on the frontlines. In a recent operation, the unit identified and eliminated a group of terrorists attempting to ambush Givati forces. 'Instead of firing missiles from a Hermes 450 drone, we’ve killed dozens of terrorists using Iron Ball, a drone that drops simple fragmentation grenades on terrorists and tunnel shafts,' said Lt. Col. Y., commander of the Ghost Unit. According to him, the unit began using this weapon in January, and while it initially presented accuracy and safety challenges, the soldiers’ intelligence and professionalism have significantly improved its effectiveness. 'Now, IDF brigades are using Iron Ball in southern Lebanon as well,' he added. In recent days, the unit also eliminated 10 terrorists hiding in a building using two precision mortar bombs. 'These mortars are cheaper and more available than fighter jet bombs. We provide collection and fire capabilities that replace high-level operations, achieving more for less,' Lt. Col. Y. said. In addition to its impressive offensive capabilities, the Ghost Unit has also been developing methods to avoid triggering explosives, including identifying tripwires that activate traps. The terrorists, it was found, have been using simple pressure plates made of blinds with foam strips. 'We’re taking extra precautions before soldiers enter for searches, even converting old armored personnel carriers (APCs) for various autonomous uses without soldiers inside,' officials added. As the operation continues with no clear end in sight, commanders in the field are unsure how long they will need to remain in Jabaliya. 'In previous operations, we didn’t reach Hamas’ core areas here, but that’s what we’re doing now,' they explained. 'Hamas has surrounded these areas with large rings of booby traps, and in recent days, civilians have been killed by these devices. According to testimonies from hundreds of detainees, Hamas terrorists have also executed civilians who attempted to flee the city.'

Netanyahu dismisses Gallant, appoints Katz as defense minister	PM cites breakdown in trust as reason behind dismissal; 'At a time of war, full trust between the prime minister and the defense minister is critical,' he says, adding Israel's enemies 'derived great benefit' from situation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant Tuesday evening, citing a breakdown in trust during the country's ongoing war. In a statement, Netanyahu said that while there had been productive cooperation in the early months of the war, significant differences in strategy had emerged between him and Gallant in recent months. 'At a time of war, full trust between the prime minister and the defense minister is critical,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, this trust has eroded, and attempts to bridge the gaps have failed.' He noted that the differences were not only made public in an 'unacceptable manner' but had also reached Israel's enemies, who had 'derived great benefit' from the situation. The prime minister emphasized that while open debate is part of his decision-making process, the public nature of the trust issue had made it impossible to continue the current working relationship. 'This crisis has become public knowledge and prevents the proper management of the war effort,' Netanyahu said. He added that most members of the government and the Security Cabinet shared the same sentiment. Netanyahu announced that Israel Katz, the foreign minister and a veteran politician who previously served as finance and intelligence minister, would replace Gallant as defense minister. Describing Katz as a 'bulldozer' with a combination of 'responsibility and quiet determination,' Netanyahu praised his extensive experience and leadership, saying Katz was well-equipped to lead the defense effort during this critical period. Additionally, Netanyahu revealed that he had invited former Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar to join the coalition as foreign minister. Sa'ar, a longtime member of Israel's Security Cabinet, is seen as bringing valuable experience in policy and defense matters. Netanyahu expressed confidence that Sa'ar’s inclusion would strengthen the government and coalition stability, which he described as essential during wartime. 'I am convinced these steps will reinforce the government and the Cabinet, ensuring they work together in harmony for the security of Israel and the victory of the nation,' Netanyahu concluded.

Israel offers $5 million and safe passage for release of Hamas ho...	Netanyahu meets with hostage families and sets price for each released captive, offering safe passage for captors to third country as part of deal; sources say communication with mediators ongoing, hoping to reach deal while Biden still in office Israel has offered $5 million for the release of each hostage held by Hamas, along with safe passage for the captors to a third country, in a bid to secure their freedom, sources familiar with the matter said Tuesday. Officials are working to publicize the offer through various channels, hoping to incentivize those holding the hostages. Israeli officials also believe that a 'renewed momentum' for advancing a deal could emerge after the U.S. elections. The sources said that communication with mediators is ongoing, primarily to explore whether Hamas can be persuaded to soften its demands, which currently include ending the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Several options are reportedly on the table, including a limited initial deal (similar to Egypt's proposal), a phased agreement or a single comprehensive deal. However, all options face significant challenges. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held an extended assessment on the hostage situation Sunday night, with more talks expected in the coming days. Netanyahu also met with families of the hostages Monday evening. Officials anticipate that the U.S. election results will greatly impact negotiations, with President Joe Biden reportedly determined to finalize a deal before his term ends in January. The election outcome could influence mediators—Egypt and Qatar—as well as Hamas, as all parties seek to demonstrate their willingness to reach an agreement and end the war. 'There will be no deal right now' A senior member of the negotiating team for the hostage deal updated families this week, saying that Israel and Hamas have been unable to reach any agreement or compromise on ending the war in Gaza. 'There is someone to talk to, but nothing to talk about,' the official said, describing the current state of negotiations. 'There is a clear understanding within the defense establishment that the hostages will not be returned unless the war in Gaza ends, and right now, there is no willingness from the government to end the war.' Reports Monday from Jerusalem indicated significant pessimism regarding the negotiations. Hamas informed mediators that it refuses to agree to any deal short of a complete cessation of the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The terror group has effectively rejected proposals for smaller, more limited deals. 'The truth must be acknowledged—there will be no deal right now. Not a small one, not a big one, not even a partial one,' sources familiar with the matter said. 'The real question is whether the time has come to save the remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza. That is the entire discussion, and this is what’s happening behind the scenes. There will be no deal without a decision to end the war in Gaza. We must face the facts.' Despite this, the prevailing understanding in Jerusalem is that if Prime Minister Netanyahu opts for a deal tied to ending the war, his government would likely collapse, making such a scenario highly unlikely. There is speculation that Netanyahu may seek to link a major deal to normalization with Saudi Arabia, but that could take many months to materialize. In the meantime, the hostages, who are in constant danger, may not survive long enough for such an agreement to be reached. As the parties await the outcome of the U.S. elections—and its impact on the negotiations—former hostage survivor Maya Sham called on the next U.S. president, whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, to do everything in their power to secure the hostages' release. 'I came here to cry out to the world and to the world's greatest superpower, to demand that whoever is elected in the United States must do everything to release the hostages—not some, not a few. These are our brothers and sisters, suffering every day, every hour, with no one answering their cries,' Sham said at the 'Shurat HaDin' Conference on Combatting Antisemitism. The Hope Forum, representing some of the hostage families, welcomed the setting of a financial offer for the release of the hostages. 'The value of the hostages' lives outweighs the importance of strict justice, especially when it protects the lives of other Israeli citizens. We support this initiative and want to see all of our children brought home,' the forum said.

Knesset approves bill banning teachers who support terrorism, cut...	Terror supporters can no longer be teachers in Israel - it is regrettable that this took us nearly two years, but better late than never,' says bill sponsor MK Amit Halevi The Knesset on Tuesday approved a bill that would ban the employment of educators and cut funding to schools that express support for acts of terrorism or terrorist organizations. The bill, proposed by MKs Zvika Fogel (Otzma Yehudit) and Amit Halevi (Likud), passed with 55 votes in favor and 45 against. 'Terror supporters can no longer be teachers in Israel,' Halevi said. Under the legislation, the director-general of the Education Ministry will have the authority to summarily dismiss a public school teacher without prior notice if the teacher has been convicted of a serious security offense, terrorism-related crime or has publicly expressed support for an act of terror or called for one to take place. The director-general can also refuse to approve the hiring of such educators, with the decision subject to a hearing process. Additionally, the bill grants the education minister the power to reduce or revoke state funding for schools found to have expressed or supported acts of terror or terrorist organizations, if the school administration should have been aware of such activities. This decision would also be subject to a hearing. Presenting the bill to the Knesset, Education Committee Chairman MK Yosef Taieb (Shas) said, 'The purpose of this legislation is to eradicate support for and identification with terrorism within educational institutions in the Jewish state. The influence of such sentiments on students is deeply troubling. This bill is essential and has been carefully deliberated. We cannot allow teachers in Israel who support or align with acts of terrorism.' MK Fogel, who chairs the Knesset’s National Security Committee, added: 'Teachers are among the most influential figures on children and youth in Israeli schools. This bill aims to ensure that educators do not exploit their influence to encourage students to engage in terrorist activity and that schools do not condone such actions.' MK Halevi emphasized, 'Today, the Knesset is taking a crucial step in the fight against our enemies by targeting the strongest foundation of terrorism—education. Terror supporters can no longer serve as teachers in Israel, and schools that align with terrorism will have their funding revoked by the education minister. The law ensures that Israeli students will be educated in justice, science and compassion—not in terrorism, injustice and barbarism. It is regrettable that this took us nearly two years, but better late than never.'

Israel lauds new UK opposition leader as she appoints pro-Israel ...	Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the British government for stopping some export licenses to Israel One day after becoming the head of the UK’s opposition Conservative Party, newly elected leader Kemi Badenoch appointed a steadfast backer of the Israeli government, Priti Patel, as the party’s foreign affairs chief. Chris Newton, a former advisor on defense policy to the Conservative Party, stated that Badenoch appointed Patel a 'staunch supporter of Israel,' which was in line with the Conservative leader’s track record of strongly backing the country. Patel was forced to resign from her post as the international development secretary in 2017 for holding unofficial meetings with Israeli officials without the approval of the UK government. Newton believed Badenoch would 'amplify the party’s support for Israel' and expected her to criticize the Labour government for dropping the previous Conservative government’s plans to oppose the International Criminal Court’s request for arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Newton, however, cautioned that there would be some internal disputes over the UK’s positions on the war in Gaza. 'There’s a minority in the parliamentary party who are highly critical of Israel’s conduct of the war, and they will no doubt air their disagreements with Badenoch. But I don’t think this will affect the party’s overall position,' Newton warned in a message to The Media Line. The Israeli government has praised Badenoch, who has accused the Labour government of weak leadership over the war in Gaza and emboldening Iran. On platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Netanyahu congratulated Badenoch on Sunday, writing, 'I am sure she will continue the great tradition of Israeli-British partnership and friendship.' Foreign Minister Israel Katz also stated on X that Badenoch was a 'true friend of Israel.' After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in October, Badenoch wrote on X that the world is a better place without him, calling Sinwar a terrorist. 'Israel defended the peace-loving world in ridding humanity of this evil. Let us now work for the release of the remaining hostages and an end to the cycle of violence that has plagued the region. Sinwar’s death aids that noble pursuit,' her account stated. In September, she accused the Labour government of 'weak leadership' on Israel after the party suspended 30 arms export licenses, writing on X that 'it will have emboldened Iran' and undermined British national interests. She wrote in an op-ed for the British tabloid newspaper The Sun that the UK benefits from its security relationship with Israel, such as Israeli weapons protecting British personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq, and that intelligence from Israel has stopped and fought against Iranian-sponsored attacks and threats in the UK and Europe. 'When I was Business and Trade Secretary, I made a decision to maintain all existing licenses for arms exports to Israel. We had numerous protests outside my department. On one occasion, the building was stormed,' she wrote. Badenoch came under the spotlight in September when she stated that 'not all cultures are equally valid' when considering who can immigrate to the UK. In an article that month for the Sunday installment of The Daily Telegraph, she wrote that she was 'struck, for example, by the number of recent immigrants to the UK who hate Israel. That sentiment has no place here.' When questioned by journalists about who she was referring to, she insisted she did not mean all Muslims and said she had met many Muslims who love Israel. Following Badenoch’s Conservative Party leadership victory, the Conservative Friends of Israel stated on X: 'Thank you for your staunch support for Israel and the UK’s Jewish community during your time in Government and throughout the leadership contest.

US ultimatum to Israel nears, arms delivery at risk	Israeli officials say Biden administration looking for ways to act in accordance to law without withholding arms; believe chances of ban are higher with Harris in charge Israel will be required to respond to the severe letter sent by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, threatening an arms embargo on Israel, on November 14. The letter, sent to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer in October, presented an American ultimatum to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza or the Biden administration will activate the national security memorandum (NSM 20) and halt arms transfers to Israel in accordance with law. if Israel does not cease blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza within 30 days. According to the memorandum signed in March 2024, Israel committed to allow humanitarian aid to reach Gaza and to not interfere with international humanitarian efforts that the U.S. supports. The U.S. is also demanding that Israel allow International Red Cross visits to Palestinian prisoners and freeze legislation against UNRWA. Political sources said that the Blinken and Austin letter indicated that the Americans don’t want to punish Israel with an arms embargo but are seeking a solution to the severe humanitarian situation in northern Gaza — as they have done in previous letters, after which improvement was noted. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Dermer to draft a response on all issues. Israel now believes that the chances of a U.S. arms embargo are low but still present — if the U.S. State and Defense Departments conclude that Israel is still blocking humanitarian aid, they would be obligated to enforce the law and halt arms deliveries. U.S. state Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that while there has been some improvement, Israel still hasn’t done enough. He said the administration believed that the legislation severing ties with UNRWA, which angered the Americans, won’t help in avoiding the embargo. 'There’s about a week left until the deadline that Blinken and Austin set in their letter to Israel to increase the flow of aid to Gaza, and there’s still a lot more they need to do. The results are not good enough today,' Miller said. Political sources said that the likelihood of enforcing the law and imposing an embargo would be higher should U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris win the election. On the other hand, Trump — if elected — could lift the embargo on his first day in office in January 2025, should one be imposed by the Biden administration.

Chaos or military rule: Scenarios for replacing UNRWA in Gaza	Analysis: Israel's law banning UNRWA in the country leaves several options to replace the UN body in the Strip, including international bodies, Gazan clans and the Palestinian Authority Following Israel’s legislation banning UNRWA’s activity in the country, replacing the 13,000 employees of the UN organization in delivering humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza will be a challenge. The international community, the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israeli officials in the country are all considering alternatives as the 90-day period until UNRWA's activities become outlawed nears its end. According to Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), over 600 aid trucks are waiting to enter the Gaza Strip. Even now UNRWA is struggling to receive the aid and deliver it where it is needed due to the fighting between the IDF troops and Hamas terrorists, especially in northern Gaza Who could be an alternative UNRWA noted that Israeli authorities have encouraged many aid organizations to assist Gaza since the beginning of the war to take part in aid distribution but only a few have been able to operate. There’s a significant systemic failure on the ground, officials in UNRWA said. Many organizations distributed aid to their close associates. An example of this is the aid provided by the United Arab Emirates, managed by associates of a senior former Palestinian official Muhammad Dahlan. 'Most of the aid is sold in markets and not distributed properly,' one displaced Gazan told Ynet. 'There’s no law; Hamas and Dahlan's men are enjoying all the aid that enters while we, Gazans who are not affiliated with any faction, only receive leftovers.' The official page of the UAE aid operation in Gaza previously responded to the claims, saying, 'We oppose what some of the displaced are doing — selling tents and aid that we distributed to them.' The World Central Kitchen organization (WCK), whose seven employees were accidentally killed in an unintentional IDF strike in April, is also operating in the Strip in a limited capacity, running two main kitchens in Gaza and 65 additional community kitchens. It’s capacity, however, isn’t enough to feed the thousands of refugees in Gaza. Another organization considered smaller is the British Human Appeal, which distributes food packages. Most of its employees are Gaza residents. Another charity is the American Anera, which primarily distributes cooked meals to the displaced in Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis. Most of its employees are also residents of the Strip. The Turkish Islamic Relief Organization IHH is still operating in Gaza. Turkish volunteers and Gaza residents are involved in food distribution and assistance with shelter supplies throughout the Strip. Hamas criticized these international relief organizations at the beginning of the war, many of which asked their employees to leave the Strip immediately due to the real danger to their lives. In addition to the continuous aid entering Gaza, a coalition of six countries is regularly providing aid to the Strip via airdrops. Planes from Jordan, Egypt, the U.S., Belgium, the Netherlands and France are dropping aid, usually consisting of foodstuffs and ready-to-eat meals. This method has not proven effective, as a significant number of displaced individuals have been killed by the drops. Military rule Lawmakers in Jerusalem have previously instructed security officials to prepare for the possibility that IDF forces will need to distribute humanitarian aid to the residents of the Strip due to difficulties in its distribution. This option imposes a reality of establishing military law, which would require purchasing basic food products at a cost of NIS 5 billion ($1.3 billion) per year, while risking IDF soldiers in the process. Military officials aren’t enthusiastic about this possibility, but it remains as long as Israel doesn’t present an alternative to UNRWA and Hamas. It’s likely that significant international pressure will be exerted on Israel to avoid establishing military rule in the Gaza Strip. Israeli agreement with Gazan clans Israel has already developed a plan for postwar Gaza centered on cooperation with large clans and influential local families who will take part in governing the Strip. Contacts between Israel and the Gazan clans were already initiated at the beginning of the war, but they encountered many difficulties including threats from Hamas and the assassination of clan leaders. The Palestinian Authority Egypt, as a mediator supporting Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas's rule, has repeatedly invited the Fatah leadership to reach some framework for control over the Strip following the War. Cairo is counting on a national Palestinian agreement between Fatah and Hamas so that the Palestinian Authority can govern the Strip. Egypt hopes the PA’s rule will be able to oversee Gaza’s and aid distribution. Fatah and Hamas have yet to reach an agreement thus far. The Palestinian Authority wishes to regain control over the Strip in all respects, but it seems that Israel isn’t interested in this possibility, fearing Hamas might regain control over the area. While the PA is nearly collapsing economically, its leaders don’t rule out the possibility of returning to govern the Strip, potentially dismantling Hamas's rule via its security mechanisms currently operating in the West Bank.

Tuesdays top headlines: Israel on high alert as US votes, ends UN...	IDF says Israel is poised to meet any potential security challenge on Election Day What are Tuesday’s top headlines? On US Election Day, Israel is on high alert for a potential Iranian missile strike, possibly from an Iraqi proxy, following last month’s Israeli attack on Iran. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Israel Katz has announced Israel's formal exit from the 1967 UNRWA agreement, ending the agency’s operations in territories captured in the Six-Day War after a recent Knesset vote. In other news, the IDF has issued 7,000 additional draft notices to Ultra-Orthodox men, seeking to address recruitment shortfalls after a summer effort enlisted only 230 of the 3,000 Haredi men initially targeted.

US voters head to polls as turbulent campaign concludes	Either of the candidates would make history if they win, Harris as the first woman, Black woman, Asian woman president; Trump as first twice impeached, criminally indicted and former president to serve non-consecutive term The dizzying presidential contest between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris hurtled toward an uncertain finish on Tuesday as millions of Americans headed to the polls to choose between two sharply different visions for the country. A race whipsawed by unprecedented events - two assassination attempts against Trump, President Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal and Harris' rapid rise - remained too close to call, even after billions of dollars in spending and months of frenetic campaigning. Trump told rallygoers that the results should be announced by the end of the day on Tuesday. His campaign has suggested he may declare victory on election night even while millions of ballots have yet to be counted, just as he did four years ago. The former president has repeatedly said any defeat could only stem from widespread fraud, echoing his false claims from 2020. The winner may not be known for days if the margins in key states are as slim as expected. The real drama of the day will begin in the early morning hours on Wednesday, Israel time when the counting of the ballots in a number of key battle count states will begin. Network Pollsters will keep a close eye on the exit polls and decision desks will announce the winners of individual states as they are determined, giving electoral college votes to the candidates. No matter who wins the White House, history will be made. Harris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century. Opinion polls in the campaign's final days have shown the candidates running neck and neck in each of the seven states likely to determine the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows a significant gender gap, with Harris leading among women by 12 percentage points and Trump winning among men by 7 percentage points. The contest reflects a deeply polarized nation whose divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race. Trump has employed increasingly dark and apocalyptic rhetoric on the campaign trail, while Harris has warned that a second Trump term would threaten the very underpinnings of American democracy. Control of both chambers of Congress is also up for grabs. Republicans have an easier path in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats are defending several seats in Republican-leaning states, while the House of Representatives looks like a toss-up. The candidates spent the final weekend barnstorming the swing states in search of every available vote. Trump staged his final rally on Monday evening in Grand Rapids, Michigan, while Harris held twin rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. More than 80 million Americans had already voted before Tuesday, either via mail or in person, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Dark Rhetoric During the campaign, Trump hammered first Biden and then Harris for their handling of the economy, which polls show is at the top of voters' concerns despite low unemployment and cooling inflation. But he showed a characteristic inability to stay on message, at one point questioning Harris' Black identity and vowing to protect women 'whether they like it or not.' His unbridled approach seemed designed to fire up his supporters, rather than expand his appeal. Even more than in 2016 and 2020, Trump has demonized immigrants who crossed the border illegally, falsely accusing them of fomenting a violent crime wave, and he has vowed to use the government to prosecute his political rivals. Polls show he has made some gains among Black and Latino voters, despite the historic nature of Harris' candidacy. Trump has often warned that migrants are taking jobs away from those constituencies. By contrast, Harris has tried to piece together a broader but challenging coalition of liberal Democrats, independents and disaffected moderate Republicans, describing Trump as too dangerous to elect. She campaigned on protecting reproductive rights, an issue that has galvanized women since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 eliminated a nationwide right to abortion. Harris has faced anger from many pro-Palestinian voters over the Biden administration's military and financial support for Israel's war in Gaza. While she has not previewed a shift in U.S. policy, she has said she will do everything possible to end the conflict. After Biden, 81, withdrew amid concerns about his age, Harris sought to turn the tables on Trump, pointing to his rambling rallies as evidence he is unfit. Her campaign's embrace of viral memes and a parade of celebrity endorsements gained her traction with young voters seen as a critical voting bloc. Trump countered the likes of Harris supporters Taylor Swift and Beyonce with Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who played an increasingly visible role as a surrogate and a top donor to Trump's cause. Tuesday's vote follows one of the most turbulent half-years in modern American politics. In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to a porn star. Four weeks later, Trump and Biden met for their only debate, where the incumbent president delivered a disastrous performance that supercharged voters' existing concerns about his mental acuity. In July, Trump narrowly escaped a would-be assassin's bullet at a Pennsylvania rally, just before the Republican National Convention. Barely a week later, Biden exited the race, bowing to pressure from Democratic leaders. Harris' entry into the race re-energized her party, and she raised more than $1 billion in less than three months while erasing Trump's lead over Biden in public polls.

Iran religious group recognizes Israel, causing outrage	Reformist assembly in Qom says the 'Zionist regime' should return to pre-1967 Six Day war borders and for a Palestinian state to be established alongside it A Muslim religious institution caused outrage in Iran after it called for a 2-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, thereby recognizing the Jewish state's right to exist. The Assembly of Lecturers and Scholars in Qom, a reformist group of religious clerics, issued a statement calling for 'the Zionist regime,' to return to 'the legal borders before the aggressions of 1967, and for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State.' Iran has never supported a 2-state solution opting to aspire to the annihilation of Israel. Tehran did not take part in a summit conference in Riyadh on a 2-state solution, with the participation of most countries in the region. In August, Iran's deputy president Mohammed Jawad Zarif was quoted as saying that the Iranian people are tired of a government that is more Palestinian than the Palestinians are themselves. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei prompted pushback in 2020 when he portrayed his future for Jerusalem to have Palestinian and Hezbollah troops guarding the holy Muslim site on the Temple Mount and pictures of the father of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khomeini, slain IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani and Hezbollah leader, since slain, Hassan Nasrallah. The caption read Palestine Will be Free' and 'The final solution – armed resistance until referendum' Following the expressions of outrage, the reformist group in Qom issued a second statement that was not a retraction but added a sentence referring to 'the despicable crimes of the Zionist state.' The group reiterated its opinion that the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel would end the violence and bloodshed.

Security expert: Iranians are on a ‘revenge mission’	Interview with former MK Ksenia Svetlova Iran is expected to launch an attack on Israel to demonstrate its strength and power, according to one security and political expert. Former Knesset member Ksenia Svetlova told ILTV News that 'the Iranians, by now, have their own score.' She explained that Iran is no longer solely focused on Hezbollah, Hamas, or on retaliating for Israel’s targeted assassinations of these proxies' leaders. 'Right now, this is about the survival of the Iranians,' Svetlova said. She added that if Israel signs a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah, there could be enough pressure on Iran to delay any attack, refrain from attacking, or at least conduct a milder response. However, she believes the Iranians are on a 'revenge mission.' 'Israel has to be very smart and strong about it,' Svetlova said. Iran previously attacked Israel in April and October, prompting Israeli retaliation. Most recently, Israel conducted 'precise strikes' on military targets in Iran. 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran,' Israel’s military spokesman Daniel Hagari said.

Germany arrests 8 far-right activists plotting revolt	Suspects are part of a Saxonian militant antisemitic group training in warfare, planning ethnic cleansing, in future Nazi-inspired system, prosecution says German police have arrested eight suspected members of a right-wing militant group driven by racist ideology and conspiracy theories who had been training in warfare for the downfall of the modern German state, prosecutors said on Tuesday. The suspects are part of an organization formed no later than November 2020 called 'Saechsische Separatisten', or Saxonian Separatists, the federal prosecutor's office said in a statement. 'It is a militant group of 15 to 20 individuals whose ideology is characterized by racist, anti-Semitic and partially apocalyptic ideas,' the statement added. Convinced that Germany is nearing collapse, with the fall of government and society prophesied for an undetermined 'Day X', the group had been training to use force to establish a new system in the country's east inspired by National Socialism, according to investigators. 'If necessary, unwanted groups of people are supposed to be removed from the area by means of ethnic cleansing,' the statement said. Those arrested include four suspected founding members, identified as Joerg S., Joern S., Karl K. and Norman T. The suspects are part of an organization formed no later than November 2020 called 'Saechsische Separatisten', or Saxonian Separatists, the federal prosecutor's office said in a statement.

Expert: U.S. election unlikely to ‘dramatically’ influence Israel...	ILTV speaks with Prof. Zachi Shalom of Misgav Institute An Israeli expert on U.S.-Israel relations has suggested that the outcome of the U.S. election is unlikely to have any dramatic influence on Israeli policy, particularly regarding the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. 'When you look at what happened in the last year, there were ups and downs. Yes, there were disagreements and embarrassing moments,' admitted Prof. Zachi Shalom of the Misgav Institute. However, he added, 'you see that Israel has done what it wanted to do.' For example, while the United States opposed the entry of Israeli soldiers into Gaza, Israel proceeded. The U.S. also opposed the capture of Gaza hospitals, yet Israel captured them. America requested that Israel not enter Rafah, but Israel did. The U.S. further opposed an Israeli attack on Iran, which was ultimately carried out by American forces. 'I don’t belong to those who think there is going to be a dramatic change if the winner is going to be [former U.S. President Donald] Trump or [Vice President Kamala] Harris,' Shalom stated. 'It all depends on us, on our unity in Israel, on our resilience, on our standing, and on what we want to do.' Shalom expressed concern that the winning candidate might not secure a sufficient margin, leading to a contested outcome. 'The main problem in the United States is not who is going to win, but whether the other side will accept the outcome,' he explained. 'The question is whether [one side] will try to challenge the election by violent means.'

IDF can take only limited number of Haredi men, but economy needs...	Israeli-American David Hagar who invested in IDF's Haredi battalion says the military is already struggling with meeting the needs of ultra-Orthodox men who cannot serve with women; says the cost of a Haredi family to taxpayers is 1,7000 shekels each month David Hagar, an Israeli-American businessman who has been advocating for the Haredi draft says it is unrealistic to expect all ultra-Orthodox men of conscription age, would be able to serve in the IDF. In an interview with Ynet Hagar said the military already struggles to accommodate the Haredi soldiers among its troops, even in the one dedicated battalion set up to allow them to continue within the confines of their religious belief. 'You cannot believe the headache it causes the military,' he said. Every battalion must allocate soldiers for specific training that is held in mixed male and female groups and is often given by women soldiers,' he said adding that senior IDF officers told him the military would only be able to handle two more such battalions and no more. How many soldiers would two more battalions include? Between 1,000 and 1,200 only. How has the war changed the situation? After the war began, the IDF decided to establish a Haredi brigade and claimed it could absorb 3,000 ultra-Orthodox soldiers in the first year so not all Haredi men must enlist simply because the military cannot take them in. This is a more complex issue than how many are drafted and there must be equality among all sectors. Let's talk about the Haredi community. What has to change there? There is a change from the bottom up. I recently asked a prominent rabbi why Yeshiva heads don't tell men who do not study full-time, to go into the army and he told me those who do not study, should enlist, which is a major shift, But he also argued that no one can decide how many hours of study is enough to be considered a Yeshiva student. Some study 12-hour days others less. Hagar was among the people behind the establishment of the IDF's Haredi battalion and invested a great deal of money over the past 25 years, in the effort. He says he expected it to bring more ultra-Orthodox men to serve in the military. That money could have been invested elsewhere I used to sit with then chairman of the Israel Bank, Stanley Fischer and would tell him that I believed that within four decades, the burden on Israel's economy from Haredi's absence from the job market would require more taxes on the rest of the population. A Haredi family today costs the Israeli taxpayers some 17,000 shekels each month.	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sy4rpvdbyl	2024-11-05T01:20:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/23/BJ14iyau0/BJ14iyau0_0_289_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Macron is losing his way': Israeli companies display at Euronava...	Several Israeli companies manage to set up stalls in the prestigious arms exhibit following prolonged battle against government-issued ban overturned by French court; officials slam Macron's actions Israeli defense companies set up booths in the 2024 Euronaval exhibition, one of the largest events of naval arms manufacturing in the world held in France, after the Paris Commercial Court overturned a decision by the event to ban Israeli companies from participating. The significant drama surrounding Israel's participation in the exhibition was seen as yet another sign of the recently tense relationship with France. The French National Security and Defense Council, equivalent to Israel’s National Security Council, clarified on October 15 to the exhibition organizers that while it wasn’t boycotting Israel, it would refuse displays of Israeli products and companies. This decision followed a statement from French President Emmanuel Macron, who called 'to halt arms shipments used in fighting in Gaza.' Consequently, the council refused the display of arms involved in IDF operations in Lebanon or Gaza. The Manufacturers Association of Israel, Israel Shipyards and the France-Israel Chamber of Commerce petitioned the commercial court, which ruled that the Israelis could exhibit in Euronaval as 'commercial companies seeking to establish connections with others should not be discriminated against.' 'We analyzed the situation and decided to assume we could take part,' said Israel Shipyards CEO Eitan Zucker. 'Here we are.' The company showcased new missile boat models and patrol boats, designed for coastal defense in shallow waters and proven effective during the recent conflict. Some countries turned a cold shoulder to Israeli companies at the exhibition, though others displayed a friendly attitude. Representatives from Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which set up a booth in just two days, also reported growing interest. 'We developed cutting-edge systems during the war,' said Yoram Israeli, the company’s head of marketing. 'We’re engaged in asymmetric warfare against terrorist organizations that use both advanced weapons from major powers and items bought online. We’ve created solutions for both challenges, with weapons capable of targeting drones and gliders. It’s important for us to participate in this exhibition,' he added. Despite the successful appeal, two Israeli companies — Israel Aerospace Industries and Elbit Systems — chose not to set up booths. An exception was DSIT, one of the few Israeli companies permitted to exhibit even before the court ruling. 'We were hesitant; we didn’t want to be isolated here,' said DSIT’s vice president of marketing Amir Alon. DSIT sells underwater sonars for detecting divers and hostile vessels and they, too, feel the varying responses from different countries. 'Some companies are waiting for the dust to settle to resume work with us, while others recognize the proven value of our technology and come to visit,' Alon noted. Orbit had already faced a last-minute court ruling this year regarding the Eurosatory arms exhibition, which prevented it from setting up a booth in time. 'We decided to bring our equipment this time,' explained Orbit’s sales manager Aryeh Vered. 'We face challenges entering new markets in Scandinavian countries, but European companies we work with, like Italy’s Leonardo, are glad to see us here.' Israeli participation in the event wasn’t a given. After their legal victory at the Eurosatory fair, Israel and France prepared for another legal round. 'At the last fair, the appeal was filed a day before opening. This time, we heard rumors about a possible ban, but we couldn’t enter proceedings without an official statement,' explained Manufacturers Association of Israel chairman Ron Tomer. 'Fortunately, the document prohibiting Israel from setting up booths was leaked about two weeks before the fair. At that point, we began discussions with the official bodies, as there were procedures we needed to exhaust,' he added. 'We don’t accept the idea that Israelis can’t take place in exhibits anywhere in the world. Criticizing Israel is acceptable but creating a situation where France — a sovereign and friendly nation to Israel — denies it rights is unacceptable,' he said. Patrick Klugman, the lawyer who led the Israeli legal team for the petition, claimed he wasn’t sure of victory. 'At Eurosatory, the organizing company said it was under pressure from government policy but didn’t provide supporting evidence. The French were very embarrassed by the petition filed by pro-Palestinian organizations.' 'The situation was very different this time,' he explained. 'Euronaval complied with two decisions from the National Security and Defense Council. We knew it reflected Macron’s wishes. It’s very rare for the Grand Paris Area Commander to appear and ask the commercial court not to rule, as that essentially would mean the judiciary is criticizing a state decision. His presence suggests that they may see our appeal as a protest against the political decision.' Israel and France's next legal battle? Hugues du Plessis d'Agentre, the director of Sogena, which operates the exhibition, avoided expressing a clear stance on the issue. 'We’re always pleased that the Israelis, like all industries from around the world allied with France, can participate in the exhibition. There was a public dispute and that’s all behind us as far as we’re concerned and we’re very pleased,' he said. When asked about the company’s position on the issue, he continued to take a diplomatic approach. 'The delegations are invited by the government, not by us. Our position is to comply with the law. The government made a decision and we followed its instructions. The judicial system overturned the decision and we complied with the court’s ruling.' The next potential legal clash between Israel and France over participation in another arms exhibition is set to take place next summer, ahead of the Paris Air Show. 'It’s the world’s largest exhibition. We won’t allow ourselves to be boycotted,' Tomer clarified. 'I hope the French government understands this. If not, we’ll fight again.' Israel’s ambassador to France Joshua Zarka came to congratulate the Israeli participants and show support. 'It’s a sweet victory,' he told Ynet. 'The State of Israel supports the defense industry, which is integral to Israeli national security, and we must do everything as a nation to strengthen it. In our view, the decision to impose the ban was entirely mistaken.'

German police have arrested eight suspected members of a right-wing militant group driven by racist ideology and conspiracy theories who had been training in warfare for the downfall of the modern German state, prosecutors said on Tuesday.

Houthis turn to social media to raise funds for war	Iran's proxy tells the already impoverished population in Yemen that they can be partners in the path to victory; 'Fire your own missile,' a post reads Yemen's Houthi rebels have been campaigning on social media, to raise money for their fight against Israel. 'Be a partner in bringing victory, donate 100 Yemeni rials and help the missile force,' a Houthi post read. The rebels, who are part of the Iranian army of proxies and are mostly funded by Tehran, were appealing to supporters for donations despite the abject poverty of most of Yemen's population after years of civil war. Donations can be made either via telephone or through a dedicated bank account. 'Fire your own missile,' and 'Support the missile or drone forces,' are some of the slogans the Houthis were using in their posts. In one, they added a drawing of the Palestine missile, that the rebels claimed to have fired at Israel, made from coins. The appeals for cash are spread by a musical group of supporters of the Iran-backed rebels which releases songs to the web at a considerable pace. The group released songs about slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and slain Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. An official in Sanaa said some civilians in areas under Houthi control, where unemployment is high and poverty rates skyrocketed, oppose the rebels' attempt to raise funds at the expense of the population. He said that Houthi supporters follow the attacks on ships in the Red Sea with enthusiasm and believe their donations fund the rebels' military force. He said people give large sums of money, gold and even cars or weapons, which are a source of income for the Iran-proxies and help the terror business thrive. Hezbollah, Iran's largest and best-equipped and funded proxy, also raises money in addition to the funding from Tehran. The IDF has gone after Hezbollah's banks in an effort to stop the influx of cash that allows the terror group to re-arm and continue its war against Israel.

Border police uncover large sum of money in a routine inspection at a West Bank checkpoint arresting a suspect wanted for funding terror The IDF said on Tuesday that it killed two armed terrorists in a drone strike near the West Bank city of Jenin. Forces were conducting anti-terror raids on villages in the area overnight and in the morning hours, and according to Palestinian reports, at least two people were killed. Forces located explosives produced in the village of Tubas and detonated them while the operation continued. In a separate incident, Border Police forces found more than one million shekels in cash in a car belonging to a Palestinian resident of Hebron who was wanted on suspicion of funding terrorism. The man was stopped for a routine check at a checkpoint when the cash was discovered in his car.

Musk and X are epicenter of US election misinformation, experts s...	Musk's massive reach with nearly 203 million followers helps enable 'network effects' in which content on X can jump to other social media and messaging platforms False or misleading claims by billionaire Elon Musk about the U.S. election have amassed 2 billion views on social media platform X this year, according to a report by non-profit group Center for Countering Digital Hate. The platform is also playing a central role in enabling the spread of false information about the critical battleground states that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential race, election and misinformation experts said on Monday. A spokesperson for X said the company's Community Notes feature, which lets users add additional context to posts, is more effective at helping people identify misleading content than traditional warning flags on posts. Since taking over the company formerly known as Twitter, Musk has curtailed content moderation and laid off thousands of employees. He has thrown his support behind former President Donald Trump, who is locked in an exceptionally close race against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Musk's massive reach with nearly 203 million followers helps enable 'network effects' in which content on X can jump to other social media and messaging platforms such as Reddit and Telegram, said Kathleen Carley, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and expert on disinformation. 'X is a conduit from one platform to another,' she said. At least 87 of Musk's posts this year have promoted claims about the U.S. election that fact-checkers have rated as false or misleading, amassing 2 billion views, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate's report. In Pennsylvania, one of the seven key swing states, some X users have seized on instances of local election administrators flagging incomplete voter registration forms that would not be processed, falsely casting the events as examples of election interference, said Philip Hensley-Robin, Pennsylvania executive director at Common Cause, during a press briefing on Monday. Common Cause is a nonpartisan organization that promotes accountable government and voting rights. Some X accounts implied 'that there was voter fraud, when in fact, we know very clearly that election officials and election administrators in all of our counties were following the rules and â€¦ therefore only eligible voters are voting,' Hensley-Robin said. Cyabra, a firm that uses AI to detect online disinformation, said on Monday that an X account with 117,000 followers played a key role in helping spread a fake video purporting to show Pennsylvania mail-in ballots for Trump being destroyed. X's spokesperson said the platform took action against many accounts that shared the video.

Sirens activated in the early morning hours sending hundreds of thousands into shelters; IDF says a soldier suffered serious injuries in South Lebanon fighting Hezbollah fired a barrage of rockets and missiles at the coastal cities of Acre and Haifa and their surrounding areas on Tuesday, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis into shelters in the early morning hours. The attack came after a relatively quiet night with the last barrage targeting the Upper Galilee region including the northern city of Safed. The IDF said it intercepted a drone that crossed into Israeli territory across the Syrian border overnight. Residents of the Jezreel Valley region said they heard loud sounds of explosions likely from aerial defenses intercepting the incoming threats. According to the military two projectiles were shot down and emergency services said there were no immediate reports of injuries in the attack. The military said a soldier was badly hurt in the fighting in South Lebanon as the IDF continued its operation to uproot Hezbollah terrorists from the area, destroy its infrastructure and prevent it from attacking the Galilee.

IDF says 2 female soldiers attacked by settlers, US furious over ...	Security forces launch manhunt against Israeli assailants after targeting troops in West Bank; U.S.'s Miller seeks accountability from Israel on settler violence The IDF reported on Monday that 'several Israeli settlers attacked two female IDF soldiers at an illegal West Bank outpost. The soldiers received medical attention on the scene and the attackers fled, prompting security forces to launch a manhunt. The IDF condemns any violence against its soldiers and will continue working to maintain order in the West Bank.' Earlier, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller opened his daily briefing with a statement condemning Jewish settler violence in the West Bank. 'It is incidents like this in the past that led us to impose sanctions, and we certainly will be looking at this one, as we look at others to see if the government of Israel takes steps to impose accountability and if they don’t know [we’ll be looking at] what we might do on our end,' Miller said. 'It is critical that the government of Israel deter extremist settler violence and take measures to protect all communities from harm in accordance with its international obligations,' he added. During the night, unknown assailants reportedly set fire to at least 19 Palestinian vehicles in the city of al-Bireh, near Ramallah. Two buildings were also damaged and the police and Shin Bet have launched an investigation into the incident. According to local residents, the arson was carried out by 'armed settlers,' and the Palestinian Authority has called on the international community 'to pressure Israel to halt violations against Palestinians.' Miller noted, 'I have no new sanctions to announce today but incidents like these have prompted us to impose sanctions in the past. If the Israeli government doesn’t take steps to prosecute those responsible, we’ll consider what actions we can take on our end and we’ve made this clear to the Israeli government.' He also mentioned reports of 'extremist settlers setting 20 Palestinian cars on fire in the West Bank. When the owners attempted to extinguish the blaze, the settlers fired at them.' Miller added that the U.S. is very concerned by such incidents and similar reports of escalating violence from extremists in the West Bank, including attacks on people, vehicle arson, property damage, siccing dogs on individuals and preventing olive harvesting. ' These violent actions cause immense human suffering for Palestinians, they threaten Israel’s security, make the realization of a two-state solution more difficult, and undermine the prospects for peace and stability throughout the region,' he said. The U.S. has already imposed sanctions on settlers and organizations during the ongoing war for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, citing that Israel hasn’t done enough to enforce the law in these areas. The UK and the European Union have also joined in applying these sanctions.

UN General Assembly to discuss Israel's UNRWA ban	The informal session will include a briefing from UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini; initiative by Norway to seek ICJ opinion on Israel's move The UN General Assembly will discuss Israel's legislation severing ties with the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). The informal session will include a briefing from UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini. The Knesset voted to sever all ties with UNRWA last week and lift its privileges to operate in its territory after members of the organization were found to have participated in the Hamas atrocities during the October 7 massacre. The United States and European allies urged the government against approving the bill warning that the move could ultimately lead to Israel's removal from its membership in the United Nations because it would be violating the UN charter. The British government was considering further restrictions on arms sales to Israel in response to the legislation. On Monday State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the United States was concerned that ending UNRWA's role in Gaza would further hamper humanitarian efforts in the Strip that were already insufficient. 'We oppose that legislation and have serious concerns about the implications of its being fully implemented as well as our concerns about the underlying humanitarian situation in Gaza even before Israel legislated the bill,' Miller said. Foreign Minister Israel Katz informed the UN of the law that will come into effect in three months and said Israel was working to replace UNRWA with other humanitarian groups that do not have ties to terrorism. Officials in Jerusalem said they believed that countries wpi make adjustments to the delivery of aid into Gaza but would not say so openly, to avoid being seen as deserting UNRWA. Norway has been working to move the matter of UNRWA to the International Court of Justice in the Hague, for review and Israeli officials said other countries will take similar initiatives.

Israel can end Lebanon fight but no progress in sight for Gaza	Officials say ending the war may be the only way to save hostages because Hamas refuses any deal before war ends; U.S. says Israel cannot afford a perpetual fight in Gaza Officials involved in negotiations for a cease-fire in Lebanon said on Monday that there could be an agreement within the next two weeks but a decision must be made in Jerusalem. Israel and the U.S. made progress on the document that would be added to any cease-fire deal and would ensure Israel's freedom to operate militarily in South Lebanon, if the terms of the cease-fire are violated and measures are not taken in response. Lebanese MTV channel reported on Monday evening that US envoy Amos Hochstein and President Joe Biden's special ambassador Brett McGurk will return to the region next week. While there is some optimism that a cease-fire can be agreed on in Lebanon, there is much pessimism among Israeli officials that any progress to reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal with Hamas in Gaza has not taken place. Hamas said it rejected any proposal that did not include an Israeli withdrawal from all of the Gaza Strip and an end to the war. 'Truth must be told, there is no sliver of a deal. The question is whether now we must save the surviving hostages and end the war in Gaza,' officials said. 'We must face facts.' But observers in Jerusalem note that if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agrees to end the war, his coalition would fall, so he is not likely to choose that path. He may attempt to tie a cease-fire deal to the efforts to reach normalization with Saudi Arabia, but that would take months. The hostages are under constant threat and may not survive. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in his daily briefing to reporters that the administration would like to see an end to the war and is working toward that aim. Miller added that Israel was one side of the conflict and Hamas has continued to fight. Israel cannot afford - for many reasons, economically, diplomatically, in terms of its standing around the world to continue to fight a perpetual conflict in Gaza,' he said 'To get to a long-term stand you have to have a political path.' Officials in Israel were bracing for increased pressure from the U.S. to end the war, that will come soon after the elections on Tuesday. They believe that no matter who wins the race to the White House, the Biden administration will want to reach a deal that will end the war and free the hostages, as part of his legacy. If Trump is elected, Netanyahu may now want to give Biden the win with a deal in Lebanon and the release of the hostages. On the other hand, Trump also called for the war to end.

The Israeli vote could determine the US election,' former Israel...	Speaking to Ynet, former Israeli ambassador Michael Oren discusses upcoming Harris vs. Trump showdown, focusing on Muslim vote in Michigan, Jewish community's growing support for GOP candidate and ongoing challenges American Jews face regarding identity and perception Speaking to Ynet, former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren offered his analysis of the increasingly tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, predicting it will go down to the wire. While Trump appears to lead in most battleground states, Oren noted that his margin remains within the margin of error, leaving the contest too close to call and both candidates neck and neck as election day approaches. According to Oren, voter turnout will play a key role in determining the identity of the next president, with Trump relying on young male voters and Harris banking on female turnout. 'If the women come out, Harris has an advantage. If the men come out, Trump has an advantage,' Oren said. When asked about Trump's appearance at a Michigan rally where Arab supporters expressed concerns about the Palestinian issue, Oren downplayed the notion that this represented a policy shift. 'I think it's obvious he's going to go toward these voters,' Oren said. 'Keep in mind Arab and Muslim Americans are not just Arabs and Muslims, they are people who belong to the middle class. They have small businesses, and they like Trump. As for his economic policies, they also like Trump for his security policies.' He explained that while the Democratic Party has called for defunding the police, Trump has positioned himself as a strong supporter of law enforcement, a stance that resonates with many in these communities. Oren also pointed to a religious dimension. 'Many of these people are religiously observant. They see a Democratic Party which is increasingly atheist [and] in favor of abortion. For example, do you think that people who are religious Muslims are in favor of abortion? They may not be. This is why Trump is gaining, not only among Arab Americans and Muslim Americans. You go by a small margin, but certainly among African Americans, Black Americans and Latino Americans.' Addressing the Jewish vote, Oren acknowledged that American Jews have traditionally supported the Democratic Party based on values rather than economic interests. However, he suggested that this year could be different. 'In the past, close to 80% of American Jews have voted with the Democratic Party. This year, it's going to be less, not only because of Israel. It has to do with wokeism and political correctness and the difficulty Jews have getting ahead today because they're perceived as white and affluent and not as members of a minority,' Oren explained. While the Jewish vote may not shift the outcome in Democratic strongholds like New York, he said, it could prove decisive in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia. 'There are as many as 500,000 Israelis who have the right to vote in the U.S. election,' he said, highlighting the strong pro-Trump campaign in Israel, including a large billboard urging support for the Republican candidate along Ayalon Highway, one of the nation's main arteries. He pointed out that many Israeli voters are registered in key swing states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, and their votes could ultimately determine the election's outcome. 'The Israeli vote could determine this election,' Oren concluded.

Trump and Harris make final push before elections in rally blitz	Presidential candidate launch fierce battle for votes in final 24 hours before one of the tightest races seen in U.S. history; 78 million Americans place their votes so far The last full day of the 2024 U.S. elections campaign began on Monday, with the race for the White House tighter than ever. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are taking advantage of the hours before heading to the polls to make campaign stops in the swing states that will tip the balance, holding a blitz of rallies. Harris is spending Monday in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes offer the largest prize among the states expected to determine the Electoral College outcome. The vice president and Democratic nominee will visit working-class areas, including Allentown, and end with a late-night Philadelphia rally that includes Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey. Trump has four rallies in three states, beginning in Raleigh, North Carolina and stopping twice in Pennsylvania with events in Reading and Pittsburgh, both areas Harris is also visiting Monday. The Republican nominee and former president ends his campaign the way he ended the first two, with a late Monday night event in Grand Rapids, Michigan. There were plenty of empty seats at the J.S. Dorton Arena, a 5,000-seat venue with additional seating on the floor in the Raleigh arena where Trump was kicking of his campaign day. One attendee, Ebony Coots, said she regretted voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and is now backing Trump — but is nervous about Tuesday’s election. 'You know, actually, I might try to go to another planet,' Coots, a 48-year-old delivery driver, said if Harris were to win. About 78 million Americans already have voted early. Either result on Election Day will yield a historic outcome. First woman president or first felon president? A Trump victory would make him the first incoming president to have been indicted and convicted of a felony, after his hush-money trial in New York. He will gain the power to end other federal investigations pending against him. Trump would also become the second president in history to win non-consecutive White House terms, after Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century. Harris is vying to become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to reach the Oval Office — four years after she broke the same barriers in national office by becoming President Joe Biden’s second in command. The vice president ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden’s disastrous performance in a June debate set into motion his withdrawing from the race — one of a series of convulsions that have hit this year’s campaign. Trump survived by millimeters a would-be assassin’s bullet at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. His Secret Service detail foiled a second attempt in September when a gunman had set up a rifle as Trump golfed at one of his courses in Florida. Harris, 60, has played down the historic nature of her candidacy, which materialized only after the 81-year-old president ended his reelection bid after his June debate against the 78-year-old Trump accentuated questions about Biden’s age. Instead, Harris has pitched herself as a generational change, emphasized her support for abortion rights after the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision ending the constitutional right to abortion services, and regularly noted the former president’s role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Assembling a coalition ranging from progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney, Harris has called Trump a threat to democracy and late in the campaign even embraced the critique that Trump is accurately described as a ' fascist.' Heading into Monday, Harris has mostly stopped mentioning Trump. She is promising to solve problems and seek consensus, while sounding an almost exclusively optimistic tone reminiscent of her campaign’s opening days when she embraced 'the politics of joy' and the campaign theme 'Freedom.' 'From the very start, our campaign has not been about being against something, it is about being for something,' Harris said Sunday evening at Michigan State University. In Allentown, home to tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans, Harris will hold a rally with rapper Fat Joe before visiting a Puerto Rican restaurant in Reading with Ocasio-Cortez. Both Fat Joe, whose real name is Joseph Cartagena, and Ocasio-Cortez, are of Puerto Rican heritage. The stops come after a comic at a recent Donald Trump rally suggested that Puerto Rico was a 'floating island of garbage.' The former president, renewing his 'Make America Great Again' and 'America First' slogans, has made his hard-line approach to immigration and withering criticisms of Harris and Biden the anchors of his argument for a second administration. He’s hammered Democrats for an inflationary economy, and he’s pledged to lead an economic 'golden age,' end international conflicts and seal the U.S. southern border. But Trump also has veered often into grievances over being prosecuted after trying to overturn Biden’s victory and repeatedly denigrated the country he wants to lead again as a 'failed nation.' As recently as Sunday, he renewed his false claims that U.S. elections are rigged against him, mused about violence against journalists and said he ' shouldn’t have left' the White House in 2021 — dark turns that have overshadowed another anchor of his closing argument: 'Kamala broke it. I will fix it.' The election is likely to be decided across seven states. Trump won Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016 only to see them flip to Biden in 2020. North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada add the Sun Belt swath of the presidential battleground map. Trump won North Carolina twice and lost Nevada twice. He won Arizona and Georgia in 2016 but saw them slip to Democrats in 2020. Harris’ team has projected confidence in recent days, pointing to a large gender gap in early voting data and research showing late-deciding voters have broken her way. They also believe in the strength of their campaign infrastructure. This weekend, the Harris campaign had more than 90,000 volunteers helping turn out voters — and knocked on more than 3 million doors across the battleground states. Still, Harris aides have insisted she remains the underdog. Trump’s team has projected confidence, as well, arguing that the former president’s populist appeal will attract younger and working-class voters across racial and ethnic lines. The idea is that Trump can amass an atypical Republican coalition, even as other traditional GOP blocks — notably college-educated voters — become more Democratic.

Israel strikes Hezbollah intelligence site near Damascus, IDF say...	The compound includes an independent intelligence gathering, coordination, and assessment network; was under the command of Mahmoud Mohammed Shaheen and Hezbollah's Head of Intelligence, Hassan Ali al-Zaima both killed in Dahieh attacks The IDF said on Monday that it attacked a Hezbollah intelligence site near Damascus. The compound includes an independent intelligence gathering, coordination, and assessment network and was under the direct command of Hezbollah's Head of Intelligence, Hassan Ali al-Zaima who was assassinated in a strike on Beirut's Dahieh last September along with the designated leader of the terror group Hashem Safieddine. According to the military in that same strike, chief of Hezbollah's intelligence branch in Syria Mahmoud Mohammed Shaheen was also killed. Earlier Syrian state media reported an Israeli strike near the Sayyeda Zeinab area south of Damascus, home to an important Shiite sanctuary and guarded by pro-Iranian groups, including Hezbollah. 'According to initial reports, an Israeli aggression targeted the area around Sayyeda Zeinab,' the official SANA news agency said, without providing additional details. Three sites were targeted, Syrian radio said in a report. News outlet affiliated with the opposition said sources close to the Assad regime reported that at least two members of Hezbollah were killed and five others injured in the attack on a farm belonging to Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Sayeda Zeinab, a stronghold of the Iran-backed terror group and the site of a major Shi'ite shrine, has been targeted in previous strikes. Syrian and Western intelligence sources say Israeli attacks in Syria have killed numerous Hezbollah and pro-Iranian militia fighters based around the eastern outskirts of Damascus and to the south of the city. The sources say the neighborhood remains a target due to the presence of high-ranking militia leaders.

No UNRWA, no food in Gaza, residents fear	UNRWA officials warn of rampant chaos in the Strip if nothing is done to replace the UN body; Israel claims tapping alternatives are organizations with no link to terror, some already active in the area Gazans are concerned about the repercussions of Israel's decision to cancel its agreement with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). Efforts are underway to find alternatives or prevent the decision from being implemented. 'There's chaos, and food has almost completely run out. What should we do now? Die of hunger?' said a displaced person in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. UNRWA spokesperson Adnan Abu Hasna added, 'There's no substitute for the agency's operations.' In an interview with Ynet, Abu Hasna explained that attempts were made over the past year to introduce other organizations to replace UNRWA in the Strip, but according to him, 'these are small organizations that can't replace a massive institution like UNRWA, which has 13,000 employees and hundreds of facilities. No one can be a substitute for UNRWA logistically; therefore, chaos will ensue.' Data from Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) indicates that around 600 aid trucks are still waiting to be distributed in Gaza. The inability to maintain a steady distribution pace and a severe shortage of personnel in Gaza don’t bode well for the displaced population in the enclave. Abu Hasna noted that various aid organizations have operated in the area throughout the year, but their smaller scale has hindered them from keeping up with demand. One of these organizations is 'al-Sahm al-Shahim,' staffed by associates of Palestinian politician Mohammed Dahlan. However, criticism against the organization has recently sounded in Gaza. 'They're discriminatory in distributing aid and medical supplies,' said one of the displaced. 'There are already alternatives to UNRWA present,' Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in response to UNRWA's claims that no aid alternative exists in the Strip. 'Other international aid organizations aren’t involved in terrorist activities.' He stressed that Israel 'is committed to international law and will continue to uphold it, while ensuring the safety of its citizens.' 'Despite extensive evidence presented to the UN showing that UNRWA employees participated in the October 7 massacre and that many of them are Hamas terrorists, the UN has ignored this and taken no action in the matter,' he added. The Palestinian Authority has also expressed concern, with presidential spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh having accused Israel of 'disregarding all international norms, conventions, resolutions and international humanitarian law.' 'Israel continues its campaign against UNRWA to disregard the refugee issue, cancel the right of return and obstruct its operations and mandate,' he added. 'The world must take serious and concrete actions against Israel. This decision by the Israeli government is very dangerous.' Meanwhile, the agency is expected to continue operating in Gaza according to UNRWA's official website and providing services to Palestinian refugees 'until a fair and lasting solution to their issue is found.' The agency noted that the responsibility to assist in finding this solution lies with the international community.

Echoes of 1979: Iran’s influence over hostility on U.S. soil, fai...	Comment: ‘The world hasn’t learned its lesson’ The Islamic regime in Iran threatening the United States is nothing new. In fact, it's been a hallmark of the government since its inception. In 1979, the regime's entire identity was founded upon a fanatic, genocidal hatred of Israel, the little Satan and the United States, the great Satan, both of which they routinely called to eradicate, going back to 45 years ago today, when a radicalized mob of student Islamic revolutionaries attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and began the start of the Iranian hostage crisis, taking 53 American diplomats and staff hostage for 444 days. This violation of international law had the full backing and endorsement of Ayatollah Khomeini, who had come to power in part thanks to the appeasement of the US administration at the time, who refused to support the Shah of Iran. Sensing American weakness, the Ayatollah used the hostage crisis for over a year to create a narrative that incites against the West, all while innocent Americans were being held hostage in inhumane conditions. Sadly, it seems the world hasn't learned the lessons of this tragic event, as we are still dealing with the same problems today, whether it be violent student protests, policies of appeasement or ongoing hostage crises. Since October 7, Western campuses have become a battleground, with students conducting violent antisemitic protests, waving flags of terror groups, burning American flags and even hijacking buildings and taking hostages. This is not a coincidence. What we're seeing is straight from the playbook of the Islamist Communist Alliance, which we saw destroy Iran in 1979. In fact, the US government has confirmed some of these recent anti-Israel protests have even been funded by the regime in Iran. Yet, instead of administrators or law enforcement taking a zero-tolerance approach, we've seen them make every possible excuse not to shut down this blatant hate speech on a national scale. The Biden administration has promoted a policy of appeasement with Iran, giving the regime billions for hostages, incentivizing kidnappings, failing to enforce sanctions, allowing the regime an estimated $122 billion in oil revenue since 2021 and freeing up $16 billion In frozen regime assets. And what has that yielded? Executions have skyrocketed in Iran. Iranian oil exports and military expenditures, including terror proxy funding, have more than doubled since the Trump administration. The regime's nuclear program has advanced at unprecedented levels, with 20% and 60% uranium enrichment at record levels. Finally, for over a year, Hamas, a proxy of the regime in Iran, has been holding American and Israeli citizens hostage. At the same time, the Biden administration's policies have enabled the funding of these very same terror proxies, the same way the Islamist revolutionaries held Americans hostage in brutal, dehumanizing conditions. So, too, today, we see the proxies of the regime doing as the Islamic Republic of Iran taught them. It's been 45 years, and history is repeating itself because of bad US policy on Iran. The only difference now is that Iran is on the cusp of a nuclear weapon, and the campus riots are starting on US soil. We can't afford not to act. American democratic values are at risk, and they cannot be defended by policies of appeasement. You don't stand up to a bully by giving him billions of dollars and asking him nicely to stop. You stand up to a bully by punching him in the face. The Islamic Republic of Iran will only stop its campaign of terrorism when they're forced to.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjqib00lwjg	2024-11-04T07:20:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/04/01/S1lNkp9dJA/S1lNkp9dJA_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

German's AfD leader's familial Nazi past, revealed	Alice Weidel's grandfather served as military judge in Nazi occupied Warsaw claimed no knowledge of SS crimes of murder of Jews; An investigative report published in Germany over the weekend revealed the Nazi familial past of Alice Wiedel leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany Party (AfD). Her grandfather Hans Wiedel served as a military judge in Nazi-occupied Warsaw during the Holocaust. The avid Nazi joined the party in 1932 and served in the SS, a family history Weidel failed to divulge during her ascent to the leadership of her party. She and AfD urged Germany to move on from what the party calls a 'cult of shame' over its Nazi-era atrocities. According to the report, Weidel's Nazi grandfather was investigated after the war for his involvement in the execution of 20,000 opponents of the Nazis but the investigations were dropped, because of insufficient documentary evidence. He claimed he did not know about the atrocities committed by the SS or the mass extermination of Jews. After the war Hans Wiedel opened a law office which was mostly preoccupied by his efforts to receive compensation for his lost property in Upper Silesia. Weidel said she was six years old when her grandfather died and did not know him or about his involvement with the Nazi regime. 'Because of a family feud we did not have any contact with my grandfather,' she said. 'He was never a subject of discussion in my family.' Many Germans of Wiedel's generation have relatives who were Nazis but Weidel has become the co-leader of a political party that was trying to erase the past and some of its senior members were the children or grandchildren of Nazis. Bjorn Hocke, even described a Holocaust memorial as a 'monument of shame' calling for a reversal of Germany's approach to remembrance. After succeeding in the elections in three German federal states in the east of the country in September the AfD was no set to establish its position in the federal elections next year. The latest revelations may not lessen support for Wiedel or the Afd.

Iran plots to assassinate Nevatim airbase commander	Brigadier General Yotam Sigler along with his family, is placed under security protection after a spy-cell made up of immigrants from Azerbaijan, operating on behalf of Iranian intelligence is uncovered Iran plotted to assassinate the commander of Nevatim airbase, according to a report in the Iranian opposition outlet, Iran International, on Monday. According to the report, Brigadier General Yotam Sigler has been put under security protection. The outlet cited a security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, who said that such security measures were typically reserved for high-threat individuals, akin to IDF Chief of Staff or Air Force Commander. However, due to recent developments, both Sigler and his family are now under protection. Additional security for Brigadier General Sigler was put in place after uncovering that he was a target within the broader scheme involving Israeli nationals returning from Azerbaijan. These individuals were allegedly operating as part of an Iranian-directed spy cell and were apprehended last month. The source said that those under threat usually undergo comprehensive security evaluations, including assessments of their family's online exposure. Sigler's position makes him a priority target for Iran due to the strategic importance of Nevatim Airbase, which serves not only as a hub for combat operations but also as a crucial intelligence and strategic asset.

Watch: Nazareth crime ring arrested at wedding after high-speed p...	Father and son indicted for opening fire at multiple locations in city before fleeing from police; one suspect apprehended while hiding at wedding; new footage reveals escape route; police seize pistol and grenades Surveillance footage released Monday has provided critical evidence in a series of shooting incidents in Nazareth, leading to the indictment of a father and his son. The two are accused of multiple shooting events and illegal possession of fragmentation grenades. The investigation began after Northern District officers and Border Police responded to reports of gunfire targeting a business and a residential property. Authorities tracked a fleeing scooter, sparking a pursuit that ended when the suspect abandoned the vehicle and sought refuge under a table at a wedding venue. Police arrested the suspect and recovered a discarded Glock pistol along the escape route. A subsequent search of the suspect's home led to the discovery of five fragmentation grenades, and the arrest of the suspect's father and another son. Witnesses near the wedding venue supported the arrests. 'It’s good he was caught immediately,' one said, noting that the police action disrupted the wedding but likely prevented a potential murder. Indictments have now been filed against the father and one son, while the other was released due to lack of evidence. The police statement indicated: 'Around 10:00 PM yesterday, Northern District officers were conducting operations in Arraba as part of efforts to prevent shooting incidents in the Arab community. During the operation, forces observed gunfire aimed at a business. Officers engaged and fired at the armed suspects, who, while fleeing, returned fire at the officers. Additional police units were dispatched, initiating a broad search for the suspects. Shortly after, the suspects' vehicle was located nearby, engulfed in flames.' Northern District Commander Superintendent Meir Eliyahu visited the scene and ordered the formation of a special investigation team. Six suspects were arrested overnight on suspicion of involvement, with further arrests anticipated. Eliyahu praised the officers' response: 'The officers' decisive engagement and bravery are commendable. In incidents where officers are targeted, the criminal assumes full responsibility for the consequences, and we will apprehend him, either during the incident or subsequently.' In a related event, police released footage from a shootout in Arraba, Lower Galilee, where armed suspects fired long guns at officers. No injuries were reported, and police are investigating the incident with aerial support.

Sky wars: Hezbollah's drone tactics push Israeli defense systems ...	Terror group's evolving use of drones challenges Israeli defenses, spurring swift deployment of advanced interception tech; recent incidents, like a drone downed near Binyamina, highlight urgent need for stronger airspace security and military response For 34 minutes last Saturday, fighter jets and helicopters escorted a Hezbollah drone until it was shot down. The drone crossed the border over Shlomi in the Western Galilee and continued flying unchallenged over Nahariya, Acre and Haifa, reaching open land near Binyamina. Once possible, reservist Major A., an Apache helicopter pilot from the 190th Squadron, locked onto it with his sight and fired a barrage of shells. The incident concluded within seconds. Civilians who witnessed the successful interception from the ground immediately uploaded footage to social media. Moments later, the message 'The incident has concluded' reached hundreds of thousands of Israelis who had taken shelter. 'We followed it for a long time,' Major A. recounted to Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. 'We waited for a moment when we could ensure that the helicopter's cannon shells wouldn't hit civilians, houses or cars below us. I saw there were clear fields and brought it down.' Tension in the cockpit and on the radio was high, with every second being critical. Decisions had to be made quickly. In the control room of the Air Force command and the Apache squadron dispatched for the mission, there was a strong desire to prevent the 'enemy aircraft intrusion' alert, which had turned many areas red, from ending in disaster. Last month, in the same area, a drone exploded at a Golani training base near Binyamina without warning, killing four soldiers and injuring dozens. On Sunday, a missile boat intercepted a drone over the sea off the coast of Caesarea. Since the outbreak of the war, Hezbollah has been launching drones toward Israel almost daily. These aircraft can sometimes evade air defense systems more easily, as they are not adequately prepared for the threat. In over a year of war, Israel has been attacked by drones from Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Lebanon. Suicide drones targeting specific locations are harder to intercept for various reasons: their small size, flight path and sometimes low altitude. Additionally, they are often launched from locations near the border, significantly reducing the response time for air defense systems. Israel’s air defense array is designed to detect, track and intercept hostile aircraft before they cross the border. The system issues warnings and follows the aircraft until they can be neutralized. Key to this process is the time the IDF has to intercept the target, which varies depending on whether it's heading toward a military base in the Western Galilee, a defense facility or a high-profile location like the prime minister’s residence in Caesarea. Each target presents a different operational window for a successful interception. According to the Air Force, about 1,300 drones have been launched toward Israel from all fronts since the war began. Of these, 231 hit the ground. This means that approximately 82% were successfully intercepted. The military is trying to target the source of the drone launches, Hezbollah's secretive air Unit 127. Despite the elimination of its commander, Mohammad Sarour, in a strike in Beirut's Dahieh district at the end of September, it has relatively retained its strength—only about ten percent of the terrorists in the unit have been killed so far. According to IDF, Hezbollah retains about 30% of its drone arsenal, with the majority destroyed in strikes on warehouses and launch sites. Returning to the drama over Binyamina's skies, seconds before the cheers of residents who documented the chase and did not heed defense instructions. In the Air Force's control unit sat Major N., the air controller who led the mission to shoot down the drone. 'We scrambled fighter jets and helicopters at it and waited for an interception opportunity,' he described. However, the Air Force admits that in reality, they still fail to intercept a significant portion of the drones. Fortunately, many such offensive aircraft miss their intended targets and fall in open areas or collide with objects, such as the residential tower in Nahariya in September and a suspension bridge in the city last week. Civilian limitations These are usually relatively small aircraft, weighing as little as 7-9 lbs. and flying slowly. In many cases, they appear on radar systems like birds, cars or clouds. Alongside sky observers recently deployed along the borders, parallel systems are activated in an attempt to detect any launch of such an aircraft and shoot it down before it crosses the border. The assessment of whether the response to destroy the threat will come from the Iron Dome, aircraft or attack helicopters is done quickly. 'Every weapon system has proximity limitations to certain sites,' explained Major N. 'We also need to protect civilians from the munitions. 'In the year of fighting, we've undergone a rapid evolution in dealing with drones. We started with detection gaps, not seeing all threats in time. Sometimes we didn't even know how to alert them. We acquired dozens of detection and warning systems, and today we can see more than 90% of the threats. The interception rate stands at about 70% of them.' The new systems can quickly determine whether the incoming object is a bird, for example, and if there's any doubt about the type of alert received. Within moments, fighter jets are sent skyward, and pilots are called to locate and identify who stands before them with their eyes. 'Every month, there's a new means to improve interceptions and defense systems,' said Major N. 'Our situation is much better now. Initially, it took us minutes to launch the first interceptor missile. Today, a missile is already launched at it within a second.' Major (res.) Y. is an F-16 pilot in the veteran 101st Squadron, and his family was evacuated from Kibbutz Yiftach on the Lebanese border. Over the past year, he has participated in dozens of sorties across various fronts. Major Y. says the required response from him and his colleagues against the new threat is immediate. For example, last month, he was scrambled in the middle of the night from sleep, boarded a plane and flew toward the mission defined for him. Within minutes, the airborne threat was destroyed, even before crossing the border. In his view, 'The main challenge is finding an appropriate opportunity to intercept it without causing more significant damage than the device itself can inflict.' In the nick of time Air battles against drones can be seen in the north almost daily, in pursuits that usually end with an interception. Major Y. says that downing the aircraft is often more challenging than any other task. 'We have a lot of power and maneuverability in fighter jets,' he explained, 'but it's tough to detect and shoot down these small devices. It's like looking for an ant on the road while you're on a fast motorcycle. A fighter jet is designed to engage large aerial targets and attack ground targets. But we still manage to provide a satisfactory response to these aircraft as well.' Major Y. does not reveal where the drone he intercepted in the air chase about last month originated. 'Its route was relatively clear—on its way to one of the big cities,' he noted. 'You know that if you don't shoot it down, there's a chance it will cause damage. It's more stressful than attacking in Lebanon, which you do from an altitude of 30,000 feet. Minutes earlier, I woke up from the siren and the scramble for action. While shaking off the throes of sleep, you must organize for interception, identify the device and reach a certain altitude. At the last second, you press the button and launch a missile at it.' The 101st Squadron boasts the highest number of enemy aircraft downed in Israel's wars—161 enemy planes. The Air Force has not engaged in air-to-air combat in recent decades, and no additional decorations have been added to the squadron's illustrious wall of downings. It is conceivable that the pilots may now lay the foundation for a new wall marking drone downings. 'True, it's not a fighter jet but another attacking aircraft, but in practice, we are here to defend the nation's skies. It doesn't matter what the threat is or its size—the main thing is to shoot it down,' said Major Y. Assessment: Prime Minister's residence could be targeted again Meanwhile, about two weeks after a drone hit the residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea, another attempt to hit the location was apparently made on Sunday. From the investigation of the drone attack, it appears that at 5:30 PM, two drones were launched simultaneously. One exploded in an open area near Elyakim, causing no damage or injuries, while the second target was intercepted by the Navy before it crossed into Israeli territory. The combined drone formation was likely on its way to the prime minister's residence in Caesarea, and the unit responsible for personnel security was updated on the event and instructed to take defensive measures. IDF identified the drone launches and their flight path. Northern Command updated the security coordinators in the frontline communities, indicating that the increased fire from Lebanon, both rockets and drones, is expected to continue—across and deep into the entire sector.

Netanyahu urges justice minister to find 'solution to 'adversaria...	Ministers accuse Gali Baharav-Miara of obstructing government decisions; Ben-Gvir says she opposes 'every good thing'; Communications Minister Karhi calls for her dismissal Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday called on Justice Minister Yariv Levin to devise a 'solution' regarding Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, whom he described as 'adversarial' to the government. The request followed a call by Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi during a Cabinet meeting to dismiss the attorney general. The discussion arose while ministers were debating the appointment of a new Civil Service commissioner. Several ministers criticized the attorney general’s legal opinions, accusing her of obstructing government decisions. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir claimed Baharav-Miara opposed 'every good thing,' citing her stance on prison overcrowding. Minister David Amsalem added that 'everything is halted by her.' Karhi suggested firing Baharav-Miara, with Amsalem further blaming her and Deputy Attorney General Gil Limon. 'This is adversarial legal advice,' Netanyahu then remarked. 'We saw what was approved under the previous government—illegal gas agreements, appointments during a transitional government. We can't work like this. I’m asking Yariv to propose a solution.' Netanyahu's comments referenced two key issues from the previous administration. The first was the maritime border agreement with Lebanon in 2022, under then-Prime Minister Yair Lapid. The agreement, which defined gas field rights in the Mediterranean, was criticized by Netanyahu as illegal because it was signed close to elections without full parliamentary approval, though it was sanctioned by the attorney general. The second issue was the appointment of IDF Chief Herzi Halevi by then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz during a transitional government. Netanyahu argued that such appointments should not be made during an election period, though the legal system permitted it under specific conditions. Constantly at loggerheads Netanyahu's government and the attorney general have been clashing for months over various issues. On Monday, Baharav-Miara sent a letter to Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs, accusing him of acting 'without authority' regarding legislation to subsidize daycare for ultra-Orthodox families, which she argued effectively circumvents the military draft law for the ultra-Orthodox. Baharav-Miara had previously said that the law would encourage draft evasion and was unconstitutional. The attorney general’s letter, drafted by her deputy Dr. Gil Limon, noted, 'We have been informed that you approached the accountant general, requesting he instruct the Labor Ministry to act contrary to the attorney general’s guidelines and the government’s position in ongoing court cases related to daycare subsidies.' Fuchs responded by accusing Baharav-Miara of creating a 'constitutional crisis and anarchy' with her opposition to the government's agenda. The government meeting also addressed the appointment of the new Civil Service commissioner, a position traditionally filled through a competitive selection process. Baharav-Miara had requested clarification from the government on why no competitive process was being considered, instead of allowing Prime Minister Netanyahu to present a sole candidate to the committee for approval. This comes as the government informed the Supreme Court of its intention to amend the appointment process. Baharav-Miara has also opposed other coalition-backed bills, including one that seeks to expand police use of spyware but excludes bribery offenses, and another that would change television ratings measurement methods, which she criticized for potentially infringing on privacy rights. The latter bill, introduced by Likud MK Shlomo Danino, has been linked to Communications Minister Karhi, who earlier called for Baharav-Miara’s dismissal.

Katz declares Israel's exit from UNRWA pact	After Knesset voted to end UNRWA's activities in Israel, FM Katz voids 1967 agreement, raising potential ICJ disputes; Israel cites UNRWA’s alleged terror ties and plans to redirect aid to non-terror-linked organizations Following the Knesset's recent enactment of legislation to terminate UNRWA's operations within Israeli territory, Foreign Minister Israel Katz has initiated the annulment of the 1967 agreement between Israel and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. The decision comes amid accusations that some UNRWA personnel were complicit in the October 7 attacks. The agreement had previously served as the legal framework governing relations between the two entities. 'Further to legislation passed by the Knesset of Israel on 28 October 2024, I write this letter to notify the United Nations that the State of Israel withdraws its request issued to UNRWA... The legislation will enter into effect following a three-month period. During this time, and thereafter, Israel will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel's security,' the letter read. This strategic move by Israel is anticipated to catalyze a legal confrontation with the Palestinians at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. Additionally, it is likely to provoke diplomatic maneuvers against Israel within the UN General Assembly, potentially including requests for advisory opinions. Minister Katz has tasked Foreign Ministry Director-General Yaakov Blitshtein with formally notifying the UN about Israel's termination of the agreement with UNRWA, in compliance with Section 1(b) of the newly enacted law. 'UNRWA, whose employees were involved in the October 7 massacre and many of whom are Hamas operatives, is part of the problem in Gaza, not the solution,' Katz said. 'Numerous pieces of evidence regarding Hamas operatives employed by UNRWA and the misuse of its facilities for terrorist activities were presented to the UN, yet no action was taken. Furthermore, UNRWA has ignored the UN's own recommendations from the Colonna report. 'Do not be misled by those claiming there is no alternative to UNRWA. Currently, the majority of humanitarian aid is distributed through other organizations, with only 13% channeled through UNRWA. Israel remains committed to international law and will continue to facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza in a manner that safeguards Israeli citizens' security.' Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon remarked on the communication sent to the President of the General Assembly, stating, 'Following the legislation concerning UNRWA, we have formally notified the President about ceasing cooperation with the agency. Despite the substantial evidence we provided to the UN demonstrating Hamas's influence over UNRWA, no measures were taken to acknowledge or alter the situation. As I have repeatedly emphasized, UNRWA is under Hamas's control in Gaza. Israel will continue its cooperation with humanitarian organizations but not with those that serve terrorism against Israel.' Under the legislative proposal by Knesset members Yulia Malinovsky, Dan Illouz and Ron Katz, which passed its second and third readings, UNRWA will no longer operate any offices, provide services or conduct activities, directly or indirectly, within Israel's sovereign territory. This effectively ends UNRWA's operations in East Jerusalem, transferring its responsibilities to Israeli control. The proposal was supported by 92 Knesset members, with 10 opposing. The legislation's backdrop reveals that the UN agency, tasked with providing services to Palestinian refugees, has employees suspected of involvement in the surprise attack on Israel and affiliations with terrorist organizations Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Following the law's passage, several global governments swiftly condemned the step, including UN Secretary-General António Guterres and UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini. Guterres even communicated to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, warning of 'devastating' consequences. The Palestinians reacted with shock, and the United States indicated that the legislation might invoke repercussions consistent with American law and Washington's policy. The British government is contemplating revoking additional arms export licenses to Israel if the UNRWA legislation is implemented. Reports from Britain suggested that Foreign Minister Katz assured his British counterpart, David Lammy, that 'the contentious measure will not be enforced immediately.' UNRWA is deeply entrenched with Hamas, with its employees involved in the October 7 massacre, and many more are Hamas and PIJ operatives, with new instances of UNRWA employees' involvement in terrorism emerging frequently. In July, Israel presented the UN with extensive documentation, including a list of 100 Hamas military operatives employed by UNRWA, yet the relief agency took no action. Recently, reports surfaced about UNRWA employee Muhammad Al-Atawi, included on this list, who participated in the massacre at Kibbutz Re'im on October 7, 2023. Despite the information being provided, no action was taken against him by UNRWA. Al-Atawi was killed in an IDF operation and UN chief Guterres expressed regret over his death. Moreover, numerous terrorist acts during the war were executed from UNRWA facilities, yet the agency did not notify Israel about Hamas' improper use of its facilities during the war, contravening its commitments to maintain neutrality. UNRWA has also failed to implement the minimal measures required by the UN's own Colonna report: employees affiliated with Hamas and PIJ have not been dismissed, nothing has been done to address the neutrality violations of UNRWA facilities and the agency has not amended the educational materials in its schools despite commitments to donor countries and Israel to immediately remove such content. The Foreign Ministry echoed Katz's statement. 'UNRWA is part of the problem in Gaza—not part of the solution. Claims that there is no alternative to UNRWA are unfounded. The vast majority of humanitarian aid to Gaza is already delivered through other organizations, with only 13% through UNRWA. Israel is committed to international law and will continue cooperating with UN and international organizations free from terrorism to ensure humanitarian aid reaches Gaza without compromising Israeli citizens' security. 'In accordance with the law, the legislation regarding UNRWA will take effect in approximately three months. During this period, the already extensive cooperation with other international organizations free from terrorism will be expanded, preparations will be made to sever ties with UNRWA, and alternatives will be established, all in compliance with international law.'

David's Sling and Namer APC awarded Israel Defense Prize: 'Ground...	Israel Defense Prize honors teams from Defense Ministry, IDF, Mossad, Shin Bet and defense industries for transformative projects enhancing military capabilities and strategic operations with cutting-edge technology and intelligence The prestigious Israel Defense Prize was conferred on Sunday evening upon teams from the Defense Ministry, IDF, Mossad, Shin Bet and defense industries for their groundbreaking technological projects that have significantly bolstered the IDF's wartime capabilities. Among the celebrated projects are the David's Sling missile defense system, the innovative Target Factory target acquisition system and the Namer armored personnel carrier (APC). Additionally, a lifetime achievement award was presented to a Mossad operative identified as Y., recognizing three decades of pioneering contributions. The ceremony, held at the President's Residence in Jerusalem, was attended by notable figures including Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Mossad head David Barnea. The awarded projects are as follows, according to the Defense Ministry and the President's Residence: David's Sling Air Defense System: This accolade was awarded to the Homa Directorate at MAFAT (the Defense Ministry's Directorate of Defense Research & Development), the Air Force, Rafael, Elbit Systems, and the Israel Aerospace Industries' ELTA Division, for their development, production and operational deployment of the David's Sling system. This sophisticated defense mechanism provides comprehensive national protection against medium-range missiles, rockets and cruise missiles. It serves as an interception layer against steep-trajectory projectiles and precision surface-to-surface missiles. For over a decade, its development has been spearheaded by the Homa Directorate at MAFAT, in collaboration with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA). During the Gaza war, the system, operated by the Air Force's air defense units, successfully intercepted numerous rockets, safeguarding countless lives. Target Factory: The award went to the Air Force, the Intelligence Directorate and the C4I Branch of the IDF for their role in mechanizing the IDF's Target Factory. This project developed shared information capabilities across IDF branches and advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence for target planning and preparation. Throughout the Gaza war, Target Factory markedly enhanced the effectiveness of the Air Force's close air support for maneuvering ground forces. Namer armored personnel carrier (APC): This award was granted to the Merkava and Armored Vehicles Directorate (Mantak) at the Defense Ministry, the Ordnance Department, the Ground Forces, the Golani and Givati Brigades and the Merkava Manufacturers Forum within the Manufacturers Association. The Namer APC, an Israeli innovation, was tailored to the IDF's unique operational requirements, revolutionizing maneuver tactics during the Gaza war. The Defense Ministry's development of the Namer facilitated pivotal operational achievements, protected IDF soldiers and commanders, and had a direct impact on combat outcomes. It integrates cutting-edge technology and results from long-standing collaborative efforts in development, production, and integration by the Defense Ministry, IDF and defense industries. Additionally, an award was bestowed upon Mossad, Rafael and the Air Force for an extraordinary strategic project that integrates cutting-edge technology, high-quality intelligence, strategic cunning and bold operational maneuvers that reshape the operational landscape. The project was noted for its unique and significant contribution to Israel's security and the defeat of its adversaries. An award was also given to the Research and Development Unit at MAFAT, the Intelligence Directorate, Israeli Air Force, Shin Bet and Elbit Systems for developing a groundbreaking technological capability that established a new intelligence discipline. The operational deployment of this system directly contributed to the IDF's success in addressing battlefield challenges and achieving intelligence superiority. The Israel Defense Prize Committee also decided to honor Mossad operative Y. with a lifetime achievement award for his three decades of service. 'Throughout his tenure, Y. has been instrumental in developing unique and innovative breakthrough technological systems, exemplifying unwavering excellence and professionalism. His efforts have significantly bolstered Israel's technological prowess and security,' the statement read. Mossad chief Barnea commended the agency's employees and commanders: 'This year, more than ever, you have demonstrated the strength and influence of Mossad in Israel's ongoing battle to overcome its enemies. Your achievement this year reflects the spirit, values, initiative and creativity of Mossad, showcasing the ability to accomplish the seemingly impossible time and again. I am proud of you.'

Suspected leaker recruited as reservist, then shifted to Netanyah...	Investigators focus on how highly classified documents leaked from secure repositories, tracking individuals who disregarded protocols; Defense Ministry confirms PM's spokesman recruited to National Emergency Center but failed to report The investigation into a sensitive document leak from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, leading to the arrest of several suspects, including his spokesperson Eli Feldstein, originated with the Israeli military. The probe focuses on a breach involving 'live secret channels'—classified intelligence from Unit 8200, the army's SIGINT unit, whose methods for securing the information appear compromised. The IDF approached the Shin Bet to trace the source of the leak, initially unaware that it would lead to Feldstein, who served as Netanyahu's security affairs spokesperson over the past year. The leak stemmed from a restricted zone where a small group of individuals allegedly provided sensitive information to an unauthorized party. This data eventually reached Feldstein, who, according to the investigation, passed it on to the German newspaper Bild. Central to the investigation are not the specific documents, known as the 'Sinwar Papers' which purportedly lay out Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's hostage negotiation strategy, but rather the channel through which the information was leaked. A source involved in the case emphasized that this inquiry is different from typical leak probes, as it focuses on understanding the breach in handling top-secret information. Several IDF reservists are also under suspicion for their role in the matter. The leaked intelligence, reportedly gathered through advanced systems, did not just circulate within Israel—it was seen by Hamas. This breach allowed the terror group to infer what Israeli intelligence knew, jeopardizing ongoing military objectives. The source added that revealing this intelligence compromises Israel’s strategic capabilities, potentially endangering its operational advantage in the war with Hamas. The Shin Bet's primary goal remains shutting down the leak during wartime. Despite claims of selective prosecution, insiders deny such allegations, noting that the Shin Bet has arrested one of its own employees for involvement. Former Shin Bet official Dvir Kariv defended the investigation, rejecting accusations of misconduct and explaining that when leaks occur, the security services must take action, regardless of the source. Though the investigation continues, initial findings suggest that espionage or financial gain are not the motives behind the leak. The suspects reportedly believed their actions were in Israel’s best interest, though knowingly transferring classified information remains a serious offense. In the early days following the October 7 massacre, Netanyahu’s office reportedly sought to appoint a new spokesperson for military and security matters, a role that had not previously existed. Traditionally, the Defense Ministry maintained contact with military correspondents. Although Netanyahu’s spokespersons had communicated with the press over the years, a specific and fully defined position had never been created until Eli Feldstein's appointment. During the second week of the war, the director-general of the Prime Minister’s Office requested Feldstein's assignment to the National Emergency Command Center, under the Defense Ministry. Feldstein was brought on in a reservist capacity through the National Emergency Authority (known by its Hebrew acronym RAHEL). However, for three days in mid-October, Feldstein worked at Netanyahu's office rather than reporting to the command center, as intended. Upon realizing that Feldstein was not fulfilling the duties for which he was recruited, the Defense Ministry immediately requested that the IDF’s Manpower Directorate (AKA) terminate his reservist service. A statement from the Defense Ministry confirmed: 'At the request of the Prime Minister’s Office, Eli Feldstein was recruited on October 15 to reinforce the emergency command center, but after three days, it became clear he was not stationed at his designated role and was promptly released by the National Emergency Authority.'

FBI arrests 'Hamas operative' and Jewish woman for plot to attack...	US-Lebanese citizen Mohamad Hamad allegedly acquired bomb-making materials to target Jewish sites in Pittsburgh; Talya Lubit, charged as his accomplice, accused of vandalizing synagogue and Jewish center with pro-Hamas graffiti Two Pittsburgh residents were arrested by the FBI and local police in connection with hate crimes and the vandalism of Jewish buildings in July. One of the suspects, Mohamad Hamad, 23, who identified himself as a 'Hamas operative,' reportedly purchased explosives. Hamad, a U.S. and Lebanese citizen, was a member of the Pennsylvania National Guard stationed near Pittsburgh International Airport, according to a report in the New York Post. The second suspect, Talya Lubit, a Jewish woman, allegedly assisted Hamad in defacing Jewish buildings with pro-Hamas graffiti. Hamad is accused of vandalizing a Chabad synagogue and a Jewish community center in Pittsburgh, where messages such as 'Jews for Palestine' and a red inverted triangle, associated with Hamas supporters, were spray-painted on the walls. Lubit, who referred to Jews as 'enemies,' reportedly supported a local county resolution condemning Israel and defended a Pittsburgh legislator who blamed Israel for Hamas' October 7 attack. The FBI launched a criminal investigation on July 29 following reports of vandalism at the Chabad house and another Jewish community center. During the probe, search warrants were executed at the suspects' homes in August and September, uncovering text messages between Hamad and Lubit discussing their plans to target Jewish institutions. Evidence found on Hamad's phone revealed that in the weeks leading up to the vandalism, he described himself as a 'Hamas operative' and shared a photo of himself wearing a Hamas-branded headband. He also discussed bomb-making and shared a video of a test explosion. Investigators found that he had purchased two pounds of Indian Black aluminum powder and two pounds of potassium perchlorate used to form explosives. Hamad reportedly planned an initial test explosion on July 6 as part of a larger plot to target Pittsburgh's Jewish community. Hamad also communicated with Lubit about the graffiti incident several days before the July 29 vandalism. Messages revealed that Lubit had grown increasingly hostile toward Jews, saying, 'I can literally feel myself starting to see Jews as my enemies.' She also shared an image of an Israeli flag with a swastika in the middle, using the codename 'Warsaw.' Both Hamad and Lubit have been linked to anti-Israel politics within the Democratic Party. Hamad donated to Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, while Lubit was part of a Jewish group defending a Pittsburgh lawmaker who called for a cease-fire following Hamas’ October 7 attack. Both suspects face hefty prison sentences.

Israeli universities return to studies under shadow of war	TAU: 1,600 students in IDF reserves Israel kicked off its academic year at universities across the country on Sunday. For the second consecutive year, thousands of students are beginning their studies under the shadow of war. Last year, one in five students served in the reserves, totaling around 70,000. This year, the numbers are expected to be similar. At Tel Aviv University, approximately 1,600 of the 30,000 students are serving in the reserves. Staff at the university told ILTV News that they are doing everything possible to support these students—emotionally, financially, and, of course, academically. ILTV’s Ariella Lahayani was at the university on Sunday to speak to students.

Israel must strike back: One building for every Hezbollah drone, ...	ILTV News interview with Prof. Mordechai Kedar Israel should demolish one building in Lebanon for every drone Hezbollah launches at Israel, according to Bar-Ilan University’s Prof. Mordechai Kedar. In an interview with ILTV News, Kedar stated that 'this should be the price the community will pay if they continue to launch drones against Israel.' He added, 'if Israel did this, after two or three days, when they see Israel is serious, they will stop it.' Kedar emphasized that the goal is not to harm civilians. Israel could still warn civilians in advance of its strikes, focusing on deterrence. Hezbollah, unlike Israel, aims to kill Israeli people. And what about Iran—will it strike Israel again soon? Kedar said he is not concerned. 'Iran is more or less exposed today,' Kedar told ILTV, 'because Israel destroyed large parts, if not most, of its air defense system. It is much easier to target more places in Iran.' He added that he believes Iran’s nuclear military facilities are exposed—anything not deeply underground—and that if Israel wanted to, it could take actions against those facilities.

Iran plans complex attack on Israel after military losses, report...	Iranian diplomats warn Middle Eastern nations Tehran's response to Israeli strike, which killed 4 soldiers, may involve military and 'additional weapons'; attack expected after US election but before inauguration Iran has conveyed diplomatic messages indicating plans for a complex attack on Israel, using more powerful warheads than previously deployed, alongside other advanced weaponry, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing Iranian and Arab officials familiar with the plans. Tehran reportedly intends to involve its regular military forces, not just the Revolutionary Guards, following the deaths of four Iranian soldiers in an Israeli strike. An Egyptian source told The Wall Street Journal that Iran personally warned Cairo of a 'strong and complex' retaliation. 'Our military lost personnel; they need to respond,' an Iranian official said, adding that Iraq could be used as part of the operation. The attack is expected to target Israeli military sites but 'in a more aggressive manner' than before, the official noted. The report claims Iran's response will likely go beyond missiles and drones, potentially involving more powerful warheads. In previous attacks on Israel, Iran used four types of medium-range missiles, including Emad, Raad, Kheibar Shekan and Fateh, according to the report. The Iranian official, amid Israeli intelligence reports suggesting an imminent attack, stated that Tehran does not want to influence the U.S. elections with its retaliation. As a result, the response is expected after Election Day but before the next U.S. president's inauguration. Diplomatic sources from Bahrain and Oman were also briefed by Iranian diplomats on the planned response. Western officials cited by The Wall Street Journal believe Iran’s leadership is debating the scope and nature of the attack—whether it should be directly from Iran or via its proxies to maintain plausible deniability. Israel, meanwhile, is preparing for a serious response, with military officials warning that any Iranian strike will be met with even greater force. Three days ago, The New York Times reported that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the country’s Supreme National Security Council to prepare for an attack on Israel. The decision followed a detailed briefing from top military commanders on the damage caused by the Israeli strike to Iran's missile production capabilities, air defense systems around Tehran, energy infrastructure, and a key southern port. According to the report, Khamenei stated that the scale of the Israeli attack and the death of at least four regular army soldiers were too significant to ignore, adding that failing to respond would be perceived as admitting defeat.

Night-time operation under Hezbollah's nose: How Israel captured ...	A meticulously planned IDF operation led to the capture of Iranian operative Ali Soleiman al-Assi near Quneitra; Soldiers executed a covert nighttime raid, employing diversion tactics and aerial support, effectively dismantling espionage efforts and preventing future attacks on Israeli targets The Israeli defense establishment disclosed on Sunday evening the capture of Ali Soleiman al-Assi, an Iranian operative, in Syrian territory near Quneitra, first to Saudi Arabia and shortly thereafter to Israel. This disclosure aims to exert pressure on the Iranian Revolutionary Guards amid the threat of a potential Iranian offensive against Israel. According to IDF reports, al-Assi revealed during his interrogation by Unit 504 of the Intelligence Corps the operational methodologies employed by Iranian entities on the Golan Heights front. The IDF prominently featured interrogation footage with his face clearly visible, affirming that he remains in Israeli custody. Al-Assi, a Syrian national, allegedly gathered intelligence in the Golan region prior to his apprehension, which effectively thwarted a prospective attack against Israeli interests in the area. This revelation coincides with another recent IDF operation in northern Lebanon, where Shayetet 13 commandos swiftly captured a Hezbollah operative, identified as a maritime knowledge hub for the terrorist organization. Details of al-Assi's capture, obtained by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, reveal that an Egoz Unit team conducted a covert nighttime raid on his residence near Quneitra several months ago. During the operation, his family was present in the building. The Egoz Unit, known for executing numerous covert operations beyond Israel's northern border in Syria and Lebanon in recent years, both before and after the war, prepared meticulously to prevent any noise or disturbance from family members that might betray their presence in the village. Apprehending the operative lasted mere minutes from the moment the perimeter was secured. Sources indicate that armed Hezbollah operatives and Syrian army personnel were in proximity but remained unaware of the unfolding operation, aided by simultaneous diversion and deception tactics. Egoz operatives stealthily crossed the border and extracted their target from his bed under the cover of night. He was unable to resist or use his personal weapon, which was confiscated. A Unit 504 investigator, tasked with verifying al-Assi's identity at the scene, joined the elite commando brigade's force. The suspect was spirited back to Israel with the operatives, employing both vehicular and on-foot maneuvers, without encountering danger. The force was discovered only nearing the border, a scenario anticipated and accounted for in the operational plan. Despite several delays, the operatives were prepared, executing their mission comprehensively. 'The operative was quite surprised when we arrived and roused him,' according to the IDF. 'This team has faced at least 10 close-quarters encounters with Hamas terrorists in Gaza, accruing significant confidence and experience, although this operation entailed a quiet and covert infiltration.' Al-Assi was informed of his captors' identity only after crossing into Israeli territory. The Egoz force had meticulously monitored him, analyzing his behavior in the weeks preceding the operation, gathering important preliminary intelligence. The mission was supported by remotely operated aircraft from the Israeli Air Force for surveillance and potential strikes, alongside special drones and a reserve force poised to extract the operatives should complications arise. Despite its proximity to the Israeli side, Hezbollah has attempted in recent years to establish terrorist infrastructures in the operation area, repeatedly thwarted by Division 210 forces responsible for the Golan sector, including preemptive strikes throughout the past year. On Sunday evening, IDF spokesperson announced the operation was conducted in recent months during a cross-border night incursion into Syria by Egoz Unit operatives with Unit 504 field investigators, under Division 210's command and intelligence guidance. The IDF confirmed that the detainee, Ali Soleiman al-Assi, a Syrian national residing in the Saida area of southern Syria, operated under Iranian direction, engaged in intelligence gathering on IDF troops in the border region for future terrorist activities. Al-Assi was under stringent surveillance by Israeli forces and is currently under interrogation by Unit 504 and security forces in Israel. During his interrogation, al-Assi recounted a meeting with one of his recruiters: 'We sat on the fence, he glanced around and told me - your area is good, strategic. We can leverage it.' He claimed to understand the individual was linked to Iran and received an offer to collaborate with them: 'He told me, you need to work with us. Just to observe the borders. He claimed to be from military intelligence, but in fact, Iran is behind them, as I understood he belongs to Iran. Even Iran does not operate openly; there's a military intelligence cover.' According to him, the recruiter expressed interest in the border area with Israel and troop movements: 'Once we informed him there was a tank yesterday at such a time, a patrol passed at such a time.' The IDF spokesperson said in a statement that: 'The operation by IDF troops to detain al-Assi prevented a future attack and led to the exposure of the operational methods of Iranian terror networks located near the Golan Heights. Al-Assi was transferred for further investigation to Unit 504 and other security forces. The IDF will continue to operate to defend the sovereignty of the State of Israel and will not allow Iranian proxies in southern Syria to operate and threaten Israeli civilians.'

IDF: Terrorist bomb exploded near humanitarian convoy in Gaza, 6 ...	On Sunday, in coordination with COGAT, a humanitarian convoy enabled the evacuation of patients and staff from the Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals to other hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip, according to the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. The convoy also provided humanitarian aid to these hospitals, including food, water, fuel and medical equipment. As the convoy passed by the Kamal Adwan Hospital, a report was received from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the detonation of an explosive device, only a few hundred meters from the hospital. As a result of the explosion, the convoy was hit by shrapnel. No injuries were reported among the convoy’s personnel. Following the incident, the COGAT Gaza Coordination and Liason Administration (CLA) reached out to the heads of the WHO and clarified this was an explosive device planted by the terrorist organizations in Gaza. Additionally, following an assessment by COGAT with hospital officials, six children in the hospital were injured by the explosion. Damage was also caused to the roof and courtyard of the hospital.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkff000h11ye	2024-11-03T14:05:35-08:00	
Eli Feldstein identified as key suspect in Netanyahu office leak	Eli Feldstein, once employed in Netanyahu's office, is at the center of a significant document leak investigation potentially impacting national security and hostage negotiations; A court, balancing transparency and security, partially lifted the gag order amid ongoing legal scrutiny Eli Feldstein, once employed in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, is the principal suspect in the confidential document leak case, who was arrested and brought before the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court. On Sunday evening, a judge partially lifted the gag order on the case, permitting the disclosure of Feldstein’s identity and related specifics, including his employment and status. Earlier, his detention was extended by two days. Since the revelation of Feldstein's identity Sunday evening, the Prime Minister's Office has remained silent on the issue and has not released a response. The order was mitigated following a petition filed by Attorney Tal Leiblich on behalf of Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. The presiding judge also permitted the publication of the following: 'The investigation was initiated after significant suspicions arose within Shin Bet and IDF, also in light of media reports that classified and sensitive intelligence information was taken from IDF systems and unlawfully disseminated, raising concerns about serious harm to national security and jeopardizing information sources. Consequently, there was a potential risk of damage to the security services' capacity to achieve the objective of releasing the hostages as part of war aims.' The implication is that the return of the hostages might be compromised due to the leaks' impact on sources. Additionally, it was permitted for publication: 'Following this, a joint covert investigation was launched by the Shin Bet, IDF and Israel Police, during which the aforementioned suspicions were significantly corroborated. Subsequently, an overt investigation was opened, during which four suspects involved in the activity were interrogated, some from the security establishment and a civilian named Mr. Eliezer Feldstein. The investigation is ongoing, and is being conducted in accordance with legal procedures and under court supervision. Any further publication regarding the investigation could jeopardize the investigation, its objectives and state security.' Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court Judge Menahem Mizrahi said in his decision that 'I have reviewed the investigation materials and its conduct and am satisfied that it constitutes a focused and highly professional investigation that must be allowed to proceed to completion. If I were to order the complete revocation of the order, there is a real risk of substantial harm to the investigation and the quest for truth. The court will reconsider the situation repeatedly as the process continues.' Furthermore, Mizrachi indicated that 'reviewing the classified material presented to me and other evidence suggests a reasonable suspicion and even substantial prima facie evidence supporting the allegations against the suspects.' Tzvia, Feldstein's sister, wrote Sunday evening that her brother is 'in Shin Bet solitary confinement already for a week without meeting a lawyer,' and claimed he is 'a victim of an embarrassing and disgraceful political spin.' She asserted that 'he will soon emerge, stronger and braver. Understanding that he is on the good side of the map.' She added: 'My brother Eli is a talented, sharp and witty guy. A sensitive soul. A pure heart that spreads only good around him. Always willing to help, full of generosity and love. For years, he sacrificed for the country in military service, yes, yes, a guy from an ultra-Orthodox home. An officer of the highest caliber. He reached the highest places through hard work. He is also a sought-after and pursued bachelor.' Feldstein's associates previously remarked that it is 'painful to see how they threw him to the wolves after he was as loyal as a soldier to Netanyahu.' An associate said that he was 'prepared to do anything for Netanyahu. There is a reason he was brought into the most important office in the country. They understood that if necessary, he would move heaven and earth for a kind word from Bibi. The fact that they discarded him the moment the affair was exposed and disowned him will backfire on them. There isn’t a person in politics who doesn’t know he has worked for Netanyahu since October 7.' Moreover, his relatives contended that 'they brought him in precisely for these tasks, related to the army. So suddenly to say that Bibi doesn't know who he is? He sat in your office, you called him on the phone. It's absurd.' Earlier, a session was held in the court regarding the request by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth and other media outlets to lift the gag order on the secret documents affair involving the spokesperson in Netanyahu's office. The session then transitioned to behind closed doors, preceding the judge's decision on the matter. Feldstein, who worked with the Prime Minister's Office, is detained as part of the document leak case that is shaking the premier's office. He is suspected of passing classified documents to the German newspaper 'Bild' and to Israeli reporters. The ongoing investigation is tasked with examining whether the material leaked by the suspects poses a real security threat or even a risk of exposing security sources and methods. Another aspect under scrutiny is who authorized the classified document leak, whether the suspects acted independently or received directives from higher authorities. The Prime Minister's Office issued a new response Saturday night, asserting that 'the document that was published never reached the Prime Minister's Office from the Military Intelligence Directorate, and the Prime Minister learned about it from the media. The person in question never participated in security discussions, was not exposed to or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits. Overall, it is ridiculous to say that publishing a favorable article about Israel in a German newspaper - in which a document like those previously published with approval and authority - caused any damage to the hostage release negotiations or to Israel's security. On the contrary, it assisted the effort and certainly did not harm it.' The Prime Minister's Office claimed selective enforcement, stating: 'Since the beginning of the war until today, we have witnessed a flood of deliberate and criminal leaks from secret cabinet meetings, closed security discussions, confidential discussions related to the release of hostages; the leak of the doctored video against our soldiers in the Yemen field, and the leak by Knesset member Gilad Kariv from the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. It is very puzzling why, out of all these leaks, this particular document - whose content was known to all and assisted the State of Israel - received such an aggressive and targeted investigation.' Before the discussion on lifting the gag order, a session was held regarding the extension of the suspects' detention in the case. According to one suspect's lawyer, his client was released, while the court extended Feldstein's detention by two days. Despite Netanyahu's declarations that he would join the petition to request the removal of the gag order, he did not submit any such request. Concurrently with the case discussion, Netanyahu's spokespersons - Yonatan Urich and Ofer Golan - were seen leaving the office of attorney Amit Hadad, who represents the prime minister in his ongoing corruption trial. The suspects themselves did not attend the session but participated via live video from detention. The request was submitted by media outlets, the hostages' families' headquarters, and a personal request by Einav Zangauker, the mother of the hostage Matan and one of the leaders of the families' protest. Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth were represented by attorneys Tal Leiblich and Natai Zuriel from the firm Leiblich-Muser-Glick.

Trump says wouldn't mind if someone shot through media to get him	Republican Donald Trump complained to supporters on Sunday about gaps in the bullet-proof glass surrounding him as he spoke and mused that an assassin would have to shoot through the news media to get him, adding, 'I don't mind that so much.' In a meandering 90-minute rally speech two days before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, Trump noted that there were gaps in the panes of glass around him. Some of the members of the press following Trump at the event in Lititz, Pennsylvania, had a sight line through one of the gaps. The former president has escaped two attempted assassinations this year.Surveying the gaps, Trump said: 'To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news and I don't mind that so much.'

Drone explodes near Metula 20 minutes before Netanyahu visit to a...	Prime minister's visit focused on meeting senior military officials in area, with no interactions with evacuees or local residents; 'With or without an agreement, the key to bringing residents back safely is pushing Hezbollah away' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to visit the northern Israeli town of Metula on Sunday but canceled after a drone exploded at a nearby outpost just 20 minutes prior to his arrival. His convoy was already en route when the destination was changed at the last minute. As with previous visits to Israel’s northern border, Netanyahu’s visit was limited to military officials and did not include meetings with displaced residents or local civilians. Netanyahu emphasized the government's commitment to security in northern Israel. 'We are striking across Lebanon. With or without an agreement, the key to restoring calm and security is first to push Hezbollah beyond the Litani River, second to prevent any renewed armament, and third to respond decisively to any action against us. In simple terms: enforcement, enforcement, enforcement – and cutting off Hezbollah’s supply line from Iran through Syria. We are fully committed to these goals.' Netanyahu further noted: 'From the northern border, one can see and hear the transformation on the ground – our aircraft above and our brave fighters below, across the border, dismantling Hezbollah’s entire underground terror network that was prepared for an invasion into the Galilee and a massacre even worse than what happened in Gaza. This will not happen.' He also praised the dedication of the reservists. 'Our heroic reservists play a crucial role in our achievements. They put their lives on hold, leave their families, lose work and sometimes, tragically, lose friends. I just met with them, and their readiness and fighting spirit are deeply inspiring. One brigade commander told me: ‘We have the privilege to defend our country. We are making history.’ This spirit of sacrifice and courage deserves our utmost support,' he said. Netanyahu’s office dismissed reports that he had personally requested to cancel the visit, calling them 'false.' A statement clarified: 'Contrary to misleading media reports, the prime minister did not ask to cancel his visit to Metula. Quite the opposite, Netanyahu repeatedly seeks to visit frontline areas, but security officials set limitations. In this instance, security authorities advised modifying the visit route.' Earlier in the day, another drone exploded in Elyakim, near Yokneam and a separate drone was intercepted off the coast of Caesarea following numerous air alerts in northern Israel over a 40-minute period. The IDF spokesperson confirmed that a Navy missile boat intercepted the drone before it entered Israeli airspace, while firefighting teams worked to extinguish a blaze sparked by the explosion in Elyakim.

Rubble, smoke and bewildered people: A drive through 'broken' Leb...	The end of Iran's era': The Atlantic highlights Lebanon's dire situation, depicting a nation fractured by economic crisis and conflict, where Hezbollah's influence wanes, communities are displaced, and people argue among themselves about what kind of a nation Lebanon will be after the war At the end of September, just days after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was eliminated in an airstrike on the organization's stronghold in southern Beirut, a reporter from 'The Atlantic' magazine met with a Hezbollah supporter at a seaside café in western Beirut. The man, an academic with a thin white beard and the weary appearance of someone who hadn't slept in days, had a deep and long-standing connection with Hezbollah. 'We are in a great campaign, like no other before,' he said. 'Hezbollah has never faced what Israel is conducting now, not in 1982, not in 2006. This is a total war.' When asked about the possibility of Iran stopping its support for the organization, he replied after a tense silence: 'There are questions.' He added, 'It's like you've raised a son, now 42 years old, and you abandon him? No. It doesn't make sense.' Fighters at the border are ready, he said, and Israeli soldiers will dig their own graves and soon beg for a cease-fire. But then, the man slowed his speech, the reporter describes, and doubts returned. He mentioned Ahmad Shukeiri, the first chairman of the PLO, who said on the eve of the Six-Day War that the Jews who survive will remain in Palestine, but he estimated that none of them would survive. 'I don't want to be like him,' said the man. It took a moment to understand the historical analogy: he implied that the movement he is so dedicated to might face complete destruction. 'This tea we are drinking,' he said, 'we don't know if it will be the last.' In a comprehensive article in 'The Atlantic,' reporter Robert Worth paints a picture of a fragmented country, and perhaps something Israelis would like to hear - that Hezbollah and Iran are losing their grip on it. The article's headline is a quote about 'the end of the Iranian era.' Here are selected excerpts from it. Fuel ran out, so they continued on foot Hezbollah is much more than a militia, writes Worth; it is almost a state within a state, stronger than the weak and divided Lebanese government, certainly stronger than the Lebanese army. The organization smuggles not only weapons but billions of dollars from Iran. It operates banks, hospitals, a welfare system and a parallel economy of duty-free imports and drug trade that enriched and empowered the Shiite community, which was previously disadvantaged. The road to Tyre reveals the depth of the crisis, according to the article in 'The Atlantic.' The coastal highway, usually bustling with traffic, is almost empty. The driver speeds at over 87 mph. On both sides of the road, smoke from the previous night's bombings can be seen. Hezbollah's yellow flags wave in the wind, alongside new billboards of 'martyrs' with the inscription 'Nasrallah Aat' - a play on words in Arabic on the name of the killed leader of Hezbollah, meaning 'Victory of God.' On the northern roadside, dozens of abandoned cars are parked -left behind by families who fled from the south, ran out of fuel, and continued on foot. The city of Tyre, usually bustling, is described by the reporter as a ghost town. The Rest House hotel, a fenced tourist complex, has become a safe spot for refugees and journalists. From its wide balcony, overlooking a stunning beach, one can see Hezbollah's rocket launches. 'It happens a lot,' said one Arab journalist. 'That's how it is in war. You get used to it until the assumptions change and the missiles land on you.' In the city of Sidon, a strike on a residential building claimed the lives of at least 45 people, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. Israel, the article notes, stated that it eliminated a local Hezbollah commander and with him activists. Mohammed Ahmed Jiradi, 31, was among the first to arrive at the scene. 'I heard the screams of people under the rubble,' he recounted. 'I saw my aunt when they rescued her. Her internal parts were outside, her head crushed. That's the last image I have of her.' A resident named Lilal recounted how many receive phone calls from Israelis warning them to evacuate their homes. Many follow the X account of Avichay Adraee, the IDF spokesperson in Arabic, who publishes warnings about upcoming attacks. Lilal's neighbor, Ghadir, received a call from someone speaking Arabic with a Palestinian accent who knew all her personal details. When she evacuated her apartment, the building was bombed that night. An economic crisis is an opportunity for Israeli intelligence. In an effort to improve its image, Hezbollah organized a tour for about 300 journalists in the devastated areas of Dahiya, its stronghold in southern Beirut. The reporter describes how, at each bombing site, a Hezbollah representative gave a speech about innocent civilians who were killed while journalists crowded to photograph the smoking ruins. One shop owner in the area sneaked in to check his place and told the reporter, 'I came now because I know the Israelis won't bomb you.' The reporter shares the story of Hamoudi, a 25-year-old Shia who was a secular and successful film producer in Beirut. 'He didn't pray,' his sister said. 'My mother said, 'You won't be a martyr, you don't pray.'' Hamoudi loved women, music and parties, and lived in the secular Hamra district instead of Hezbollah's stronghold in Dahieh. Last September, he decided to join the ranks of the militants. A day after filming a 'martyr' video, he was killed in an Israeli bombing. 'He was my friend, my brother, my box of secrets,' his sister said tearfully. Instead of promising revenge, she added, 'I'm thinking of leaving the country.' Ashraf Rifi, former head of Lebanese security services, explained to The Atlantic how Israel managed to infiltrate Hezbollah's ranks. According to him, the organization's involvement in the Syrian war exposed the fighters to Israeli intelligence. Additionally, Lebanon's economic crisis made many vulnerable to recruitment as collaborators. On September 17, an operation was carried out to explode thousands of beepers sold through deception. A doctor at a leading hospital described the chaos of that day, with dozens of young people hospitalized without registering their names – all under the name 'George,' a typical Christian name. Rifi estimated that about 20% of Hezbollah's mid-level and senior commanders were killed in Israeli operations. 'The Iranian era is over, I think,' he said. 'In Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen.' Belief in Lebanon In Tripoli, at the trendy Crop restaurant, the reporter described a heated debate about the country's future. A local municipal official claimed, 'I don't see anyone who believes in a country called Lebanon. I see the Christians, Sunnis, Shias, Druze each loyal to their community or party. There is no public interest.' A young historian named Charles El-Haik passionately disagreed, arguing that Lebanon has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other Arab countries: traditions of religious diversity, democracy, higher education, and personal and public freedoms. A senior former officer in the Lebanese army, close to Chief of Staff Joseph Aoun, warned in the article that 'only Iran can disarm Hezbollah.' According to him, despite the severe blow, Hezbollah still has a significant fighting force in the south that can operate independently. 'But over time,' he emphasized, 'Hezbollah will feel the lack of money. That will be the biggest problem. And when the Shias return to the south, who will rebuild?' At night, from the roof of a hotel in Beirut, the reporter describes orange flames erupting from the southern outskirts of the city following an airstrike. 'It looks like a volcanic eruption,' he writes. A group of young Lebanese at a nearby table film the spectacle on their phones and return to their cocktails. Meanwhile, about a quarter of Lebanon's population has been displaced. At Beirut airport, Worth writes that he saw people sleeping outside hoping to get a ticket for a flight out. Foreign airlines have stopped their flights, and more than 300,000 Syrian refugees have fled back to Syria – evidence, he says, of the depth of fear prevailing in the country.

Rubble, smoke and bewildered people: A drive through 'broken' Leb...	The end of Iran's era': The Atlantic highlights Lebanon's dire situation, depicting a nation fractured by economic crisis and conflict, where Hezbollah's influence wanes, communities are displaced, and people argue among themselves about what kind of a nation Lebanon will be after the war At the end of September, just days after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was eliminated in an airstrike on the organization's stronghold in southern Beirut, a reporter from 'The Atlantic' magazine met with a Hezbollah supporter at a seaside café in western Beirut. The man, an academic with a thin white beard and the weary appearance of someone who hadn't slept in days, had a deep and long-standing connection with Hezbollah. 'We are in a great campaign, like no other before,' he said. 'Hezbollah has never faced what Israel is conducting now, not in 1982, not in 2006. This is a total war.' When asked about the possibility of Iran stopping its support for the organization, he replied after a tense silence: 'There are questions.' He added, 'It's like you've raised a son, now 42 years old, and you abandon him? No. It doesn't make sense.' Fighters at the border are ready, he said, and Israeli soldiers will dig their own graves and soon beg for a cease-fire. But then, the man slowed his speech, the reporter describes, and doubts returned. He mentioned Ahmad Shukeiri, the first chairman of the PLO, who said on the eve of the Six-Day War that the Jews who survive will remain in Palestine, but he estimated that none of them would survive. 'I don't want to be like him,' said the man. It took a moment to understand the historical analogy: he implied that the movement he is so dedicated to might face complete destruction. 'This tea we are drinking,' he said, 'we don't know if it will be the last.' In a comprehensive article in 'The Atlantic,' reporter Robert Worth paints a picture of a fragmented country, and perhaps something Israelis would like to hear - that Hezbollah and Iran are losing their grip on it. The article's headline is a quote about 'the end of the Iranian era.' Here are selected excerpts from it. Fuel ran out, so they continued on foot Hezbollah is much more than a militia, writes Worth; it is almost a state within a state, stronger than the weak and divided Lebanese government, certainly stronger than the Lebanese army. The organization smuggles not only weapons but billions of dollars from Iran. It operates banks, hospitals, a welfare system and a parallel economy of duty-free imports and drug trade that enriched and empowered the Shiite community, which was previously disadvantaged. The road to Tyre reveals the depth of the crisis, according to the article in 'The Atlantic.' The coastal highway, usually bustling with traffic, is almost empty. The driver speeds at over 87 mph. On both sides of the road, smoke from the previous night's bombings can be seen. Hezbollah's yellow flags wave in the wind, alongside new billboards of 'martyrs' with the inscription 'Nasrallah Aat' - a play on words in Arabic on the name of the killed leader of Hezbollah, meaning 'Victory of God.' On the northern roadside, dozens of abandoned cars are parked -left behind by families who fled from the south, ran out of fuel, and continued on foot. The city of Tyre, usually bustling, is described by the reporter as a ghost town. The Rest House hotel, a fenced tourist complex, has become a safe spot for refugees and journalists. From its wide balcony, overlooking a stunning beach, one can see Hezbollah's rocket launches. 'It happens a lot,' said one Arab journalist. 'That's how it is in war. You get used to it until the assumptions change and the missiles land on you.' In the city of Sidon, a strike on a residential building claimed the lives of at least 45 people, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. Israel, the article notes, stated that it eliminated a local Hezbollah commander and with him activists. Mohammed Ahmed Jiradi, 31, was among the first to arrive at the scene. 'I heard the screams of people under the rubble,' he recounted. 'I saw my aunt when they rescued her. Her internal parts were outside, her head crushed. That's the last image I have of her.' A resident named Lilal recounted how many receive phone calls from Israelis warning them to evacuate their homes. Many follow the X account of Avichay Adraee, the IDF spokesperson in Arabic, who publishes warnings about upcoming attacks. Lilal's neighbor, Ghadir, received a call from someone speaking Arabic with a Palestinian accent who knew all her personal details. When she evacuated her apartment, the building was bombed that night. An economic crisis is an opportunity for Israeli intelligence. In an effort to improve its image, Hezbollah organized a tour for about 300 journalists in the devastated areas of Dahiya, its stronghold in southern Beirut. The reporter describes how, at each bombing site, a Hezbollah representative gave a speech about innocent civilians who were killed while journalists crowded to photograph the smoking ruins. One shop owner in the area sneaked in to check his place and told the reporter, 'I came now because I know the Israelis won't bomb you.' The reporter shares the story of Hamoudi, a 25-year-old Shia who was a secular and successful film producer in Beirut. 'He didn't pray,' his sister said. 'My mother said, 'You won't be a martyr, you don't pray.'' Hamoudi loved women, music and parties, and lived in the secular Hamra district instead of Hezbollah's stronghold in Dahieh. Last September, he decided to join the ranks of the militants. A day after filming a 'martyr' video, he was killed in an Israeli bombing. 'He was my friend, my brother, my box of secrets,' his sister said tearfully. Instead of promising revenge, she added, 'I'm thinking of leaving the country.' Ashraf Rifi, former head of Lebanese security services, explained to The Atlantic how Israel managed to infiltrate Hezbollah's ranks. According to him, the organization's involvement in the Syrian war exposed the fighters to Israeli intelligence. Additionally, Lebanon's economic crisis made many vulnerable to recruitment as collaborators. On September 17, an operation was carried out to explode thousands of beepers sold through deception. A doctor at a leading hospital described the chaos of that day, with dozens of young people hospitalized without registering their names – all under the name 'George,' a typical Christian name. Rifi estimated that about 20% of Hezbollah's mid-level and senior commanders were killed in Israeli operations. 'The Iranian era is over, I think,' he said. 'In Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen.' Belief in Lebanon In Tripoli, at the trendy Crop restaurant, the reporter described a heated debate about the country's future. A local municipal official claimed, 'I don't see anyone who believes in a country called Lebanon. I see the Christians, Sunnis, Shias, Druze each loyal to their community or party. There is no public interest.' A young historian named Charles El-Haik passionately disagreed, arguing that Lebanon has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other Arab countries: traditions of religious diversity, democracy, higher education, and personal and public freedoms. A senior former officer in the Lebanese army, close to Chief of Staff Joseph Aoun, warned in the article that 'only Iran can disarm Hezbollah.' According to him, despite the severe blow, Hezbollah still has a significant fighting force in the south that can operate independently. 'But over time,' he emphasized, 'Hezbollah will feel the lack of money. That will be the biggest problem. And when the Shias return to the south, who will rebuild?' At night, from the roof of a hotel in Beirut, the reporter describes orange flames erupting from the southern outskirts of the city following an airstrike. 'It looks like a volcanic eruption,' he writes. A group of young Lebanese at a nearby table film the spectacle on their phones and return to their cocktails. Meanwhile, about a quarter of Lebanon's population has been displaced. At Beirut airport, Worth writes that he saw people sleeping outside hoping to get a ticket for a flight out. Foreign airlines have stopped their flights, and more than 300,000 Syrian refugees have fled back to Syria – evidence, he says, of the depth of fear prevailing in the country.

Telegram’s hate speech increased 433% after October 7 massacre	The messaging platform's new privacy policies useless, experts say; Following CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in August, hopes rose for better moderation, but no significant steps taken to curb platform's hate and antisemitism Since the October 72023 Hamas massacre, which marked one of the deadliest days for Jews since the Holocaust, antisemitic speech has spread online like wildfire. Telegram, known for its stringent privacy features and minimal content moderation, has since become a bastion for groups that incite violence against Jews and the Jewish State. A newly released report by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) tracked a sample of 793 channels/groups and 7,769 users, representing those who posted at least one violent antisemitic or anti-Israel message between April 2023 and 2024. The analysis found that on the day of the attacks antisemitic posts surged by 433.76%, skyrocketing from an average of 238.12 to 1,271 daily. While this spike has diminished, the current average of 321.22 daily posts remains significantly higher than pre-attack levels. Antisemitic conspiracy theories spreading across various platforms include false accusations that Israelis harvest organs from Palestinians, accusations that Jews were responsible for the 9/11 attacks, that Jews control the media and the U.S. government, that Jews promote the 'LGBTQ+ agenda,' and denying or distorting Israel's role in the October 7, 2023, attacks, falsely suggesting Israel orchestrated the violence. The influence of antisemitic content is measured by the volume of posts and user engagement, particularly by how frequently these posts are shared. Analysis by the ADL revealed that, before October 7, an average of 12.18 unique users forwarded extreme antisemitic posts weekly and this surged to 20.96 after that date. Additionally, the weekly forwarding of violent antisemitic and anti-Israel messages rose from 204.03 to 346.4. Daniel Kelley, director of Strategy and Operations and Head of the ADL Center for Technology & Society, discussed the report's concerning findings. 'After the arrest by French authorities (of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov) earlier this year, Telegram started sharing some data with governments, which they hadn’t done before. However, they haven’t changed their core rules,' Kelley said. 'They did add one rule to their terms of service, which says if something is illegal in many countries, they will take action. But they still don’t have fundamental content moderation measures in place. Telegram doesn’t prohibit hate speech or have rules against extremism or support for extremists,' according to Kelley. Although many experts consider these basic standards and platforms try to enforce them, Telegram seems hesitant to acknowledge that hate against marginalized groups isn’t acceptable on their platform, even in light of its recent attempt to prohibit notoriously illegal content. Arik Segal, the founder and CEO of Conntix, a consultancy facilitating effective and constructive communication on virtual platforms, highlighted how and why Telegram’s privacy changes won’t have the desired effect. 'I don't think the new privacy policies will have any impact. First, I believe that most people are not aware of the changes. Second, people don't see hateful messaging as a crime but as a legitimate communication method. Lastly, I don't think the police will have time and resources to deal with anything that is not strictly criminal, so people will not see any enforcement,' he said. According to Segal, curbing hate requires legal and technological changes done in coordination to protect free speech while shutting down antisemitism. Segal explained that local laws about hate and incitement are the first steps to fix this problem since platforms like Telegram have a business model that thrives on viral, often fake content, including antisemitic conspiracies. 'In short, they will only act if there is a threatening regulation,' highlighted the CEO of Conntix. David Strom, a leading technical expert on digital technologies with more than 35 years writing about online communications based in St. Louis, said he also is skeptical that Telegram’s new privacy policies will have the desired effect. 'Telegram better be more reactive, or they will get massive fines. I believe that businesses that rely on Telegram for their communications will switch to strongly encrypted emails and VPNs that don’t share users' data and migrate from Telegram to Signal for messaging, for example,' according to Strom. Even with newly devised AI tools to provide moderation, Strom is doubtful of their efficiency. 'To do content moderation properly, you need human eyes on and a big enough staff to fix the problems of false positive flags.' With Telegram’s CEO recently saying that his platform only employs 'about 30 engineers,' it is clear to experts that antisemitism will continue to flourish there. Considering Telegram’s unwillingness to take efficient measures, it remains in the hands of public authorities to do something. 'As long as people don't hear about a person that was thrown into jail due to controversial speech, they will not change their behavior. The police will not act since they don't have the willingness and resources to do so,' Segal said. Despite many who believe that hateful and violent content is a matter of opinion, Kelley explained that 'we’re not dealing with grey areas here, like questioning whether something is hate or not. The new rules are focused specifically on illegal content – things like terrorism and child pornography, which are illegal in most countries. They’re now prohibiting activities like child abuse and selling illicit goods, including weapons. For example, selling guns on Telegram is now explicitly banned, which wasn’t the case before. But even then enforcement is spotty. Telegram has had a rule for years against promoting violence on publicly viewable channels, but ADL found channels sharing footage from the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel and celebrating it. As Telegram seems indifferent to the violent and racist content on its platform, the ADL took the issue to other players in the high-tech sector, but the measures can still be avoided. Equally powerful to help curb antisemitism online, Google and Apple have restricted access to specific channels on Telegram. These online forums remained accessible via browsers or other means outside Apple and Google’s ecosystems. Kelley considers these measures the bare minimum and not measures that could be regarded as debatable since they promote explicit violence and hate. Concerned about how to fight back against hate speech on Telegram, Kelley doesn’t believe it is the right platform to do such work because most radicalized people are unwilling to review their worldview. 'They’re unmoveable in that sense,' he said. Other platforms could be a more efficient way to reach people who aren’t fully committed to extremist positions, according to the expert from the ADL. 'TikTok, YouTube or Facebook can be valuable where there’s more room for dialogue,' according to him. Fully aware that TikTok also has many problems, the ADL shared that TikTok usually addresses complaints when the ADL reports them. Still, when an average user reports them to TikTok, it is much less likely to be addressed. TikTok has recently updated its efforts to protect users amid the ongoing conflict. The platform has strengthened its Community Guidelines, expanding policies against hate speech to include indirect references to antisemitism, such as the misuse of the term 'Zionist.' TikTok reports removing over 4.7 million videos and suspending 300,000 livestreams for violations related to hate speech and misinformation since October 7, 2023. The company has also removed 500 million fake accounts globally, significantly ramping up content moderation with enhanced automated tools and trained moderators. Initiatives like the #SwipeOutHate campaign aim to engage the community in reporting hateful content. -This article is written by Nathan Klabin and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hknqlbhb1e	2024-11-03T10:26:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/17/BJuH1LhZT/BJuH1LhZT_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Iranian woman takes off her clothes at a Tehran university to pro...	The young woman was filmed walking in a bra and underwear at Azad University in Tehran, reportedly after being 'harassed' by Basij militia members enforcing Iran's strict morality laws; Iranian authorities claim she 'suffers from mental health issues' A young woman was arrested after undressing at a university in Tehran, according to reports from Iran. Sources associated with opposition to the Ayatollah regime claimed the woman was protesting Iran’s strict hijab laws, while state-affiliated media asserted that she suffered from mental health issues. Footage of Saturday's incident circulated on social media, showing the young woman walking in a bra and underpants, leaving onlookers stunned at Azad University in Tehran. In another video, she appears to be detained by authorities and taken into a vehicle. According to various reports on social media, the woman was allegedly 'harassed' earlier by members of the Basij militia at Azad University, which is considered a prestigious educational institution in Iran. Though the credibility of these reports remains unclear, they were also cited by the French news agency AFP. Some accounts claim that Basij members 'forcibly removed' the woman’s hijab and outer clothing, prompting her to strip down to her undergarments in protest and walk outside the university. An Iranian student news outlet, Amir Kabir Newsletter, alleged she was assaulted during her arrest. The incident sparked widespread reactions on social media. 'For most women, being seen in underwear in public is a nightmare … this is her response to the government’s stubborn insistence on enforcing hijab laws,' wrote one user on the X platform. Meanwhile, Iranian state media insisted that the woman is struggling with alleged mental health issues. The popular Iranian daily Hamshahri quoted a 'well-informed source' who suggested she would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. A spokesperson for Azad University also claimed the woman has 'severe psychological issues.'

IDF captures Iranian Revolutionary Guard operative in Syria	Syrian citizen spying on Israel for Iran says he was 'told to watch the borders' during interrogation in Israel; IDF: Arrest 'prevented a future attack and led to the exposure of the operational methods of Iranian terror networks located near the Golan Heights' An Iranian terrorist operative was recently arrested in Syrian territory, the IDF spokesman announced Sunday evening. The arrest was carried out in recent months during a nighttime operation in southern Syria, by the soldiers of the Egoz unit with field investigators of Unit 504, under the command of Division 210 and with intelligence guidance. The detained spy, Ali Soleiman al-Assi, a Syrian citizen who lives in Saida in southern Syria, was employed by Iran and engaged in gathering intelligence on IDF forces in the border area for future terrorist activity. Al-Aasi was under close surveillance by IDF forces, and he is under investigation in Israel by members of Unit 504 and the security forces. 'The operation by Israel Defense Forces troops to detain al-Assi prevented a future attack and led to the exposure of the operational methods of Iranian terror networks located near the Golan Heights,' an IDF spokesperson said. The Saudi channel Al-Hadith reported Sunday afternoon that an Israeli commando force entered Syria and kidnapped a Syrian working with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. According to Syrian reports, in July an IDF force accompanied by military vehicles entered the village of Al-Razania, in the south of the Quneitra district, arrested the citizen Ali Soleiman al-Assi at his home, and transferred him to Israeli territory. The reports claim that he worked transporting milk to Damascus and it is not clear why the report was published on the Syrian Voice of the Capitol website, which is affiliated with the opposition in the country, and on a local Syrian website. 'It is possible that Israel disrupted UNIFIL radars to reach northern Lebanon coast' This is the second time in the last day that the IDF admits, unusually, that its forces arrested terrorist operatives in enemy territory in a special operation. Last night it was allowed to be published that in a special operation of the 13th Fleet arrested a senior Hezbollah operative in the town of Batroun in northern Lebanon who is an expert in his field. The detainee, Imad Fadel Amhaz, was transferred to Israel and interrogated by Unit 504. The IDF confirmed that in a special commando operation together with the Navy, the flotilla's force intercepted an active member of Hezbollah, 'who is an expert in the maritime field.' Officials in Israel said Saturday that the operation, according to one, 'primarily shows operational boldness, they come and simply pick upsomeone from deep in Lebanon.' An official said that the arrested activist is 'a man who was a significant operational factor in military capabilities, such as those used by Hezbollah in the Second Lebanon War.' On Sunday morning, the Lebanese networks published a comment by the arrested man's father, Fadel, who claimed that his son was not involved in politics. The Arabic-language Saudi newspaper ASharq Al-Awsat, which is published in London, published new details about the arrest in Batroun on Sunday. A legal source told the newspaper that the Information Department of the Internal Security in Lebanon has opened an investigation into the incident, and that it will take 'at least three days to find out the details of the operation and the method the Israelis used to carry it out successfully.' A security source quoted in the newspaper said that there are several scenarios which the Israelis could have used, and that the investigation so far has not determined whether the forces reached the shore with boats or helicopters. According to the newspaper, the UNIFIL forces informed the Lebanese side that they too had begun an investigation to determine the measures taken by the IDF. The source said that it is possible that Israel had disrupted the radars of the UNIFIL forces, which made it easier for the Israeli forces to reach the coast without being discovered by UNIFIL or the Lebanese army, but so far this has not been confirmed. UNIFIL forces enjoy international immunity and therefore the Lebanese mechanisms cannot investigate them, unless they cooperate and deliver the information requested by Lebanon. The forces operating in Lebanon do not have to deliver to Lebanon the results of the special investigation they conduct, but can only submit them to the UN Secretary General. In February, the Syrian news site Nidaa al-Watan reported from sources that Mataa al-Sarhan, a senior member of Baath - the ruling party in Syria - disappeared after leaving his home in the village of al-Rafid in the Quneitra district of Syria. In media affiliated with the country's opposition there were various reports about his fate - some claimed that he was kidnapped in front of his house, others reported that he fled to Israel and, according to one report, he had been in Israel and was released back to Syria. The Syrian regime and the official media did not comment on the incident.

Nahariya man, 57, dies two weeks after being hit by rocket shrapn...	Edward Salulov couldn't reach the shelter in time when sirens sounded in the northern city of Nahariya, and was critically injured by shrapnel from an intercepted rocket; After two weeks, he has succumbed to his wounds; 'He taught children how to catch fish and tie hooks,' a local said Edward Salulov, 57. from Nahariya, was injured about two weeks ago on the evening of the Simchat Torah holiday by shrapnel from an interceptor during a Hezbollah barrage targeting the city. He was unable to reach a shelter on the seaside promenade and was critically injured by two pieces of shrapnel. On Sunday morning, after 11 days during which intensive care teams at the Galilee Medical Center fought for his life and performed several surgeries, he was pronounced dead. Salulov had been a resident of Nahariya since 1990. He was divorced and had four children with whom he had not been in contact for over a decade. He maintained contact with two of his nephews living in the city. One nephew, Arthur Korginyan, noted that Sululov lived alone and that his mother had died about seven years ago. He is also survived by a sister who lives in Holon. Salulov once leapt into the water and saved the lives of two children who were drowning at sea According to Korginyan, his uncle was a fisherman. 'We were on good terms. He worked for years at Soglowek (an Israeli food company), and, following an injury at work, he could no longer continue working. All of Nahariya knew him. He taught children how to catch fish and tie hooks. He managed to catch a 26-lb. amberjack fish from the shore.' Korginyan also shared that about two years ago Salulov leapt into the water and saved the lives of two children who were drowning at sea. 'He was always ready to help, forgetting all his problems and only remembering to help others. He was an unfortunate man with no luck in life.' Korginyan, a boxing coach, added that Salulov used to send 'weak people' to him, asking him to train them 'so that they wouldn't get hurt.'

Rabin family will request cancellation of state memorial amid war	The family of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin is requesting that the official ceremonies at Mount Herzl, a special session in the Knesset, and an event at the president's residence marking his assassination be cancelled The family of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Yitzhak Rabin Center plan to request that the state cancel this year’s memorial ceremonies for Rabin due to the ongoing war. This year’s commemoration of Rabin’s assassination is scheduled for November 13, the anniversary date on the Hebrew calendar. Events would include the official ceremony at the Great Leaders of the Nation's Plot on Mount Herzl, a special session in the Knesset, and a gathering at the president’s residence. Dalia Rabin, Rabin’s daughter, did not issue a response, and his granddaughter, Noa Rothman also said in a statement that she could not comment on the report. On Saturday night, November 4, 1995, Rabin attended a peace rally in Tel Aviv's Kings of Israel Square in Tel Aviv. . As he was walking back to his car he was assassinated by gunman Yigal Amir. Last month, it was reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to miss the state ceremony at Mount Herzl’s national leaders’ section, after the government secretariat notified ministers that the prime minister 'will not be able to attend this ceremony' and requested they designate a representative to lay the government’s wreath on his behalf. Last year, Netanyahu also missed the ceremony, sending then-Minister Ofir Akunis in his place. His absence drew sharp criticism, including from the leader of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz, who said in a statement that 'Netanyahu’s decision to miss the official memorial for Yitzhak Rabin is unstatesmanlike, but, more seriously, it is a failure of leadership. Regardless of criticism, Israel’s prime minister must do the right thing, honor the memory of a slain prime minister, and attend the ceremony –not for his own obligation, but for the State of Israel and all its citizens.'

IDF troops raid Hezbollah terrorist compound	During limited, localized, targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence by the 36th Division, troops of Shayetet 13, the Yahalom Unit, and the Oketz Unit, with support from the 282nd Brigade, conducted a raid on a Hezbollah terrorist compound, the IDF announced on Sunday. Hezbollah intended to use this compound to plan and execute an infiltration into Israeli territory and attacks on IDF troops. Within the compound, the soldiers located underground infrastructure and hideouts equipped with logistical and medical supplies for prolonged stays, military tents, and pits stocked with weapons, according to the IDF. The troops also located and destroyed rocket launchers, high-powered explosives ready to be activated, anti-tank missiles, mortar shells, AK-47 rifles, surface-to-air missiles, and a launcher concealed in a mountain on a several-meter track aimed directly at civilian communities in northern Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyzubzswyx	2024-11-03T06:25:22-08:00

Harris and Trump locked in tight race in swing states, NYT/Siena ...	Close races in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, according to the poll, which surveyed 7,879 likely voters in the seven states from Oct. 24 to Nov. 2.; In Iowa, Harris up likely thanks to women, after Trump wins state in 2016, 2020 Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump remain in a tight race in the country's seven battleground states two days before the U.S. presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College poll. The opinion poll showed Vice President Harris with marginal leads in Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin and former President Trump just ahead in Arizona. The two are in close races in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, according to the poll, which surveyed 7,879 likely voters in the seven states from Oct. 24 to Nov. 2. In all seven states, the matchups were within the poll's 3.5% margin of error. About 40% of the respondents had already voted and Harris led among those voters by 8 percentage points, while Trump leads with voters who have said they are very likely to vote but have not yet done so, the poll found. The tied race in Pennsylvania shows Trump gaining momentum in a state Harris had led by four percentage points in all prior New York Times polls, the outlet said. Both candidates are campaigning in battleground states this weekend, with Trump set to appear in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday, while Harris will campaign in Michigan. But in Iowa, a new poll released on Saturday, conducted by Ann Selzer for the Des Moines Register/Mediacom, showed Harris surpassed Trump in the state he won in 2016 and 2020, likely thanks to women voters, responsible for the turnaround. The poll of 808 likely voters, who were surveyed Oct. 28-31, has Harris leading Trump 47%-44% in Iowa, which has been trending deeply Republican in recent years. It is within the 3.4 percentage point margin of error, but it marked a turnaround from a September Iowa Poll that had Trump with a 4-point lead, the newspaper reported. 'The poll shows that women, particularly those who are older or who are politically independent â€' are driving the late shift toward Harris,' the Register said. Trump won Iowa in his past two presidential campaigns by more than 9 percentage points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. The Trump campaign released a memo from its chief pollster and its chief data consultant calling the Des Moines Register poll 'a clear outlier,' and saying that an Emerson College poll - also released Saturday - more closely reflected the state of the Iowa electorate. The Emerson College Polling/RealClearDefense survey of a similar number of likely voters Nov. 1-2 had a starkly different result, with Trump leading Harris by 10 points. This poll also has a 3.4 percentage point margin of error. The Emerson College survey had Trump with strong leads over Harris among men and independents, while Harris was performing well with those under the age of 30. Whoever wins Iowa will collect six Electoral College votes. A total of 270 are needed to capture the White House. Both parties have been concentrating their efforts during the closing days of their campaigns on 'battleground' states such as North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

Look them in the eyes': Former hostage shares new photos from ca...	Agam Goldstein-Almog abducted with her mother and younger siblings after her father and sister are murdered takes to social media to slam the government's inaction to bring about the release of those still held captive Former hostage Agam Goldstein-Almog shared new images on Sunday from her time held in Gaza, urging for the release of the 101 hostages still being held captive after 394 days. 'Look them in the eyes; how much longer will you ask them to survive like this?' she wrote in an Instagram post, accompanied by two photos. In one, she stands beside her younger siblings, Gal and Tal, who were abducted alongside her. Her father, Nadav, was murdered on October 7. 'Just sitting there in a tunnel in Gaza, photographed, begging to come home,' wrote the 18-year-old. 'With tired, frightened eyes that had just witnessed the worst and feared what more they might see. Today, November 3, 2024, on this date last year, I had no idea that in three weeks I'd be free, no idea if I’d even survive if I'd see other hostages. I was afraid of what my eyes would see. I didn't want to witness more tragedy or pain. 'These eyes — eyes that likely will never fully express all they've seen. Eyes that each day there, looked at the clock, waiting without knowing what for. Eyes that saw the other hostages up close. I looked into your eyes, not knowing it would take so much longer. How can we still look you in the eye? What will we say to you? What do you see there? What's being done to you from the day we parted? 'Today, I look at you through my own eyes and see people who don't place you first on their list of priorities. I see you, and then I see your mother fighting for you everywhere she can. I see two worlds and know what you're seeing there. Look into my tired, lost eyes in the photo and tell me I’d have to survive like that for another 51 days. I wouldn’t have believed it. And I'm angry because so much would have been spared if they'd freed me even a week earlier. Even a single day earlier. 'So what can I say about them? Soon it'll be 400 days and to think of all we could have spared them from seeing. And how much we continue to add with every delay. Look them in the eyes; how much longer will you ask them to survive like this?' In an interview with The Washington Post published in January, Goldstein-Almog spoke about the sexual abuse of those who remain in captivity, revealing that hostages she encountered in the tunnel confided in her that they had been sexually assaulted. In the tunnel where she and her family stayed for a week before their release, Agam met six women, some of whom were injured to varying degrees. The teen recounted that she and her mother treated their wounds using the limited means available. The teen shared that some of the women were held in isolation, separated from others, in small rooms with their daughters. When they met these women, some tearfully and with great difficulty revealed that they had been sexually assaulted. 'It was the first question we asked when we realized we were alone: 'How do they treat you?' Suddenly, they had someone they could share with and break down in front of - cry together.' Agam was released on November 26. On the day of her release, she said: 'Suddenly they came and told us to be ready at nine in the morning. The other girls, who were not supposed to be released, they lied to: 'Maybe tomorrow, Inshallah, maybe tomorrow.''

Tories pick pro-Israel Kemi Badenoch as new leader	The 44-year-old North West Essex MP is declared the winner of a lengthy leadership after beating Robert Jenrick; the new conservative boss is outspoken in her support for Israel; 'The time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles.' Kemi Badenoch has won the race to become the next leader of the Conservative Party. The 44-year-old North West Essex MP, who has been a staunch supporter of Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu’s war efforts in Gaza and in Lebanon, was declared the winner of a lengthy leadership after beating Robert Jenrick. At a results ceremony in central London on Saturday it was confirmed that Badenoch had received 53,806 votes from members to Jenrick’s 41,388, leaving her the winner with 57% of the vote. Having served as shadow business and trade and communities in the previous government Badenoch has been outspoken in her support for Israel. Both she and Jenrick have repeatedly expressed support for the Conservative Friends of Israel organization, appearing at their hustings event last month, and both penning letters to the group. Badenoch wrote: 'If I am leader of the Conservative Party, we will continue to strengthen our ties with Israel and root out the tragic resurgence of antisemitism in the UK. We will be true to our values.' She added 'We stand on the edge' of Labour 'reversing' the UK’s strong relationship with Israel built by the previous Conservative government. Last month she said Israel was showing 'moral clarity in dealing with its enemies' in the war with Hamas and Hezbollah. In an interview with Sky News host Trevor Phillips she said she would be 'congratulating Prime Minister Netanyahu' in dealing with 'enemies of the West.' Asked if she was ready to give Israel a 'free pass' if she became PM, Badenoch said: 'It’s not about a free pass, Israel does have a right to defend itself… If we look at what happened on October 7 we can see they cannot be complacent,' she said adding 'of course there will be red lines, we have international law for that.' Badenoch also flew to Israel to engage in on-going talks for a new free trade agreement with the Jewish state, which has yet to be concluded. In terms of tackling antisemitism at home, Badenoch strongly disputed claims by Lord Mann, that she had no interest in discussing the problem with him when she was Communities Secretary. Conservative former justice minister Lord Wolfson, a supporter of Badenoch’s, claimed: 'That’s not my experience of her, nor that of many others.' In comments about the pro-Palestine demos in the UK, Badenoch said: 'Our streets were soon filled with hordes of joyous people, not appalled at the acts of terror or demanding the perpetrators be brought to justice, but instead protesting against Jews under the guise of attacking Israel.' After the final result was announced Badenoch said the Tory Party was 'critical to the success of our country' but 'the time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles, to plan for our future, to reset our politics and our thinking.' Prime Minister Keir Starmer responded to the result saying the first election of a black leader in this UK was 'a proud moment for this country.' Badenoch’s shared of support from members was comparable to that achieve by former PM Liz Truss, but was less than that given to David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith.

Hezbollah's new tactic to confuse air defenses	terror group launches barrages made up of different projectiles, with a variety of ranges targeting different distances from the border at the same time, often adding drones into the mix Hezbollah implemented a new tactic to challenge Israel's air defenses in recent days, combining barrages of different-range rockets some precise and some 'stupid,' and launching at the same time, swarms of drones, all along the Israel-Lebanon border. The aim was to make it harder for the Iron Dome missile defense system and for radars, to detect and respond to specific threats. Since the morning hours, rocket attacks on the Western Galilee, Upper Galilee and Golan Heights came minutes apart. In one attack, The Iran-backed terror group targeted Western Galilee with a barrage of 10 rockets while 25 projectiles were fired at the Golan Heights. In an earlier attack, two longer-range missiles were fired at the Haifa Bay area and minutes later, a barrage targeted the Western Galilee communities closer to the border. IDF officials said they expected Hezbollah to launch more significant barrages in the war. They said they had braced for at least 150 different types of rockets and 10 drones in each attack. They attribute Hezbollah's limited strikes to the successes of the forces on the ground in South Lebanon, and the attacks on the terror group's arsenal of weapons along with the severe blow to the group's senior command after its leadership was assassinated and lower-level commanders were also killed in targeted strikes.

Rare flag and a lock of hair: Americana on auction ahead of elect...	New York auction house offers bizarre and rare items from the history of American presidents including a lock of George Washington’s hair, a flag that adorned Abraham Lincoln's casket Guernsey's‏, a New York auction house, launched a new event placing rare and unusual items in the U.S. presidential history for sale. The company said that some of the proceeds would go toward the construction of a new American museum. As the celebrations for the upcoming election unfold, rare items from U.S. presidential history are hitting the auction block, reminding everyone where it all began: a lock of George Washington’s hair, a flag that adorned Abraham Lincoln's casket, the plaster model for his famous statue in the Washington Monument and stunning presidential portraits from a family studio collection. The American flag that draped Abraham Lincoln's casket was seen by millions of Americans who bid farewell to the assassinated president in April 1865. Measuring 2.4 meters (7.9 feet) long, it covered the casket as it journeyed from Washington to his burial site in Springfield, Illinois and is now valued at between $800,000 and $1.2 million. Another unique American flag up for auction is a 49-star flag from 1959, created after Alaska joined the Union but before Hawaii became the 50th state. At the time, the government decided against producing more 49-star flags, anticipating Hawaii's upcoming statehood and the shift to 50-star flags. However, President Dwight Eisenhower's Oval Office still needed a distinguished display, so this impressive flag was specially crafted to stand behind his desk, symbolizing this unique moment in American history. As for George Washington, the auction house owners explained that a lock of his graying hair had been preserved in a locket that was gifted to a family friend and passed down through generations — until it reached a Philadelphia museum which is now putting it up for sale. The delicate hair, likely cut from Washington’s head shortly before or after his death in 1799 at age 67, is contained in a hand-crafted brass and glass locket. Also included in the auction are rare portraits from the Bachrach Studio, long considered a preferred choice for American presidents and now revealed to the public for the first time. Alongside these presidential portraits, including Franklin Roosevelt’s, are family snapshots from the Kennedy family, such as Jacqueline Kennedy’s wedding portrait. Among the special items is also the studio chair where numerous icons sat for their portraits, from Albert Einstein to Donald Trump and Meryl Streep. Founded in 1868, the Baltimore studio is the oldest continuously operating photography studio in the world, having documented every American president since Abraham Lincoln, including the only photo of him during his famous Civil War speech at the Gettysburg National Cemetery. Another famous presidential portrait of Abraham Lincoln available for auction was painted by artist Francis Bicknell Carpenter. Carpenter created this portrait as part of his preparations for the well-known painting 'First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln,' which currently hangs in the U.S. Capitol. Other famous paintings include the 'Monumental Lincoln Deathbed' by James Burnes, painted in 1866, along with the rare plaster model for the famous statue created by Daniel Chester French at the Washington, D.C. memorial. French, considered one of America’s greatest sculptors, created the figure of the 'Minute Man' in 1875, depicting a farmer who became a soldier in the Revolutionary War fighting for the young nation. The statue, located in the center of Concord, Massachusetts, became an American icon, used by the government during wartime to raise funds through war bonds and savings. Decades later, French received the honor of designing one of the most iconic and beloved works in the U.S.: his statue of Abraham Lincoln at the famous memorial in Washington. The rare plaster models for these two renowned works will also be up for sale. Other artistic works being auctioned include impressionistic portrait sculptures of presidents by sculptor Robert Berks — the first to have his works featured on the cover of Time magazine. His statue of John F. Kennedy also received the exceptional honor of being displayed above the podium at the White House.

I was Donald’s closest friend': disgraced pedophile says in reco...	Jeffrey Epstein tells Michal Wolf in an interview how Trump goes after the wives of his friends; had undergone surgery for hair loss and was incapable of showing affection; The Trump campaign says the claims are false and are elections interference Recordings released on Sunday by entertainment outlet The Daily Beast revealed that Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in his jail cell, referred to himself as 'Donald Trump's closest friend' and shared intimate details about Trump’s sex life, including instances of him cuckolding his close friends. The convicted pedophile even boasted about his friendship with the U.S. former president and his now-wife Melania, claiming, 'The first time he slept with her was on my plane.' The aircraft, known as the 'Lolita Express,' also transported Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Kevin Spacey, Naomi Campbell and numerous young girls who later alleged rape and sexual assault. Epstein spoke at length about Trump with author Michael Wolff in August 2017, two years before he was found dead in his cell. Wolff was then working on his book Fire and Fury, which went on to sell 5 million copies. Trump tried at the time to prevent the book’s publication. The recordings shed new light on the longstanding relationship between Trump and Epstein, and their release — just two days before the U.S. election — adds to discussions about the Republican candidate’s character, especially regarding his attitude toward women. Trump’s camp called the recordings 'false smears' and 'election interference.' In the recordings, Epstein described Trump as 'charming' and 'always fun,' hinting at his support for Trump’s policies on various issues, including 'the transgender stuff.' However, he alleged that Trump was a serial cheater during his marriages and liked 'to f*** the wives of his best friends.' He also claimed Trump was a person without real friends at heart and was incapable of showing affection. Epstein alleged that Trump had undergone surgery for hair loss. 'How do you know all this?' Wolff asked Epstein, who responded, 'I was Donald’s closest friend for 10 years.' On Thursday, Wolff caused a stir by releasing a brief clip in which Epstein spoke at length about working within Trump’s inner circle. Wolff also claimed that the convicted millionaire pedophile showed him photos of Trump with topless young women sitting on his lap. Wolff, a veteran journalist who also authored Rupert Murdoch’s biography, said that he possesses around 100 hours of interview recordings with Epstein. He said he decided to release some of them following a new accusation against Trump — Miss Switzerland 1992, Beatrice Kohl, alleged that he sexually harassed her a year after her win. 'He was grabbing and touching my body everywhere he could,' she recounted. Epstein was first arrested in Florida 2005, accused of paying a 14-year-old girl for sexual favors. Dozens of other minors described similar sexual offenses, but prosecutors ultimately allowed him to plead to only one charge. He served 13 months in jail. Some high-profile associates distanced themselves from Epstein after his conviction, including former U.S. presidents Clinton and Trump, while others didn’t. In 2019, Epstein was arrested again on charges of trafficking dozens of girls for sex and later died by suicide in his cell.

IDF cuts Jabaliya off from Gaza City in prolonged operation	The military says most civilians have already left leaving hundreds of Hamas terrorists and the remaining civilians surrounded by troops; IDF officials say at least six months are needed to clear northern Gaza from Hamas The IDF cut off Jabaliya from Gaza City in its weeks-long assault. The forces took control of the area and allowed civilians out through dedicated passages where they were monitored with facial recognition technology to prevent terrorists from escaping. Thus far some 600 suspected Hamas terrorists have been captured and detained for interrogation by security forces. The forces in effect implemented part of a plan devised by former high-ranking members of the military, to prevent humanitarian aid from reaching areas under Hamas control and thereby undermine its rule. In the first week of the assault, Jabaliya was surrounded, while the military urged civilians to leave but after American pressure, aid was once again allowed in, straight to the hands of Hamas. Tens of thousands of civilians, no longer fearful of the terrorists, chose to leave but thousands remain. The military increased the use of artillery fire after the risk of civilian casualties was reduced. Jabaliya was considered a Hamas stronghold in the northern part of the Strip and many of the terrorists returned there after the IDF withdrew its forces earlier in the year. The forces said they found the entrance to the city laced with explosives that caused casualties to the troops but said they were less sophisticated than in other areas. Hamas, having studied the movements of the forces, began booby-trapping the upper floors of buildings, believing the soldiers shelled lower floors only, before entering the structures. Hamas opted to use their explosive material on booby traps which were more effective than directing them at the troops maneuvering outside. 'We found an exhausted population, hungry and weak, arriving at our ports of passage and without civilians, Hamas cannot exist,' IDF officials said. 'Interrogations of terrorists have been useful and provide intelligence on where the Hamas planted explosives and where they keep their weapons.' The IDF said several hundred terrorists still remain in Jabaliya, behind their fortifications, requiring the military to continue operating there for at least a few more days. The ongoing operation was made possible after more aid was delivered. Medical equipment has also been brought into the local Kamal Adwan hospital. The IDF said the terrorists and civilians have enough supplies to last them a month although more aid is making its way into the besieged areas. Some officials in the military said it would take at least six months to clear northern Gaza of Hamas forces.

Israel's academic year begins, the second since war	Higher education institution heads make effort to support reserve soldiers throughout year but warn budget cuts and other restrictions could harm academia and the country Israeli higher education institutions opened the academic year on Sunday amid the backdrop of the Gaza war for the second consecutive time, as tens of thousands of students — some still actively serving in the reserves — head to universities and colleges. Data from universities and colleges indicate that one in five students served in the reserves in the last academic year — marking about 70,000 students — and similar numbers are expected this year. Ahead of the academic year, university heads pledged to continue supporting reservists to minimize the impact on them and help them complete their degrees. They also showed concern about anticipated cuts to higher education, urging funds be allocated to address these challenges and were also troubled by the growing phenomenon of boycotts against Israeli institutions and researchers worldwide. Universities report a significant number of reservists already mobilized, with more expected to do so throughout the year. At the Hebrew University, 2,000 reservists will start the year, while Tel Aviv University has about 1,600, Ariel University has 1,900, Ben-Gurion University has 1,700, a similar number at Bar-Ilan University and over 1,000 at the Technion. A breakdown by field of study reveals that a large proportion of these reservists are enrolled in engineering, medicine and law faculties. The war’s effects are also reflected in students’ choice of study fields. Universities report an increase in students enrolling in therapeutic fields like psychology, social work, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Additionally, education studies are seeing ongoing growth in study interest alongside rising regard for technology and engineering fields. Ariel University reports a 15% increase in the number of students starting medical studies this year. Meanwhile, the war has driven a significant increase in demand for Arabic language and literature studies (40%) as well as Islamic and Middle Eastern studies (31%). According to data from Haifa’s Technion, enrollment interest remains unaffected by the ongoing war. 'We’ll likely open the new academic year under the threat of rocket fire,' said Technion President Prof. Uri Sivan. 'The Technion is probably the only university in the world directly protected by technologies developed by its alumni — the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow are just a few examples.' He added that harm to Israeli academia through budget cuts, threats to its independence, or restrictive laws would severely impact Israel’s future — its security, economy and society. 'I invite everyone to imagine what the current war would look like without our technological advantage and how the economy could support the war without advanced industries,' he said.

American Iranian journalist jailed for months in Iran	Detention of Reza Valizadeh, former staffer of an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that’s overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media to increase tensions with the U.S. ahead of threatened strike on Israel An Iranian-American journalist who once worked for a U.S. government-funded broadcaster is believed to be detained by Iran for months now, authorities said Sunday, further raising the stakes as Tehran threatens to retaliate over an Israeli attack on the country. The imprisonment of Reza Valizadeh, acknowledged to The Associated Press by the U.S. State Department, came as Iran marked the 45th anniversary of the American Embassy takeover and hostage crisis on Sunday. The event took place days ahead of the US elections pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Kamala Harris. It also followed Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatening both Israel and the U.S. the day before with 'a crushing response' as long-range B-52 bombers reached the Middle East in an attempt to deter Tehran. 'The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation and the resistance front,' Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran. Valizadeh had worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that’s overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. In February, he wrote on the social platform X that his family members had been detained in an effort to see him return to Iran. In August, Valizadeh apparently posted two messages suggesting he had returned to Iran despite Radio Farda being viewed by Iran’s theocracy as a hostile outlet.

IDF forces were near Sinwar 5 times, Hamas claims	Forces were mere dozens of meters away from a house in the Khan Younis neighborhood where Sinwar was hiding alone, accompanied only by a bodyguard who helped him stay hidden, Hamas sources say Hamas sources told Arab news outlet Asharq Al-Awsat on Saturday that former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was nearly killed by IDF troops in the Gaza Strip five times, before his ultimate death back in October. According to the sources, Sinwar maintained contact with senior Hamas officials via letters delivered in a method he devised, moved from place to place based on the presence of IDF forces in the area, relayed messages to Hamas members and mediators abroad and even informed his family when his nephew, who accompanied him died but that message reached them only two days after he, himself was killed. During the IDF’s offensive in Khan Younis last January the Hamas sources said Sinwar was hiding in one of his tunnels in the city north of Rafah. They referred to a video showing Sinwar walking through tunnels with his family, released by the IDF. They said the IDF intercepted recordings showing Sinwar moving around and delivering several items to a tunnel he and his family occupied just hours before the October 7 attack. 'Sinwar insisted on staying' 'But Israel was unable to reach him in the Khan Younis tunnels, nor could they get to him above ground,' the sources said. As the military operation expanded, both above and below ground, Sinwar was forced to find a safe place for his wife and children, distancing them from him due to Israel's relentless pursuit. They said the wife and children were unharmed and received letters from him at least every six weeks. 'As the military operation in Khan Younis intensified, Sinwar insisted on staying there and parted several times from his brother Mohammed and Rafa'a Salameh, Hamas’ Khan Younis Brigade Commander,' who was killed last July alongside Mohammed Deif, 'whom he met occasionally since the start of the war in safe houses or tunnels,' the sources claimed. They explained that the four weren't always together, meeting at times and spending hours or even days before parting based on the situation on the ground. The sources revealed there were instances when IDF forces were mere dozens of meters away from a house in the Khan Younis neighborhood where Sinwar was hiding alone, accompanied only by a bodyguard who helped him stay hidden. They added that Sinwar 'was armed and prepared for a possible IDF raid on the house where he was located and to confront them if they approached. However, movements by Hamas operatives from house to house led to street battles with IDF forces, revealing Sinwar’s presence within the house.' The sources said that Sinwar was immediately extracted from the house through openings Hamas operatives had created in adjacent homes and was subsequently moved to a safe house approximately one kilometer (0.62 miles) from his previous location. Before being relocated from the second to a third hiding place, he met with his brother Mohammed and Rafa'a Salameh, after which the three parted ways as the military maneuver expanded in the area where they were located. From Khan Younis to Rafah The sources added that, under pressure from his brother, Salameh and Hamas operatives, Sinwar was forced to leave Khan Younis for Rafah back in February. According to them, Israeli forces at the time had almost complete control of Khan Younis and had imposed a siege. 'However, he was safely transferred to Rafah through operations above and below ground,' they said. The sources revealed that Sinwar’s nephew, Ibrahim Mohammed Sinwar, didn’t leave his uncle’s side throughout the war. They added that Ibrahim was killed last August in an Israeli strike when he exited a tunnel opening to monitor military movements while with his uncle in Rafah. They added that Sinwar sent a letter to his brother's family explaining the circumstances of Ibrahim’s death and the location of his burial in an underground tunnel. 'He pointed out the burial location and mentioned that he himself had prayed over the body,' they reported. Hamas sources noted that the delay in the message reaching Mohammed Sinwar’s family 'demonstrates the difficult and complex conditions,' in which the terror organization’s leader lived, as well as the stringent measures he took to avoid any security breaches through which Israel could easily locate him. 'This also explains the thinking that his death was an 'accident',' they claimed. The sources reported that Sinwar had been in Rafah for several months, moving through various parts of the city. 'Since the end of last May, he remained in its western areas, moving both above and below ground. He was in multiple tunnels in Rafah, including the one where the six hostages were killed.' According to them, this indicated he made the final decision to execute them after Israeli forces came close to him last September. While separated from his relatives and commanders, he exchanged letters with them using certain security methods he devised himself. The sources said that the same method applied to his communications with Hamas leadership in Gaza and abroad — especially concerning contacts with mediators about any cease-fire agreement and hostage deal. The sources said that before his elimination, Sinwar and his companions suffered from food shortages, particularly in the last three days when they didn’t eat at all. 'They were preparing for a confrontation with Israeli forces and thus moved between several nearby damaged buildings,' they said. The sources explained that Hamas’ Tel al-Sultan Battalion commander, Mahmoud Hamdan made attempts to evacuate the Hamas leader to a safe location during their final 15 days in Rafah, but these efforts failed due to the intensity of military operations in the area in which the two were later located and eliminated. 'Israeli forces came close to Sinwar’s location many times — at least five times, three above ground and twice underground. Each time, Sinwar was relocated despite his insistence on participating in the fighting, which he did several times before being moved from locations where firefights took place,' they claimed. When asked if his incessant presence in Rafah was related to assessing the situation along the Philadelphi Corridor, particularly since he was killed only a few hundred meters (0.19 miles) away, the sources denied it. Other sources close to the terror organization suggested that his choice to remain there might have been part of a plan where Sinwar considered the potential for Israel’s gradual withdrawal from the area and its impact on a 'prisoner exchange' deal, as well as to assess the situation on the ground.

New details on abduction of Hezbollah operative in Lebanon	According to reports in the Lebanese press, the raid lasts no more than four minutes carried out by a 20-man team including 2 in civilian wear; IDF remotely erases some CCTV footage to mask details The abduction by Israeli commando forces, of a senior Hezbollah operative from a coastal town in north Lebanon, continued to fascinate local media after new reporting added details of the operation. Lebanon's al-Jadeed channel reported that the raid in Batrun, lasted only four minutes and was carried out by 20 people including soldiers and 2 civilians, like soldiers in civilian clothes. Al Jadeed also claimed as part of the Israeli effort to prevent details of the operation from being revealed, CCTV footage from the area of the raid, later taken by Lebanon's security forces, was remotely erased. The senior operative's wife reported the abduction. In his apartment, the Lebanese forces found 10 SIM cards with foreign numbers, a phone and foreign passports. Pictures showed one of the passports with PANAMA written on it in English. The abduction of Imad Amhaz, described by the military as a naval expert, took place early on Friday and was carried out by IDF naval commandos and military intelligence forces. Israeli sources confirmed its forces had carried out the operation some 140 kilometers (85 miles) north of the border.

Election day nears as demographics debate: Trump or Harris?	This election is one of the closest ones yet and both candidates are very unpopular. Voters this time, more so than in previous elections, are voting against someone, not for someone With only a few days until the U.S. presidential election, it is still unclear who will win. Last week, some polls began to show former U.S. President and Republican candidate Donald Trump edging past Vice President and Democratic contender Kamala Harris, with a 54% chance of winning. However, 'with the margin of error, this is still a very close race,' Drew McCoy, president of Decision Desk HQ, told The Media Line. 'The election will come down to turnout.' According to the latest Gallup Poll report, more than half (54%) of registered voters are expected to have voted by November 5. However, this is down from 64% in 2020, suggesting that more voters may cast their ballots in person this year — or possibly not show up at all. 'First, I cannot recall any election as close as this one,' Eytan Gilboa, a professor of international relations at Bar-Ilan University and an expert on U.S. elections, told The Media Line. 'Second, both candidates are very unpopular. Voters this time, more so than in previous elections, are voting against someone, not for someone. And when you vote against someone, it doesn't matter who is on the other side.' There is also extreme polarization between the Democratic and Republican parties, with voters barely agreeing on the most important issues. Although the economy is No. 1 for both sides, there are several other critical issues on the table that only Republicans or Democrats prioritize, such as immigration, abortion, or democracy. When it comes to the economy, people often don't seem to remember what actually happened during Trump's first term; instead, they recall a time when the economy was better and inflation was lower, according to Prof. Benjamin Miller of the University of Haifa. Trump presents himself as a billionaire, which projects an image of economic expertise. On the other hand, Harris lacks a strong record in financial affairs, leading to lower public trust in her economic management skills. Pro-Trump voters expect him to address issues at America’s southern border with Mexico related to illegal immigration. Pro-Harris voters, meanwhile, are concerned about the anti-abortion laws implemented since the reversal of Roe v. Wade, which was influenced by Trump's appointment of conservative judges to the Supreme Court. Harris voters are also focused on preserving democracy; Harris has accused Trump of being a fascist and argues that only she can safeguard the country's democracy and commitment to civil and human rights. Another major factor is foreign policy. According to Miller, Harris aims to continue America's 'grand strategy since World War II,' positioning the U.S. as a global leader committed to its allies, particularly NATO. On the other hand, Trump takes a more unilateral or isolationist approach, which could mean discontinuing support for Ukraine and potentially abandoning NATO. Are Jews and Muslims shifting their loyalties? Israel, the Gaza war, and the potential for a regional escalation involving Iran are also factors for U.S. voters this year. In Israel, where most people can't vote in the U.S. election, many favor a Trump victory. A recent poll by Israel's Channel 12 showed that 66% of Israelis support Trump, while only 17% support Harris. In contrast, a Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) survey found that 63% of American Jews plan to vote for Harris. However, this represents a drop in support from the Jewish community compared to Biden in 2020. Meanwhile, 24% of American Jews plan to vote for Trump, with 95% of Trump supporters citing his pro-Israel stance as the primary reason. Over 90% of these supporters believe a Trump Administration would strengthen U.S.-Israel relations, according to JPPI. A majority of Americans (56%) feel the current Biden Administration does not adequately support Israel. For Harris supporters, however, the survey showed that Israel is less central, with only a third listing it as a key voting issue. Meanwhile, the American Muslim community, which has historically supported Democratic candidates, is also shifting away from Harris. This year, for the first time in documented history, Michigan's Council on American-Islamic Relations is not endorsing a Democratic candidate. Michigan, home to the country's largest Arab American constituency — around 250,000 Muslims, nearly half of whom are eligible to vote — has seen mixed reactions, with some planning not to vote and others leaning toward Trump, according to a recent Reuters report. Similarly, younger, progressive Democrats critical of Harris's support for Israel are moving away from her. The Reuters article suggested many of these voters plan to cast protest votes for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. A survey by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research revealed that many U.S. voters are concerned that the Middle East conflict could escalate into a broader regional war. Miller noted that the public perceives Trump as more 'hostile to Iran,' which has orchestrated and funded much of the proxy war against Israel. Trump's decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal with Iran when he was president is seen as indicative of his hardline stance. 'One of Trump's arguments during this election campaign was that while he was in office, there were no major wars,' Miller added. Is America ready for a female president? In a country that prides itself on gender equality, gender is unexpectedly playing a significant role in this election. 'Another issue is whether or not the United States is really ready for a woman president,' Gilboa told The Media Line. Looking at the polls, about 80% of African American women plan to vote for Harris, but fewer than 50% of African American men say the same. The Harris campaign has even adopted a slogan, 'Be a man, vote for Harris,' which, according to Gilboa, suggests they recognize her struggle to gain support from men — whether white, Black, or Hispanic — despite Harris being a minority herself. Miller agreed. He explained that Trump's core supporters are white working-class voters, but he has recently gained traction among minority voters, particularly Latino and African American working-class males. For many of them, 'the idea that a woman, let alone a woman of color, could be president is hard to absorb.' Voter turnout: The deciding factor for the White House? According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2020 presidential election saw the highest voter turnout of the 21st century. Some 66.8% of citizens 18 and older voted. According to Decision Desk HQ's McCoy, voter turnout, at least in numbers if not percentage, is expected to be similar this year. In recent history, higher turnout has tended to favor Democrats, but McCoy noted this trend has shifted somewhat toward Republicans. 'Now, the Republicans want higher turnout, and the Democrats might want lower,' McCoy said. 'If you start to see higher turnout levels, that could benefit Trump and the Republicans.' There are seven key swing states to watch: North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. In most of these, polls show both candidates running neck and neck, with a slight Trump advantage in Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. 'Based on where things are now, there is a chance that those seven states — or at least five of the seven — go to one candidate,' McCoy said. 'North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are highly correlated.' Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have voted together since 1988, but this year is more of a toss-up. Analysts are watching closely to see if these states will stay aligned or diverge. McCoy explained that Harris's most straightforward path to the White House is to retain as much of the 2020 map as possible. This means she could lose North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada as long as she holds Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to secure the 270 electoral votes needed. If Trump retains North Carolina, as he did in 2020, and flips Georgia and Arizona in his favor, he could also reach 270. McCoy noted that Pennsylvania is particularly close. Harris had the chance to select a Jewish vice-presidential candidate from Pennsylvania, which has the most electoral votes of any swing state, but she chose Tim Walz from Minnesota instead. 'There is a lot of discussion about how much of a home-state advantage a candidate like [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro would have,' McCoy said. 'However, if Donald Trump wins Pennsylvania, people will certainly question it.' With just a few days left, the candidates are making last-minute efforts to sway undecided voters. Harris is working to attract Republicans who oppose Trump and is appealing to evangelical Christians — Trump's core base — to remind them that 'he is not a moral person, not a family man,' Gilboa said. Meanwhile, Trump is reaching out to American Muslims with messages focused on the economy and a stable Middle East. Who will be more convincing? The world will have to wait until Tuesday to find out.

Israel expresses doubt over hostage deal amid renewed talks	Mediators press on, yet Israeli officials warn Hamas’ demand to end war and withdraw from Gaza may block any small-scale deals; Israeli sources predict heavy US pressure to end war following upcoming election Despite renewed negotiations and mediator efforts, Israeli officials expressed significant pessimism Saturday about the chances of securing a hostage deal with Hamas. 'Hamas insists on a complete end to the war and is not open to incremental deals. This isn’t moving in a promising direction,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that mediators have not returned with an official response, attempting to prevent a full collapse of the talks. 'Perhaps after the U.S. elections, there could be a fresh approach. If [Kamala] Harris wins, momentum could continue toward a larger deal—meaning an end to the war.' 'The mediators are still in talks with Hamas and haven’t given up, but the chances look very slim,' explained one source familiar with the ongoing discussions. 'As it stands, Hamas is unwilling to consider any framework that does not ultimately include a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war from July 2. This isn’t final, but even if Hamas were to agree to an initial small-scale deal, they would still require the later stages to include a full cease-fire and retreat from Gaza. 'After over a year of intense fighting, including significant gains and the killing of [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar, it’s time to consolidate, end the war and achieve core objectives, one of which is the hostages’ return. Some argue that it would be wise to withdraw even without securing the hostages. 'Sinwar has consistently told Hamas leadership—and his brother—that the hostages are leverage and will only be released if there is a full military withdrawal. No hostage is returned until forces withdraw from Gaza. The prime minister’s team might frame it as Hamas waiting for us to lose and withdraw, but most security and military officials believe that after a year of combat and substantial achievements, now is precisely the time to end the war, plan for what follows and secure the hostages.' Israeli assessments suggest that after the U.S. election, regardless of who wins, there will be intense pressure on Israel to conclude the war. Officials anticipate that the Biden administration, feeling less constrained by the political campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, will push for a broad deal that includes ending the war and securing the return of the hostages. Meanwhile, Cairo is persisting in its diplomatic efforts with both Palestinian and Israeli representatives to establish calm in Gaza and enable further humanitarian aid access, Egypt’s Al Qahera News reported Saturday evening, citing a senior Egyptian official. The source noted ongoing Cairo meetings between Fatah and Hamas leaders, with Hamas remaining firm on negotiating hostage release and cease-fire terms jointly to avoid further hostilities from Israel. Egypt is working to bring negotiations back on track, with both Fatah and Hamas reportedly open to forming a joint committee for Gaza’s governance. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Saturday with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. The two discussed steps to reduce regional escalation, with Blinken underscoring the importance of ending the war in Gaza, securing the return of all hostages and establishing a post-war pathway that ensures governance, security and reconstruction. Blinken addressed the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, reviewed actions taken to improve the situation and urged further steps to increase aid to civilians. The two also discussed ongoing diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution in Lebanon, which would allow both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to return safely to their homes. Additionally, Blinken reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to Israel’s security against threats posed by Iran and its proxy groups.

Israel expresses doubt over hostage deal amid renewed talks	Despite renewed negotiations and mediator efforts, Israeli officials expressed significant pessimism Saturday about the chances of securing a hostage deal with Hamas. 'Hamas insists on a complete end to the war and is not open to incremental deals. This isn’t moving in a promising direction,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that mediators have not returned with an official response, attempting to prevent a full collapse of the talks. 'Perhaps after the U.S. elections, there could be a fresh approach. If [Kamala] Harris wins, momentum could continue toward a larger deal—meaning an end to the war.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhw6l4bkl	2024-11-02T11:30:11-07:00

Israel confirms captured senior Hezbollah operative in high-stake...	Israeli sources acknowledge commando raid on Batroun’s coast, capturing Hezbollah operative identified as 'key figure in weaponry capabilities used by Hezbollah during Second Lebanon War,' and say mission demonstrates 'bold operational capability' Israeli authorities confirmed Saturday that an elite naval commando operation by Shayetet 13 captured a senior Hezbollah operative in Batroun, northern Lebanon. The individual, described as an expert in weaponry crucial to Hezbollah's capabilities, was transferred to Israel and is currently being interrogated by Unit 504, Israel’s military intelligence division. According to earlier reports from Arabic media, a team of more than 25 suspected Israeli commandos landed on the shores of Batroun, approximately 85 miles from Israel’s border, and apprehended the Hezbollah operative in a building in the sector. Israeli sources hailed the operation as a show of 'bold operational capability,' with one official remarking, 'They just reached in and extracted someone from deep within Lebanon.' Sources said that the detained operative was 'an individual with significant operational expertise in weaponry capabilities, akin to those Hezbollah used during the Second Lebanon War.' Sky News Arabia quoted an Israeli security source confirming the capture, identifying the detainee as Imad Amahaz. Hezbollah has reportedly denied any connection to the individual, while Lebanon’s Al Jadeed network claimed Amahaz is an officer in the Lebanese Navy, potentially tied to Hezbollah. However, Al Arabiya, citing additional sources, reported that he is not affiliated with Lebanon's official military forces. The Associated Press reported that the raid took place early Friday in the coastal town of Batroun, about 20 miles north of Beirut. The man allegedly abducted had rented an apartment on the first floor of a multi-story building in the town. Lebanon’s National News Agency reported that locals observed an unidentified military force conducting an amphibious landing on the beach. The force reportedly moved with weapons and equipment to a nearby cabin, later capturing the Lebanese national, taking him to the shore and departing on motorboats to the open sea. Security footage distributed from the area shows around 20 armed individuals in military uniform escorting a person with his face covered by a shirt.

Northern towns experience continuous alarms as suspected Hezbollah drone enters from Lebanon; after 34 minutes, military confirms drone shot down; second drone also downed over Mediterranean before entering Israeli airspace near Tel Aviv Israel’s northern towns sounded continuous alarms Saturday, warning of a suspected drone infiltration from Lebanon. The first sirens were activated in Shlomi and surrounding border communities, quickly spreading across the Western Galilee, including the city of Nahariya. The IDF reported a 'suspicious aerial target' crossing from Lebanon, adding that it was being monitored, and urged the public to follow Home Front Command instructions. As the drone continued southward, alarms sounded in Acre, Kiryat Bialik, Kiryat Yam and Kiryat Motzkin. Within minutes, sirens were also triggered in Haifa, Nesher and further south in Binyamina, where fighter jets were reportedly seen overhead, possibly in pursuit of the suspected drone. The sirens extended across additional northern locations, with alarms sounding in Yokneam Illit, Bat Shlomo in the Carmel region, and later in Zikhron Ya’akov, Ramat Hanadiv and Ma’ayan Zvi. After 34 minutes of heightened alerts, Home Front Command announced the conclusion of the incident, with the IDF confirming that the drone, which set off numerous warnings, had been intercepted. Meanwhile, another drone was reportedly intercepted west of Tel Aviv in the Mediterranean Sea, before the drone crossed into Israeli airspace.

Arab Media: Israeli naval commandos snatch Hezbollah official nor...	Several Lebanese and other Arab networks have reported Israeli commandos, making landfall from the Mediterranean shores to the coastal city of Batroun in northern Lebanon, have taken Imad Amahaz, reportedly a senior Hezbollah operative, in an operation they report was conducted jointly with UNIFIL, who deny involvement On Saturday, Arab media buzzed with reports of a clandestine naval operation. A sizable force, suspected to be Israeli, stealthily touched down on the shores of Batroun in northern Lebanon, roughly 87 miles from the Israeli border, with the intent of snatching a high-ranking terrorist operative from his hideaway in a cabin. This daring raid, involving over 25 operatives, was said to have been coordinated with UN forces stationed in Lebanon (UNIFIL). On their end, UNIFIL have denied any involvement in the matter. Confirming the whispers, an Israeli security source revealed to Sky News in Arabic the capture deep within Lebanese territory. Saudi channel 'Al-Hadath' named the captured figure as Imad Fadel Amahaz. While Hezbollah distanced itself from him, Lebanon's 'Al-Jadid' painted Amahaz as a naval officer, possibly linked to Hezbollah. Contrarily, Saudi 'Al-Arabiya' cited sources claiming he wasn't part of Lebanon's military ranks. The Lebanese National News Agency added more color, describing local accounts of an unidentified military force executing an amphibious landing. Armed and ready, they reportedly seized a Lebanese individual, whisked him to the beach, and vanished into the sea aboard motorboats. 'Al-Hadath' sources labeled the operation as an Israeli commando landing in Batroun. Initially, Lebanese Transport Minister Ali Hamieh dismissed these reports as internal disruptions. Yet, he later confirmed the capture, identifying the individual as a captain of civilian and commercial ships, corroborating the operation with a video, while security services conducted inquiries. Hamieh further commented on efforts to verify with UNIFIL whether the operation was coordinated with them, questioning the implementation of UN Resolution 1701. UNIFIL's deputy spokesperson, Kandice Ardiel, denied any involvement in the capture or sovereignty breach. Meanwhile, Israeli sources noted a significant uptick in strikes against Hezbollah's aerial unit over the past week. 'The road ahead is long, and it continues to challenge us, but we've shifted from defense to offense with the Air Force in this domain, and we will not relent,' they stated. This isn't the first instance of Israeli special forces making waves in enemy territories. Last September, 'Syrian Television,' an opposition outlet to Assad's regime based in Turkey, reported an Israeli raid in Masyaf, Hama, involving ground forces rappelling into action. The broadcast detailed skirmishes resulting in the deaths of three Syrians, with several others injured. Reports claimed that up to four Iranians were captured by Israeli forces, who executed the attack with drones, securing the area from external access.

Fearing a Trump win, Iran waits for US election results before st...	Iran delays retaliatory strike on Israel for US election results, fearing further regional chaos might bolster Trump’s campaign; Meanwhile, tensions rise as both sides prepare for potential post-election confrontations A week has passed since the Israeli strike in Iran, yet the full scale of the destruction at the Revolutionary Guards' bases continues to come to light. Despite Iran's efforts to downplay the events, new satellite images reveal significant damage to two buildings at the Khojir missile production complex near Tehran, which had recently undergone expansion. In tandem with Iran's claims of a 'weak attack,' Tehran's officials have issued frequent threats against Israel, promising a 'decisive and painful response.' However, reports about the timing of any retaliatory strike have been conflicting. Some suggest a response before the U.S. elections, while others indicate it might occur afterward, partly due to Iran's concern that further regional tension could bolster former President Donald Trump's election campaign. Today, the Washington Post cited a source close to the Israeli leadership, who claimed that current intelligence points to Iran preparing an attack on Israel in the coming days. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei stated that they would take whatever actions are necessary to confront political or military arrogance, emphasizing that the Iranian people and officials will never hesitate to confront the criminal mechanisms controlling the world order. He warned that enemies, particularly the U.S. and Israel, should expect a harsh response for their actions against Iran and the resistance front. Iran's Revolutionary Guards spokesman, Mohammad Ali Naeini, remarked that Israel believes Iran will not retaliate. He said the 'Zionists think Iran is reluctant to enter into a direct conflict and that the Iranian people are weary of resistance and unwilling to engage in war with Israel'. He added that the response to the Israeli strike against Iran is inevitable, definitive, and beyond what the enemy expects. Concurrently, the Pentagon announced an order to deploy additional forces to the Middle East, including ballistic missile destroyers, fighter squadrons, refueling aircraft, and several long-range B-52 bombers. These additional forces are expected to arrive in the region in the coming months, coinciding with the planned departure of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. This reinforcement comes against the backdrop of Iran's threats to strike Israel again, following the Israeli assault that disabled several air defense batteries and impacted Tehran's ballistic missile production. American officials, speaking to the Wall Street Journal, explained that the damage might delay the production of solid-fuel missiles by a year or more. Regarding the S-300 air defense systems, which were completely destroyed, a security source indicated that repairs or replacements could take several months. The Journal also noted that Israel's response remained within the 'red lines' defined by Washington. Over the past week, the U.S. has urged Iran not to launch an attack on Israel, with White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre making it clear that if Tehran decides to respond, the U.S. will stand by Israel and assist in its defense. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller also addressed the issue, stating he could not predict Iran's potential actions but said Tehran should not escalate the conflict. He did not respond to questions about whether Iran had communicated with Washington regarding a possible attack before the elections, saying he would not discuss communication between the two governments, whether real or imaginary. However, he underscored that Iran has been clearly informed not to escalate the conflict. Despite American appeals, the New York Times reported that Ayatollah Khamenei instructed the country's Supreme National Security Council to prepare for an attack against Israel. According to three informed Iranian sources, Khamenei made this decision after reviewing a detailed report from senior military commanders on the extent of the damage inflicted by the Israeli strike on Iran's missile production capabilities, air defense systems around Tehran, energy infrastructure, and a key southern port. The Times reported that Khamenei considered the scale of the Israeli strike and the number of casualties—at least four soldiers were killed—too significant to ignore, and he viewed inaction as an admission of defeat, according to the three sources. These sources spoke anonymously as they were not authorized to speak publicly. They added that military commanders are preparing a list of dozens of potential military targets within Israel. Earlier this week, satellite images also uncovered damage at the secret Parchin base, previously reported to have been used for nuclear development. Nuclear expert David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector, stated that other images, likely undisclosed, showed damage to a building that was part of Iran's nuclear weapons program. According to him and another researcher from the American research institute CNA, the images also depicted damage to facilities used for integrating solid fuel into missiles. Israel's strike in Iran, launched in response to the barrage of ballistic missiles from Iran at the beginning of last month, marked Israel's first-ever declared attack on Iran. Dozens of fighter jets were involved, significantly impairing the Islamic Republic's air defense network and its capability to produce ballistic missiles.

US-brokered Lebanon-Israel truce falters amid doubts over ‘unreal...	Lebanese sources anticipate escalation, with Parliament Speaker Berri accusing Netanyahu of rejecting US proposal; sources say proposal fell through after Israel insisted on enforcing agreement itself American efforts to halt fighting between Israel and Hezbollah have failed after the U.S. drafted an 'unrealistic' cease-fire proposal and Israel's insistence on being able to enforce a truce directly, people briefed on the diplomacy told Reuters. Meanwhile, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri claimed on Friday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a U.S.-backed proposal for a cease-fire with Hezbollah. 'The Israeli prime minister rejected Lebanon’s proposed roadmap, which was agreed upon with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein,' he said in an interview with the Arabic-language London-based newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. The newspaper further reported that 'political efforts to resolve the crisis have been postponed until after the U.S. elections.' Al Jazeera quoted a source close to Berri as saying, 'An agreement with Hochstein was reached in Beirut on provisions to be implemented within 60 days. These provisions include a complete cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, the deployment of the Lebanese Army to the southern border and the withdrawal of all unofficial military presence to north of the Litani River.' Lebanon’s Al Jadeed channel added that 'only after this will negotiations to resolve the issue begin.' With no workable proposal on the table ahead of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, the conflict could drag on for months, according to a Lebanese political source close to Hezbollah, two diplomats and a person briefed on the talks. They all spoke on condition of anonymity. The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not respond to questions from Reuters. Political sources in Lebanon told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television they anticipate a likely escalation in the coming days as talks stall, though U.S. officials have described the discussions as 'substantive and constructive.' The U.S. also emphasized that 'public negotiations' are not part of Washington’s approach to these discussions. According to a draft of the proposal reported by The Wall Street Journal, Israel would retain the right to conduct defensive strikes in Lebanon for 60 days to address 'imminent threats.' During this period, Israel would also oversee the implementation of the cease-fire and UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Lebanon War. The proposal calls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon within a week, after which the Lebanese Army would be deployed to dismantle Hezbollah’s military infrastructure in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government, however, reportedly rejected the proposal, claiming it grants Israel excessive latitude for cross-border operations. Lebanese officials noted they preferred to avoid publicly dismissing the proposal, as it leaves room for further negotiations that could eventually lead to an end to hostilities. In Israel, U.S. envoys Hochstein and Brett McGurk met with Israeli leaders, returning to the U.S. without a stop in Lebanon. Israeli officials dismissed claims that the lack of a Lebanon visit indicates stalled progress, saying, 'We never expected this to resolve in just a few days.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken remarked, 'We’ve made strides towards implementing Resolution 1701 as a foundation for a political agreement between Israel and Hezbollah.' When questioned on the matter by Reuters, State Department officials referred to Blinken’s comments. After the U.S. team’s visit, Israeli sources familiar with the negotiations described an understanding between Israel and the U.S., with Hochstein and McGurk set to brief President Joe Biden and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan upon their return to Washington before possibly heading to Lebanon to finalize the deal. 'The U.S. side document is crucial; it provides Israel the backing it needs to act if necessary,' an Israeli official said, adding that action is expected given likely violations until the Lebanese Army takes control. Meanwhile, Israel expressed pessimism over separate talks with Hamas for a hostage deal. According to sources, Hamas has demanded a complete end to the war, rejecting smaller-scale arrangements. 'This isn’t looking promising,' an Israeli official said, noting that mediators have not returned with an official response to avoid a total breakdown in talks. 'After the U.S. elections, we might see a creative approach. A victory by Harris could keep momentum going for a larger deal that ends the war.'

Arizona's top prosecutor, a Democrat, said on Friday that her office was investigating whether Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump violated state law for suggesting a prominent critic should face gunfire in combat. Trump has drawn outrage for comments he made about former lawmaker Liz Cheney at a campaign event in the battleground state of Arizona on Thursday. His campaign said the former president was criticizing Cheney as a warmonger, but critics condemned the remarks as evidence he would target his enemies if he wins next week's election against Democrat Kamala Harris. 'She's a radical war hawk,' Trump said of Cheney. 'Let's put her with a rifle standing there, with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.' Speaking to a local TV station on Friday, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said Trump might have violated state laws that prohibit death threats. 'I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona's laws,' Mayes told 12News. Mayes said it was not yet clear whether Trump's comment amounted to protected free speech or a criminal threat.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkfbdambje	2024-11-01T13:30:49-07:00	
Authorities launch probe into classified leak from Netanyahu’s in...	Security agencies focusing on spokesperson suspected of leaking manipulated Hamas documents to international media; despite lacking clearance, he joined sensitive talks; associates say he is a 'scapegoat' The investigation centers on suspicions of exposing sensitive intelligence and methods, potentially compromising Israeli military operations and strategic aims in Gaza. The leaks reportedly involve a former spokesman who, despite lacking full security clearance, regularly accompanied Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure meetings, including military briefings at the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. He is suspected of sharing classified information with the German newspaper Bild and other Israeli journalists, allegedly disclosing in September a document supposedly written by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The document purportedly detailed Hamas’ negotiation strategy with Israel, advising on how to manipulate the international community while aiming to rebuild military capabilities and intensify pressure on Israel. A parallel report in The Jewish Chronicle quoted another Hamas document, later deemed fraudulent, which claimed Hamas aimed to transfer hostages via the Philadelphi Corridor to Iran or Yemen. Within days of the publication of these reports, both Bild and The Jewish Chronicle faced backlash. IDF investigators determined the so-called 'Sinwar Document' had been manipulated, suggesting it was not authored by Sinwar himself, as initially reported. The Chronicle retracted its story after confirming that the cited document had no basis, and that the author’s name was fabricated. This revelation has prompted additional scrutiny of how seized Hamas materials were potentially altered to influence public opinion in Israel regarding the Gaza war. While Netanyahu’s office denied the detained individuals were officially employed, insiders confirmed the suspect maintained close ties to Netanyahu’s inner circle, conducting public relations and diplomatic assignments under the direction of Netanyahu's Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman. Despite failing an initial security clearance check, he continued to attend high-level discussions, reportedly acting as an ardent supporter and unofficial advisor. The classified leaks investigation has intensified tensions between Netanyahu’s office and Israel’s defense establishment, highlighting growing divisions over Gaza policy and hostage negotiations. Sources familiar with the case view the detained suspect as a 'scapegoat,' suggesting that other officials may have played larger roles in the series of leaks. In an ongoing security and legal effort, authorities continue to examine if senior officials might have indirectly sanctioned the unauthorized release of classified documents to foreign media.

Northern Command chief sustains minor in crash, resuming duties after hospital checks; Central Command head unharmed; IDF ground ops in Lebanon see increased road mishaps due to challenging terrain and steep inclines on supply routes The IDF reported Friday evening that a patrol vehicle carrying Northern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin and Central Command Chief Maj. Gen. Avi Blot overturned during an operational tour in Lebanon. Gordin sustained minor injuries, completed a series of medical checks and returned to duty, the military confirmed. The two commanders were visiting troops on the Lebanese side of the border, marking Blot’s first tour in Lebanon as Central Command forces under his command, including the 98th Division and Paratrooper Brigade, have been actively deployed across the border. Gordin was released from Ziv Medical Center in Safed in good condition and attended evening planning and operational briefings at a nearby command base. A few other soldiers were slightly injured in the accident, checked at the hospital and subsequently discharged. Over the past month of ground operations in southern Lebanon, numerous operational road accidents have occurred on newly opened supply routes near the border, designed to support logistics and transportation of supply convoys. In one instance, an IDF Humvee plunged down a short embankment in Lebanon, injuring a soldier who fractured his arm. The vehicle was recovered after a nighttime operation lasting several hours. Supply trucks have also faced challenges, with some toppling on steep, rugged terrain. Drivers navigate these newly cut, rough roads with night-vision equipment, often under blackout conditions to avoid detection by Hezbollah.

Armed group in Bolivia takes over military post in latest politic...	An armed group in Bolivia took over a military post outside the city of Cochabamba on Friday while taking some soldiers captive, the armed forces said in a statement, ramping up tensions in the already restive Andean nation. Cochabamba, located in central Bolivia, is home to many supporters of former President Evo Morales. The standoff over the military post, located about 100 miles (160 km) east of Cochabamba, marks the latest escalation in Bolivia's increasingly volatile and often violent politics. The military's statement described the armed group as 'irregular,' noting it had also taken control of firearms and ammunition, and stressed that such actions amounted to treason. It urged those responsible for the takeover to 'immediately and peacefully' abandon the facility.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy68iog11ye	2024-11-01T11:26:56-07:00

Iran braces for Trump victory, fearing more Israeli strikes, West...	Tehran faces diminished leverage if Trump wins Nov. 5 US election, fearing he could grant Israel green light to hit nuclear sites and finalize US-Saudi defense pact to shift regional balance of power Iran's leadership and allies are bracing for what they would regard as a dreadful outcome of the imminent U.S. presidential election: A return to power of Donald Trump. Opinion polls suggest the Republican Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris remain locked in a close contest. But Iranian leaders and their regional allies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen are concerned that Trump could well triumph on Nov. 5 and this could spell more trouble for them. Iran's main concern is the potential for Trump to empower Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites, conduct targeted assassinations and reimpose his 'maximum pressure policy' through heightened sanctions on their oil industry, according to Iranian, Arab and Western officials. They anticipate that Trump, who was president in 2017-21, will exert utmost pressure on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to cave in by accepting a nuclear containment deal on terms set by himself and Israel. This potential change in U.S. leadership could have far-reaching implications for the Middle East balance of power, and might reshape Iran's foreign policy and economic prospects. Analysts argue that whether the next U.S. administration is led by Harris or Trump, Iran will lack the leverage it once held - largely due to Israel's year-old military campaign aimed at degrading the Islamic Republic's armed proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. However, Trump's stance is perceived as more detrimental to Iran due to his more automatic support for Israel, they added. 'Trump will either put very tough conditions on Iran or let Israel carry out targeted strikes on its nuclear facilities. He is fully endorsing a military action against Iran,' Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Gulf Research Center think-tank, said. 'It's Netanyahu's dream day to have Trump back in the White House,' he told Reuters. Poison chalice? A senior Iranian official who declined to be named told Reuters Tehran was 'prepared for all scenarios. We have (for decades) consistently found ways to export oil, bypassing harsh U.S. sanctions..., and have strengthened our ties with the rest of the world no matter who was in the White House.' But another Iranian official said a Trump victory would be 'a nightmare. He will raise pressure on Iran to please Israel... make sure oil sanctions are fully enforced. If so, (our) establishment will be economically paralyzed.' In an election speech in October, Trump stated his unwillingness to go to war with Iran, but said Israel should 'hit the Iranian nuclear first and worry about the rest later', in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel on Oct. 1. Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Iranian military targets, especially missile production sites, on Oct. 26. Iran's choices are limited going forward, analysts say. 'The reality is: Trump is going to support Netanyahu and give him the green light to do whatever he wants,' said Hassan Hassan, an author and researcher on Islamic groups. 'Trump is much worse (than Harris) for Iran.' Hassan noted that Washington has delegated a substantial share of responsibility to Israel in the conflict with Iran and its proxies, with Israel leading the way. 'The U.S. is involved enough in that it's backing Israel, may be more so than before.' 'This time it's just things are really bad for Iran. Iran is seen as a problem by both Republicans and Democrats.' During her campaign, Harris called Iran a 'dangerous' and 'destabilizing' force in the Middle East and said the U.S. was committed to Israel's security. She said the U.S. would work with allies to disrupt Iran's 'aggressive behavior.' But Trump's re-election would be a 'poisoned chalice', for Khamenei, according to two regional officials. If he were to reinstate stringent sanctions, Khamenei may be forced to negotiate and accept a nuclear pact more favorable to U.S. and Israeli terms to preserve theocratic rule in Iran, which is facing growing foreign pressure and has been buffeted by bouts of mass protest at home in recent years. A U.S.-Saudi defense pact tied to Riyadh's establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, now in its final negotiating stages, poses a significant challenge to Khamenei too. This alliance threatens to shift the regional balance of power by creating a more unified front against Iran, impacting its geopolitical standing and strategy in the Middle East. New architecture Hassan said recent attacks on Iran and its allies have been widely perceived as a significant success for Israel. They offered insights into what a limited strike on Iran might look like, setting a precedent and altering assumptions that military action on Iran would inevitably spark a wider Middle East war. A senior Arab security official said that Tehran could 'no longer brandish its influence through its armed proxies' in the wake of Israel's deadly strikes on Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. For its own part, Iran has every reason to fear another Trump term. It was Trump who in 2018 unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and ordered the killing of Qassem Soleimani, Khamenei's right-hand man and mastermind of overseas attacks on U.S. and allied interests. Trump also imposed punitive sanctions targeting Iran's oil export revenues and international banking transactions, which led to extreme economic hardship and exacerbated public discontent in the Islamic Republic. He frequently said during his presidential campaign that President Joe Biden's policy of not rigorously enforcing oil export sanctions has weakened Washington and emboldened Tehran, allowing it to sell oil, accumulate cash and expand its nuclear pursuits and influence through armed militias. In March, he told Israel's Hayom newspaper in an interview that Iran could have a nuclear weapon in 35 days and that Israel - which deems Iran's nuclear activity an existential threat though is widely thought to have the region's only nuclear arms - was in a 'very treacherous and dangerous neighborhood'. An Arab government adviser noted that Tehran recognizes there is a 'new architecture in the making', but also that Trump despite his tough rhetoric realizes there is no alternative to a deal with Iran given its accelerated uranium enrichment program. 'Trump might aim for a new nuclear agreement, he could say I tore up the 2015 agreement because it was incomplete and replace it with a long-lasting agreement, touting it to 'make America great again' and preserve U.S. interests,' the adviser said. As the 2015 deal has eroded over the years, Iran has escalated the level of fissile purity in enriched uranium, cutting the time it would need to build an atom bomb if it chose to, though it denies wanting to. Iran Online, a state-run news website, stated that when Trump left office, Iran was capping enrichment at 3.67 percent under the deal, far below the 90 percent of weapons grade. Now, Iran has 'enriched uranium to 60% with IR-6 advanced centrifuges' and could achieve nuclear weapons capability 'within a few weeks ... Completing the nuclear deterrence cycle is Iran's greatest trump card against Trump,' it said. Arab and Western officials warn that the more Iran hints it is nearing development of an atomic bomb, the more they incite the need for Israel to strike. 'If Trump reassumes power, he will support Israeli plans to strike Iranian nuclear facilities,' a Western official said.

Report exposes failures in US universities' handling of antisemit...	US House report reveals major failures by top universities in addressing antisemitism on campus, describing 'environment hostile to Jewish students'; Harvard avoided calling Oct. 7 massacre 'violent,' and Columbia minimized ties with Tel Aviv U A new U.S. House of Representatives report reveals major lapses by leading American universities in addressing antisemitism and anti-Zionism on campus, presenting internal discussions on the issue for the first time. The 300-page report, compiled from over 400,000 documents, includes transcribed testimonies, document requests and subpoenaed statements. The House Education Committee noted that the incidents investigated serve as 'evidence of a broader environment on these campuses that is hostile to Jewish students,' violating the Civil Rights Act. Harvard’s response to October 7 protests The report highlights Harvard University’s handling of protests after October 7, showing that the administration initially drafted a statement condemning Hamas and expressing sympathy for hostages. However, then-president Claudine Gay and current president Alan Garber, who was then provost, requested the statement be softened, removing key references to hostages. Internal communications show Harvard’s leadership resisted stronger condemnation of Hamas, citing the 'complex' and 'deeply divided' nature of the issue. Harvard Medical School Dean Dr. George Q. Daley, for instance, opposed using the word 'violent' to describe Hamas’ attack, suggesting it might imply blame, preferring instead to 'express horror' over the ongoing violence, referencing IDF actions in Gaza. Garber, though initially opposed, ultimately agreed with Gay’s request amid concerns of faculty backlash, writing in an internal email that the stance would be 'crossing a line for many members of our community.' Additionally, current Harvard provost John Manning opposed including a passage on the toll hostage situations had on Harvard’s community, a draft that initially read, 'The violence hits all too close to home for many at Harvard. Some members of our community have lost family members and friends; some have been unable to reach loved ones, and others fear that their loved ones may have been taken hostage.' This section was removed after multiple professors concurred with Manning that mentioning hostages without balancing reference to Palestinian casualties would be inappropriate. Following public backlash over the muted statement, Harvard Corporation Board member Penny Pritzker wrote to Gay, calling the response 'massively inappropriate at the time and insufficient.' Pritzker urged Gay to denounce the use of the slogan 'From the River to the Sea' on campus, explaining it as 'clearly an anti Semitic sign which calls for the annihilation of the Jewish state and Jews' and further added, 'why we would tolerate that and not signage calling for Lynchings by the KKK.' Garber responded that the issue was 'not as simple as some of our friends would have it,' and Gay advised Pritzker not to label the phrase antisemitic publicly, suggesting it might 'prompt the question of what we're doing about it' Congress, notably, recently passed a resolution defining the phrase as antisemitic. The report further noted that students involved in disruptive protests on campus were not disciplined, a decision made consciously by the relevant committees, according to internal records. During testimony, Pritzker said that the Harvard Corporation found 'uneven enforcement' of rules around campus protests, an issue she called 'unacceptable' and still under review. Columbia University's handling of antisemitism A report has spotlighted Columbia University’s approach to issues of antisemitism and pro-Palestinian activism on campus, revealing internal communications and decisions among senior leadership. According to the report, then-president Minouche Shafik communicated with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who reportedly advised her that 'universities' political problems are really only among Republicans' and suggested the 'best strategy is to keep heads down' and avoid meeting with Republicans. Additionally, Columbia Board Chair David Greenwald and Trustee Jonathan Lavine expressed hope in private communications for a Democratic majority in Congress, anticipating it would halt further investigations into universities. In another internal exchange, Columbia Trustee Chair Claire Shipman dismissed Congressional criticism over campus antisemitism as 'capital [sic] hill nonsense' and pushed to reinstate anti-Israel groups suspended by the university, proposing events with anti-Israel professors to foster dialogue. Meanwhile, a senior figure in Columbia’s University Senate, responsible for coordinating with university leadership, was found to have supported pro-Palestinian demonstrators and suppressed pro-Israel voices. Although Columbia ultimately did not reach an agreement with leaders of an on-campus pro-Palestinian encampment, internal documents revealed potential concessions were considered. These included options to divest from Israeli-linked businesses, establish a joint program with a West Bank university, offer scholarships to Palestinian students and provide lenient disciplinary action for protest participants, as well as reactivating anti-Zionist student groups. The report also covered the case of an Israeli student who sprayed 'skunk spray' at a pro-Palestinian protest on campus. Columbia suspended the student, claiming he used an illegal chemical agent, but later agreed to pay him $395,000 in damages after confirming the spray was legally available for purchase. Further, the report criticized Shafik for ignoring complaints of discrimination from students in Columbia’s joint degree program with Tel Aviv University. The report notes that Shafik appeared to downplay the partnership, with a post celebrating the program's first graduating class removed from Columbia’s social media channels within hours. Overlooking calls to murder Israelis At the University of Pennsylvania, former Board Chair Scott Bok reportedly advised then-President Liz Magill to disregard pressure over the institution's response to antisemitism, dismissing political criticism as coming from voices 'easily purchased.' The report also alleges that UPenn leadership coordinated with a local media outlet to secure favorable coverage of Magill’s congressional testimony, portraying legislators’ questions as 'bullying and grandstanding.' At UCLA, the report details instructions given to campus police not to intervene as protesters set up a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus. School leaders allegedly refrained from intervention and even issued misleading communications to the university community about the encampment. At Rutgers University, a student who encouraged others to harm an Israeli peer was allowed to remain on campus during disciplinary proceedings and ultimately faced only a one-semester suspension. Meanwhile, several Jewish students received disciplinary action for publicly speaking out against antisemitism and filing formal complaints with authorities. The report also mentions a senior business professor at Northwestern University, Nour Kteily, who, during negotiations with a pro-Palestinian campus group, reportedly expressed hope for 'amazing wins' for the student protesters. Kteily, part of the administration’s negotiating team with the protesters and a member of Northwestern’s newly established anti-antisemitism task force, had previously criticized the need for such a task force. During talks, he reportedly proposed a campus boycott of Sabra products, made by Israeli food manufacturer Strauss Group.

Israeli ex-lawmaker claims Mossad ties in fight against extraditi...	Former Romanian MP Nati Meir, who previously served a prison term, detained in Rhodes at Bucharest’s request; Meir opposes extradition, alleging Romanian persecution over his Mossad ties Israeli national Nati Meir, a former Romanian parliamentarian detained this week in Rhodes, claims he previously served as a Mossad agent operating in Romania. Meir made this assertion in an affidavit to a Greek court in an attempt to prevent his extradition to Romania. Meir’s arrest in Rhodes follows an Interpol warrant issued by Romania, which alleges he fled the country in 2016 to evade an 11-year prison sentence for criminal fraud. Romania has formally requested his extradition from Greece. Meir’s attorney, Nir Yaslovitzh, filed a petition in Rhodes court opposing the extradition, calling it a 'witch hunt' by Romania despite Meir having served a five-year sentence. Yaslovitzh argues that Romanian authorities allowed Meir to leave the country and continue to persecute him without legal grounds. In his statement to the court, Meir explained, 'I was a Mossad agent sent to Romania, where I lived for 20 years from 1996 to 2016. I was elected to the Romanian Parliament in 2004, but shortly after my Mossad ties became apparent, a relentless campaign began to discredit me with false criminal charges, effectively ending my political career.' Yaslovitzh added that Romania’s pursuit of Meir reflects ongoing political persecution, citing a similar 2022 incident when Israel intervened to secure Meir's release from a Dubai detention. He called on Israel’s Foreign Ministry to help secure Meir's release once again. A Rhodes court will review Meir’s case next week.

At least nine injured, one seriously, in Galilee rocket attack	Emergency services paramedics arrive on scene in olive orchard in Arab town of Sha'ab where the rocket hit, injuring residents in the area The Hian Medical Services emergency service reported on Friday at least nine people were injured, one seriously, after a rocket landed in an olive orchard in Sha'ab located in the Galilee following a rocket barrage from Lebanon toward the area earlier. Magen David Adom Director Eli Bin added paramedics who arrived on the scene treated one individual in minor to moderate condition following the impact. According to the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, 'approximately 30 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israel. Some of the projectiles were intercepted and others fell in the area.' Hezbollah and Israel continue to trade blows amid the Gaza war, now ongoing for over a year, despite efforts by the U.S. to reach a diplomatic solution for a cease-fire. Officials familiar with the talks between U.S. President Joe Biden's Middle East envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials said on Thursday that the administration's envoys are expected to return to Israel to finalize a deal, after meeting Biden and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. 'More important than the agreement will be an American document that will authorize Israel to act,' they said. Jerusalem understands that there will most certainly be violations of the deal until the Lebanese military takes over responsibility for South Lebanon.

'The 2025 state budget will stand at approximately NIS 607.4 billion ($160 billion),' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said following the budget's approval. 'Alongside the budget, the government approved budgetary adjustment measures totaling approximately 37 billion shekels ($9.8 billion).' 'The current budget is a stabilizing one designed to serve the needs of the war and the major challenges facing the Israeli economy,' he added. 'It’s a war-supportive budget that also promotes growth: we’re offering reservists an additional care package worth 9 billion shekels ($2.4 billion) and a comprehensive recovery and development plan for the north amounting to approximately 15 billion shekels ($4 billion).' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu concluded the cabinet meeting, saying, 'I want to thank the finance minister, ministers and the office staff who worked very hard for this. We gathered to vote for an important, difficult budget but one that's essential in a wartime year.' Opposition Leader Yair Lapid sharply criticized the budget, saying, 'The Netanyahu government just passed a reckless budget. It’ll increase every Israeli family’s expense by 20,000 shekels ($5,300) a year, while simultaneously distributing billions to 10 unnecessary government ministries. They’ve lost all shame,' he wrote. National Unity party leader Benny Gantz added, '4.1 billion shekels ($1.1 billion) – that’s the amount the Israeli government just approved.' 'No, it’s not for reservists who experience the heavy load, not for active-duty soldiers, nor for evacuees from the north and south, nor for economic recovery after a significant hit, nor for at-risk populations, education or welfare. 4.1 billion shekels is for them — for the politicians. Whoever supported this budget will carry this shame for life. Shame on you,' he added. The marathon of discussions for the budget’s approval began on Thursday, with the scheduling designed by the Prime Minister's Office and the finance ministry to press ministers into ending discussions as the hours approached the early start of Shabbat. Consequently, disputes over certain budget items diminished, allowing most of the Finance Ministry’s proposed budget items to pass as written.

Akin to surrender': Lebanon denies US proposal for unilateral ce...	Top Lebanese diplomat says U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein asked Prime Minister Najib Mikati for a unilateral cease-fire with Israel to allow and advance deal with Hezbollah A U.S. envoy this week asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral cease-fire with Israel as part of an effort to help negotiations to reach a resolution for the more than year-long conflict, a senior Lebanese political source and a senior diplomat told Reuters on Friday. The sources say the effort was communicated by U.S. Lebanon Envoy Amos Hochstein to Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati. But such an announcement was seen as a non-starter in Lebanon, the sources say, where it would likely be equated with a surrender. In a statement to Reuters, Mikati’s office denies the claim and says the government’s stance was clear on seeking a ceasefire from both sides and the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last round of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden's Middle East envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, Mossad Director David Barnea and other senior Israeli officials. 'The two focused on efforts to secure a cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, allowing people on both sides of the Blue Line to return home safely, as well as new initiatives to secure the release of hostages which Hamas must address without delay,' an Israeli official said. 'We have made progress toward implementing Resolution 1701, which will serve as the basis for a political agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. It’s important to make sure we have clarity, both from Lebanon and from Israel, about what would be required under 1701 to get its effective implementation,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. A senior American official said that Thursday’s meetings in Israel were 'substantial and constructive, focusing on a range of issues in depth including Iran, Lebanon, Gaza and securing the hostages' release.' The Wall Street Journal also revealed on Thursday a draft of the pending agreement, which includes a clause allowing Israel to strike in Lebanon during a 60-day interim period in response to ' imminent threats.' According to the report, Israel would enforce the agreement and relevant UN resolutions, including UN Security Council Resolution 1701 which concluded the Second Lebanon War in 2006.

Israeli returns from dangerous trip to Afghanistan	Benny Wexler says he spent days without sleep ahead of his trip to the Taliban's home country, worrying he might be identified as Jewish Benny Wexler, a young ultra-Orthodox man, recently managed to reach Afghanistan’s capital of Kabul — a country controlled by the Taliban that has no diplomatic ties to Israel. 'It was the scariest and most challenging trip I’ve ever taken,' he recounted. 'To be at the mercy of the Taliban without minimal protection, I couldn’t sleep for weeks leading up to the trip.' Wexler, who owns a travel company, has already visited approximately 100 countries around the world, including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and others. He faced significant challenges obtaining a visa for Afghanistan, saying, 'It took us a very long time, with a lot of connections and favors.' 'My biggest fear,' he said, 'was entering the country with their strict inspections, passing dozens of Taliban checkpoints where we were repeatedly checked. The big concern was that they would discover we were Jewish, carrying tefillin and other items in Hebrew. We were advised to dress like locals to blend in.' To avoid having his tefillin discovered, Wexler packed them in a nondescript bag with Arabic writing from Dubai, planning to claim he bought them as souvenirs in a shop in Dubai selling antiques from around the world if questioned about them. He was also concerned about his phone, which contained Hebrew text. In Afghanistan, photographing passersby, especially Taliban members, is prohibited, with severe punishments for violations. Wexler also needed Taliban permission to tour Kabul. 'It was a complex process, involving meetings with various Taliban officials before finally obtaining clearance from the Taliban leadership, who showed us respect and even offered us tea and cookies.' His hotel was located directly across from the Iranian embassy. He described the rooms as very basic, had no air conditioning, malfunctioning showers and insects everywhere. One of the scariest moments of his trip took place at the hotel. 'While in the room, we thought no one could hear us and spoke in Hebrew,' he shared. 'The hotel owner overheard us, grew suspicious and started questioning us. We thankfully managed to get him to drop it after some effort.'

Rockets, drones and terror attacks: 88 Israelis killed in October	October marks the deadliest month in Israel's war in Gaza amid a ground operation in Lebanon, incessant rocket and drone strikes and deadly terror attacks Israel experienced one of its most challenging months since the beginning of the war in the month marking exactly one year since Hamas’ October 7 attack. Alongside impressive military actions, including the elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and the ground offensive in southern Lebanon, 88 civilians and soldiers were killed in October, marking it the deadliest month in 2024. November marks one month since IDF forces entered southern Lebanon, during which 37 soldiers have been killed in fighting there and along the northern border. Fighting in Gaza continues to take a heavy toll. Nineteen soldiers fell in combat over the past month and another soldier died in an operational accident near the border. Additionally, it was confirmed that captive Idan Shtivi was killed on October 7, 2023, and his body remains held in Gaza along with 101 other hostages — both alive and deceased. October was also marked by significant security incidents within Israel, with nine civilians, a police officer and a policewoman killed in terror attacks from Be'er Sheva to Hadera. The deadliest attack took place on the first day of the month when seven people were killed in a terror attack in Jaffa. Thirteen civilians were killed by rocket or shrapnel impacts in northern Israel, seven of whom were killed on Thursday in Metula and the Haifa Bay area within a matter of hours on the last day of the month. Six soldiers were killed by drone strikes, including four combat soldiers hit by a deadly UAV strike at the Golani Brigade Training Base.

IDF reports injured officer succumbs to wounds in hospital	Military confirms Captain Yarden Zakay, an officer in the Givati Brigade, succumbed to his injures after being severely wounded while fighting in Gaza The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported on Friday that Captain Yarden Zakay, 21, from Hadera, a Platoon Commander in the Shaked Battalion, Givati Brigade, succumbed to his injuries after being severely injured during combat in southern Gaza on September 17, 2024. Medical staff fought to save Zakay’s life for about a month and a half. Other soldiers fell in the same incident including Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff, Staff Sergeant Dotan Shimon, Staff Sergeant Amit Bakri and Staff Sergeant Agam Naim, who was the first female soldier to die while fighting in Gaza. Hadera Mayor Nir Ben Haim mourned Zakay’s loss on Friday, saying, 'After two months in which he continued fighting for his life and all of Israel prayed for his recovery, Yarden, our city’s son, is no longer with us. There are no words to comfort us; the entire city grieves.' As part of the 401st Armored Brigade operation, soldiers were conducting searches for weapons in a building in the Tel Sultan neighborhood. For reasons still under investigation, a deadly explosion occurred. A helicopter evacuated the wounded, including five soldiers in serious condition and two others in moderate condition, to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva.

IDF strikes 200 terror targets in Gaza and Lebanon in one day	Military spokesperson says troops eliminated terrorists alongside precise airstrikes on Hezbollah and Hamas military complexes The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Friday that the Israeli Air Force struck 'over 200 terror targets belonging to Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon,' throughout Thursday. According to the military, the targets included 'command and control centers, launchers and terrorist infrastructure sites.' 'Yesterday (Thursday), projectiles were fired from Lebanon toward the area of Haifa Bay in northern Israel. The IAF struck the launcher and the terrorist who fired the projectiles,' the IDF said in a statement. 'Over the past day, IDF troops continued their limited, localized, and targeted activity in southern Lebanon, eliminating terrorists, locating weapons, and dismantling terrorist infrastructure sites and launchers. Simultaneously, IDF operational activity continues throughout the Gaza Strip,' it added. The military also detailed the forces’ operation in the Gaza Strip, saying troops in Jabaliya 'eliminated dozens of terrorists from the air and ground and conducted targeted raids on military structures.' 'In central Gaza, the troops identified and eliminated several armed terrorists who were operating in the area. In the Rafah area, the troops identified terrorists operating within a military structure that had an underground tunnel shaft. The IAF then struck and eliminated the terrorists,' the IDF said.

Iraq tries to avoid regional fight as militias fire at Israel	Country is working to avoid being drawn into the growing regional conflict as Iran-backed terror groups launch attacks on Israel from Iraqi soil Nervously watching Israel's destructive campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon, Iraq is working to avoid being drawn into the growing regional conflict as Iran-backed terror groups launch attacks on Israel from Iraqi soil, sources familiar with the matter say. Two decades after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, Iraq is experiencing relative stability with high revenue from oil sales funding a service-based agenda that has turned much of the country into a construction site. Iraq does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani's government is wary of regional conflicts that could affect its delicate balancing act between Washington and Tehran, both states it is allied with. Axios reported late on Thursday that Israeli intelligence suggests Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days, possibly before the U.S. presidential election on November 5, citing two unidentified Israeli sources. There was no immediate Iraqi comment. Spillover from regional conflict has already resulted in months of tit-for-tat attacks between Iran-backed terror groups and U.S. forces stationed in Iraq and the region that only subsided after Iran intervened in February. Sudani's government has not been successful in a push to convince the Islamic Resistance in Iraq - a coalition of Iran-backed terror groups - to stop firing rockets and drones at Israel, according to four sources in Iran-backed terror groups and two government advisors. Two visits to Iran by Iraq's top security officials in the past two months, seeking Tehran's help to rein in its allied Iraqi factions, failed, the sources said. 'The Iraqi delegation received a cold reception in Tehran ... The answer was: those groups have their own decision and it is their call to decide how to support their brothers in Lebanon and Gaza,' said a senior Iraqi security official briefed on the visits. Baghdad turned to Washington, asking U.S. officials to intervene with Israel to prevent retaliation for the attacks, including one that killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded more than 20 on Oct. 4, the sources said, the first time such an attack has been reported to cause fatalities. 'Washington was understanding of the repercussions of possible Israeli strikes in Iraq and pledged to help,' said an Iraqi foreign ministry official. A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Baghdad did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Four militia sources said the Kataib Hezbollah and Nujaba groups, which are leading the attacks on Israel, have warned the prime minister against pressuring them to halt their actions and vowed to continue their attacks as long as Israel continued its Gaza and Lebanon operations. The issue has divided parties in Iraq's ruling coalition, all of whom are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and view Israel as an enemy, though some differ over how involved Iraq should be in the regional confrontation. Shi'ite leaders discussed the risk of repercussions from attacks on Israel and possible Israeli retaliation during two meetings in October, said Ahmed Kenani, a Shi'ite lawmaker from the ruling alliance. Key players in the Shi'ite coalition view direct confrontation with Israel as counterproductive and potentially damaging to Iraq, according to four Shi'ite lawmakers. 'Those groups who have the rockets and drones should go to Gaza and Lebanon to fight Israel rather than pushing Iraq towards destruction,' said Iraqi PM adviser Abdul Ameer Thuaiban. Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful of the terror factions, said Israel and the U.S. would have to pay a price for Israel's strikes on Iran last week. Senior Iraqi security sources said ahead of that attack that any strike by Israel against Iran outside what the sources called the established rules of engagement could prompt pro-Iran terror groups to significantly expand their attacks on Israel and U.S. assets in the region. Mohammed Shummary, chairman of Baghdad-based think tank the Sumeria Foundation, said growing regional conflict risked pulling Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim parties, many of them heavily armed, into a confrontation that few initially had appetite for. 'They are torn between maintaining their decision to keep Iraq out of the confrontation and their ideological and political commitments toward the Shia of Lebanon and the broader resistance axis, amid Israeli aggression that has crossed all permissible red lines,' he said. 'If the confrontation escalates ... this may not only mean the continuation of attacks on Israeli targets but also the potential involvement of additional factions in larger, more complex operations,' he said.

I was tempted by easy money': Court indicts Azerbaijani couple w...	Rafael Guliyev admits to charges against him but distances his wife from crime claiming she had no knowledge of it; suspects say they didn't wish to harm Israel's security Rafael Guliyev, 32, made aliyah to Israel with his family from Azerbaijan at age 7. During one of his visits to his homeland, he met Lala, 29, who joined him in Israel six months ago. The two married and now live together in Lod. The couple was caught at a hotel in Tel Aviv while surveilling a highly sensitive security facility for Iranian intelligence operatives. On Thursday, they were charged with gathering intelligence for Iran, facing serious security-related charges of aiding the enemy in wartime and providing information to the enemy with the intent to harm national security. In a hearing held at the Central Region District Court, the prosecution requested to remand the couple until the end of the legal proceedings against them. At the conclusion of the hearing, it was decided that the couple would remain in custody for at least 30 days until a further decision was made regarding their case. 'The respondents committed security offenses at a time when the State of Israel is engaged in one of its toughest wars, facing multiple fronts including Iran,' the prosecution said in its request. The indictment noted that individuals identifying themselves as Elshan and Hassan, acting on behalf of Iranian intelligence agencies, were involved in recruiting Israelis, including the couple, to carry out various tasks aimed at gathering intelligence for the Islamic Republic. The defendants were asked, among other things, to photograph the Mossad headquarters, take pictures of graves of those killed in the October 7 massacre and monitor an academic from the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) aiming to harm her. The Iranian handlers, one of whom had a prior acquaintance with the defendant’s family from Azerbaijan, assigned Guliyev a 'test mission.' According to the indictment, Elshan asked the defendant to photograph a tourism office located near the Moldovan embassy in Tel Aviv. Guliyev initially arrived near the German embassy, took photos there and only later reached the correct location sent by his handler, near the Moldovan embassy. The defendant received $400 for this photo. From that point on, the defendants were assigned numerous tasks, which Guliyev carried out either alone or with his wife, under the guidance of foreign agents. Among various assignments, the defendants were asked to photograph the graves of victims of the October 7 massacre at cemeteries in Petah Tikva, Kfar Saba, Jerusalem and Be'er Sheva. For these photos, the defendant was paid $1,200. He received $650 for each day of surveillance and photographing of Mossad headquarters. In total, the couple received approximately $26,000 in cryptocurrency from foreign agents. 'I don’t know what my husband did or why he took pictures without my understanding,' Lala Guliyev, who doesn’t speak Hebrew, claimed during her interrogation. However, investigators from the Israel Police’s special investigations unit Lahav 433 and the Shin Bet assert that she was fully aware of the purpose behind photographing security-sensitive sites across Israel and the source of the money they received for their actions. 'Today I understand that my actions could have harmed the country I love. I deeply regret it. I’ve been in this country for 25 years and I love it. I didn’t mean to harm the country; I was tempted by easy money,' the defendant said. 'I thought I could trick the Iranians and only took mock photos.' Guliyev admitted to receiving instructions from his Iranian handler. Regarding the request to photograph the graves of last year’s massacre victims, the defendant said, 'They insisted I take photos, even though I told them it was available online.' The defendant recounted that during one of his trips to Azerbaijan, a local businessman asked him to photograph offices for rent in Tel Aviv and Haifa, along with the views from them. He further shared that the businessman later connected him with another local, saying, 'He had an Iranian accent.' Guliyev revealed this individual overwhelmed him with requests to photograph sensitive sites in Israel. The investigation revealed that the Iranian intelligence handler was well-acquainted with Israel and its sensitive and strategic facilities. While the defendant admitted to taking the photos, he also said during his investigation, 'I thought I was smarter than the Iranian, so I didn’t photograph exactly what he asked for.' Later, the Iranian handler requested bolder actions, such as setting cars on fire. He also asked Guliyev, 'Do you have the courage to kill someone?' to which the defendant responded, 'I don’t.' Guliyev admitted in his interrogation that he recognized the handler as a hostile entity assigning him tasks, but claimed he didn’t believe his actions would harm the country. Investigators suspect that the handlers were involved in other cases leading to indictments against Israelis for espionage on behalf of Iran.

Officials optimistic Lebanon deal possible despite Hezbollah's re...	Biden envoys arrive in Israel to meet officials and discuss potential diplomatic agreement report says first draft will allow Israel to act in Lebanon for 60 days Officials familiar with the talks between U.S. President Joe Biden's Middle East envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials said on Thursday that the administration's envoys are expected to return to Israel to finalize a deal, after meeting Biden and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. 'More important than the agreement will be an American document that will authorize Israel to act,' they said. Jerusalem understands that there will most certainly be violations of the deal until the Lebanese military takes over responsibility for South Lebanon. Saudi outlet Al-Hadath reported the two will return directly to the U.S. from Israel, without visiting Lebanon. Israeli officials denied that this was an indication of a lack of progress. 'We didn't deceive ourselves into thinking this would be resolved today or within a few days,' they said. 'We have made progress toward implementing Resolution 1701, which will serve as the basis for a political agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. It’s important to make sure we have clarity, both from Lebanon and from Israel, about what would be required under 1701 to get its effective implementation,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. A senior American official said that Thursday’s meetings in Israel were 'substantial and constructive, focusing on a range of issues in depth including Iran, Lebanon, Gaza and securing the hostages' release.' McGurk and Hochstein met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, Mossad Director David Barnea and other senior Israeli officials. 'The two focused on efforts to secure a cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, allowing people on both sides of the Blue Line to return home safely, as well as new initiatives to secure the release of hostages which Hamas must address without delay,' the official added. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu made it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel's ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes,' the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement. Meanwhile, Al-Hadath cited Hezbollah sources saying the terror group refused to withdraw beyond the Litani River as part of the agreement. The Wall Street Journal also revealed on Thursday a draft of the pending agreement, which includes a clause allowing Israel to strike in Lebanon during a 60-day interim period in response to ' imminent threats.' According to the report, Israel would enforce the agreement and relevant UN resolutions, including UN Security Council Resolution 1701 which concluded the Second Lebanon War in 2006. The proposal was expected to face strong opposition from both Hezbollah and the Lebanese government due to concerns over violations of Lebanese sovereignty. As per the draft, Israel would need to withdraw its forces from Lebanon after a week, after which the Lebanese army would deploy in the country's south to help dismantle military infrastructure linked to Hezbollah and other militias. According to the journal, neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government has accepted the proposal, which they argue 'gives Israel too much leeway to continue attacking over the border,' according to Lebanese and Arab officials familiar with the talks. Lebanese officials said they were reluctant to reject the deal publicly as the document leaves room for continued negotiations that could ultimately bring the conflict to an end, according to Arab sources.

Iran's supreme leader's decision prompted by the extent of damage caused in Israel's strike on Iranian military targets, says failing to respond is admitting defeat; Netanyahu issues warning to Iran that nuclear sites could be targeted Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei gave the order to prepare for a strike on Israel, the New York Times reported on Thursday quoting three Iranian officials. According to the paper the decision was made after the leader was briefed on the extent of damage caused by Israel's strike on Iran last Saturday. Khamenei, they said was impressed by the number of casualties and the damage and said ignoring the results of the Israeli strike would be 'admitting defeat.' The officials said the strike would come after the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential elections so as not to help the Republican candidate Donald Trump's chances. Earlier Kamenei's senior aid Mohammad Mohammadi Golpayegani warned of a 'harsh and regretful' response to Israel's strike. 'The recent action of the Zionist regime in attacking parts of our country was a desperate move and the Islamic Republic of Iran will give it a harsh and regretful response,' the influential cleric, told the Tasnim news agency. He praised Iran's air defense performance in 'preventing the entry of the Zionist regime fighters into the territory' and said damage from the strikes was 'minimal.' The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Hossein Salami said Israel made a mistake and will see Iran's reaction that will 'surpass imagination.' He said Israel was wrong to believe it could change the balance of power in the region by launching a few missiles but saw how its air defenses failed during Iran's strike on October 1. During that attack, Iran launched some 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a clear message to Iran in a speech to the graduation ceremony of IDF cadets, saying Israel's primary goal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear capability, remains unchanged. 'The bravado of the Iranian regime cannot mask the simple fact that Israel today has a greater freedom to operate in Iran than ever before,' he said.

Berlin cops on hunt for suspect after he drops bag with explosive...	Man stopped for a routine document check takes off leaving his bag with triacetone triperoxide (TATP), same explosives used in ISIS Paris Bataclan attack; Berlin police says risk of a terror strike still in place German police are searching for a man who abandoned a bag of explosives at a Berlin train station and ran away after being stopped by federal officers, according to police. 'We are investigating all possibilities,' a police spokesperson told Reuters on Thursday, adding that authorities had not yet been able to identify the suspect. Police said they stopped the man in the German capital's Neukoelln station on Wednesday afternoon. He fled the scene and explosives were found in the bag he left behind, according to a post on social media platform X. The explosive found was triacetone triperoxide (TATP), often referred to as 'the mother of Satan' due to its prominent use in attacks, such as the Bataclan club bombing in Paris, in the shoe soles of Richard Reid and the planning of the Taylor Swift concert attacks in Vienna. The amount of explosive material and the charges found inside prompted police to alter protocol: rather than transporting the device to a designated disposal station, authorities evacuated passengers from the train station and transported the device to an open area. Firefighters then dug a pit for a controlled detonation of the material. The blast's echoes were heard hundreds of meters away. 'If the device had exploded in a crowded area, the consequences would’ve been dramatic,' a police officer told the BZ newspaper. 'The device was wired, indicating it was meant for use, not transit alone. This is an explosive that anyone could make in their kitchen from materials anyone can buy. Using such an explosive carries an extremely high risk. The explosive can detonate from any movement or change in weather. A major disaster was averted.' Police could neither confirm nor deny the report on the type of explosive.

Hamas entered UNRWA and took everything,' Gazan staffer says	IDF releases interrogation with UNRWA worker in Gaza describing how terror group operatives took over UNRWA facilities and vehicles and looted aid meant for civilians for their personal use The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Thursday released a video clip from the interrogation of a Gazan staffer of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees UNRWA who described how Hamas used the organization's facilities as their own. 'They see UNRWA vehicles as a form of protection,' he said. 'Hamas entered the place [UNRWA facilities] and took everything. Hamas is, after all, the government. They took it in their way (by force), it happened before everybody’s eyes. It’s no secret. Because they [UNRWA vehicles] have supplies, they started taking the supplies out of them and distributing them using private supply lines,' he said in his interrogation. On Tuesday, the Knesset voted to pass a bill banning UNRWA’s activities in Israel after employees of the agency took part in the Hamas massacre last year. The legislation caused the outrage of UN and international bodies. The law passed by a vote of 92-10. European Council President warned on Thursday that Israel's decision to ban the key U.N. aid agency for Gaza could result in the annulment of a deal establishing Israeli trade relations with Brussels. 'The decision made by parliament in Israel, if implemented, to ban UNRWA in Israel is absolutely not acceptable and I cannot imagine that there would be no consequences on the EU side,' Charles Michel told reporters in Geneva. 'I can observe that more and mo re voices, including at the political level, the highest political level of the EU, are considering that the time will come to put on the table the Association Agreement between Israel and the EU,' he said. The deal, which entered into force in 2000, provides the legal basis for trade between the two parties. An EU website showed that the EU is Israel's biggest trade partner, accounting for 28.8% of its trade in goods in 2022, while Israel is the EU's 25th biggest trade partner. Under the new law, UNRWA will not 'operate any institution, provide any service, or conduct any activity, whether directly or indirectly,' in the sovereign territory of Israel. In effect, UNRWA's activities in East Jerusalem will be terminated and the body's powers will be transferred to Israel's responsibility and control.

PM spokesperson given full access despite being denied security c...	Spokesperson closely allied to Netanyahu sits in on confidential meetings, calls with U.S. officials, enters secure sites; IDF probes leak of confidential material to press Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office allowed access to classified and sensitive information to a spokesperson who failed his security clearance review held by the Shin Bet, Ynet learned on Thursday. The spokesperson accompanied Netanyahu on visits to sensitive security facilities during the war, including the Air Force command bunker at the IDF’s Tel Aviv military headquarters and was even exposed to classified transcripts from meetings held by the Security Cabinet. According to sources close to the matter, the spokesperson was initially hired to work for Prime Minister’s Office’s Director General Yossi Shelley’s office. He was promoted at the request of Netanyahu’s Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman and left the Director General’s office to serve as a spokesperson in the 'Aquarium' — a nickname for the Prime Minister's office, one of the country's most sensitive facilities, dealing with security issues. For this role, he was required to receive a high-level security clearance. However, as reported by Israeli public broadcast channel Kan 11, the spokesperson failed the security screening. According to insiders, his position with the director general ended after this came to light, but he continued to act as a spokesperson on security issues despite not having clearance. After leaving the director general's staff, he was no longer a full-time employee but this didn’t prevent him from continuing to represent the prime minister on sensitive security matters. Throughout this period, he worked under Braverman and stayed in contact with Netanyahu’s various spokespeople. He was involved in sensitive political and security discussions, participated in consultations and even joined several security-related conference calls, including some with U.S. officials. Since his official employment at the Prime Minister’s Office ended on April 1, efforts were made to hire him as a paid external consultant, though no contract was finalized. In recent months, Netanyahu’s office has tried to officially hire him as an external consultant and pay him for his services. Ynet reported last month that the IDF was investigating how classified material was leaked to certain international publications for perceived political motivation. Senior officials close to Netanyahu on Wednesday distanced themselves from the spokesperson, who was known as close to the Prime Minister over the past year. Ynet couldn’t obtain his comment. The Shin Bet and the Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment on the matter.

Exiled cleric’s death likely to improve Turkish-US relations, ana...	Turkish justice minister said there were 256 extradition requests for people in the US that Ankara believes are members of Gülen’s network and there are still diplomatic disagreements over the handling of those suspected of being his followers The death of Pennsylvania-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen will likely improve Washington’s relations with Ankara, which had demanded his extradition over accusations he masterminded the 2016 coup attempt. The request for Gülen’s extradition was one of the largest challenges in relations between the US and its key NATO ally, Turkey. Ömer Özkizilcik, an Ankara-based non-residential fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the argument over his extradition was a source of distrust for Turkey, which believed that the US keeping him in the country was evidence that Washington was behind the putsch. 'This will most likely open the way for the new administration, whether it will be [US Vice President Kamala] Harris or [former US President Donald] Trump, to restart and rekindle the Turkish-American relations after the American election results,' he said. Suspicions of Gülen’s involvement in the putsch are widespread across the political spectrum in Turkey, and some of his strongest critics are also opposed to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Yusuf Can, an analyst at the Wilson Center’s Middle East program, agreed that pressure on ties between Turkey and the US could decrease due to Gülen’s passing. 'The impact of Gülen’s death is multifaceted. On the one hand, his death might ease tensions around his extradition, which has been a significant issue between Turkey and the US,' Can said. Turkey’s state news agency reported last year that the Turkish justice minister said there were 256 extradition requests for people in the US that Ankara believes are members of Gülen’s network and 483 in the European Union. Özkizilcik warned that, despite Gülen’s death, there would still be diplomatic disagreements over the handling of those suspected of being his followers. According to Özkizilcik, there would be internal disputes within Gülen’s network following his death, possibly weakening the group, and Ankara could use this time to try to get more of his followers and those suspected of being part of the coup attempt back to Turkey. 'They will definitely still be a topic, but these people will not be as pressuring and as high priority… as Gülen himself was,' he said, adding that if there is an improvement in relations between the US and Turkey, extradition requests will no longer harm those ties. 'This topic will remain. It will not go away, but it will not be as public as it was before. It will not be as pressuring as it was before, and it will be done more behind closed doors on a bureaucratic level rather than politically and in the public.' Can agreed that problems would remain between the two countries given that people linked to Gülen’s network were still in the US despite Turkey’s desire for extradition, but the prominence of the issue would likely decline. He stated that while Ankara would continue to seek people’s extradition, this issue would likely be used as leverage during negotiations, especially in cases where the US needs Turkey’s cooperation. On Monday, Kenya said it had accepted an extradition request from Turkey for four Turkish refugees, with some reports suggesting they had connections to the Gülen network. The government stated that it was assured these refugees would be treated in line with international law. Three days earlier, Amnesty International said it was alarmed and concerned about what it referred to as the individuals’ 'abductions' and that the incident broke international refugee law. The UNHCR told the AFP news agency that Kenya should 'abide by their international legal obligations and, in particular, to respect the principle of non-refoulement, which protects asylum-seekers and refugees from any measure that could lead to their removal to a place where their life or freedom would be threatened.' Özkizilcik said that Turkey could increase the number of such operations as Gülen’s network potentially weakens following his death. However, he did not expect these attempts to happen in the US or Europe. Can argued that the UN’s comments would not likely carry much weight for Ankara or substantially impact its policies. This is partly because of the international organization’s waning influence on the global stage. 'The AKP government has historically been dismissive of international criticism unless it leads to tangible negative consequences,' he said.

Negotiations continue despite Hamas rejecting partial	Terror group rejects proposals by Egypt and the U.S. to facilitate a partial hostage and cease-fire deal they hope would lead to a preeminent end to fighting in the Strip; Sources say talks still advancing behind the scenes Intense negotiations are ongoing to facilitate a hostage and cease-fire deal with Hamas despite the terror group's rejection of Egypt and the U.S.'s proposals, Ynet has learned. Hamas was now demanding guarantees before any 'small deal' that it will eventually lead to a halt in fighting and a full withdrawal. Senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu said in an interview that the terror group opposed a temporary cease-fire. 'The idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,' he told AFP. Meanwhile, the Hamas-affiliated Quds network revealed new details regarding proposals for a partial deal. According to the report, the Egyptian proposal involves a 10-day cease-fire, during which 150 aid trucks would enter Gaza daily, in exchange for the release of four hostages, including two women. The American proposal, according to sources cited by Quds, involves a 30-day cease-fire and the entry of 600 aid trucks per day in exchange for the release of all female and IDF soldier hostages. 'Both proposals concern a partial deal that doesn't end the war, nor does it include returning displaced residents to their homes or an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza,' the report added. 'All proposals are Israeli, based on Netanyahu's desire for a partial deal.' As mediators await Hamas's official response regarding its willingness to enter negotiations on a hostage deal based on the proposals presented at the Doha summit earlier this week, a source close to the talks in Qatar said on Wednesday that the terror group would be offered a cease-fire lasting 'less than a month.' The source added that discussions between Mossad chief David Barnea, CIA Director William Burns and Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani focused on a proposal for a several-week pause. The source noted that the proposal to be conveyed to Hamas includes the release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails and an increase in humanitarian aid delivery to the Strip. 'Senior U.S. officials believe that if a short-term agreement can be reached, it could lead to a more permanent agreement,' he added. Qatari officials are expected to meet with Hamas leaders in the coming days to relay the proposals from the Doha summit and check whether the terror group is willing to sit at the negotiation table for a smaller deal. In addition to the American and Egyptian plans, a Russian proposal is also on the table which involves the release of two hostages with dual citizenship.

Saudi-US bilateral accords 'not that connected' to Israel normali...	Country's foreign minister says 'moving ahead' with normalization efforts with Israel after negotiating with officials in Washington Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Thursday that some of the bilateral agreements the kingdom has been negotiating with Washington are 'not that tied' to the normalization of Saudi relations with Israel and are 'moving ahead'. Potential U.S.-Saudi agreements about trade and artificial intelligence are 'not tied to any third parties' and 'can progress probably quite quickly,' Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said on stage at an investment conference in the Saudi capital Riyadh. 'Some of the more significant defense cooperation agreements are much more complicated. We would certainly welcome an opportunity to finish them before the (end of the Biden) administration's term, but that's reliant on other factors outside of our control,' he said. 'The other work streams are not that connected, and some of them are progressing quite quickly, and we hope to see moving forward.' Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are looking into a set of agreements on nuclear energy, security and defense cooperation, which were originally all part of a wider normalization deal with Riyadh and Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden's aides originally envisioned, in three-way negotiations before the Oct. 7 attack, for Saudi Arabia to gain U.S. security commitments and U.S. nuclear cooperation in exchange for normalizing ties with Israel. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said in May that Washington and Riyadh were close to concluding a set of agreements but cautioned that for normalization to proceed there must be calm in Gaza and a path to Palestinian statehood. Prince Faisal on Thursday reiterated the kingdom's position that it would not recognize Israel without a Palestinian state, adding on that accord, Saudi Arabia is 'quite happy to wait until the situation is amenable,' before moving ahead with normalization.

Prime minister says Tehran's bravado cannot mask the fact that Israel now has the greatest freedom to operate in Iran; says the war in Gaza and Lebanon will continue until objectives are met, freeing hostages, preventing Hamas rule over Gaza, safety of Israelis in the north and south Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has not altered its intention to stop Iran's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons. speaking at a graduation ceremony for IDF officer cadets, he said Israel's ultimate objective was and remains to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear capabilities. 'The bravado of the Iranian regime cannot mask the simple fact that Israel today has a greater freedom to operate in Iran that ever before. After the IDF strike on Iranian military targets including air defenses on Saturday, and after the regime in Tehran first played down the severity of the damage caused in the attack, threats of retaliation have been increasing. CNN quoted a 'senior source' familiar with the Iranian discussions who said there will be a 'definitive and painful' response to Israel’s recent attack on its territory, likely before the U.S. presidential election on November 5. CNN did not specify where the source came from, but it is implied from his words that he is Iranian. 'The response of the Islamic Republic to the aggression of the Zionist regime will be definitive and painful,' said the source. The White House once again called upon Iran not to attack Israel. White House spokeswoman Karin Jean-Pierre was asked at a press briefing about a report about a possible attack and replied: Iran should not respond to Israel's retaliation. They should not. ... If they do, we will support Israel in defending itself, but they should not,' she said at a news briefing. In his speech, Netanyahu said there was no set date to end the war, only set objectives. he said until Hamas is removed from its rule over Gaza and cannot pose a threat to Israel, the war will continue. He said the objectives are victory and the return of the hostages. He said that the agreement under consideration to end the war in Lebanon must include the IDF's freedom to enforce measures vital for security and prevent Hezbollah from re-arming. 'Let me be clear, the documents, papers, proposals 1559, 1701, all those are not the issue. The issue is our ability and mostly our determination to enforce security,' he said. The prime minister said he greatly appreciated U.S. support adding that when possible he accepts Washington's demands and when necessary, he opposes them.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqch711wjl	2024-10-31T08:03:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/31/SJN11vQ1111kx/SJN11vQ1111kx_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Northern residents far from feeling safe: 'We won't return and be...	Despite IDF destroying key Hezbollah vantage point overlooking border towns, displaced residents hesitant to return; 'Residents won’t return until army clears everything to the Litani' For years, residents in Israel's Galilee Panhandle woke each morning to the sight of Hezbollah operatives watching them from a fortified concrete tower on the Hamamis Ridge—a symbol of constant danger. Over the past year, locals repeatedly called on Northern Command officers to remove the threat but were told the tower was controlled by the Lebanese military or UN forces. On Monday, the Israeli military destroyed the tower. 'The demolition of that tower has lifted another layer of fear for us,' said Nisan Zeevi, a resident of the evacuated Kibbutz Kfar Giladi, who has a permanent binocular station in his backyard to keep watch on the area. He gazed repeatedly at the remains of the tower, calling them a symbol of hope. 'That tower overlooked the entire Hula Valley, Kiryat Shmona and the fence-adjacent communities,' he described. Behind it lies the village of Khiam, where extensive terrorist infrastructure remains largely unaddressed. Amid reports of U.S.-pressured government talks to reach an agreement with Hezbollah and end the fighting, residents in Israel’s north are divided over what to make of the potential deal. 'We've learned not to react to every report but to see what the results bring,' said Zeevi. 'Taking down that tower is symbolic, but it's not the whole picture. Israel knows that to bring the northern residents back home, we need to decide if our goal has been achieved. No plan has been presented showing how to create real security here, let alone a sustainable economic or community vision for the area.' On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the home of Einat and Gideon Lev-Ari in the town of Metula was destroyed by Hezbollah shelling. Einat decided early in the war that she would not return to Metula as long as the tower overlooking the valley still stood. 'To me, it symbolized the existential threat and the neglect that allowed such a structure to exist here at all,' she explained. 'I understand that we’ll have to return to the land we worked on, but if the crisis of trust continues, we won’t be able to stay here.' Lev-Ari, however, welcomed the idea of a cease-fire agreement to end the war. 'I think the army has done an excellent job dismantling Hezbollah’s capabilities. Even after a deal, there will be hidden weapons and threats, but I hope the agreement includes a real buffer zone separating us from any Lebanese influence.' Prosper Azran, former mayor of Kiryat Shmona, has refused to leave his home since the outbreak of war. Even a rocket strike on the housing unit in his yard didn’t sway him. 'I don’t trust any deal that says foreigners will protect us,' he said angrily. 'After we’ve seen what’s happening in southern Lebanon, they tell us only 30% of the Radwan forces remain. Even 10% of them could do more damage than Hamas did in the south. We have to keep them on the run—there’s no peace with them.' For Azran, any agreement must guarantee 'an area no Arab can enter, where we don’t need permission to eliminate anyone who crosses into it.' Itzik Ben-Moha, chairman of the local council of Zar’it in Western Galilee, posted a sign at the entrance reading: 'Residents of Zar’it are not sitting ducks. We will not return without a demilitarized zone.' A year after they were evacuated from their homes, Zar’it residents declared that rumors of a deal wouldn’t make them pack up the lives they’ve built far from the Lebanese border. 'We made a community-wide decision: no one is going back, and we’re ready to launch a campaign to make the Israeli government understand that it’s us or Hezbollah,' Ben-Moha declared. 'The residents won’t return until all operations in southern Lebanon are completed, as we were promised until the army clears everything—to the Litani [River]. For years, they kept telling us there were no tunnels, and that everything was fine. The system misled the residents here. We now know the truth about the tunnels and the weapons caches they found—and there’s more of it in deeper areas. We appreciate what our soldiers have done so far, but it’s not enough. We won’t go back only to become another community under fire.'

Two dead in rocket strike north of Haifa	A woman in her 60s and a man in his 20s were the latest fatalities in Hezbollah fire since the morning hours at least one more man in his 70s was wounded; the terror group launched a barrage of 25 projectiles hours after missiles killed five in Metula. A woman in her 60s and a man in his 20s were killed in a rocket attack on the northern suburbs of Haifa on Thursday. Another man in his 70s was wounded in a barrage of some 25 projectiles. The victims were identified as members of the same family, from the Arab city of Shfar'am who were at their olive grove. The attack came hours after five people were killed when missiles struck the northern border town of Metula. This is the deadliest day of civilian casualties in the north since the war began. While Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli cities, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with American envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk in Jerusalem to discuss progress in the negotiations for a cease-fire on the Lebanese front. 'The prime minister told his guests that the main point is not the writer agreement but Israel's ability to enforce it and respond to any threat from Lebanon on its security, in a way that will bring the residents of the Galilee safely back home,' the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement.

Israel works to fortify settlements as West Bank reaches boiling ...	West Bank operations continue unabated, focusing on eastern border, Green Line crossings and Hamas recruitment efforts; following lessons from October 7, Israel bolsters forces and armed rapid-response teams to double firepower for sudden threats As negotiations for calm continue along Israel’s northern border and hostilities remain active in Gaza and southern Lebanon, IDF operations in the West Bank show no signs of slowing, even after heightened activity during the recent High Holiday period. Although recent weeks have seen fewer prolonged operations deep in refugee camps, aggressive counter-terrorism efforts persist. Overnight Thursday, IDF forces targeted and eliminated an armed terrorist cell in a preemptive airstrike on Tulkarm's Nur al-Shams refugee camp. Israeli security assessments highlight three key strategic areas contributing to regional security challenges: Arm smuggling on the eastern border: For months, the IDF and Shin Bet have warned of extensive arms smuggling along the porous Jordanian border, with terrorist groups attempting to bring sophisticated arms, including anti-tank missiles and military-grade explosives, into the West Bank. While the IDF recently announced plans to establish a specialized division focused on tightening security along this border, its operational start date remains uncertain. Green Line crossings: Movement across the Green Line into Israel and back into the West Bank is a key security concern, with authorities working to strengthen defenses at checkpoints. Despite these efforts, officials report significant quantities of smuggled ammunition—such as a recent seizure of thousands of 5.56mm rounds intended for West Bank terrorists. Regarding unauthorized workers, estimates indicate that about 70,000 Palestinian workers are present within Israel, around 40,000 of whom lack permits. Though the Security cabinet has avoided deciding on halting the entry of Palestinian workers during the ongoing war, far-right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir continue to oppose such discussions. Cross-Border terror coordination: Security officials report that Hamas is actively recruiting West Bank operatives from Lebanon, Syria and Gaza to carry out attacks. Known as 'external direction,' this coordination includes providing operatives with funding, often through intermediaries, such as electronics traders who receive funds from Hamas to purchase supplies, keep a portion and deliver the rest to West Bank contacts. Meanwhile, IDF West Bank Division is now focusing on securing major roads and settlements, reinforced in the wake of the October 7 attacks. Additional arms, equipment and personnel, including reservists and rapid-response teams, have been deployed to strengthen settlement defenses. In some areas, notably in Samaria in the northern West Bank, IDF bases have been relocated closer to communities. The objective is to double available firepower in case of sudden threats, giving forces time to hold positions until reinforcements arrive. The West Bank Division highlights the strategic importance of operating within refugee camps, where preserving freedom of movement for counter-terror efforts is key. 'The goal is to maintain and expand operational flexibility,' an IDF source explained, noting that frequent entry into camps reinforces the military’s deterrence and helps prevent armed resistance during arrests or security operations. 'To keep this freedom of action, I’m in Nur al-Shams every week,' he said, expressing concern over northern Samaria, where substantial funds and resources are fueling terrorism. Despite political actions that have destabilized the Palestinian Authority, Israel’s security agencies coordinate counter-terrorism with Palestinian security forces. While IDF officials emphasize they are not solely reliant on Palestinian forces, cooperation in certain areas does take place. The Palestinian Authority’s recent arrest of a terror cell in the Qalqilya area exemplifies this coordination. Security forces captured six suspects and a large cache of weapons intended for a major attack, including seven Carlo submachine guns, four M16 rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. However, while Palestinian forces work with Israeli counterparts, they typically avoid refugee camps, where the IDF has intensified operations. An IDF official noted that despite a relatively calm holiday period in the West Bank, the situation remains volatile, with a call among officials for larger-scale operations to seize arms, set up checkpoints and conduct broader arrests.

Ministries call to cut ties with Haaretz after publisher calls te...	Amos Schocken accuses Netanyahu government of enforcing 'cruel apartheid regime' on Palestinians; interior and communications ministries urg cutting all government ties with newspaper, suggesting halting services would 'ease public distress' Government officials called to terminate any ties with Haaretz newspaper after its publisher, Amos Schocken, called Palestinian terrorists 'freedom fighters.' On Wednesday evening, Interior Minister Moshe Arbel instructed his staff to effectively stop any collaboration with the daily, with the ministry's director-general issuing a formal letter to that effect. 'We cannot and will not remain silent in the face of harm to IDF soldiers and the state's efforts to protect its citizens,' the director wrote. During a Haaretz conference in London, Schocken criticized the Israeli government, claiming 'It dismisses the costs [to] both sides for defending the settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls 'terrorists.'' He further accused the Netanyahu government of 'imposing a cruel apartheid regime' on the Palestinian Arab population and usurping lands supposedly designated for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Schocken's comments generated significant backlash, particularly after labeling Israel's actions in 'the occupied territories and in part of Gaza' as a 'second Nakba,' using the Arab term meaning 'disaster' for Israel’s 1948 War of Independence. Schocken's remarks reached Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi, who proposed to the government that all dealings with Haaretz be halted. This includes ending government press office advertisements in the newspaper and prohibiting any governmental agency from communicating with Haaretz in any form. 'It is worth noting that Haaretz is generously funded by Israeli citizens through advertisements and subscriptions purchased by the government,' Karhi said. 'Halting the purchase of services from Haaretz by government bodies will ease the significant distress Israeli citizens feel, not only from the newspaper's publications but also from being compelled to fund it with their tax money. This approach will mitigate the harm to Israeli citizens without disproportionately infringing on freedom of expression. 'Israel's status as a buyer of advertisements and subscriptions from Haaretz is that of a party to a contract. This is not an administrative action, but rather a contractual decision subject to free will. By adopting its current line, Haaretz surely considered that this extreme position could alienate some of its clientele. The State of Israel is a customer of Haaretz.'

‘We are in the beginning of a third world war’	ILTV News interview with MK Sharren Haskel Israel and the West may be facing the early stages of a third world war—a clash not only against groups like Hamas and Hezbollah but one that pits radical Islam against Western civilization. 'This is a cultural and religious war, with Israel on the front lines,' MK Sharren Haskel told ILTV News in an exclusive interview for its new podcast last week. Haskel, known by some internationally as Israel's 'Minister of Hasbara' or public diplomacy, didn't hold back on what Israel's response to Iran might have looked like if she were prime minister. Over the weekend, the Israeli air force struck several Iranian military sites across multiple cities in response to a recent Iranian attack, which launched over 180 rockets toward civilian areas in Israel on October 1. Haskel said she would have prioritized targeting Iran's economic lifelines and nuclear reactors to prevent the country from achieving nuclear weapons. Analysts suggest that Israel's recent strikes might ease future actions against Iran. However, Israel refrained from hitting nuclear facilities, oil refineries, and other infrastructure at Washington's request. 'Imagine those missiles they sent toward Israel with nuclear warheads,' Haskel said. 'What would happen? Israel wouldn't exist.' She stressed that Iran operates through proxies worldwide, not just in the Middle East, while the international community 'chooses to completely ignore it.' 'You'll either fight them when they're small, with fewer casualties, or you'll face them when they have nuclear capabilities, with tens of thousands, if not millions, of victims,' Haskel warned. 'And it won't just be Israelis—it will be British soldiers, American troops, French forces, German forces.' On Monday, the Knesset was set to vote on two bills related to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). One bill would make it illegal for Israeli officials to cooperate with the organization, while the other aims to restrict UNRWA's operations in Jerusalem. Haskel founded the UNRWA caucus nine years ago when she entered the Knesset. Her goal was to develop an alternative for serving Gaza's population and Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, and East Jerusalem. Only after the October 7 massacre, when Israel uncovered direct ties between UNRWA and Hamas, did the country move to designate it a terrorist organization. According to Israel, around 10% of UNRWA employees are linked to Hamas. Haskel told ILTV that UNRWA provides services typically offered by a government, like education, healthcare, housing, and infrastructure. 'UNRWA even provided the street sweepers,' she said. 'Over the years, they let Hamas take over, manage, and run the organization, using it for their own purposes.' Israel has shown that Hamas was using UNRWA schools and other buildings to conceal terror infrastructure. Some of UNRWA's teachers and doctors were found to be directly linked to the October 7 attacks or involved in holding hostages. Now, Haskel is calling on Israel and the international community—including the Abraham Accords countries, Saudi Arabia, the European Union, and the United States—to replace UNRWA with a new program that offers similar services. She is also advocating for a comprehensive overhaul of the UNRWA education system, which she says promotes hatred toward Israel and Jews. 'If we want to change our future, it has to start with education,' Haskel said. 'One of the soldiers' Since October 7, Haskel has traveled around the world, speaking in parliaments across five continents and giving interviews to major media outlets. As head of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus, she has connected with parliamentarians who support Israel through their faith. By educating them about UNRWA and Israel's position, these allies can advocate for Israel among other lawmakers. She said that, beyond the physical war, Israel faces another battlefield in media and social media. 'For me, I feel with my position, I'm one of the soldiers to fight this fight for Israel,' Haskel said. 'Our family members are fighting on the front line, and my job is to fight those lies in the media and social media… and to tell [the world] about the real Israel.' Haskel believes that being a woman and a young mother of three children under four makes her relatable to the politicians and journalists she meets. Her fluent English also helps. Haskel lived in Australia for almost seven years, where she studied to become a veterinary nurse and worked at a clinic that rescues, treats and releases wildlife back into nature. 'It was a completely different life, and I loved it,' she admitted. 'But I made a conscious decision about where I want my life to be, where I want my kids to grow up, and to recognize the incredible miracle our country is.' She lamented that the government and other relevant bodies still don't coordinate well enough to effectively fight for Israel in the media and on social platforms. While she acknowledges it's better than in past operations, she feels there's still room for improvement. She also knows that the job is far bigger than her alone. Still, she believes every small victory matters. 'I have a responsibility,' she said. If I know I'm capable of doing this, I have to do it. It's part of my obligation.' Although she feels guilty about not always being home with her young children, she understands that her work is helping to build a safer Israel for them in the future. 'After October 7, I was shocked to my core,' Haskel admitted. She shared that she learned about year-old twins who watched as their mother was killed in front of them and were then left to cry for hours—set as a trap by Hamas. Anyone who heard their cries and entered would be ambushed. 'As Israeli mothers, we carry those tragedies and those horrifying stories,' Haskel said. 'I would go to my girls' room every few hours to check that they were okay during the night. I would sleep with my gun under my pillow, and every noise—a motorcycle or something else—would make me run to the window and look. This is our mission: to protect our babies, our children. And as a leader of this country, I have a responsibility to all of these children to make it safer, to make sure that something like that will never, ever, ever happen again.' She added, 'For that, many changes need to happen. I'm only one, but with God's help, this is going to be my life's mission: to make sure that Israel is safe and secure and that something like that will just never happen again to any Israeli child.' She stated that the war with Gaza cannot end until all the hostages come home. However, since the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month, she is more optimistic that this could happen. Haskel expressed hope that, in the end, Israel can still live in peace with its neighbors. 'If we work together, understanding how we need to resolve the problem and build a different future, I believe we can do that,' Haskel concluded. Although she acknowledged that, for now, Israel must stay in control of security in Gaza and at the border, she believes that in two or three generations, 'there could be a Palestinian leadership that will want to look after its people and that will be capable of doing that well.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj9m00alyg	2024-10-31T04:31:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/11/S1iWFogrS0/S1iWFogrS0_0_0_1558_878_0_small.jpg
Watchdog: ‘UNRWA’s existence violates UN charter’	ILTV News speaks with UN Watch’s legal advisor, Dina Rovner. The existence of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) violates the UN Charter 'because instead of promoting peace and security, it perpetuates conflict and war,' said UN Watch’s legal advisor, Dina Rovner. In an interview with ILTV News, Rovner argued that UNRWA 'perpetuates conflict and war' and poses a threat to the State of Israel and the safety of its citizens. She explained that Israel’s parliament, which voted earlier this week to ban UNRWA operations in Israel within 90 days, acted within its legal rights. 'UNRWA keeps Palestinians in perpetual refugeehood, giving them this dream that they have a right of return to sovereign Israeli territory,' Rovner concluded. 'We know what that looks like. We saw it on October 7.'

Should Israel sign a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah?	ILTV speaks with Sarit Zehavi, founder and president of the Alma Research and Education Center Will Hezbollah continue to threaten Israel's northern border residents if a ceasefire deal is reached in the coming days or weeks? This is the critical question security experts are examining before any agreements are finalized. Sarit Zehavi, founder and president of the Alma Research and Education Center, says it all hinges on whether Hezbollah can rearm and redeploy along the border. 'The only way to ensure this doesn’t happen is to implement an effective, military-level monitoring mechanism,' Zehavi noted, 'which would need to be deployed by Israel, the United States, or a capable international entity.' Furthermore, she emphasized the global community must press Lebanon to alter Hezbollah’s status within its borders. 'Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization worldwide, yet in Lebanon, it is recognized as a legitimate political party that participates in government decision-making,' Zehavi said. 'This is unprecedented. As long as this remains the case, I don’t believe we will see real change in Israel’s north or Lebanon’s south.'

FBI offers $5 million reward for tips in 30-year-old suspected mu...	Thirty years after the bombing of Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901, which killed 21 passengers and crew—mostly Jews, including four Israelis—the FBI has released photos of three suspects believed to be tied to Hezbollah Thirty years after a mysterious midair explosion killed four Israelis, the United States has announced a $5 million reward for any information that could lead to an arrest or conviction in the bombing of Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901, which officials believe was carried out by Hezbollah. On July 19, 1994, Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901 took off from Colón Airport in Panama, headed for Panama City. The routine 15-minute flight soon entered the annals of aviation's greatest unsolved mysteries. The small plane was carrying 21 passengers, most from the local Jewish community, including four Israeli citizens—Rani Gabay, Jaica Rascovsky Yaker, Joseph Gershon and Moshe Pardo. Just minutes after takeoff, a powerful explosion ripped through the plane, tearing the metal shell of the aircraft over the Panamanian jungle and killing everyone on board. Aviation investigators quickly concluded that the blast was caused by a bomb, but the circumstances surrounding the bombing remain unknown. Many believed it was a targeted terror attack against the Jewish community, especially given the timing: just one day earlier, an attack on the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires killed 85 people and injured more than 300. The Argentine attack, later classified as a Hezbollah-led terror act, left a deep scar on the Jewish community in Argentina and worldwide. The close timing of the two events led to suspicions that they were coordinated attacks by the same group, prompting intelligence agencies and relevant governments, including Israel, to pursue justice. Days after the attacks, a Lebanon-based group calling itself 'Ansar Allah' claimed responsibility. U.S. authorities later identified the group as a Hezbollah alias. The prime suspect was Ali Hawa Jamal, the only passenger whose body was never claimed. U.S. intelligence, which joined the investigation after three Americans were confirmed among the dead, later found evidence linking Jamal to the bomb. According to a Panamanian government report, Jamal had scouted the flight path and noted it frequently carried Jewish passengers. He allegedly carried out the attack after several trips, during which he tested the security measures. After the bombing, Panamanian authorities reported that they had identified a local Hezbollah terror cell suspected of orchestrating the attack but were unable to make any arrests. In 2018, 24 years after the explosion, then-Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela called for a reopening of the investigation based on new information from Israeli intelligence, which he said confirmed the event as a terrorist attack. Varela also asked Israel and the FBI to aid in the effort. He noted that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had written to him, saying, 'I lost my roommate and a senior member of the Jewish community in Panama to a Hezbollah terrorist attack.' Now, the U.S. has renewed international efforts to seek justice with its generous reward, hoping to bring those responsible to trial. The FBI, whose announcement was also released in Hebrew, included photos of three men believed to have assisted Jamal. According to the FBI, the suspects were known to travel among Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Lebanon and were in contact with known arms smugglers. The American investigation also revealed that, before the attack, a man believed to be Jamal used a stolen U.S. credit card to rent a car in Panama City. The next day, he contacted the agency again to rent a second vehicle, a 4x4 jeep. Both rentals were paid for with the stolen credit card, and the vehicles were later found abandoned near the airport. The FBI believes that the same man may have used the credit card to purchase a two-way Motorola phone system, which Jamal was later seen carrying aboard the flight. Family members of the victims, many of whom have no grave to visit, welcomed the renewed U.S. efforts with hope and gratitude. Anna Karina Smith-Kane, granddaughter of one of the victims, expressed thanks to the U.S. government, saying, 'This is a powerful message that our tragedy has not been forgotten. It’s a day engraved in our memory as an ongoing pain—and the reward reminds us that the fight for justice continues.'

Weiss faces charges of contact with a foreign agent, providing intelligence to an enemy and obstruction of justice. According to the indictment, Weiss recorded the scientist’s home and vehicle using a GoPro camera, which the agent later forwarded to an East Jerusalem resident assigned to carry out the attack. Weiss also allegedly set vehicles on fire, sprayed graffiti and distributed hundreds of flyers calling for civil unrest. Charges against the East Jerusalem suspect were filed last week.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1u00z0e11yl	2024-10-31T01:50:15-07:00

Israeli couple charged with espionage for Iran after allegedly ta...	Rafael and Lala Guliyev of Lod allegedly spied on security sites and prominent security think tank employee, marked by Iran for harm; pair reportedly began working with Iranian agents in 2021, photographing key sites, including Mossad headquarters Israeli authorities have arrested a couple from Lod suspected of conducting espionage activities on behalf of Iran, the Shin Bet security agency and police announced Thursday morning in a joint statement. According to officials, Rafael and Lala Guliyev allegedly carried out intelligence-gathering operations on security and national infrastructure sites, as well as a prominent scholar. Authorities report that the academic was 'marked for physical harm.' An indictment was filed Thursday against the couple, both 32 and originally from the Caucasus region, on charges of aiding an enemy in war and relaying information with intent to compromise national security. The prosecution has requested that the couple be remanded to custody throughout the legal proceedings. Court filings reveal that the couple allegedly began coordinating with two Iranian agents in 2021, gathering intelligence on strategic sites and sending still photographs and video footage via encrypted messaging apps. Among the sites photographed were the Mossad headquarters, the Moldovan Consulate in Tel Aviv, key points around the Glilot area, Israel’s Electric Corporation, Haifa Port, public shelters in Tel Aviv, graves of victims of the October 7 Hamas attack and a factory where one of the suspects worked. The pair allegedly transmitted this information to their handlers using secure communication to avoid detection. The indictment also states that Rafael Guliyev was instructed to recruit additional operatives to establish a covert network. Furthermore, he is accused of surveilling a scholar affiliated with the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), a prominent security think tank, whose identity remains undisclosed, photographing her residence and vehicle over hours of observation. According to Shin Bet and the police, the Iranians intended to inflict harm on the scholar, with Guliyev reportedly receiving $600 daily for these surveillance activities. Throughout the assignment, Guliyev allegedly maintained contact with his handlers, receiving additional funds periodically. The indictment states that the couple received approximately $26,000 in total for their efforts. The investigation led by Shin Bet, the National Unit for International Crimes and the police’s cyber unit exposed the alleged Iranian-backed network, which aimed to recruit individuals from the Caucasus community in Israel. Rafael Guliyev was reportedly recruited by an Israeli citizen of Azerbaijani origin, identified as 56-year-old Elshan Aghayev, who acted as an intermediary for Iranian intelligence. According to Shin Bet, Guliyev was tasked with finding an assassin on behalf of his Iranian handlers. INSS expressed gratitude to Shin Bet for uncovering the plot, with INSS director Maj. Gen. (res.) Tamir Hayman stating that the center's analysts remain targeted by Iran due to the institute’s role as Israel’s leading security research center. Although INSS operates independently of the defense establishment, Hayman noted the institution’s ongoing communication with security agencies. Thursday's indictment is the latest in a wave of espionage cases exposed by authorities in recent weeks involving Israeli citizens allegedly working on behalf of Tehran. Police officials reaffirmed their commitment to neutralizing threats to Israeli citizens and pursuing legal measures against those cooperating with hostile entities. Last week, seven individuals from northern Israel were indicted for allegedly collecting intelligence on military bases for Iranian operatives during the current war. A senior Shin Bet official noted earlier this month that Tehran is systematically attempting to harm prominent figures in Israel, including scientists, municipal leaders and defense officials. Authorities stressed that stringent punitive measures are critical for deterrence, advocating administrative and economic sanctions, including potential citizenship revocation and asset seizures, for Israeli citizens who collaborate with Iran.

Not on our watch': IDF destroys Hezbollah terror command center ...	The entire village was a staging ground; we found weaponry and evidence of terror operations in almost every house,' says soldier involved in operation The IDF announced Wednesday that it had completed a large-scale demolition operation targeting southern Lebanon’s Matmoura, located close to Israel’s northern border near Kibbutz Adamit and the village of Arab al-Aramshe in the Western Galilee. The operation was led by the 5067th Engineering Battalion, part of the 646th Brigade under the 146th Division, and marked the culmination of an intensive brigade-level exercise in the sector. According to an IDF soldier involved, the village functioned as a Hezbollah 'terror hub,' where caches of weapons and ammunition were found in nearly every building. 'The entire village was a staging ground; we found weaponry and evidence of terror operations in almost every house,' he reported. Footage released by the IDF shows 466th Battalion Commander Lt. Col. (res.) Nimrod Ziv addressing troops, saying, 'After a year of war on the southern front, in the West Bank and now in Lebanon, we, the reservist paratroopers of the 646th Brigade’s 446th Battalion, destroy this Hezbollah staging ground. We will not allow the enemy to threaten our freedom in this country on our watch. We honor those who sacrificed everything, and we will continue to fight forever and defend our land.' The IDF’s operations last week led to the discovery of underground bunkers designed for Hezbollah’s elite Radwan forces, with long-term living supplies, military gear and ammunition. Among the equipment seized were combat vests packed with grenades, full ammunition magazines, tactical helmets, winter gear, rocket launchers and advanced night vision systems. Several weapons reportedly bore markings linking them to sources in Moscow, Russia. Lt. Col. Shushan, who previously led tours in the village, explained, 'Even in our emergency depots, we don’t have the level of readiness we found here in this small Sunni village.' He added that heavily fortified combat positions were constructed by Hezbollah mere feet from the border. 'They had dug trenches and planted mines, intending to breach the wall along the border and infiltrate Israel in civilian clothing to strike quickly,' he said. The IDF emphasized that this operation is part of a broader mission to neutralize Hezbollah’s offensive capabilities near the border, aiming to restore security and assure the safety of Israel’s northern residents.

North Korea said it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday, upgrading what it called the 'world's most powerful strategic weapon', as Seoul warned Pyongyang could get missile technology from Russia to help with the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was on hand and said the test was a warning to enemies that have been threatening the country's security, KCNA state news agency said. 'The test-fire is an appropriate military action that fully meets the purpose of informing the rivals, who have intentionally escalated the regional situation and posed a threat to the security of our Republic recently, of our counteraction will,' Kim was quoted as saying by KCNA. The muscle-flexing comes amid a storm of international condemnation and rising alarm over what the U.S. and others say is North Korea's deployment of 11,000 troops to Russia - 3,000 of them close to the western frontlines with Ukraine. The launch drew swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1xkfcgwyx	2024-10-30T21:14:24-07:00

Trump courts Muslim voters: 'I will stop the suffering and destru...	Trump who has already pledged to end the wars in Gaza and the north, continues to court support from the Arab and Muslim communities, especially in Michigan – a key state that could decide the election With just six days remaining until the U.S. presidential election, Republican candidate Donald Trump has once again ramped up his appeals to Arab and Muslim voters. In a post on X, Trump declared that if he returns to the White House, he will put an end to the 'suffering and destruction in Lebanon.' His words add to recent statements he’s made, promising to end the war in Gaza if elected. 'During my Administration, we had peace in the Middle East, and we will have peace again very soon! I will fix the problems caused by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon. I want to see the Middle East return to real peace, a lasting peace, and we will get it done properly so it doesn’t repeat itself every 5 or 10 years!' 'I will preserve the equal partnership among all Lebanese communities. Your friends and family in Lebanon deserve to live in peace, prosperity, and harmony with their neighbors, and that can only happen with peace and stability in the Middle East. I look forward to working with the Lebanese community living in the United States of America to ensure the safety and security of the great people of Lebanon. Vote Trump for Peace!' While Trump hasn’t explicitly stated he would force Israel to halt its actions in Gaza and Lebanon, his increasing promises to end the war, along with his often unpredictable nature, may be causing some concern in Jerusalem over how Israeli interests would fare if he defeats Harris next week. Harris, meanwhile, has repeatedly reaffirmed her commitment to Israel’s security and to continuing financial and military aid. Over the past six months, she has called consistently for an end to the Gaza conflict. Still, based on past experience, the expectation was that Trump would offer Israel far more leeway. Trump raised eyebrows earlier this year when he praised Hezbollah as a 'smart organization' and when he said that Israel should end the war in Gaza because it was causing it image damage. On the other hand, he repeatedly accused Biden and Harris of not giving Israel sufficient support, and said that it is better for Hamas that the Israeli hostages return home before he returns to the White House. Trump explains: 'The Arabs in Michigan want peace' Arab and Muslim voters in the U.S. - like Jewish voters - tend to vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, who are seen in their eyes as those who will better protect the rights of minorities and immigrants. However, in the current election campaign, certain shifts are noticeable against the backdrop of the war in the Middle East: On the Jewish side, more people are considering voting for Trump instead of Harris due to the feeling that the Democratic Party is distancing itself from Israel and not doing enough to stop the wave of antisemitism in the U.S., including on campuses; And on the Arab and Muslim side there are quite a few who intend to refrain from giving their vote to Harris , in protest of her 'assistance to the genocide in Gaza,' as they see it. Even if only a few percent in each of the communities change their voting patterns, in an election campaign as close as the one currently underway, this may have dramatic consequences. At a rally he held this weekend in Michigan, Trump raised a sword in the battle for the Muslim voice, when he hosted on stage those he presented as 'prominent leaders in the Muslim community of Michigan.' 'I'm thrilled to have the support of these rather respectable leaders,' Trump said as he invited them to the stage, and later stated that Arab and Muslim voters 'could swing the election one way or the other.' 'We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace – he promises peace, not war,' Imam Bilal Alzuhairi said. 'We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine.' 'And I think this man can make it happen. I personally believe there's a reason why God saved his life twice,' the imam said, referring to the two assassination attempts from which Trump survived. Trump at his rally on Saturday claimed that 'Jews, Catholics, evangelicals, Mormons, Muslims are joining our cause in larger numbers than ever before and now the most wonderful thing is happening.' 'The Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East. That’s all they want,' Trump said.

Key Hamas operative killed in Tulkarem in West Bank	The Shin Bet, the Israel Police and the IDF said in a joint statement that the terrorist operative who was killed in the West Bank town of Tulkarm on Wednesday night was Hassam Malach, 'a key operative in the Hamas infrastructure in the area, who was involved in planning imminent attacks.' It was also reported that Malach worked to promote terrorist attacks together with Aslam Odeh, who was killed on October 26 in an operation in Tulkarm, and Zahi Ofi, who was killed in an airstrike in Tulkarm on October 3, and was responsible for planning significant attacks that were to be carried out on the first anniversary of the October 7 massacre.

Report: Iran will attack Israel, likely before US election	Now that extent of damage caused by Israel is known, 'senior source' claims to CNN that Iran will attack Israel in a 'definitive and painful' response even before the U.S. presidential elections; White House warns: 'Iran should not respond' A 'senior source' familiar with the Iranian discussions, told CNN Wednesday night that there will be a 'definitive and painful' response to Israel’s recent attack on its territory, likely before the U.S. presidential election on November 5. CNN did not specify where the source came from, but it is implied from his words that he is Iranian. 'The response of the Islamic Republic to the aggression of the Zionist regime will be definitive and painful,' said the source. In the first days after the attack in Iran, which took place overnight between Friday and Saturday, Iran tried to minimize and downplay the damage caused to the country's military infrastructure. In Tehran they even claimed that the IDF's announcements after the attack, which said that it was successful and its goals were achieved , constitute 'psychological warfare.' The elections in the United States will be held this Tuesday - November 5 - so if the source's words are to be believed, Iran may attack Israel in less than a week. An Israeli official responded to this Wednesday , and issued a warning: 'If they give a response - they will receive back double.' Knesset member Avigdor Liberman called on the political and military ranks 'not to wait until the Iranians carry out their threats,' and added: 'We must move from waiting for a preemptive strike, from a proportional response to a clear decision. On October 26, we proved our ability, and now the order of the day is to exercise this ability in full force '. The White House once again called upon Iran not to attack Israel. White House spokeswoman Karin Jean-Pierre was asked at a press briefing about a report about a possible attack and replied: Iran should not respond to Israel's retaliation. They should not. ... If they do, we will support Israel in defending itself, but they should not,' she said at a news briefing. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller also addressed the issue. He said that he could not give an assessment regarding what Iran might do, but he also noted that Iran 'doesn't need to respond.' He did not answer when asked if Iran had conveyed a message to Washington regarding a possible attack before the elections, saying that 'I will not talk about the communication between the two governments, whether it is real or imaginary. But as we have stated publicly, and Iran clearly knows this, they must not escalate this conflict.' Israel estimated shortly after the attack that Iran would respond - but it was not clear how. At the same time, the Israeli attacks targeted, among other things, missile production facilities, and the air defense batteries that protect Tehran were damaged, so that Iran remains exposed to future attacks. The report on the escalation in Iranian rhetoric comes following the publication by the Associated Press, which on Tuesday revealed new satellite images from Iran, which indicate damage to another site in the Israeli attack - damage that the regime in Tehran has not reported so far. The photos show damage to several buildings at the Shahrud Space Center in the north of the country. The center, which is located about 370 km northeast of Tehran, is managed by the Revolutionary Guards, from which they launch satellites into space, but according to the AP it is also used by the Revolutionary Guards to manufacture ballistic missiles. Iran publicly admitted that the attack caused damage to sites in the Tehran area and in the provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan in the west of the country, but it did not report any damage at all in Samnan. Experts emphasized that it is not possible to absolutely determine that the damage to the site was not caused by another reason, but they noted that the photos from before the attack did not show any damage to the site. The Planet Labs satellite images taken Tuesday show a 'central' structure in the center was destroyed, with only its skeleton left standing. Near it are seen vehicles, probably belonging to Iranian officials who were sent to examine the extent of the damage. In a previous photo taken in March of this year, the building can be seen before it was destroyed, with a high blue roof. On Wednesday morning, Iran's Minister of Defense, Aziz Nasir Zadeh, issued several statements about the attack and threats: 'There was no disruption in the pace of missile production,' he claimed, noting that 'Iran can launch dozens of counterattacks such as 'The Real Promise' (the Iranian name for the two attacks carried out in Israel) We will respond to any attack on our lands, even if it is a single bullet.' In addition, an Iranian lawmaker attributed the following quotes to Zada, which appeared, among others, in the 'Tehran Times' and include another threat: 'When the airspace is violated, the country has the right to respond to any act of aggression. Even if the Zionist regime fires an arrow at our country, Iran will not forgive That's how you will respond.' The minister later claimed that 'no fighter jet entered Iran during the Israeli attack. Israel's latest aggression caused partial damage - and it was repaired immediately.' The 'Days of Repentance' operation , conducted in response to the barrage of ballistic missiles on Israel from Iran at the beginning of the month, was Israel's first ever declared attack on Iran. Dozens of fighter jets participated in the attack, which significantly damaged - according to foreign reports and also according to the official Israeli statements - the air defense system of the Islamic Republic and its ability to produce ballistic missiles. In the days after the attack, senior Iranian officials stated that Tehran reserved the right to respond 'at the appropriate time' to the attack, and several of them, including Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami, promised 'painful revenge.' At the same time, and despite various reports on the extent of the damage, Tehran is careful to claim that the results of the attack were limited and that the damage from them will be repaired quickly, in a way that was interpreted internationally, at least until Wednesday evening, as a possible attempt to 'contain' the attack. The final decision on a retaliatory attack will be made by Supreme leader Ali Khamenei - with the estimate that he also prefers to avoid an all-out war. A few days ago, Khamenei himself issued a non-committal statement regarding revenge: 'Israel made a miscalculation and must understand the will of the Iranian people,' he said. 'Israel's step should not be exaggerated - nor should it be underestimated.'

'After landing, it took me a moment to process and understand the full impact of what I’d done. Gaza is here; Lebanon is somewhat distant, but Iran — it's far, and we’re not normally there.' 'The Air Force has been preparing for the eastern front for at least 20 years, as long as I can remember,' Maj. N. says. 'It's constantly on our radar. It's no secret that Iran is a relevant theater, always distant and unreachable, somewhere off in the distance. But we got there.' In 119 Squadron, based at Ramon Airbase, the team meticulously prepared for the mission. 'We were all here during the holiday,' shared Maj. Anael from the base’s control tower. 'On Friday, we started the day early with more drills and preparations, briefing soldiers with our commanders. We make sure to maintain unity beforehand, talking together about what we’re doing here, especially with the maneuvering and knowing we have hostages. I have a close friend, Omer Wenkert, who was abducted,' she added (Wenket was abducted from the Re’im festival to Gaza). 'Each time a plane takes off, I think of him and our friends fighting, and how we’re protecting them from above.' 'Dad doesn't come back saying, 'I bombed Iran'' Maj. N. woke up to sirens in Jerusalem on the morning of October 7. By 8 a.m., he’d decided to head to the squadron, and by early afternoon he was already in the skies over Gaza. 'The initial situation then and now is completely different,' he reflects. 'What happened surrounds all of us. We’re here around the clock. In the days leading up to the strike, we focused mainly on preparations: ground scenarios, studying the terrain and the air models, including scenarios and responses. We sit and think about what it means if there are surprises – in the plane, the systems, or the field itself. 'Of course, it crosses your mind – what happens if things don't go as planned. But once airborne there’s this heightened focus, and nothing else enters your mind. It’s full of data, figuring out how to execute the mission, and what to do at each stage. It’s an enormous privilege. We know it’s a historic event, that we're doing something unprecedented at this scale. From the moment you cross that flight line into enemy territory, all your senses sharpen. The alertness stays at that heightened level until we’re back in our country’s borders. Until you’re home, you’re alert, razor-sharp. After crossing back, you allow yourself to relax. Once we land, we gather information from our fellow squad members, realize it was a successful event, and there’s a great sense of satisfaction.' Maj. N., married with five children, didn’t tell his family the details of that night. 'My wife hears the same news we all consume, so she can put two and two together. My family and friends understood quickly. They’d read about the increased intensity, the talk of things to come. My wife isn’t fazed by the distance I fly; it’s part of serving in the Air Force. Dad doesn’t come home saying, ‘I bombed Iran.’ They know enough. The kids are happy and proud.' 'You feel a sense of duty as you take care of the skies' 'Most of our flights are operational. But a mission toward Iran is something different,' Maj. Anael explained. 'There are specific forms indicating the aircraft's destination. It’s knowing they’re going on a different mission. Just hearing that plane take off… and not everything always goes smoothly. We have to keep a safe and functional base for every departing plane and every plane returning safely. It’s very moving to say, ‘Cleared for takeoff,’ and send those planes so far away. We see where they’re heading, and we feel responsible for following them – who’s landing, who’s taking off, and how to take care of the skies. The feeling of knowing the planes completed the mission is incredible. It’s knowing we’re part of something historic. When we learned they’d launched and completed the offensive action, our pulse quickened, because it’s the riskiest moment for the pilots, seeing what the ‘red side’ has planned.' 'The night didn’t end with the strike – it continued long after that,' she added. Maj. R., head of the munitions division, shared his perspective: 'The moment it ends, and everyone’s landed, we’re just waiting for the next mission. If you’d asked me a year ago if something like this would happen, I wouldn’t have believed it. In those first days of the war, we were in shock, not expecting this. The feelings were intense and stay with us. Some of the scenarios we prepared for — the reality has outpaced them all. I didn’t anticipate we’d reach where we have, but I trust the people and the machines. When it’s over, there’s a sigh of relief, and then you wait for the next mission. I feel the people of Israel are united. Our mission is to bring the hostages back, and that’s what drives our work.' 'I’ll always remember the moon that night — it was a brilliant crescent, shining and rising just as we flew deep, illuminating the pitch-black night,' recalls Maj. S., a combat pilot, speaking of the moment he flew over enemy skies. He came to Israel as a lone soldier and was part of Operation Days of Repentance against Iran. As a combat pilot, he keeps his focus short-term, always thinking ahead to the next sortie. But what doesn’t fade is the commitment to bring the hostages home and return civilians to their homes, whether in the north or Gaza perimeter. 'My family knows I was part of the attack, but the exact details — I still can’t share. It’s tough from a distance, and even for those whose parents are here, it’s difficult to talk about our experiences and what we’re doing. Here, I decided to share, and it’s very empowering. My parents were incredibly moved and proud,' he said. 'We know how to strike far and under significant threats' Maj. S. explained that, as a combat pilot, he has trained for such moments. 'We were trained to strike deep in enemy territory. I know how to reach faraway countries under numerous threats. These are capabilities we trained for even before October 7. In the days leading up to the mission, the excitement grew, and there was a little pressure, too. The peak came just before takeoff. It comes from knowing the importance and meaning of what we're about to do, understanding how many people are counting on us. The squadron commander assigned me to the mission and trained me for it. In the end, it’s me carrying it out, and it has meaning for every citizen in the country. They might not know I’m the one executing it, but a single mission has strategic importance,' he said. 'I believe the point isn’t just the specific target but that we’re delivering weaponry into Iran and showing them we have the capability. Look, we’ve reached you; we’re responding, we’re here. And on this mission, we dealt them a significant blow. It’s less about the target than the operation itself — I’m placing munitions on Iranian soil.' Despite the excitement and pressure, he says it dissipates once in the air. 'The moment I power up the engines on the ground and take off,' Maj. N. explained, 'my body and mind go on autopilot. I’m skilled enough not to feel it, and the plane will do what’s required. I’ll always remember the moon that night. It was a brilliant, crescent moon, rising exactly as we flew deep, lighting the surrounding area and allowing me to see in a very dark night. I’m trained enough to separate emotions from actions in real time, making decisions quickly by working purely logically. After landing, it took me a moment to process and understand the full impact of what I’d done.' 'This wasn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last that I put myself at risk in a combat mission,' he said. 'Even in more routine sorties during the war, I take risks. And if the enemy does its job well, there’s a chance I’ll be hit. It’s a fear I understand every time I take off. The best thing I can do is not think about it– fly fast, fly well, and if something happens, respond optimally. Because it was such a critical mission, we took risks – I knew there was a chance I’d be hit, but we had ample time to prepare for nearly every contingency, a 'what if' response. If the worst should happen, I’m mentally prepared and know what steps to take in each moment.' Despite the historic nature of the mission, he says he keeps his focus on the next assignment. 'The moment I land, the focus is on debriefing and preparing for the next mission, and the next mission is always important. Even after returning from the strike in Iran, I flew several missions afterward, each with a different character and creating different feelings. The only things that don’t fade from memory are the commitment and importance of bringing the hostages home and returning our residents to their homes —whether in the north or the Gaza perimeter. We’re committed, and we can’t stop until everyone is back —every hostage, every resident.'

Iran intends to respond to the extensive Israeli attack on its territory, a source familiar with the discussions in the Islamic Republic told CNN, noting that 'the reaction against the Zionist regime will be absolute and painful.' It was also reported that Iran will probably respond in the coming week, before the U.S. elections on November 5.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rysqlme11ke	2024-10-30T13:36:23-07:00	
Lebanese PM hopes for cease-fire soon, but process could take tim...	Najib Mikati ready to deploy Lebanese troops to south of country with wtihdrawal of Israeli troops; Says Hezbollah 'was late to sever the connection between the Gaza and Lebanon fronts'; White House: 'There are many reports and drafts circulating' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Wednesday evening that he hopes a cease-fire with Israel will be signed ' within the coming hours or days.' He expressed 'cautious' optimism, adding: 'We are doing our best.' According to him, Hezbollah 'was late to sever the connection between the Gaza and Lebanon fronts' and now demands that Lebanese army forces be deployed in the south of the country with the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Mikati also stated that Lebanon will no longer agree to receive aircraft assistance from Iran or Iraq, after Israel threatened to attack Iranian aircraft transporting military equipment to Beirut. 'We don't want to expose Beirut airport to danger,' he said. 'If Iran or Iraq want to help us it will be via the sea.' He added that he is not in contact with any official from Hezbollah, and that he received the message about the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah while he was in treatment in the U.S. Mikati made the statements after a conversation with President Joe Biden's envoy to Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, who together U.S. Mideast envoy Brett McGurk, is currently traveling to Israel. The two envoys will hold a series of meetings in Israel at a critical point in time, to discuss the overall regional picture. On the agenda is a possible cease-fire in Lebanon, as well as a hostage deal and cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, and the desire to prevent Iran from attacking Israel. National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said on Wednesday night of a potential deal for a cease-fire in Lebanon that 'there are many reports and drafts circulating. They do not reflect the current state of the negotiations.' The discussions in Israel will focus on three directions. The first is preparations for a possible attack by Iran against Israel in response to the Israeli attack last week. The commander of the U.S. Central Command, General Michael Kurilla will be in Israel over the weekend for talks with senior IDF officials to discuss Israel's defense in the event of an Iranian attack. Both Israel and the U.S. do not know what Iran will do and think that the issue of the Iranian attack is still open. The Iranians are still in the process of trying to understand what happened in the Israeli attack and are realizing day by day that it was very significant. The more the Iranians understand and internalize that they have something to lose if they attack, the more likely that they will drop the response option. Despite this, no one - neither in Israel nor in the U.S., knows what the Iranians will actually do in the end, but they understand that they must be prepared for every possibility, both defensively and offensively. The second focus of the discussions will be on Lebanon. In recent weeks, there has been an intensive dialogue between Israel and the United States on the current hostilities. The two countries have reached an agreement on what a cease-fire settlement will look like, how the political outline is shaped, and how to enter into it. The fact that Hochstein and McGurk are coming to the region indicates that there is an understanding between Israel and the U.S. that they are moving in the direction of the diplomatic path. Despite this, it is important to emphasize that, as far as Israel is concerned, a final agreement with Lebanon has not yet been reached, and the intention is to enter into an accelerated process that will last several weeks until an agreement is reached. On the other hand, Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri said that he has reached agreements with Hochstein - and that he expects the American envoy to reach these same agreements with Netanyahu as well. According to him, the agreements are related to the cease-fire, the deployment of the South Lebanese army and the implementation of resolution 1701, without changes. 'The ball is now in Netanyahu's court,' he said. 'If he shows willingness to continue the understandings with Hochstein or turn against them.' In the meantime, the IDF still has time to act in southern Lebanon and complete the dismantling of the terrorist infrastructure. Sources privy to the details say that what is happening now reflects a feeling that the time has come to translate the military achievements into a political path that will soon allow the residents to return to their homes. In principle, Israel and the US want to work on a mechanism that will be much stronger than Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war and required Lebanese troops to withdraw to south of the Litani River - a mechanism that will never be fully implemented. The intention is also not to base it on UNIFIL, which is worthless and has no weight. In the discussions, there is talk of a significant enforcement mechanism, along with the addition of a principle that gives Israel freedom of action to enforce violations. Still, Berri claimed Wednesday that 'we are not ready to change even one letter in Resolution 1701.' Also on wednesday, the U.S. State Department spokesman said that the U.S. supports Israel's right to go after legitimate Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, when asked about the eastern city of Baalbek being bombarded by Israel. But Matthew Miller told reporters at a regular news briefing that Israel must do so in a way that does not threaten the lives of civilians and it was critical civilian infrastructure and significant cultural heritage sites can be protected. 'We have made clear that the campaign they are conducting in Lebanon should not, cannot, must not look like the campaign that they have conducted in Gaza. We do not want to see that type of widespread damage,' Miller said when asked about Baalbek at a regular news briefing. The third discussion is about the kidnap deal. The talks for a cease-fire in Lebanon are not really related to the hostages, but there is an indirect connection. In Israel there is a belief that the talks on Lebanon can advance a hostage deal, because Hamas has been betting that a regional war will break out and stop Israel in Gaza. A hostage deal with Hamas in Gaza that would come with a temporary cease-fire would help reach a settlement in Lebanon, but now Lebanon no longer ties itself to Gaza and an agreement with it could help reach an agreement in the south. Behind the scenes there is also a U.S. preoccupation with the humanitarian issue in Gaza, while in the background there is disappointment among the Americans about the legislation in the Knesset against the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. The Americans understand that UNRWA is a failed and rotten organization, but their fear is that it will harm the humanitarian effort.

French court rules Israel can participate in Paris Euronaval exhi...	Paris Commercial Court ruled against President Emmanuel Macron and the French government, allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Euronaval exhibition The Paris Commercial Court ruled Wednesday in favor of a petition by the Manufacturers Association of Israel, Israel Shipyards and the France-Israel Chamber of Commerce, allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Euronaval maritime defense exhibition, set to take place in Paris in early November. The judge’s decision effectively overturns a previous ruling by French President Emmanuel Macron, the French government, and event organizers to bar Israeli companies from the exhibition — a move the court deemed inconsistent with the European Union’s free-market principles and in violation of equality and non-discrimination policies. Foreign Minister Israel Katz welcomed the decision, saying, 'Congratulations to the Israeli petitioners on their victory against the undemocratic and unjust decision by President Macron to exclude Israeli companies from the exhibition. This success, achieved in part through legal and diplomatic efforts by the Foreign Ministry, is a win for justice and a clear statement against attempts to weaken Israel in its struggle against forces of evil.' Ron Tomer, president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel, added: 'The court made clear that political-based discrimination in business has no place in the international market. Israeli industry will continue to be open to global business and lead in innovation and advanced technology. No government or organizing body will hold us back, and if attempts like this arise in the future, we will make it known that ‘Made in Israel’ will proudly stand at international exhibitions and conferences. This is a victory for the State of Israel and Israeli businesses, reaffirming that all are bound by the principles of equality and fair trade to which we are committed.' Despite the limited time left until the exhibition begins, Israel Shipyards will manage to set up its booth. Eitan Zucker, CEO of Israel Shipyards, praised the ruling, noting it would allow the company to showcase some of the world’s most advanced naval vessels made in Israel. However, he also urged caution for policymakers. 'While the court ruled in our favor, we must remember that France effectively imposed a security embargo on Israel by trying to block Israeli companies from the exhibition. This should serve as a wake-up call for Israeli decision-makers to recognize, as we have seen in other instances during the war, that Israel must not be dependent on other countries. We need to rely on our own high-level capabilities and the strength of Israel’s defense industry, especially when it comes to key platforms,' he said. The petition, filed through the French law firm GKA, argued that France’s decision violated EU principles of equality and fair trade, which require member states to maintain open, competitive and non-discriminatory markets. The petition emphasized the EU’s obligation to uphold fair, unbiased trade practices, ensuring that Israeli companies can participate and compete in the European defense market.

German lawyers ask court to block ship allegedly carrying explosi...	Human rights lawyers have filed a court appeal in Berlin seeking to block a 150-metric-ton shipment of military-grade explosives aboard German cargo ship MV Kathrin which they say is to be delivered to Israel's biggest defense contractor. The European Legal Support Center (ELSC) said on Wednesday the action was filed on behalf of three Palestinians from Gaza, arguing that the shipment of primarily RDX explosives could be used in munitions for Israel's war in Gaza, potentially contributing to alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Israel denies accusations that it has committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Germany-based Lubeca Marine, which owns the MV Kathrin, said the ship 'was never scheduled to make any port calls in Israel' and had recently discharged its cargo in Bar, Montenegro. The ELSC said the RDX shipment was destined for Israeli Military Industries, a division of Elbit Systems, Israel's largest defense contractor. Elbit Systems declined to comment.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r19zvblzkg	2024-10-30T11:23:47-07:00

I will preserve the equal partnership among all Lebanese communities. Your friends and family in Lebanon deserve to live in peace, prosperity, and harmony with their neighbors, and that can only happen with peace and stability in the Middle East.

Lifting Iran sanctions, threatening to censure Israel enabled Gaz...	In his new book, 'One Jewish State', former US ambassador to Israel appeals to country’s political left, arguing that Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank offers the best solution for Palestinian welfare and regional stability The road to October 7 began when President Joe Biden entered the White House, according to former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Friedman said that if President Donald Trump had still been in office, Israel would not have experienced the deadly attacks and would have achieved more regional alliances through additional Abraham Accords. 'When we left office, Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy,' Friedman, who served under Trump, said. 'Qasem Soleimani, who had been their chief architect of terror, had been eliminated by the United States, imposing great fear and concern on the part of the mullahs. And then Biden comes in.' Friedman criticized Biden for stopping the enforcement of sanctions on countries that trade with Iran, known as secondary sanctions. 'Iran began to sell oil in large amounts to China, to Russia, two of America’s greatest adversaries. Large, specific amounts. There was like a $6 billion gift here, a $10 billion gift there. That seemed to make no sense,' he said. 'So what happened to Iran? Iran more than doubled its GDP in a couple of years by about $200 billion.' He said that Iran used that money to fund its many proxy groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, which are now engaged in a multifront war with Israel. Under a Trump Administration, Friedman said, Iran would not have had the funds to prop up the various proxy groups. He also said that Trump would have continued the momentum of the Abraham Accords, the historic US-brokered agreement normalizing relations between Israel and four Arab nations. 'I think we needed about six months more in our administration to get the Saudis on our side,' Friedman said. He added that Indonesia and 'some of the secondary Gulf nations' were also primed to achieve normalization with Israel. Saudi Arabia, which once seemed to be on the cusp of normalizing relations with Israel, recently held military exercises with Iran. Friedman said that Saudi Arabia would stop cooperating with Iran if Trump is elected and it becomes clear that the US is 'a partner that can push back against Iranian malign activity.' 'What people need to understand about the Abraham Accords is it wasn’t about showing these countries that we could move away from Israel. It was about showing these countries how closely we were aligned with Israel. That’s what made Israel the most attractive partner to the Gulf, that they were rock-solid aligned with the United States,' he explained, noting that once the U.S. relationship with Israel appeared less secure, alliance with Israel became less attractive to Gulf states. Once the U.S. relationship with Israel appeared less secure, alliance with Israel became less attractive to Gulf states Friedman’s book 'Sledgehammer: How Breaking with the Past Brought Peace to the Middle East' was published before the October 7, 2023 attacks. Friedman said that many of the predictions he made in his book came true on October 7. 'What I thought then, and I think what’s been proven to be the case, is that the US-Israel alliance, at its strongest, is the fulcrum upon which you can then expand peace throughout the Middle East,' he said. As it weakens, those opportunities not only become less, but the potential for malign activity and mischief becomes greater.' Biden’s strategy for the Middle East involved showing countries other than Israel that the U.S. was committed to 'equal measures of peace, prosperity, dignity' throughout the entire region, Friedman said. 'They use that phrase, ‘equal measures,’ all the time,' he continued. 'No. No. Israel is the single most important ally of the United States in the Middle East.' He said that broadcasting the centrality of Israel as the US’s ally in the Middle East would increase the chances of peace in the region. Senator Lindsey Graham has pushed for achieving normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel during the Biden Administration. 'I would love to see the details,' Friedman said of Graham’s plan. 'It’s hard to comment on something which is just, at this point, aspirational.' Democrats also recently urged a probe into Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and former White House aide, alleging that he had acted as an agent of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Friedman described that allegation as 'complete nonsense.' 'Anything Jared Kushner does in that field is done for the good of America, with the support of America,' he said. 'And I hope that he continues what he’s doing, because he developed levels of credibility with Saudi Arabia, with the Emirates, with others in the Gulf, that had never been achieved before.' Earlier this month, a letter sent by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to the Israeli government leaked to the press. In that letter, the U.S. threatens to withhold arms shipments if Israel doesn’t address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Friedman expressed frustration with the Biden Administration’s threat of sanctions on Israel, including an embargo or slowed arms shipments critical for Israel’s defense in the ongoing conflict. He confirmed knowing the specific weapons involved but declined to elaborate, emphasizing his belief that these delays are 'entirely political.' He emphasized the significance of a swift and decisive Israeli victory in its current conflict, framing it as 'essential' not only for Israel but also for the stability of Jordan, Egypt, and moderate Sunni Muslim nations. According to Friedman, US national security interests should support a clear win for moderates over extremists in the region. Turning to US domestic politics, Friedman argued that Michigan holds critical weight in the upcoming 2024 presidential election, suggesting that without Michigan, Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, lacks a path to victory. 'They’re in the process of losing Michigan, and what they did here, I think, was to sway those in Dearborn and other places,' he asserted. Friedman criticized the Biden Administration, asserting that 'politics has infected the national security decisions,' leading to negative consequences. In his view, while President Biden has not demonstrated the capacity to end the conflict swiftly, Trump is seen by some voters as able to achieve that goal, which may influence the election outcome in Michigan. Asked about Trump’s habit of making derogatory comments and offensive statements, Friedman urged people offended by the former president’s words to 'get over it' He noted a recent shift, where a group of Muslim imams endorsed Donald Trump, citing his perceived ability to 'stop the killing' and end the war. He explained that this endorsement didn’t reference Israel directly but suggested urgency in conflict resolution. 'That doesn’t mean that Israel should somehow be held back in its efforts to win the war, but it should be done quickly, decisively, and let’s start the rebuilding process,' he said. Israel will struggle to improve its public image until the war comes to an end, Friedman said. 'Once it’s over, you can make the case, look, this is what we did,' he said. 'This is what had to be done. Efforts were made to minimize civilian suffering. We are rebuilding, and this is what the future will look like. I think in the absence of a vision going forward, it’s hard to get people all that interested in your side of the case.' Friedman said that Trump will likely receive between 30% and 40% of the Jewish vote, which would be a historically high level of Jewish support for the Republican candidate. Many Jews who support Harris simply have priorities other than Israel, Friedman said. 'But then there are others who really just want to self-rationalize the idea that Kamala Harris will be better for Israel or better at fighting antisemitism than Trump,' he said. 'I don’t think there’s any intellectually honest way to get there.' Friedman discussed Trump’s 2019 executive order that expanded Title VI of the US Code to include protections for Jewish students from anti-Semitic conduct at universities. This expansion means that universities receiving federal funding must ensure the safety of their Jewish students or risk losing financial support. 'And almost all universities get some form of federal funding,' he said. According to Friedman, this is an 'enormously important' tool that remains in place under President Biden but is not being enforced. 'You can’t get tenure on a major American university if you’re pro-Israel,' Friedman asserted. 'We’ve seen that over and over again. And this is the breeding ground for the leaders of America for the next 20, 30, 40 years.' He argued that the federal government could pressure institutions like Harvard, Yale, and Columbia by threatening their funding, which he believes would prompt swift changes, saying, 'follow the money, you figure out where the incentives lie.' Friedman highlighted the broader impact of universities as 'the breeding ground for the leaders of America' and described the lack of pro-Israel perspectives in academia as a critical issue for the country’s future. He called for expanding law enforcement, particularly around immigration laws, asserting that many agitators are foreign nationals. While Friedman expressed doubt in changing 'the hearts and minds of anti-Semites,' he emphasized that enforcing existing laws could address these issues. This, he explained, is one of the key measures Trump would prioritize to 'change things very quickly' if reelected, ensuring universities comply with laws protecting Jewish students. Asked about Trump’s habit of making derogatory comments and offensive statements, Friedman urged people offended by the former president’s words to 'get over it.' 'He’s made America a stronger country, a more prosperous country, a more respected country,' he said. 'He’s been able to export American values throughout the world, throughout some of our most challenging places within the world. He’s feared in places like North Korea and Russia. And he stood up to China like no president before or after. You don’t like something he said, get over it.' Friedman said he was 'really nervous' about a world in which Trump isn’t elected. 'Who’s going to deal with making sure Israel has the weapons it needs to defend itself? The only thing Kamala Harris has ever said that’s in favor of Israel is that they have the right to defend themselves,' he said. 'I’d like her to point to any country in the world that, after it’s been attacked, doesn’t have the right to defend itself. It’s a meaningless platitude. Where she goes with that, I don’t know. I don’t think she really believes in the cause, in the ultimate justice of a Jewish state.' In his recently published book, 'One Jewish State: The Last, Best Hope to Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,' Friedman argues for a one-state solution where Israel would hold sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, the West Bank. This stance marks a shift from his previous support for a two-state solution, though he clarifies that even then, his vision included strict security controls by Israel over Palestinian territories—a model Palestinians rejected. He attributes his change in perspective to several factors: The first factor, he said, was the Palestinian response to the 2020 Trump peace plan, 'which was complete, unadulterated rejection.' 'Then along comes October 7, in which we see the capacity of Palestinians for hatred and brutality,' he said. 'And then you look at the polls of Judea and Samaria, of the Palestinians living there, and the aftermath, where like 80-plus percent of them were in favor of what Hamas did on October 7. So you take the Palestinian rejectionism, their support for October 7, and you then say, OK, this has changed the way I think.' Friedman recalls a pivotal conversation with a secular Israeli entrepreneur who initially seemed indifferent about retaining historically significant areas like Shiloh. After learning about Shiloh’s biblical heritage, the entrepreneur changed his view, affirming the importance of retaining the site. Inspired by this interaction, Friedman wrote his book to appeal to Israel’s political left, presenting his case for Israeli sovereignty as the best path for Palestinian welfare and stability. 'The best outcome is Israeli sovereignty over all of Judea and Samaria, because there is no other governing body,' he said. 'Look around and look around the region. You know, there’s no other governing body that has a track record of empowering an Arab minority other than Israel.' According to Friedman, Israel’s governance has offered opportunities to its Arab citizens, pointing to Arab participation in elite universities, health care, and business in Israel. He argues this model benefits Palestinians more than self-governance, which, he says, was a failed experiment in Gaza, leading to resources being diverted to conflict. 'What did they do with their independence, right? What did they do with the money that was given to them? They squandered it all on terror tunnels and weapons of mass destruction,' Friedman said. 'So why go through this experiment again when Israel has a proven track record of running an Arab minority?' Friedman has not yet presented these ideas to Trump or the moderate Muslim states, noting that his focus is on influencing Israeli opinion. He believes that for any U.S. policy shift, it is crucial to have Israeli consensus on the approach. The book, he adds, was recently translated into Hebrew to broaden its reach in Israel. Friedman’s plan does not provide an answer for the 2 million people living in Gaza. 'It’s a long-term solution,' he said. 'We’re not ready yet for a long-term solution to Gaza. Gaza is entirely a short-term problem. You know, people need houses. They need to eat. I mean, these are issues that, until you deal with them, you don’t deal with the One Jewish State issues.' Despite the ongoing war and the hostages still held in Gaza, Israel is better off now than it was before the war broke out, Friedman said. 'My analogy has always been to take two people who had serious cancer on October 6,' he said. 'They don’t know it yet. They feel fine. But they’ve got cancer growing inside of them. And over the course of the next year, one discovers it, goes through chemotherapy, suffers through it, has a very difficult time. It’s now a year later, not completely out of the woods, but starting to get good test results, starting to get, you know, the PET scans and the CAT scans are showing that the cancer has shrunk. In some cases, it’s been eliminated. The other guy still feels fine, right? Now, you compare these two people a year out, right? In the USA, you’re a life insurance company, right? Who do you want to write a policy on? Who’s healthier?' Similarly, he said, Israel has come to terms with the unsustainable situation on its borders and taken steps to address it. Asked about what role he might take in a new Trump Administration, Friedman expressed his willingness to rejoin the government, especially in the wake of recent events impacting Israel. He described a desire to help Israel heal from the trauma of October 7 and said he would again accept the role as ambassador if Trump is reelected and offers it to him. 'I want to help Israel get back on its feet,' he said, adding that he also hopes to 'help America restore its credibility within the world.' Friedman emphasized his belief that America is uniquely positioned to lead globally, warning that if the US doesn’t take that role, 'the world quickly devolves to a very bad place.' 'I want to help America restore its credibility within the world,' he said. 'Of all the superpowers, regional and worldly, America’s the only country with the values that really make it suitable to lead the world.' -This article is written by Felice Friedson and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ryav00glz1e	2024-10-30T10:34:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2020/02/25/HJJ32sMVL/HJJ32sMVL_0_34_800_451_0_small.jpg

Haredi lawmaker says national religious are 'useful idiots' of th...	Moshe Shimon Roth says the left is using the religious Zionist community's fallen soldiers as a political tool and says that the whole conscription issue is a sham, claiming there is no manpower shortage Knesset Deputy Speaker Moshe Shimon Roth of the United Torah Judaism Party launched a scathing critique of Aliyah and Integration Minister Ofir Sofer from the Religious Zionism party, who stated on Wednesday, 'We’ve been spit in the face by Haredi leadership,' adding that it’s unacceptable that the Haredi community avoids enlistment while 'both Torah students and others are bleeding to death.' Considered relatively moderate on conscription issues, Roth told Kol Berama Radio that, contrary to the claims of IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, 'the whole conscription issue is a sham. There is no manpower shortage; the IDF doesn’t want to draft Haredim. It’s the left that keeps bringing this up, using national religious Israelis as its ‘useful idiots.’' Roth, who is involved in discussions on the military conscription law and serves as chair of the Knesset Ethics Committee and a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, added: 'Sofer is very attached to his seat, and that overrides any ideology. Eventually, even he will need something. He just wanted to show his supporters what a debater he is, but that’s the end of the show – he went off to bed.' 'They [the left] do it because the religious and traditional camp is gaining strength, and that bothers the left. They are politicizing the sacrifice of religious Zionists to score points against the Haredim. When these soldiers were alive, the left vilified them for their actions and beliefs, but now they’re using them as tools against the Haredim.' Opposition leaders quickly condemned Roth. Avigdor Liberman, chairman of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, said Roth 'should be ashamed. Calling the national religious community ‘useful idiots’ crosses a red line. National religious Israelis, who combine Torah study with military service and workforce participation, are the salt of the earth and deeply committed to the values of the state and Zionism. It’s time you and your colleagues realize: we’re in an existential battle; everyone must join and enlist.' Likewise, Yesh Atid Knesset member Meirav Cohen criticized Roth, saying: 'When a public official fights to keep his community out of the army – refusing to serve while their own brothers fall –and calls those who do serve ‘useful idiots,’ well…' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1n1ucybkl	2024-10-30T10:08:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/30/HkoN11T111Jx/HkoN11T111Jx_0_40_1280_721_0_small.jpg
How inmates in Israeli prison hid cellphones underground	Over 40 mobile devices found in underground spaces and sewage pipes sawed to hide the cellphones; Israel Prison Service warns possible upcoming budget cuts could hinder efforts to prevent future smuggling operations In September 2021, six prisoners escaped from Gilboa Prison, which until then was considered one of Israel's most secure facilities. Following the escape and the ensuing investigative committee, the Israel Prison Service underwent a significant reform, introducing a computerized management system and reinforcing prison security. As part of these measures, concrete was poured into the underground spaces beneath Gilboa Prison, which had been constructed with foundational piles. The project was expanded to other prisons, including Ganot Prison in southern Israel, where approximately 2,500 inmates are held. At the peak of these efforts, it was revealed that prisoners found another use for these 'dead spaces' beneath the cells: hiding mobile phones to maintain contact with the outside world. Currently led by Israel Prison Service chief Kobi Yaakobi, this extensive effort to fortify cells and fill underground spaces with concrete aims to implement recommendations from the government’s inquiry following the Gilboa escape. The committee discovered that some prisons have open spaces beneath the cells – created when the structures were raised on piles – leaving gaps of several dozen centimeters between the ground and the floor. The latest security operations uncovered a particularly clever tactic: Prisoners sawed through toilet pipes to stash magnetic pouches containing mobile phones. Using improvised 'fishing rods' with magnets on the ends, they would retrieve the phones to communicate outside the prison. Despite concerns about budget cuts, the Israel Prison Service warns that the proposed reductions could severely hinder their ability to prevent smuggling operations and implement the Gilboa Prison escape committee’s recommendations. During recent security operations in Ganot Prison, prison staff uncovered over 40 mobile phones hidden under cell floors. Using the new method, prisoners sawed into plumbing pipes, creating hidden compartments for phones and retrieving them with magnetic fishing rods when needed. Chief Warden Hatem Azam, who leads the project, highlighted the sophistication displayed by the prisoners. 'We are facing elaborate tactics, and our actions aim to thwart these attempts and prevent illegal communications. Additionally, we’ve deployed cellular jammers to disrupt any communication. We will continue to detect and seal off these ‘underground cities.’' Southern District Commander Chief Warden Eran Peer expressed concern over possible budget cuts. 'Right at the peak of our fight, the Finance Ministry is considering budget reductions, while we’re uncovering methods that enable security prisoners to communicate from behind bars. National security depends on preventing these smuggling operations. Lives and state security cannot be reduced to a matter of budget.'

Gallant in Gaza: 'Deal to return hostages most important task'	Defense Minister Yoav Gallant entered the Gaza Strip on Wednesday and joined troops deployed in Rafah and the Philadelphi corridor. Gallant was shown the location where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was eliminated and held an operational situation assessment together with the General of the Southern Command, Commander of the Gaza Division, and additional senior officials. 'In any place where Hamas rears its head, it meets the IDF – whether in Rafah, Khan Younis, or Jabaliya- wherever Hamas rises, it is taken down. Your [military] actions led to the conditions that ultimately caused Sinwar to make a mistake [leading to his elimination],' he told IDF troops. 'The central issue here is to continue exerting as much [military] pressure on Hamas as possible, in order to create the conditions necessary to ensure the return of the hostages. Your duty is to exert military pressure, and eliminate and imprison terrorists.' 'The political echelon must do what is necessary to bring about a deal. You [referring to the troops] must apply military pressure and do what is necessary to create the conditions required for us to carry out a deal. This is our most important mission in Gaza at this time,' he said. 'We have routine tasks as well – defending Israeli communities and troops, and maintaining our freedom of operation in Gaza. You apply pressure – do what is necessary and we will bring about a deal because you created the conditions for us to carry it out, and I hope that we will do it.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk87eay11jx	2024-10-30T07:47:26-07:00

New Hezbollah chief says war goes on in 1st speech	Naim Qassem vows to continue in the path set by his slain predecessor Hassan Nasrallah; says the terror group is defending Lebanon and not working on behalf of Iran Hezbollah's new leader, Naim Qassem, said on Wednesday that the war against Israel will continue. In a prerecorded speech, his first since being named to head the terror group, Qassem said he will continue in the footsteps of his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah who was assassinated in an Israeli strike on his bunker in Beirut, in September. During his speech rockets targeted the Galilee after barrages that began early in the morning and continued throughout the day. 'I thank Hezbollah for giving me this responsibility, which is a heavy load and a sign of trust. The blood of our leader will remain and strengthen our resolve to continue on this path,' he said. Qassem said support for Gaza was necessary to deal with the threat Israel poses to the entire region. 'Israel does not need an excuse for its aggression,' he said. 'History has proven that.' He said Hezbollah was not asking for a cease-fire. 'If the enemy wants to stop, we will accept terms that are suitable to us. Any solution will be through negotiations,' he said. U.S. Mideast envoy Amos Hochstein and Special Presidential Envoy Brett McGurk were scheduled to arrive in the region on Thursday, to advance a cease-fire deal that would end the fighting on the Israeli-Lebanon border. The 71-year-old cleric said that Hezbollah was fighting Israel to defend Lebanese territory and not on behave of any foreign influence, alluding to Iran, the group's main benefactor. He said Iran'supports us but doesn't want anything' in return.

Ukraine is also bracing for what could be the toughest winter of the war after long-range Russian airstrikes destroyed what officials says is about half of its power generating capacity. A $61 billion aid package from the United States, stalled by Republicans in Congress from December last year, was approved in April.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aoz6ywkl	2024-10-30T06:29:45-07:00	
Mass evacuations from Lebanese towns amid explosions from IDF att...	Two farmers injured by rocket from Lebanon targeting Metula, as Israeli forces warned Lebanese towns of imminent danger, urging evacuation; From an environmental standpoint, there is significant damage to forests throughout northern Israel, with long-term recovery needed for affected wildlife and vegetation Two farmers sustained injuries, ranging from mild to moderate-severe, on Wednesday morning due to a direct rocket strike launched from Lebanon targeting Metula. They were taken to Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa for treatment. Concurrently, IDF's Arabic spokesperson, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, issued an evacuation warning to residents of Baalbek, Ain Borday and Dours in eastern Lebanon, prompting a massive exodus. Later on Wednesday, huge explosions and large amounts of smoke were seen and heard in Baalbek. Adraee's message stated: 'Urgent notice to the residents of Baalbek, Ain Borday, and Dours. IDF is taking strong action against Hezbollah interests in your towns and villages and does not wish to harm you. To ensure your safety, you must immediately evacuate your homes and move beyond the towns and villages via the following routes: Zahle-Baalbek Road; Nahla-Baalbek Road; Al-Arz-Baalbek Road, as outlined on the map. Proximity to Hezbollah operatives, its facilities, or weaponry may expose you to danger.' Following the evacuation announcement, Sky News in Arabic reported on the mass departures from the Baalbek area and other regions identified in Adraee's notice. The governor of Baalbek said in an interview with Sky News in Arabic that 'there is no military presence of Hezbollah' within Baalbek and urged residents to head toward the northern district, adding that 'panic has spread among the residents after the evacuation warnings.' In the afternoon, IDF spokesperson reported that Air Force fighter jets, guided by intelligence from Military Intelligence, the Air Force, and Northern Command, attacked the Nabatieh area and eliminated Mostafa Ahmed Shhadi, the deputy commander of Hezbollah's Radwan Force. In his former roles, he was responsible for operations in Radwan during the Syrian conflict from 2012 to 2017 and managed the unit's combat plans in southern Lebanon. 'Mustafa Ahmad Shihadi advanced terror plots against the State of Israel. This elimination further cripples the operational capabilities of Hezbollah's Radwan Force to execute terror activities against Israeli forces and the Israeli home front on the northern border, particularly the plan to conquer the Galilee,' the report stated. Meanwhile, the Lebanese 'Al-Mayadeen' network, affiliated with Hezbollah, reported an aerial strike on a vehicle on the Al-Kahhala Araya road in the Mount Lebanon area. According to the Lebanese 'Al-Jadid' channel, one person was killed in the vehicle attack. Minutes earlier, a separate report in Lebanon detailed another vehicle attack using a drone in the nearby village of Shamoun. Earlier in the morning, minor damage was reported at a factory building in Nahariya, where aviation components are manufactured, after a drone exploded nearby. The IDF is investigating why no alert was triggered at the site. Prior to this, IDF spokesperson updated that the Air Force intercepted three drones that penetrated from Lebanon after sirens activated in Nahariya and communities in the western Galilee. It was further reported that there were no casualties in the incident, although a fire broke out near the Gesher HaZiv area. In the meantime, the Jewish National Fund (KKL) released data on Wednesday indicating the extent of damage caused by Hezbollah fire since the war began. Approximately 43,243 acres of natural land were burned in the Upper Galilee-Golan Heights region, which suffered the most damage. They estimate that rehabilitation will take between five to seven years. In the Lower Galilee-Gilboa, slightly more than 6,100 acres of open and forested areas were burned, according to KKL data. In the Western Galilee-Carmel region, approximately 2,224 acres were burned, and in the Hula Valley, approximately 178 acres. 'KKL emergency teams, alongside firefighting and rescue crews, continue to lead the fight against fires in the north, even under fire,' said KKL Chairperson Yifat Ovadia-Luski. 'The war has caused severe damage to the residents of the north, and unfortunately also to wildlife and vegetation. Our primary mission for the new year is to rejuvenate the affected areas and the entire State of Israel.' KKL also noted that the fires impacted a wide variety of wildlife: many bird nesting sites were destroyed, habitats of mammals and reptiles living on the ground were burned, and a large number of arthropods could not escape the flames. The damage to vegetation, they noted, is severe. All forest and woodland trees, including conifers like pine, cypress, and cedar, as well as broadleaf trees such as oak, terebinth, Judas tree, eucalyptus, carob, and almond, were affected by the fires. Additionally, public spaces like parking lots, lookout points, scenic viewpoints, forest entrances, and scenic routes were also burned. 'They want to make a 'lame' agreement' Northern municipal leaders addressed the potential settlement in the north, as revealed on Tuesday by Ynet and 'Yedioth Ahronoth.' Eitan Davidi, chairman of Moshav Margaliot, said: 'We want the war to end, but this is not the way. Israel is attempting to reach an agreement that would allow residents in southern Lebanon to return to their homes, and at some point, we could live amicably with our neighbors, but that's not the situation.' He stated, 'This neighborhood doesn't work, the concept doesn't work. The State of Israel needs to change its approach.' Davidi warned that if such a settlement is implemented, 'we will protest.' He added: 'I suggest to the Chief of Staff and the Northern Command Commander to focus on restoring security and achieving results within Lebanon. They want to make a 'lame' agreement.' Shimon Guetta, head of the Ma'ale Yosef Regional Council, said in an interview with Ynet: 'We need to end this once and for all. We are eager to return to our homes, but to return safely. The residents will not return easily. People have been outside their homes for a year.'

Espionage scandal rocks Italy, Mossad implicated	Private security firm alleged to steal information on leaders, public figures in years of hacking, to sell to customers; Mossad agents reportedly seek to trade information on illegal deals with Iran for info on Russian hackers, Wagner Group An internal espionage scandal is rocking Italy after a private investigation firm made up of current and former senior members of the security services was alleged to have stolen personal information on politicians, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and public figures for extortion. Israel's Mossad was alleged to have been involved in deals with the Milan-based investigative firm. At least four people were under arrest and dozens more were under investigation. Cyber security experts and hackers may have breached the servers of Italy's interior ministry, investigators said. Meloni described the alleged plot as 'unacceptable' and 'a threat to democracy.' Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto demanded an urgent parliamentary probe, out of concern that state secrets may have been compromised. He said the personal information that was exposed is the tip of the iceberg. Italian media described the affair as a conspiracy of the highest level that involves members of the mafia and officials in the intelligence services along with foreign intelligence services including the Mossad. A former senior member of the police who heads Equalize, the private investigation firm is the primary suspect in the investigation and is accused of breaching the servers of government ministries and the police, since 2019 and until 2024, to build massive files, packed with secrets and sensitive information which he sold or planned to sell to his clients. Most of the firm's clients are large companies or major law firms who were interested in access either to gain an advantage over competitors, to succeed in court cases or for extortion. According to a report in the Corriere Della Sera on Wednesday, investigators intercepted a visit to the investigation firm, by two unidentified Israelis who were described as intelligence agents, who wanted to deal in information regarding Iranian gas that may be of interest to Italy's government gas company, ENI and pertained to illegal trade in gas with Iran. The paper also said that the visit was coordinated by a senior member of the police who worked for Italian intelligence, Mossad's counterpart, a man identified as Lorezo De Marcio, and that the Israeli agents asked help in identifying the actions of Russian hackers and Russian bank transactions connected to the notorious Wagner Group, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin's former ally who was reportedly assassinated after he led a mutiny against the Russian military. The Open website claimed the Israelis asked to stop funding of Prigozhin by Russian oligarchs and offered the Italian firm classified information on illegal purchases of gas from Iran and a payment of one million euros.

US Marines complete first drill using Iron Dome interceptors in I...	Drill included a radar-based system and an American command-and-control center testing capabilities of Iron Dome in part of a new U.S. Army project The U.S. Marine Corps has completed its first live-fire training exercise using an air defense system incorporating Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system, the Defense Ministry said on Wednesday. The drill was carried out successfully, featuring a radar-based system and an American command-and-control center, alongside the Iron Dome interceptor missile and a mobile launcher developed by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in collaboration with the U.S. company Raytheon. During the exercise, the Marines operated the system in full, intercepting targets within the area. Additionally, the exercise evaluated the continuous launch capability of Iron Dome interceptors from a mobile launcher designed specifically for the U.S. Marine Corps. The Defense Ministry said in a statement that this exercise was part of a development and procurement project headed by the U.S. Marines to test a prototype for a new medium-range interception system. The Iron Dome interceptor, known as the 'Tamir,' which was used in the exercise, can intercept cruise missiles, drones, and a variety of rockets, shells and mortars. 'The live-fire exercise’s success represents a key milestone toward operational deployment of the Marines' first prototype battery,' the ministry said in a statement.

After demeaning photos appear, detained Palestinians speak out	Hundreds of men stripped of their shirts seen in images on social media after being detained by troops during the fighting in Gaza; IDF says it acted in accordance to international law and was searching for Hamas terrorists among the civilians Hundreds of Palestinians detained by troops in Gaza were seen in photos on social media, stripped of their shirts. The demeaning photos prompted condemnation from media outlets but the IDF said it was acting according to international law and the men were told to strip to ensure that they were not strapped with explosives. 'The men were instructed to remove their clothes and stay in just their underwear,' on man told CNN. We complied. We sat in the cold for several more hours and the weather was frigid. They were insulting us during that time, calling us names, laughing and taking pictures.' According to the report, the image, taken last Friday, was initially shared on an Israeli Telegram channel. It was also noted that the individuals in the photo had tried to leave the area following a warning from the IDF that there will be fighting there. Temperatures in Gaza were in the high 20's C for most of the day. CNN reported that it was unclear who had taken the picture, though some of those photographed claimed it was IDF soldiers who photographed them during their detention. A CNN correspondent spoke with five of those in the image. Muhannad Khalaf, 27, said he and his wife were detained by IDF soldiers while attempting to flee their home with their infant son via what was described as a designated safe corridor. 'We were all gathered in one place – men, women, children, and the elderly. This was at 11 a.m. After five hours, at 4 p.m., they asked the women and children to move forward and carry all (of our) bags and belongings,' he told the outlet. 'Once they left, the men were instructed to remove their clothes and stay in just their underwear. We complied. We sat in the cold for several more hours and the weather was frigid. They were insulting us during that time, calling us names, laughing and taking pictures,' he added. According to Khalaf, every five men in the photo were asked to move forward for an ID screening by the soldiers before being allowed to proceed toward Gaza City. 'Some individuals were detained while others were released. Most of us ended up in Gaza City. The situation was terrifying and deeply saddening as we witnessed elderly men and injured individuals in distress, with no one showing them compassion or mercy.' According to CNN, the image shows a three-and-a-half-year-old girl named Jouri Abu Ward riding a bicycle alongside her father as they made their way to Gaza City. Her father, Mohamad Abu Ward, said, he was forced to strip down to his underwear and was held for eight hours. He said the girl was not required to remove her clothes but was unable to leave the area because she was alone with him. No food or water was available to them. His wife and other children left the area earlier in the morning and were able to make it to Gaza City. 'Individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity are being detained and questioned,' the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit told CNN in a statement. 'The detainees are treated in accordance with international law but it is often necessary for terror suspects to hand over their clothes so that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry.' 'Due to security protocol, clothes aren’t immediately returned to the detainees,' the statement added, adding the clothes are returned as soon as it’s 'possible to do so.'

Spain flash floods kill at least 51 people	Torrential rains leave roads and towns under water in Valencia leaving some people stranded; Madrid send troops to assist in the rescue efforts At least 51 people have been killed in flash floods sweeping the eastern Spanish region of Valencia following torrential rains on Tuesday that left roads and towns under water, local authorities said on Wednesday. Dozens of videos shared on social media overnight appeared to show people trapped by the floodwaters, with some climbing into trees to avoid being swept away. Carlos Mazon, the regional leader of Valencia, told a press conference some people remained isolated in inaccessible locations. Frantic residents searched for missing relatives while local rescue services struggled to respond to the urgent demand. The government in Madrid deployed 1,000 military troops to assist in the rescue efforts after an astounding 491 mm. of rain fell in 8 hours, the most since 1966, according to Spain's RTVE network. Emergency services urged citizens to refrain from any kind of road travel and to follow further updates from official sources. Spain's state weather agency AEMET declared a red alert in Valencia, with some areas such as Turis and Utiel recording 200 mm (7.9 inches) of rainfall. Meteorologists warned that the extreme weather occurrences will likely increase amid rising global temperatures.

Israel disables most of Iran's air defenses, official says	Israel's destroys key S-300 missile systems and radar sites; Satellite images reveal extensive damage to the Shahrud Space Center, a pivotal Revolutionary Guards facility used for satellite launches and missile production Israel succeeded in taking out most of Iran's air defenses during its attack last Saturday, an official said in an interview with Fox News late on Tuesday. According to the network's sources, Israel destroyed three of Iran's S-300 systems, after a fourth was targeted in the first Israeli strike last April Satellite imagery has revealed significant damage to the Shahrud Space Center, a key launch site for Iran's Revolutionary Guards located in the Semnan province in northeastern Iran, allegedly inflicted by Israel. The operation reportedly also targeted multiple radar systems critical to Iran's ballistic missile capabilities. In a message to Tehran, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi warned that any further Iranian missile barrages would be met with unprecedented Israeli military responses. Visiting the squadrons responsible for the Iran strike at Ramon Air Force Base, Halevi said, 'We will know how to hit very, very hard in both capabilities and locations that we left aside this time.' The Associated Press unveiled new satellite images showing additional damage at another site targeted by the Israeli assault, a fact unreported by Tehran. Images reveal destruction at several buildings within the Shahrud Space Center. Although Iran has acknowledged damage in Tehran and the provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan, it remains silent about Semnan. Expert analysis suggests that while there is no definitive evidence the damage was not caused by other means, pre-strike imagery shows no such destruction. Captured by Planet Labs, the satellite images from Tuesday depict a central structure at the space center, now a skeletal ruin. Nearby vehicles, likely belonging to Iranian officials, survey the wreckage. Pre-strike images from March show the building intact, topped by a high blue roof. Further images reveal three smaller structures demolished south of the main building, with additional damage to a hangar to the northeast, indicating precise targeting by the Israeli military. Iran is presumably still assessing the full extent of the damage from this calculated strike.

US envoys arrive to advance Lebanon cease-fire	Israeli terms include freedom to operate in South Lebanon if UNIFIL fails to prevent Hezbollah's return to areas south of the Litani; Hezbollah says will not disarm and is prepared to fight on U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk will arrive on Thursday as efforts to secure a cease-fire deal in Lebanon, advance. Hochstein was in the region last week and will now return as both sides show serious intentions to finalize a deal. Israeli officials said an agreement in Lebanon is tied to the discussions held between CIA chief William Barns and Egyptian and Qatari mediators attempting to reach a hostage release and cease-fire deal for Gaza. Officials in Jerusalem said that some of Israel's conditions could prove difficult for Lebanon to accept, including the demand that the IDF be able to operate freely in South Lebanon to ensure compliance with the terms agreed. Israel insists that if the UNIFIL force is unable to enforce the deal, the IDF be able to take action to ensure the safety of the residents in the north, after the peacekeepers failed to enforce UN resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War and allowed Hezbollah terrorists to return to the border with Israel and build fortifications there in advance of their planned invasion of the Galilee. Israel also demands that the Lebanon army complete the destruction of all Hezbollah infrastructure in South Lebanon, after the IDF withdraws, and ensures no members of the terror group remain south of the Litani River. Jerusalem also demands that measures be in place to prevent Hezbollah from re-arming with weapons smuggled across Lebanon's border with Syria, provided by Iran. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Khbar newspaper published on Tuesday, the demands of the terror group for the cease-fire including maintaining the link between the war with Israel and Hamas's war in Gaza. 'Hezbollah hopes all Lebanese understand that disarming is not an option,' the paper wrote. Hezbollah also rejects changing the makeup of UNIFIL troops except for the removal of Germans 'because they are partners with the enemy.' Israel has asked that its European allies dedicate troops to the peacekeeping mission. 'Israel wants to continue the war,' Hezbollah officials told the paper. 'We must be prepared for a prolonged fight.' The terror group also said they were not affected by the wave of assassinations of leaders.

Beyond UNRWA: How does Israel plan to coordinate Palestinian aid ...	UN officials and foreign leaders condemned Israel’s plan to ban the UN’s Palestinian refugee organization, but Israeli politicians say that doing say is necessary for the country’s security If the bills passed Monday night by the Israeli parliament are implemented, the United Nations agency supporting Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank could be banned in Israel by February 2025. The plan, which is expected to be implemented in 90 days, would shift responsibilities from the organization known as UNRWA to other international aid organizations. Israeli lawmakers say the change aims to create a foundation for a more peaceful and productive relationship with Palestinians in Jerusalem and neighboring areas. Founded in 1949, UNRWA provides education, health care, and aid to millions of Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israel’s tenuous relationship with the agency became even more strained after the October 7 attacks, in which at least 12 Gaza UNRWA employees were found to have been involved. Israel later discovered evidence that at least 1,200 UNRWA employees in Gaza—10% of its Gaza workforce—were operatives of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. A bill banning state authorities from having any contact with the UNRWA and stripping all UNRWA workers of their diplomatic privileges and immunity passed the Knesset 87 to 9. 'I hope for a better education system in Palestinian society—one that teaches peace, not hate' 'I hope the Palestinians will see a weakened Hamas and weakened radical forces,' lawmaker Dan Illouz, who co-authored the bill, told The Media Line. 'I hope for a better education system in Palestinian society—one that teaches peace, not hate—and then, a move forward. It might be a very slow move forward, but toward a more constructive Palestinian society that yearns for peace, not war.' Lawmaker Sharren Haskel co-authored a second bill barring UNRWA from operating in Israeli territory. That bill passed 92 to 10. 'To protect our people, we have to change things, and it starts with UNRWA' 'I knew nine years ago that if UNRWA remained at the core of the Israeli-Arab conflict, there could be no different future,' Haskel told The Media Line. 'I knew it would lead to death and destruction. I didn’t imagine it would pave the way to a massacre like the one on October 7. To protect our people, we have to change things, and it starts with UNRWA.' Haskel’s bill would ban UNRWA from operating in East Jerusalem. A minority of the Palestinian students in East Jerusalem attend schools run by UNRWA, which are not associated with the Jerusalem municipality of the Israeli Education Ministry. Students at these schools study only in Arabic and follow the same curriculum as children in Gaza. Getting rid of UNRWA schools in East Jerusalem would be the most significant result of the bill, allowing a new generation of Palestinian East Jerusalemites to become more integrated into Israel society, Haskel said. The two bills were brought for a second and third reading Monday night, marking the start of the Knesset’s winter session. Both bills aim not only to remove UNRWA from Israel but also to sharply restrict its activities in Gaza and the West Bank. Israel will no longer issue entry permits for UNRWA workers from those territories or have the Israeli military coordinate on UNRWA operations. Lawmaker Boaz Bismuth, who co-authored one of the bills, described the organization as 'an aid agency for Hamas.' 'UNRWA is not a refugee aid agency,' he said. Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chair Yuli Edelstein said that Israel has 'the right and duty, as any sovereign nation committed to its survival, to combat threats against it, especially when they lie at its very heart.' Palestinians will still receive aid, lawmakers say Illouz explained that other international aid organizations are expected to support Palestinians as UNRWA is phased out. Potential alternatives include UNICEF, the United States Agency for International Development, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme, and others. The Palestinian Authority could also take over some responsibilities from UNRWA. 'These are organizations that work worldwide in all conflict zones,' Illouz explained. 'It is only in the case of the Palestinians that there is this unique organization that deals with only one conflict. This is toxic, not constructive, and not conducive to peace. We want to return to the internationally accepted norm in all other conflicts.' Haskel noted that the recent polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, a collaborative effort between WHO and UNICEF, ran smoothly. She emphasized that Israel wants to ensure that aid can enter the Palestinian territories and get to those in need. Aid not coordinated through UNRWA is more likely to reach those it’s intended for, she said, noting that diverted UNRWA aid bags had allegedly been found in the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s Gaza hideout. Illouz said he expects funding to be redirected from UNRWA to other aid organizations as needed. 'At the end of the day, the international community will need to decide if they care more about actual humanitarian aid for the Palestinians or strengthening this terror-supporting organization,' he said. 'That’s a decision they’ll have to make. I hope they make the right one.' He also called on the UN to change its definition of Palestinian refugees, noting that UNRWA now serves 5.8 million Palestinian refugees, up from the 750,000 it was originally tasked with serving. Critics of UNRWA often point to the ballooning number of Palestinian refugees as a sign of the agency’s ineffectiveness, but UNRWA rejects the idea that Palestinian refugees are held to a more lenient standard than other refugees served by the UN. 'There is no basis to question the reality that Palestine refugees have for generations been compelled by circumstances to retain their refugee status,' then-UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness wrote in 2011. 'Such questions betray a lack of understanding of the international protection regime and serve only to distract from the need to address the real reasons for the protracted Palestinian refugee situation, namely the absence of a negotiated solution to the underlying political issues.' Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, called the Knesset’s decision 'unprecedented' and 'dangerous,' adding that it violated international law. He also said that the bills 'will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians.' Similarly, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the decision would have 'devastating consequences.'

Palestinian Authority reels at bill banning UNRWA in Israel	International and Palestinian bodies harshly condemn Jerusalem for passing controversial law banning UN aid organization activities in the country; repercussions expected in ICJ case against Israel Palestinian Authority officials condemned the legislation of the bill to ban UNRWA activities in the country on Monday. 'The Israeli decision regarding UNRWA’s work requires an Arab and international stance dedicated to protecting and supporting the agency’s role,' Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee Secretary-General Hussein al-Sheikh said in a posted on X. 'The UN Security Council must compel Israel to implement international decisions. Silence on the massacres committed against Palestinians and on what UNRWA has been exposed to is a disgrace for those who agreed to restrict their position to statements, condemnations and denunciations only,' he wrote. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has been in severe economic straits since the beginning of the Gaza war, teetering on the brink of collapse after Israel was withholding clearing funds which make up 65% of its annual budget. Palestinian officials noted that without an immediate solution for the 'void that UNRWA will leave behind, specifically in the education system,' the PA would struggle to meet the needs of students and teachers. 'Israel is tying our hands and feet,' a senior PA official said. 'We have no way to address all the issues UNRWA handled and supported without UN funding and aid unless Israel intends to fill that void through financing.' Fatah Deputy Chairman Mahmoud al-Aloul stressed the international community’s need to take 'urgent action' to force Israel to repeal the law and warned of its 'negative consequences.' 'The law reflects Israel’s systematic intent to end UNRWA’s role and replace it with other agencies, in a move aimed at eliminating the Palestinian refugee issue and revoking their right to return,' he said. 'Refugees’ right to return is guaranteed by international law and can’t be circumvented by Israeli methods.' Al-Aloul accused the Israeli law of 'blatantly violating the UN Charter and contradicting international resolutions — foremost among them Resolution 302 which mandates the establishment of UNRWA, as well as the recent Security Council resolution calling for the protection of humanitarian institutions and their staff.' UNRWA was established by a UN General Assembly resolution in 1949 and is authorized to provide aid and protection to Palestinian refugees in its five operational areas: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 'We provide assistance, protection and support for over 5.9 million Palestinian refugees,' UNRWA wrote on its main Arabic website alongside a statement from the agency’s Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, calling to 'stop Israel’s violent campaign against us.' The laws halting UNRWA’s operations in Israel were approved partly due to the involvement of some agency members in the October 7 massacre. 'There is no question that individuals accused of criminal acts, including the deplorable assault on Israel, must be investigated,' Lazzarini said. 'This is exactly what the United Nations is doing. Those individuals must be held accountable through criminal prosecution and, if found guilty, punished.' He said the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the top investigative body in the U.N. system, is overseeing this inquiry. 'It is looking into allegations against 19 out of 13,000 UNRWA staff members in Gaza. To date, one case was closed because there was no evidence. Four cases were suspended because the information was insufficient to proceed. Another 14 cases remain under investigation. But we must distinguish the behavior of individuals from the agency’s mandate to serve Palestinian refugees. It is unjust and dishonest to attack UNRWA’s mission on the basis of these allegations.' Several governments worldwide, including France, were quick to condemn the legislation. 'Paris deeply regrets the approval of laws aimed at banning UNRWA’s operations in Israel. The implementation of these laws would have severe consequences for the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territories, depriving hundreds of thousands of civilians of essential aid, including shelter, healthcare, education and food,' France’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 'For more than 70 years, UNRWA has been playing a vital, indispensable role in providing essential goods and services to Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, but also in the countries that have taken them in – Lebanon, Jordan and Syria,' it added. 'France reaffirmed its support for UNRWA, pledging that it will 'continue to ensure the implementation of the necessary reforms to guarantee its neutrality, specifically the recommendations contained in the Colonna Report.' Repercussions at The Hague The new legislation mandates Israel’s complete severance of ties with UNRWA. The immediate effect means that should UNRWA staff request visas, Israel’s Foreign Ministry won’t cooperate, indirectly impacting their immunity. Israeli officials estimate Palestinian officials will leverage this legislation against UNRWA in the genocide lawsuit South Africa filed against Israel at the Hague. The legislation has triggered a serious crisis in Israel’s relations with the UN, though it’s important to note the UN consists of many bodies. Israel maintains reasonably good relations with UNICEF, the International Red Cross and the UN World Food Program. Bodies with which it has friction include UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who has one more year in office, UNRWA and UN Women. Guterres will likely use the legislation as a lever against Israel. He and Lazzarini framed the legislation as a blow to the multilateral system and a dangerous precedent — but this is misleading, as there’s no other organization in the world similar to UNRWA that perpetuates refugee status indefinitely.

Up to 14 hostages freed, 30 day lull, latest cease-fire proposal	Deal being discussed by Mossad chief and Qatari mediators says all women held hostage to be freed along with elderly; Egypt proposes a smaller deal to jumpstart the process with Hamas after Sinwar's killing Mossad Chief David Barnea and Qatari mediators drafted a proposed deal to be negotiated with Hamas that would see the release of all women held by Hamas in Gaza and the elderly hostages in exchange for a 30-day lull in the fighting and the freeing from Israeli jails of an undisclosed number of Palestinian prisoners. The offer does not include an Israeli withdrawal from the Strip. The U.S. and Qatar were considering a guarantee to Hamas that the IDF troops would pull out after all hostages were freed, despite Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence on maintaining troops along the border with Egypt. Efforts were underway to bring Hamas back to the negotiating table even for a 'small deal' to test the terror group's position after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month. Proposals on offer involve four hostages released in exchange for a two-week ceasefire, followed by a temporary pause to ponder peace. Prime Minister Netanyahu, however, claimed no such offer was made adding that he would have accepted such a proposal. Hamas, meanwhile, eyes Egypt not merely as a neighbor but as a gateway—a portal to renewed diplomatic ties under the watchful eyes of newly minted intelligence chief Hassan Rashad. This rapprochement comes after a frosty chapter with Rashad's predecessor, Kamal Abbas. And then there is the Russian proposal—two hostages with dual citizenship, Alexander Trofenov and Maxim Harkin, become the focal point of Moscow's diplomatic efforts. Hamas number 2, Mousa Abu Marzook was in Moscow, but it remains unclear—whether this would be part of a broader agreement. With the U.S. presidential elections taking place next week, there’s doubt whether any deal can be agreed before Americans go to the polls. After the elections, the pressure on Netanyahu promises to be relentless, regardless of who the next president will be.

Bismuth: 'Terror organizations like UNRWA won' operate in Israel' How did the Knesset manage to pass a bill banning UNRWA from Israel? According to one of the bill’s authors, MK Boaz Bismuth, this legislation has been a long time coming. 'If we say that what was before October 7 won’t be the same after, then this [ban] is one thing Israelis are expecting: That terror organizations, like UNRWA, will not operate from Israel,' Bismuth told ILTV. He added that implementing the bill will be straightforward. Israel, as a sovereign nation, 'only has to ban UNRWA' from operating within its borders and has full authority over which organizations or individuals may enter.

Rafael chief says laser interception systems is a gamechanger	New air defense system against rockets, mortars, cruise missiles, and even drones is the future: 'This is the world’s first laser weapon, and it will work seamlessly with Iron Dome, 'Yuval Steinitz says; So how does the system work, and what will it cost? 'This is the first laser system of its kind in the world, a global breakthrough—not just for Israel—that allows us to intercept missiles, rockets, shells, and drones kilometers away from the country using lasers,' said former minister and Rafael Chairman Yuval Steinitz on Sunday. The timing of the announcement amid wartime holds special significance, he noted: 'Most of our employees at Rafael are highly skilled scientists who could work elsewhere, but here, they feel they’re contributing to the national effort.' Israel’s Defense Ministry announcement effectively ends an international race among world powers, who have spent years attempting to develop a laser-based defense system. This breakthrough was made possible by scientific advancements at Rafael six years ago, which allowed the laser beam to stay consistent upon contact with the atmosphere without scattering. Rafael expects the system to be operational by 2025, adding another layer to Israel’s air defense against missile threats during wartime. 'The system is composed of hundreds of laser beams directed at an incoming target,' Steinitz explained. 'Laser is a highly focused and powerful beam with immense energy that can cut through steel at close range. However, when it encounters air, it tends to scatter. Our scientists at Rafael solved this by sending hundreds of laser beams toward a target tens of kilometers away, enabling us to detect in seconds—based on the beams' return—which hit the missile most accurately. The system then instantly redirects all beams to that precise point for effective targeting. It happens in a flash, within milliseconds. Once all beams lock onto the most accurate frequency, the missile can be neutralized.' Using sophisticated targeting technology similar to Iron Dome’s advanced systems, the laser system calculates the most effective beam for detonating the incoming missile, focusing the rest of the beams on that exact impact point to bring it down. 'The hit range will be about 10 centimeters,' Steinitz noted. 'It will slice through the missile’s steel casing, penetrate its warhead, and strike the explosive with such force that it will detonate.' When fully operational, the Iron Beam system will complement Israel’s existing air defense network, already one of the most advanced globally thanks to Iron Dome, the Arrow missile, and David’s Sling. This laser-based system provides Israel with a strategic and economic advantage, reducing interception costs significantly. 'Right now, each interceptor missile costs taxpayers a fortune,' Steinitz explained. 'But the Iron Beam intervention will cost the state only a few thousand dollars per use, thanks to the laser-based system instead of missiles. It’s a major difference. The cost of a single interception will be around five dollars, a massive shift. It reverses the current equation of intercepting cheap missiles with expensive countermeasures.' Rafael declined to go into further details, but for now, it appears the system won’t defend against ballistic missile attacks, like the one seen from Iran earlier this month. However, Rafael assures it will work effectively against other aerial threats from neighboring regions that have intensified in recent years. 'The system will be deployed alongside Iron Dome batteries,' Steinitz added, 'and depending on the threat type, it will decide whether to use an Iron Dome missile or the faster, lower-cost laser to do the job.' According to the agreement, the first operational system will be delivered to Israel by the end of next year. Like any defense system developed here, Israel’s adversaries will immediately seek ways to overcome it. Yet Steinitz remains unfazed by the challenge. 'There’s never 100 percent success, but while they think far ahead, so do we—ten steps ahead. This is just the beginning of the system. It’s clear that this breakthrough will bring additional applications and have a lasting impact on national defense in the future,' he concluded.

Reza Pahlavi reveals bold plan to end Iran's Islamic regime – is ...	Exclusive interview with former Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince of Iran, says the Islamic regime maintains its grip on power through indoctrination and proxy wars. In an exclusive interview with ILTV’s Emily Schrader, Pahlavi criticized Western policies that prioritize changing the regime’s behavior over advocating for its replacement. Instead, he supports a controlled implosion that would pave the way for a secular, democratic system. Pahlavi emphasized that Iranians are ready for change and that international support is crucial—but not through military intervention. What is his vision for the Iranian-Israeli relationship? Pahlavi envisions a strategic partnership between Israel and a free Iran, focused on mutual benefits and regional stability.

Is military or ‘civil’ force the key to regime change in Iran?	This is a war of narratives,' said Marty Youssefiani, who served as senior counselor to Iran’s crown prince. Over the weekend, Israel launched a powerful attack deep into Iran, demonstrating its capability to strike critical targets across the country at will. This show of force could pave the way for future strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities or energy infrastructure. Did Israel’s recent action weaken Iran’s leadership, or might it provoke retaliation? Two influential Iranian dissidents – Marty Youssefiani, a veteran campaign strategist who served as senior counselor to Iran’s crown prince, and Mohsen Sazegara, former Islamic Republic Deputy Prime Minister and founder of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards – discuss these questions on the latest episode of ILTV’s Insider. 'No regime change can ever be accomplished through military actions,' Youssefiani told Insider. 'What needs to be done is more investment in the Iranian people.' According to Youssefiani, much like Soviet Communism, Islamist governance in Iran is 'destined to fall' because it offers 'an epic but dark ideology.' He said that over the past 45 years, the people of Iran have witnessed the incompetence and corruption of living under a kleptocracy, and the world will see it too when the regime is no more. However, Youssefiani cautioned, this is not a war that can be won by missiles. 'This is a war of narratives that we can only win by winning the hearts and minds of the Iranian people, giving them the courage and confidence to stand up,' he said. However, there is hope that some military pressure may help convince the Iranian regime itself that it may be time for change. Sazegara noted that, for at least the last 25 years, Iranian military doctrine has centered on three pillars: asymmetric warfare or terrorist groups, missiles, and, as a deterrent, its nuclear project. Since Iranian proxy Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, and its other proxy, Hezbollah, began attacking Israel on October 8, Israel has managed to nearly dismantle these terrorist groups. 'The Iranian regime now has a big question,' Sazegara said. 'Now is the time for the leaders of Iran to think about the political consequences of such a defeat in its military doctrine.'

Lost Mayan city discovered in southern Mexico jungle	Archeologists in Mexico have discovered a huge, lost Mayan city, which they named Valeriana, hidden deep in the southern jungle of Campeche -- a sprawling, urban settlement, replete with architectural marvels and agricultural infrastructure.The discovery of what appears to have been a bustling urban landscape challenges the existing knowledge about the prevalence and density of ancient Mayan settlements. Valeriana was discovered by chance thanks to Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging, a technology that uses lasers to map and analyze archaeological landscapes. The dataset used for the study came from approximately 122 square kilometers (47 square miles) of high-quality airborne Lidar data collected in 2013 as part of a forest monitoring project called Alianza and led by the Nature Conservancy in Mexico, to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1bfmgj11je	2024-10-29T15:43:48-07:00	
From Lebanon, a close look at Hezbollah’s strategy to attack Metu...	The village of Kila, adjacent to Metula in Israel’s Upper Galilee region, was a strategic hub in Hezbollah’s plan to infiltrate northern Israeli communities; IDF soldiers have since dismantled terror infrastructures there, including a tunnel meant to funnel 1,000 terrorists across the border; Our reporter is on the ground with troops in southern Lebanon After nearly a year of war, the once-thriving village of Metula now stands abandoned and battered. Most of its homes lie in ruins from repeated Hezbollah strikes. Through its walls, the extensive destruction and devastation of Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure in the neighboring Lebanese village of Kila are clearly visible, the result of intense operations by Israel’s 769th Brigade of the 91st Division. In recent weeks, following the government’s authorization for the IDF to advance into southern Lebanon, bulldozers have been working tirelessly within three kilometers of the border to dismantle weapons caches and demolish terror strongholds. As tunnels are unearthed, the scale of Hezbollah's terror network, meant to facilitate a full-scale invasion of northern Israel, becomes clearer. For months, both government and military leaders awaited a diplomatic resolution with Hezbollah to withdraw its forces. However, with Hezbollah’s persistent attacks on northern communities, Israel has had no choice but to act, leading to the evacuation of thousands of residents from villages along the Lebanese border. On Monday alone, Metula endured 12 more rocket barrages. 'Kila represents everything Hezbollah had planned,' says Colonel Avraham Marciano, commander of the 769th Brigade, after crossing into Lebanese territory. From this vantage point, Marciano explains, Hezbollah fighters once targeted the northern Galilee and even the Hula Valley. Standing at a lookout where, last January, Hezbollah terrorists launched an anti-tank missile that struck the Ayalon family’s living room in Kibbutz Kfar Yuval, killing Mira Ayalon and her son Barak as they ate lunch, Marciano recounts the discovery of an underground network for surveillance and intelligence gathering aimed at coordinating attacks on Israel. 'Today, we're settling the score and dismantling Hezbollah’s infrastructure,' Marciano declared. In recent days, IDF soldiers have left their mark on the Lebanese side of the border wall, painting over Hezbollah graffiti honoring the slain leader Hassan Nasrallah. These walls, initially erected as a defensive barrier to delay enemy advances until reinforcements could arrive, were a response to Hezbollah’s longstanding threat. Standing mere meters from Metula's orchards, near a Hezbollah-owned gas station, Marciano points to a tunnel that had been primed for attack but did not breach Israel’s border. 'Fifty meters from here, inside those ruins, we discovered a tunnel entrance where they planned their invasion route. It’s a complex hundreds of meters long. They intended to move beneath the main street of Kila, regroup, and launch an assault from there,' he says. Hezbollah had planned for over 1,000 fighters from Kila to spearhead the assault on the eastern Galilee. As part of ongoing operations, IDF forces are systematically neutralizing these threats, both above and below ground. David, one of the soldiers, participated in locating the tunnel. 'We found it still equipped with digging tools. Nearly every building we entered contained terror infrastructure: shafts, tunnels, weapons, ammunition, combat vests, and medical supplies,' he said. Marciano estimates that the brigade is about two-thirds of the way through its mission. 'I believe it will take just a few more weeks to completely eliminate Hezbollah’s invasion capabilities,' he says. However, the thunder of artillery and the wail of sirens in Metula signal that the task of restoring security to the region is far from over. The sight of Kila’s gas station reminds me of years spent observing locals living under Hezbollah’s influence on the other side of the border fence, where terrorists documented and harassed our movements. Villagers from Kila often threw stones or waved hostile gestures at us and shone laser pointers into Metula’s homes. Now, I find myself on the Lebanese side, amid the ruins of that very gas station. Dust covers the ground, and in the rubble, I spot a receipt dated September 2023 from the gas station. Apparently, a Ferrari owner had filled up with 80 liters of gas, bought five liters of motor oil, and paid $450 for it all, including a car wash. Returning to Israel, I meet David Azulai, head of the Metula Local Council, who surveys the view of Kila from across the border. Over 60% of homes in Metula have been destroyed by Hezbollah rockets, he says. Despite his admiration for the IDF’s work, he expresses concern that the ground operation might conclude prematurely. 'It’s impressive, yes, but I have to think ahead,' Azulai says. 'What will happen a month from now when the army isn’t here? We’ve heard promises like this too many times.' Azulai is deeply worried that political leaders, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, might halt the mission without fully restoring security to the region. He is firmly against a negotiated settlement to end the war. 'There’s no need for an agreement that binds us to the other side,' he argues. 'We need to set the conditions and make it clear that any future violation will lead to an even more decisive response.' Azulai hopes the shattered villages on the Lebanese side will remain so, as a stark reminder to Lebanon of the cost of provoking Israel. 'We need a clear buffer zone from here to the Litani River.' The IDF now faces the task of proving to Metula and its surrounding communities that they are safe. 'We’re only halfway through this journey. I’m far from feeling secure here,' says Riki Gino, a native of the village and the council’s CEO. Like her parents’ home, her house was destroyed by Hezbollah rockets. 'I need to know what comes next. We need visible assurance that it’s safe to live here again.'

Watch injured IDF soldiers as they are evacuated from war zones	Since the beginning of the conflict, over 1,800 wounded have been airlifted from Gaza and southern Lebanon by Unit 669 and Air Force helicopters; Watch their heroic efforts to safeguard the wounded as bullets are still flying The Unit 669 combat search and rescue extraction unit, medical teams and Air Force helicopters have whisked more than 1,800 wounded from war zones over the past year. On Tuesday evening, the IDF unveiled footage capturing the pulse-pounding moments of these helicopter rescues: 'The fourth is on the ramp, the doctor is coming,' the teams called out in one of the videos documenting the seconds that the helicopter was on the ground. Since the start of the conflict, the Medical Corps, Unit 669 teams, and rescue helicopters have been active in three combat zones: the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon, and the West Bank. This week, the IDF has inaugurated a salute week for wounded and disabled IDF soldiers from the Gaza war, including many of those airlifted. Throughout the last year, Sikorsky CH-53 Yasur and Black Hawk helicopters have soared on over a thousand rescue sorties, leading to the evacuation and saving of more than 1,800 wounded. To date, about 200 of them have been airlifted from the northern sector, and approximately 1,600 from the southern sector, with additional wounded evacuated from various areas and incidents. Air Force helicopters undertake complex missions in compromised territories, supported by aircraft executing fire strikes to neutralize threats in the area. This is all to join forces with ground combat units and deliver advanced, life-saving care even as bullets rain down upon them. Senior caregivers work shoulder-to-shoulder with ground forces, ensuring initial medical response until evacuation arrives to guarantee the swiftest and most efficient life-saving treatment. 'Activities of the Medical Corps teams and the Air Force rescue teams have saved the lives of many combatants in all war arenas,' according to IDF spokesperson. On Tuesday, the Rehabilitation Division of the Ministry of Defense released its data: About 12,000 wounded IDF and security forces personnel have been received by the Rehabilitation Division since the beginning of the Gaza war, including 910 wounded evacuated to hospitals in the north since the start of the ground maneuver in Lebanon on October 1. Of these, 140 have already been received by the Rehabilitation Division, marking a 50% increase compared to security personnel wounded in the north last month who sought continued treatment. The remaining wounded were classified as lightly injured and returned to combat after receiving medical treatment. About 1,500 were injured twice in the war year. IDF's data stands at 5,184 wounded since the beginning of the war, but does not account for security personnel who are not soldiers, such as Shin Bet, police officers, emergency team members and those injured in routine events. The average annual cost of the treatment and economic support package for those wounded in war is estimated at about $40,000 per person.

US faces interceptor missile shortage amid Gaza war, global threa...	US sees missile stockpile depleting after over a year of aiding Israel in Gaza and the Red Sea; This raises concerns about US military readiness amid potential conflicts with Chinese aggression toward Taiwan and Russian aggression toward Ukraine The U.S. is facing a significant depletion of interceptor missiles after over a year of backing Israel in the Gaza conflict, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. This drain on U.S. military stockpiles is sparking anxiety in Washington over its readiness to respond to new potential flashpoints in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific, where tensions with China, poised to invade Taiwan, are escalating. American officials informed the paper that concerns about a potential missile shortfall have intensified following Israel’s recent strike on Iran, which might provoke Iranian retaliation with another salvo of ballistic missiles. The shortage pertains mainly to guided missiles from the AEGIS system, deployed on some U.S. Navy destroyers. These ship-launched missiles, pivotal in protecting Israel over the past year against direct Iranian assaults in April and early October, are the SM-3 models, each costing $15 million. These interceptors are essential for U.S. efforts against drone and missile attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen targeting Israel and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Since the conflict’s onset on October 7 of last year, the U.S. has reportedly fired over 100 'Standard' missiles. The Pentagon has declined to disclose the exact number of interceptors in its arsenal to prevent this information from being leveraged by Iran and its proxies. 'Over the past year, the Department of Defense has adjusted its regional deployments to protect U.S. forces and aid in defending Israel, while considering U.S. readiness and stockpiles,' stated Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh. The Wall Street Journal highlights the challenges the U.S. faces in ramping up production of these missiles. The main hurdle is the reluctance of U.S. companies to invest heavily in new production lines without guarantees of sustained Pentagon purchases. Carlos Del Toro, a senior Pentagon official overseeing the Navy, noted some progress in producing two models of Standard missiles, but acknowledged significant obstacles remain in boosting production. 'The more sophisticated the missile, the harder it is to manufacture,' he explained. These missiles are pricey, with each costing several million dollars, and the U.S. often launches two interceptors per detected threat. According to Navy data, since the war began last year, the cost of interceptions by American ships against Iranian and Houthi missiles and drones has reached $1.8 billion. A U.S. congressional source expressed frustration, stating, 'These are very expensive munitions to shoot down subpar Houthi targets,' noting the significantly lower production costs for Iranian missiles and drones. 'Each interceptor takes months to replace at a very high cost.' U.S. sources also voiced concerns about the Pentagon's ability to replenish its stocks as quickly as they're depleted. Adding to this strain is the extensive military assistance the U.S. is channeling to Ukraine, embroiled in a protracted conflict with Russia for over two and a half years. 'The U.S. hasn't developed a defense industrial base designed for large-scale attrition wars in both Europe and the Middle East while maintaining readiness standards,' remarked Elias Youssef, a security researcher at the Stimson Center in Washington. 'These are prolonged conflicts not accounted for in U.S. security planning.' RTX, the company developing Standard missiles, can produce several hundred annually. However, not all are destined for the U.S., as the company serves 14 other countries. As part of the 'arms economy,' during the Iranian attack on October 1, the U.S. and the Israeli Defense Forces sometimes refrained from intercepting certain missiles if they weren't targeting sensitive areas. Deployment of the THAAD air defense system to Israel is reportedly linked to concerns about the Standard missile shortage, as THAAD uses different missiles. The Pentagon has also sent additional Patriot batteries to the Middle East, despite their own limitations, as they are also being dispatched to Ukraine. American sources and commentators have warned that the rapid depletion rate of missiles could leave the U.S. 'more exposed' to potential conflicts in the Pacific, where concerns over China's aggressive behavior are rising. 'We've depleted a year's worth of Standard missiles, meant to bolster our defenses against China,' Mark Montgomery, a former U.S. Navy admiral and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the newspaper. Ynet analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that the agreement with the U.S. to deploy the THAAD air defense system in Israel stemmed as much from American constraints as from Israeli needs. IDF requires additional American interceptors and launchers to counter potential massive Iranian missile barrages. In such scenarios, the more missiles launched in a single or dual salvo to overwhelm defense systems, the more interceptors, launchers, and radars are required. Israel has multiple layers of interceptor missile systems. At the top is the Arrow 3 system, targeting missiles hundreds of miles outside the atmosphere. Below it is Arrow 2, intercepting missiles near the atmospheric boundary, over 62 miles away. Further below is David's Sling, designed for defense against long-range missiles within the atmosphere. The lowest layer is Iron Dome, providing localized protection and intercepting short-range missiles within about 62 miles.

US lawmakers to Macron: 'Call to halt arms sales to Israel encour...	Eighteen U.S. lawmakers sent a scathing letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, in which they made it clear that they are deeply troubled by his call for an end to arms sales to Israel. They emphasized that Iran also threatens the security of the United States and France, and made it clear that Paris must support Israel's efforts to eradicate terrorism, protect its citizens and return the 101 hostages held in Gaza. The lawmakers urged Macron to reconsider his position, and focus on diplomatic efforts to strengthen security and democracy in the Middle East. 'Your call to halt arms shipments to Israel will further encourage Iran and its proxies to escalate their attacks against Israel,' they wrote.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk4uor0lyl	2024-10-29T13:51:54-07:00	
Fallen soldier's wife is expecting their first child	Master Sergeant (Res.) Yedidia Bloch, 31, from Mevo Horon, was seriously injured in a battle in southern Lebanon last week, but died of his wounds; His wife is eight months pregnant; 'I will tell your child about you so that he knows what a special and kind man his father was' IDF reservist Master Sergeant Yedidia Bloch, 31, who was seriously injured last week in a battle in southern Lebanon, died of his wounds in the hospital on Tuesday. Bloch, a resident of Mevo Horon, was expecting his first child and is survived by his wife Sapir, who is in the eighth month of her pregnancy; he also is survived by his parents and 7 siblings. Yedidia studied at Yeshivat Chitzim in Itamar in the northern West Bank, served in the Paratroopers Brigade and also fought in the 2014 Gaza War known as Operation Protective Edge. He continued his contribution to the IDF in the reserves, and in the current war he fought in Gaza and on the northern front as part of maneuvers in Lebanon. He was seriously injured last week in a battle in southern Lebanon, and after a long struggle in the Rambam Hospital he died Tuesday from his injuries. His family describes a man whose life was full of love for the country, generosity of heart and a genuine connection to every person he met. 'He was a devoted friend, with a big heart and always ready to help others, and a figure admired by all his nephews and nieces,' said a relative. His family donated his organs in order to save others. 'Someone asked me today what the name Yedidia means - and it is enough to see the light on your face to feel your friendship. Our beloved nephew and hero, the light of his eyes, the light of his heart,' Yedidia's aunt, Naomi, said in tribute to him. Yedidia's friend, Omri, wrote: 'Seven years ago when I was hiking the Israel Trail with my friend Assi, we arrived in the evening before sunset at Mevo Horon in the Latrun area. When we arrived we were so hungry and we met people told us that there was a pizzeria at the entrance of the community. Most of all I remember the reception of Yedidia when we met him there. He took our invitation, and he came to sit with us. I later found out that he served together with one of my best childhood friends and I knew at that moment that I had met a special person.' 'He was such a handsome man, blond, tall, with bright eyes. A light-hearted, funny guy and a smiling and happy person, and just as beautiful on the inside,' wrote Omri. 'I will never forget how when we came to pay him for the pizza, he simply said that it was on him. This kindness moved me so much at that moment. I thought about what a privilege it is to meet such kind people in a way that simply gives from the heart. Yedidia Bloch, you are the beautiful Israeli. This is how I will remember you as a man and a dear friend, a man of giving, laughter and true love. I will tell your child about you as soon as he grows up - so that he knows what a special and kind man his father was.' Nissan, another friend of Yedidia, wrote: 'In October 2017, I started studying, and on the first day I saw that I and another handsome blond guy with the only knitted kippa wearers. We immediately connected and were best friends for our college years. Always smiling, never angry and looking only to help and donate. For a whole year I followed every report and names of fallen soldiers in anxiety. For five days, we hoped but unfortunately sometimes God says no. You are now close to the throne of honor. Rest in peace friend.' Yisrael Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, where Mevo Horon is located, eulogized the fallen soldier. 'All these days we prayed for Yedidia. He went into battle with self-sacrifice and lived a noble life, and thus he fought and died for the sake of the people of Israel and complete victory. Thanks to him, the people of Israel will overcome and win.' Earlier on Tuesday, the names of four soldiers killed in battle in Jabaliya in northern Gaza were announced: Captain Yehonatan (Joni) Keren, 22; Staff Sergeant Nisim Meytal,20; Staff Sergeant Aviv Gilboa, 21; and Staff Sergeant Naor Haimov; 22.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkotpa0ejx	2024-10-29T13:43:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/29/yk14132071/yk14132071_1_67_710_400_0_small.jpg

From school teacher to international terrorist - Meet Hezbollah's...	He served as the Iranian proxy's number 2 for 34 years, and now Naim Qassem gets his 15 minutes of fame as head of the terror group, officially replacing Nasrallah; He is a Hezbollah co-founder and is also a former high school teacher Hezbollah officially named Naim Qassem as its new secretary-general on Tuesday. For 34 years, Qassem served as the deputy under the recently assassinated Hassan Nasrallah and his predecessor Abbas al-Musawi. Now, he steps into the limelight and into the thick of the conflict. Qassem wasn't the first pick to succeed Nasrallah. However, following the assassination of Hashem Safieddine, who was set to be the next leader, Qassem emerged as the natural choice among the surviving top brass. Since the assassination of Nasrallah in late September, Qassem has delivered three speeches for Hezbollah. His initial speech seemed unpolished; he appeared nervous, sweated a lot, and the background hinted he was in hiding. His third speech showed improvement, possibly due to feedback on his earlier appearances. In his latest address, Qassem declared: 'We are no longer in the phase of 'support' for Gaza but in direct confrontation with an Israeli war against us.' He claimed this shift began with the operation to blow up pagers in Lebanon. He insisted the organization is still operational and promised a new Secretary-General would be appointed soon. It's unclear if he knew then that he would assume the role. Naim Qassem has been a key figure in the terrorist organization for decades. Born in 1953 in the Al-Basta al-Tahta area of Beirut, his family hails from the Shiite-majority village of Qafar Fila in southern Lebanon. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, he is married with six children. Qassem has held the position of Deputy Secretary-General since 1991, during the tenure of former Secretary-General Abbas al-Moussawi, who was assassinated in 1992 by Israel. He remained in the role after Nasrallah's appointment. He began his political career with the Shiite Amal Movement in Lebanon, founded in 1974, and left in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution. Qassem participated in the meetings that led to Hezbollah's formation in 1982 and became one of its prominent spokesmen. He also served as the general coordinator for Hezbollah's parliamentary election campaigns since the organization first ran in 1992. Qassem studied under Shiite scholars in Lebanon while pursuing academic studies at the University of Lebanon in 1971, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry. He completed his master's degree in chemistry in 1977. Subsequently, Qassem worked as a high school teacher for six years. He helped establish the 'Lebanese Union of Muslim Students' during his university years to spread Islamic ideas in the 1970s. Over the years, he also served on Hezbollah's Shura Council. In 2005, he authored a book on Hezbollah's history, offering a rare glimpse into the organization. About six years ago, the U.S. government designated Qassem as an 'international terrorist,' subjecting him to economic and business sanctions. Earlier this month, a report from the Emirates, based on an Iranian source, claimed Qassem fled to Iran at the start of October, fearing assassination by Israel. According to the unverified report, he has been in Tehran since October 5. It was also alleged that he left Lebanon on an Iranian plane, accompanied by Abbas Araghchi, Tehran's foreign minister, first to Syria and then to Iran. The source claimed Qassem's last two speeches were actually delivered from Khamenei's homeland. Report: Shura Council made the decision - not Tehran The London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat published an article about Hezbollah's Shura Council, suggesting that if it managed to convene, it indicates – according to sources close to the organization – that the council has regrouped after significant setbacks and can now hold meetings of senior Hezbollah leaders despite security risks. It was also suggested that if the council convened, it shows Tehran did not take over Hezbollah's political and military leadership after Nasrallah's assassination, contrary to rumors. The paper noted that Hezbollah's organizational structure is divided into three main frameworks: The first—the Secretary-General, who holds extensive powers The second—the Shura Council, whose members head four organizational councils: the Jihad Council, the Legal Council, the Governmental and Parliamentary Work Council, and the Political Council The third—the Executive Council (formerly led by Safi al-Din before his assassination). The Executive Council is Hezbollah's core, from which most organizational units branch out. Among the councils, the Shura Council is the most important. The Shura Council includes seven members: the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, who is also the Chairman of the Shura Council, the Deputy Secretary-General of Hezbollah—Head of the Legal Council Mohammad Yazbak, Head of the Political Council Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid, Head of the Executive Council—recently assassinated—Hashem Saffiedine, the political assistant to the Hezbollah Secretary-General Hussein Khalil, the head of the parliamentary branch and leader of Hezbollah's party in the Lebanese parliament, 'Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc' (Hezbollah's political arm), Mohammad Raad. With Qassem's appointment, two positions remain vacant in the Shura Council: the Deputy Secretary-General and Chairman of the Executive Council. Qassem Kassir, a political researcher interviewed by the newspaper, said a Deputy Secretary-General has not yet been appointed and that it is a crucial appointment, 'a message from within and outside that Hezbollah is active and monitoring affairs.' Other sources interviewed did not rule out that even if a deputy to the new Secretary-General is appointed, his identity will not be disclosed, as he would become a strategic target for Israel, similar to Naim Qassem, who wants Hezbollah to remain leaderless.

GOP works to turn out pro-Trump Jewish voters in swing states to ...	The door-to-door outreach to Jewish voters with a history of backing Republicans is part of a new effort the Republican Jewish Coalition is undertaking this year in five presidential battleground states in hopes of boosting Trump Rachel Weinberg calls herself a religious Jew first, then a proud American. She said she had only one choice for president: Donald Trump. 'I don’t like everything he says,' the 72-year-old retired preschool teacher from Michigan said after volunteer canvassers for the Republican Jewish Coalition knocked on her door Sunday. 'But I vote for Israel. It is our life. I support Israel. Trump supports Israel with his mouth and his actions.' Weinberg’s home in West Bloomfield, in vote-rich Oakland County, was among more than 20 that the Republican Jewish Coalition was visiting that morning. She has voted for Trump in previous elections as well. The door-to-door outreach to Jewish voters with a history of backing Republicans is part of a new effort the group is undertaking this year in five presidential battleground states in hopes of boosting Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. Although surveys show that Jews vote decidedly Democratic, the Republican Jewish Coalition is hoping that the door-knocking will peel off enough votes to make a difference in an election year when the war between Israel and Hamas has stoked debate and provoked division. About 7 in 10 Jewish voters nationally backed Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, while about 3 in 10 backed Trump that year, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping electorate survey. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. Biden carried Michigan in 2020 by fewer than 155,000 votes out of roughly 5.5 million cast. Although Jewish voters account for only 2% of the state’s voters, the 15,000 new Jewish Republican voters the coalition has identified since the 2020 election — out of roughly 120,000 Jewish voters in the state — could make an impact in what is shaping up to be a very close race, said Sam Markstein, an RJC spokesperson. The Republican Jewish Coalition’s targeting is very specific in Michigan, as it is in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Here, its work is centered in Oakland County, the state’s second most populous county, with 1.3 million people just northwest of Detroit. It focuses on the upper-middle-class suburbs of Farmington Hills, Oak Park, Southfield, and West Bloomfield — the township with the state’s largest Jewish population, where Israeli flags hang in some front windows. Biden defeated Trump in 2020, 66% to 33%, in the West Bloomfield Township precinct where 82-year-old David Cuttner and 22-year-old Noam Nedivi were canvassing for the coalition on Sunday. The margin was not far off the national trend. The coalition’s robust effort is aimed at chipping away at Democrats’ advantages in this voting bloc. 'This includes direct mail, social, and digital, all hyper-targeted to the Jewish community. And it’s going to be a full thrust, the largest investment ever to turn out Jewish voters for Republicans,' Markstein said. The Republican Jewish Coalition has purchased $15 million in advertising in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. But it’s the $5 million it has committed to door-to-door outreach that is new for this election, chiefly its investment in voter data aimed at more efficiently identifying potential Trump supporters. Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said in a statement that Jewish voters are a key part of a winning Democratic coalition. 'Kamala Harris shares the views and values of the majority of American Jews, while Donald Trump threatens and denigrates us, trafficks in antisemitic rhetoric, aligns with dangerous extremists, and aspires to be a dictator on day one,' Soifer said. Tensions have been high since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took 250 people hostage. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the subsequent fighting, according to Gaza health officials. Republicans were more likely than Democrats to be supportive of Israel, while Democrats were more likely to be critical, a survey by the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found in September. The fighting has intensified the focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which has provided at least $17.9 billion in military aid since the war began. Many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests in cities and college campuses have made them feel unsafe. Nedivi, who was canvassing Sunday, said he had been a victim of antisemitism at the Michigan college he attends. Zeke Aharonov had an alternative message for his fellow observant Jews after standing in a line of more than 200 people to cast his early vote at the West Bloomfield library Sunday. 'As Jews, we must be attentive to fascism and to fight it,' the 26-year-old cybersecurity tech said as he left the library. 'And our way of fighting fascism is to vote against Donald Trump.'

Pentagon reassigns worker who leaked Iran attack plans to role wi...	Ariane Tabatabai to be moved to a position overseeing education and training within the Defense Secretary’s office; Pentagon still denies she was the leaker The Pentagon has reassigned Ariane Tabatabai, whose name has been linked to a leak of intelligence documents regarding Israel’s strike plans on Iran, to a role with significantly reduced access to intelligence and classified military plans. Although the Pentagon denied Tabatabai’s involvement in the leak, given her previous connections to Iran, it decided to move her to a position overseeing education and training within the Defense Secretary’s office. Tabatabai served as the head of the Office of Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a role that gave her unique access to high-level classified intelligence and information on nearly all U.S. covert operations. Her new position, by contrast, provides significantly limited access to intelligence and classified operational plans. Independent of the leak controversy, some Republican members of Congress have spent the past year pushing to revoke Tabatabai’s security clearance over reported ties to Tehran. Sky News Arabic reported a week ago that Tabatabai was the source of the leaked documents, which covered preparations for an Israeli strike on Iran and were published prior to the operation’s launch. Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder denied these reports, stating that the Pentagon is investigating the matter and coordinating with Israel. To date, the source of the leak has not been identified. Tabatabai, an American of Iranian descent, previously held access to highly classified information. She formerly worked with Robert Malley, President Joe Biden’s ex-special envoy for Iran, who was dismissed about a year ago over improper connections with the Islamic Republic.

Migrant workers in Lebanon left stranded as war with Israel conti...	Caregiving remains a lifeline for Middle Eastern households, but these migrant workers battle loneliness, exploitation and insufficient protections amid regional crises; Home care in Israel is also heavily dependent on foreign workers In Lebanon, a country facing widespread destruction and displacement caused by the conflict with Israel, migrant caregivers are among the most vulnerable populations. Bram Frouws, director of the Mixed Migration Centre, highlighted the significant vulnerability of migrant care workers in Lebanon amid the ongoing conflict. 'Since the escalation of the war began, many employers fled the country or fled north, and left their migrant workers without pay, shelter, or food, and many were left stranded,' he said. 'Many migrant workers have now been left sleeping on the streets, with no access to basic necessities or humanitarian aid. Shelters often only permit entry for Lebanese citizens.' The immigration status of migrant workers in Lebanon is tied to the individual employer, Frouws explained, which opens up Lebanon’s 175,000 migrant workers to exploitation and abuse even during peacetime. Now, that vulnerability has been amplified. Many of these migrant workers don’t have access to their passports, which are held by the employers. 'Lacking financial resources and documentation really makes it near impossible to escape,' Frouws said. Language barriers, restricted mobility, limited social networks, and discrimination all exacerbate the situation. Frouws expressed concern that migrant workers are being left out of government and humanitarian responses to the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon. 'This is often the case with migrants who are caught up in a sudden conflict,' he said. October 29 marks the International Day of Care and Support, a day dedicated to recognizing and raising awareness about the vital role of caregivers. The UN established the day to spark conversations about the importance of care work, both paid and unpaid, which serves as the backbone of society and ensures that individuals and systems can thrive and function smoothly. Those conversations have a special significance in the Middle East, which relies heavily on migrant domestic workers to provide care to elderly and disabled individuals. Despite the critical contributions of migrant caregivers in Middle Eastern households, most still face unfair and unsafe working conditions, including long hours, minimal rest time, and vulnerability to exploitation. Legal protections and social safeguards for these caregivers are often inadequate or poorly enforced. Home care in Israel is also heavily dependent on foreign workers. As of the end of 2023, more than 75,000 foreign caregivers were working in Israel, according to data from the Population and Immigration Authority. The caregivers come from a diverse range of countries, with the largest groups hailing from the Philippines (26,673), India (19,924), and Uzbekistan (12,335). Many also come from Moldova, Sri Lanka, and Ukraine. About 60,000 of the workers have documents to work in Israel, and the other 15,000 do not. Meytal Russo, deputy executive director of Kav LaOved, an Israeli nonprofit dedicated to securing equal labor rights for all workers, explains that foreign caregivers in Israel face a complex and challenging bureaucracy. 'About 95% to 99% are coming with legal documentation, allowing them to stay here for five years and three months,' Russo said. That period applies to all foreign workers, but caregivers can apply to extend their stay to continue to serve the same elderly or disabled patient they had been caring for. 'There is a lot of bureaucracy involved in that,' Russo said. 'Caregivers are required to be available 24 hours a day, six days a week and are obliged to stay at the patient’s home,' she said. These workers receive only minimum wage without overtime pay and are excluded from the law mandating breaks. 'This exclusion stems from a Supreme Court decision that ruled it is impossible to quantify a caregiver’s rest time due to the nature of their work,' Russo explained. She also raised concerns about the high brokerage fees paid by caregivers to come to Israel. 'Many workers pay between $7,000 and $30,000 in fees, creating significant financial burdens,' she said, noting that most workers still rely on private work placement agencies despite government attempts to regulate the process through bilateral agreements. 'The situation remains business to business, with undocumented payments being made to private agencies abroad and sometimes to agencies within Israel.' The vast majority of migrant caregivers in Israel are women, and these female caregivers face substantial risks of sexual harassment and assault, Russo said. Often the perpetrator is a patient with dementia or one of the patient’s family members. 'The vulnerability of a migrant woman working in a home is very high,' Russo explained. Physical demands of the work also add to caregivers’ challenges, with many experiencing orthopedic issues due to heavy lifting and inadequate professional support. Living in a patient’s private home and developing a relationship with the patient and the family can also be challenging. 'There is a wide spectrum, with some very good relationships and others that are quite bad,' Russo said. All these challenges can lead migrant caregivers to experience burnout. 'If you are burnt out in a regular job, you can find another one,' Russo said. 'But here, you’re tied to the same employer, which creates a dangerous situation for both the caregiver and the patient.' Migrant caregiving is especially widespread in Gulf Cooperation Council countries. According to Migrant-Rights.org, a GCC-based advocacy organization focused on advancing migrant workers’ rights, over 90% of Kuwaiti households employ migrant domestic workers. The 620,000 migrant domestic workers in Kuwait represent more than 22% of the country’s total workforce. These workers often face significant disparities in wages and working conditions. In Bahrain, migrant domestic workers account for 10% of the entire workforce and 37% of the female workforce. Migrant workers dominate the domestic work sector in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, making up 95% of all domestic workers and personal assistants. About 20% of all foreign workers in the UAE perform domestic work. Around 96% of Emirati families hire domestic workers to care for their children. These 750,000 or so workers perform an estimated 80% of parental duties, outnumbering family members in 22% of Emirati households. Domestic workers constitute about 20% of the total expatriate workforce in the country. Domestic workers in Saudi Arabia face particularly long hours, averaging 63.7 hours per week – the second-highest rate globally. Similarly, in Qatar, domestic workers average 60 hours of work per week. Wages remain a significant issue for migrant domestic workers. In Qatar, domestic workers earn less than 30% of the average national wage, while in Kuwait, their earnings are under 30% of the average national wage. The minimum monthly wage for domestic workers in Kuwait is $147, but enforcement mechanisms to guarantee this payment are insufficient. In Saudi Arabia, domestic workers from Sri Lanka earn just 20% of the private sector’s minimum wage, receiving approximately $80-$100 per month. Santhosh, a 35-year-old caregiver from India, came to Israel last year. 'My patient is in very good condition and very supportive to me, so I am happy to be here,' he said. But he quietly added that he found the relentless nature of the job and the distance from his family to be challenging. 'It’s very lonely,' Santhosh said. 'Facebook and WhatsApp help, but I miss my family. I feel a constant loneliness.' Despite the difficulty, he expressed a sense of determination. 'I want to continue working, and I’m grateful for the opportunity,' he said. For a caregiver from the Philippines who asked to remain anonymous, the hardest part of the job is the emotional isolation. 'I was prepared for hard work, and I do it to support my family,' she said. 'But here, I became very lonely.' 'I feel like my whole life is online, and the rest is just me working. Nothing else,' she said. -This article is written by Veronica Neifakh and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1119gq0ljg	2024-10-29T10:06:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/29/SyLNXiRxye/SyLNXiRxye_0_0_3000_2065_0_small.jpg

Ministry's Rehabilitation Division reports at least 900 of injuries took place in Lebanon since start of IDF ground operation in region; Male reservist soldiers highest injured demographic Approximately 12,000 IDF soldiers and security force personnel wounded since the start of the Gaza war have been admitted to the Defense Ministry’s Rehabilitation Division, including 910 injured who were evacuated to hospitals in the north since the beginning of the military’s ground operation in Lebanon on October 1. Of these, 140 have already been registered to the Rehabilitation Division, marking a 50% increase compared to security forces personnel wounded in the north last month who requested continued treatment. The remaining wounded, classified as lightly injured, returned to service after receiving medical care. Around 1,500 individuals have been wounded twice over the course of the year-long ongoing war. Notably, IDF statistics record 5,184 wounded since the start of the war, though they don’t account for non-military security personnel, such as Shin Bet operatives, police officers, alert squad members and those wounded in routine incidents. The average annual cost for treatment and financial support for a wounded soldier is estimated at approximately 150,000 shekels ($40,000) per person. The Rehabilitation Division's budget, which stood at 5.4 billion shekels (about $1.5 billion) before October 7, 2023, has increased to 7.3 billion shekels (about $2 billion). However, division head Limor Luria warns that further budget increases are needed to provide adequate care. 'We need budgetary support,' she said on Tuesday. 'We've reached out to the Finance Ministry to help us address the high number of casualties, which is expected to grow in the coming years, and provide them with optimal care.' Men comprise 93% of the wounded; the percentage of women in the division remains at 7%, but the nature of injuries has evolved and the number of female combatants has increased. Of the wounded, 66% are reservists, 51% are aged 18-30 and approximately 8,500 (66%) face physical injuries. Among them, 14% are classified with moderate-to-severe injuries, including 377 with head injuries, of which 23 required skull reconstruction using a 3D printer. Eye injuries impacted 308 individuals, with 12 losing vision and needing prosthetics. Additionally, 104 suffered spinal injuries and roughly 60 had limb amputations requiring advanced prosthetic adaptations, five of whom required fittings abroad. A total of 5,200 (43%) developed psychological response conditions including anxiety, depression, adjustment issues and PTSD. The division anticipates the number will rise. 'It’s still early to gauge the extent of psychological injuries as these effects solidify over time,' Luria added. Each month, the division admits around 1,000 new wounded personnel, alongside roughly 500 additional recognition requests for past incidents. The number of individuals treated by the division has grown by 20% in a year, reaching approximately 74,000. The Rehabilitation Division estimates there will be around 100,000 disabled IDF veterans by 2030, 50% of whom will be dealing with psychological trauma. As of October 6, 2023, elderly disabled IDF veterans constituted about 50% of all disabled veterans. This dynamic has shifted considerably with the intake of younger wounded personnel, prompting the division to tailor support for educational reintegration, vocational training and occupational rehabilitation for the wounded. The Rehabilitation Division said it is continuing its 'rehabilitation before bureaucracy' policy, providing immediate medical and psychological care for all injured personnel while postponing medical evaluations for a year. Currently, 22,000 individuals dealing with psychological challenges are receiving support through various frameworks: 500 therapists have been recruited and 10 rehabilitation facilities have been established across the country. These offer body-mind workshops, discussion circles and varied agricultural activities. In the future, family-oriented activities will also be held at these locations. Additionally, PPS (primary psychological support) mobile units have been set up to provide immediate mental health aid and three care homes have been opened specifically for war-wounded personnel. IDF Disabled Veterans Organization Chairman Idan Kliman commented on the latest data, saying: 'At this time, when the State of Israel has a moral and ethical debt to wounded IDF soldiers who have sacrificed, and continue to sacrifice, their bodies and minds for the country’s survival, the Israeli government has decided to harm these soldiers in the 2025 Economic Arrangements Law by freezing their compensation for injuries sustained in service.' 'This decision continues the government’s total disregard for wounded IDF veterans, severely violating agreements with the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization and government resolutions, directly hindering the rehabilitation of our heroes and undermining national resilience,' he added.

Erdogan says Turkey aims to have 'Steel Dome' air defense system	President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Turkey aimed to have its own 'Steel Dome' multi-layered air defense system soon, adding that Ankara would also increase its long-range missile capabilities. NATO member Turkey has in recent years significantly reduced its dependence on external suppliers of defense equipment. It has become a leading manufacturer of armed drones for the global market and produces much of its own defense needs at home. Speaking at a ceremony in Ankara to inaugurate the home-made Gokbey helicopter for use by the gendarmerie at the headquarters of the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS), which was targeted by a deadly Kurdish militant attack last week, Erdogan likened the 'Steel Dome' to Israel's famed Iron Dome. 'It is understood much better now how vitally important our multi-layered air defense systems are for our security. If they (Israel) have an 'Iron Dome', we will have a 'Steel Dome'. We won't look at them and say 'why don't we have this',' Erdogan said, without giving a specific timeline. 'We will increase our long-range missile capabilities during this period too,' he added, saying Turkey would 'not rest' until it achieved full independence in the defense industry.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkp2wkagke	2024-10-29T07:41:38-07:00

New satellite images from Iran: Attack damaged Iran Revolutionary...	New footage following Israel's retaliatory strike on Iranian territory reveals damage to the Shahroud base, where the IRGC launches satellites into space; Iran is 'still assessing the damage' Israel’s attack on Iran over the weekend likely damaged a base run by the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard that builds ballistic missiles and launches rockets as part of its own space program, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press on Tuesday showed. The damage at the base in Shahroud raises new questions about the early Saturday attack, which took place in an area previously unacknowledged by Tehran and which involved the IRGC, a powerful force within Iran’s theocracy that so far has remained silent about any possible damage it suffered from the retaliatory strike. Iran only has identified Israeli attacks as taking place in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces — not in rural Semnan province where the base is located. It also potentially further restrains the Guard’s ability to manufacture the solid-fuel ballistic missiles it needs to stockpile as a deterrent against Israel. Tehran long has relied on that arsenal as it cannot purchase the advanced Western weapons that Israel and Tehran’s Gulf Arab neighbors have armed themselves with over the years, particularly from the United States. Satellite photos earlier analyzed by the AP of two military bases near Tehran also targeted by Israel show that sites there that Iran uses in its ballistic missile manufacturing have been destroyed, further squeezing its program. 'We don’t know if Iranian production has been crippled as some people are saying or just damaged,' said Fabian Hinz, a missile expert and research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who studies Iran. 'We’ve seen enough imagery to show there’s an impact.' Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The IDF declined to answer questions from the AP, but sent a previous statement acknowledging it targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities' in the attack. Images show major building at Shahroud base destroyed High-resolution satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken for and analyzed by the AP showed the damage at the Guard’s Shahroud Space Center in Semnan, some 370 kilometers (230 miles) northeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Semnan also hosts the Imam Khomeini Space Center, which is used by Iran’s civilian space program. The images showed a central, major building at the Shahroud Space Center had been destroyed, the shadow of its still-standing frame seen in the image taken Tuesday morning. Vehicles could be seen gathered around the site, likely from officials inspecting the damage, with more cars than normal parked at the site’s main gate nearby. Three small buildings just to the south of the main structure also appeared to be damaged. Iran has been constructing new buildings at the base in recent months. Another hangar to the northeast of the main building also appeared to have been damaged. Iran has not acknowledged any attack at Shahroud. However, given the damage done to multiple structures, it suggested the Israeli attack included pinpoint strikes on the base. Low-resolution images since the attack showed signs of damage at the site not seen before the assault — further pointing to Israeli missile strikes as being the culprit. 'We can’t 100% exclude the possibility it’s something else, but it’s almost certain this building got damaged because of an Israeli attack,' Hinz said. Given that the large building had been surrounded by earthen berms, that suggests it handled high explosives, said Hinz, who long has studied the site. That central site likely deals with solid propellant mixing and casting operations, he added. Large boxes next to the building likely are missile motor crates as well, Hinz said. Their sizes suggest they could be used for Iran’s Kheibar Shekan ballistic missile and the Fattah 1, a missile that Iran has claimed is able to reach Mach 15 — which is 15 times the speed of sound. Both have been used in Iran’s attacks on Israel during the Israel-Hamas war and the later ground invasion of Lebanon. The strike at Shahroud, coupled with others across the country, likely have put more pressure on Iran’s theocracy, particularly as it assesses the damage to its main weapon arsenal and tries to downplay the attack. 'Due to preparedness and vigilance of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s armed forces, and timely reaction by the country’s air defense, limited damage was caused to some of the points hit,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi claimed in a meeting with foreign diplomats Tuesday in Tehran. 'Necessary measures were taken immediately to restore the damaged equipment to operational state.' US worries Guard’s space program a cover for missile research A short distance from the destroyed buildings sits a concrete launch pad used by the Guard, which has conducted a series of successful missions putting satellites into space using mobile launchers. The Guard, which answers only to 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, revealed its secret space program back in 2020. The U.S. intelligence community’s 2024 worldwide threat assessment said Iran’s continued development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline to produce' an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. Parchin, one of the two military bases near Tehran targeted by Israel, saw a building linked to that program destroyed. 'Like with Iran’s nuclear program, you don’t build the system itself, you build all the technology under cover of a civilian program,' Hinz said. Then, Iran could make the decision to pursue the weapon — or use its knowledge as a bargaining chip with the West over international sanctions. But for now, the satellite photos suggest Iran is still trying to assess the aftermath of Israel’s attack. 'The picture that is emerging is one of significant damage to Iranian air defenses as well as missile launch facilities, both of which would be intended to show the Iranians that they are vulnerable to further strikes if they attempt retaliation,' an analysis published Monday by two experts at Britain’s Royal United Services Institute said.

Within walking distance: Six bereaved families mourn fallen soldi...	Grieving Jerusalem families, friends and comrades gather at the capital to mourn the losses of fallen soldiers from the city; these are their stories The homes of families mourning their loved ones killed in the war are easy to find. Buildings draped in Israeli flags with condolence notices at the entrance have become part of the landscape. Dozens of bereaved families across the country are sitting shiva, a number of them in Jerusalem are located just minutes from each other. Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg A mourning tent has been set up near the home of Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, who was killed in a battle in southern Lebanon. Rows of Israeli flags guide visitors there, paying respects to the deceased and marking the way. As in his life, Captain (res.) Goldberg's mourning tent is filled with a diverse crowd of people. High school students alongside older adults and female soldiers mingling among ultra-Orthodox men, all share in the painful space. One by one, the mourners shared reflections of him: a devoted educator, a gifted musician, a soldier who never missed a day of service and a cantor during the Jewish High Holidays. He was a kollel head, rabbi, teacher, father — a world. 'It’s just so him,' said his widow, Rachel, when visitors from Kibbutz Ginosar described his usual leading of Yom Kippur prayers in their kibbutz, sharing a voice message he sent with a Rosh Hashanah blessing after being unable to join them in the past holiday. 'That’s exactly who he was — he cared about everyone with all his heart.' Rabbi Goldberg left his eight children behind. 'Our father lived a life for the nation,' said his eldest son, Yehuda. 'His life was dedicated to the people of Israel, without ever considering what would be most comfortable for him. Wherever Israel needed him, that’s where he wanted to be.' Rabbi Goldberg, who fell at 43, continued serving in the reserves as both a soldier and military rabbi even after he was exempt. His absence was already felt over the past year — in his classroom, in the projects he led and most deeply, at home. 'This year prepared us to say goodbye,' Yehuda added. 'He wasn’t home often, both with us and with his students. Both God and our father made us ready for it an advance.' Warrant Officer (res.) Shmuel Harari A short walk away, another building bears the same painful front. The parents, widow and three children of Warrant Officer (res.) Shmuel Harari, who fell in Lebanon, are gathered at the widow Anna’s parents' home. Seventeen years ago, Shmuel made aliyah, enlisted in the IDF, started a family and stayed on for reserve duty. His parents and siblings have flown in from the United States to sit shiva with his wife, who lives in Safed and chose to mourn at her parents’ home in Jerusalem. 'He made aliyah at 17,' his brother Aivy said. 'He finished high school and immediately came to spend a year in a yeshiva in Israel, after which he enlisted and stayed here. Our parents really wanted him to stay in the United States; our dad wanted him to go to university and earn a decent living, but it wasn’t even a consideration for him.' Aivy shared that Shmuel 'was very eager to come to Israel. For years before he finished high school, he said he would make aliyah. He was very Zionistic despite our parents’ worry. He got married and lived in Safed because that’s where his wife studied medicine and she relocated to Jerusalem during the height of the war while he spent most of the year in reserve duty.' Last summer, the family gathered for what would become an unexpected farewell meeting. 'He finished his reserve duty in the summer,' Aivy recounted. 'We had a great time together; we were so happy to meet up. He delayed his return to work for a whole month to be with us and then, after the fighting began in Lebanon, he was called back. That’s how it ended.' Sergeant Hillel Ovadia Not far from there, a large mourning tent is also being set up beneath the family home of Sergeant Hillel Ovadia, filled with many mourners. Hillel, 22, who fell in Jabalia, was an Armored Corps soldier and a trainee in the tank commander course in the 196th Battalion, having graduated from the pre-military yeshiva in Brukhin. One by one, friends from his yeshiva and the military entered the tent to share stories about the young man who was always cheerful. In the yeshiva, he would deeply engage in study for hours; when it rained, he would lead joyous dances outside and would set the tone for serious learning after returning to the study hall. Sergeant Major (Res.) Gilad Elmalich Far from there, in northern Jerusalem, the family of Sergeant Major (Res.) Gilad Elmalich, sits shiva. His parents, brother, widow and children gather to mourn. 'Gilad wasn’t home much this year,' said his widow, Shir. 'He knew he would be there whenever the Israeli people needed him. He never thought of backing down or asking not to participate in any of the missions.' 'It was about his connection to the Torah and the values he believed in so strongly,' she added. 'Everyone felt he was their best friend. He felt a timeless connection to generations of the Jewish people, and always acted from that strength. He leaped into every mission. He volunteered with Holocaust survivors, always helping and all of it stemmed from his connection to the Torah.' First Sergeant Yaakov Hillel In Jerusalem’s Neve Yaakov neighborhood, among knitted kippahs and notices against conscription to the IDF on bulletin boards, shopping centers and yeshivas, sits the shiva for First Sergeant Yaakov Hillel, 21, a Golani Brigade soldier who fell in Lebanon. Yaakov came from a Haredi family and there is a notable presence of yeshiva students and rabbis at the shiva at his home, along with his friends and military commanders. His father, Rabbi Chaim Hillel, a well-known educator in the Haredi community, sees no contradiction between his son’s life path and that of his other siblings and family members. 'It wasn’t a different path,' Rabbi Hillel says. 'It was his own way. Yaakov was the third child among ten sons and daughters, all learning in Haredi frameworks. His brothers study in yeshiva,' the father said, 'and he wanted to enlist. He wasn’t raised to do so, but that was his choice. He was a man of truth first and foremost; he paved a genuine path and when he saw what was right for him, he wasn’t concerned about what others would say. That turly characterized him.' 'One of the things that gives us the greatest comfort is that we always walked alongside him,' the father continued. 'This was a path he forged with difficulty and effort, due to the different background he had compared to most soldiers. He was filled with a sense of mission and we were always by his side.' Captain (res.) Alon Safrai The family of Captain (res.) Alon Safrai, a Jerusalem resident, is also sitting shiva nearby. Safrai, 28, was a medical student — and wasn’t obligated to serve in the reserves. 'Alon was a student for whom everything came so easily; he was a star, and everything just flowed for him,' his classmate wrote. 'We envied him because he could study for a few hours for an exam and still get good grades without too much effort. Everyone loved him. He was such a friendly guy, so helpful and a good person. Of all people, he shouldn’t have had to go,' he added.

While Israel barred from Paris tradeshow French companies supply ...	One company provides a radar with a range of 170 kilometers (105 miles) to Guard's naval vessel while nine others supply Iran's energy sector While France banned Israeli security industry companies from participating in the Euronaval tradeshow in Paris in June, some of the 233 French companies that will take part in the event, were known to be licensed suppliers of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) naval vessels and the country's coast guard and nine companies were listed by Iran as authorized suppliers of its oil and energy industries. Some of the Iranian companies the French firms were doing business with, were under U.S.-imposed sanctions. The annual exhibition features hundreds of international companies that develop naval vessels and weapons and has always included numerous representatives of Israel's defense industries. Although the event is scheduled for June, preparations start many months in advance. An Israeli source said that France has become a symbol of left-wing embargoes on Israel, noting that French companies had asked President Emmanuel Macron to ban Israeli companies for commercial reasons behind the scenes. One French company provided a radar with a maximum range of over 170 kilometers (105 miles) that was installed on an IRGC ship. France said there was never any intention to ban Israeli companies from attending French tradeshows and the French government's position cannot be seen as a boycott of Israeli firms. 'Our support of Israel and its right to defend itself has always been unequivocal,' the Elysee Palace said. 'Proof if that is evident in our decision to continue to make components for the Iron Dome missile defense system.' The palace went on to say that while France has called for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon because it is the only way to stop the escalation and achieve regional stability and peace, it would be 'inconsistent to allow the promotion of weapons' used in those fronts, that was harming civilians.' Twelve Israeli companies were interested in exhibiting at the naval fair, and local participation will almost certainly be blocked from the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, the crown jewel of such exhibitions, should this negative trend continue.

Iran plans to triple military budget, government spokesperson say...	Budget increase submitted by the government to parliament for approval includes an estimated 200% addition, government spokesperson tells local media Iran's government plans to raise its military budget by around 200%, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani was reported as saying by state media on Tuesday, after Iran and Israel exchanged attacks in recent months. The planned defense budget increase is part of a budget proposal that has been submitted by the government to parliament for approval. 'A considerable raise that amounts to 200% has been witnessed in the country's defense budget,' Mohajerani said, giving no further details. Iran and Israel have been trading missile salvoes for months, with Israel on Saturday striking Iran in retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage against Israel on Oct. 1, much of which Israel said was downed by its air defenses. Tehran said on Monday that it will 'use all available tools' to respond to Israel's weekend attack on military targets in Iran. Iran backs the Hezbollah terror group which is engaged in heavy fighting with IDF forces in Lebanon, and also the Hamas terror group, which is battling the IDF in the Gaza Strip.

One dead, at least three injured in northern Israel rocket strike	24-year-old Mohammed Naim was killed when a rocket hit his home in Tarshiha; IDF reports at least 50 munitions seen crossing from Lebanon toward the Galilee area; rocket marks direct hit in Ma'alot-Tarshiha home 24-year-old Mohammed Naim was killed and at three others were wounded after a missile hit Ma'alot-Tarshiha in Western Galilee, Magen David Adom (MDA) Director Eli Bin reported on Tuesday. Nai'm was critically hurt and later succumbed to his wounds sustained when a rocket made a direct hit on his home. 'It’s a complex scene; we saw extensive destruction in the house and began searching the area,' MDA medic Gilad Benhemo, who was present on the scene, recounted. 'We found an unconscious person who had no pulse and wasn’t breathing.' 'We performed a medical assessment, but his injuries were critical and we had to pronounce his death. MDA teams are providing on-site medical care to several individuals suffering from anxiety,' he added. The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported at least 50 projectiles were located crossing from Lebanon toward northern Israel’s Galilee region earlier on Tuesday. Meanwhile, as the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah continues, the Iran-backed terror group named Naim Qassem as the new head of the terror group after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in September. He was deputy secretary-general under Nasrallah since 1991. 'Based on the faith in Allah, our commitment to Islam and our dedication to its principles and purposes, Hezbollah, in accordance with its established mechanism, approves Naim Qassem as secretary-general,' the terror group said in a statement.

They’re still there, tortured and abused': freed hostage Mia rec...	Mia Schem speaks in an event held by Israel's New York consulate and tells of the moments after her kidnapping when she was held inside a cage with five other women who remain captives in Gaza Mia Schem, a former captive released as part of the first hostage deal with Hamas in November 2023, recalled her experiences in Gaza and the harsh conditions she endured. Speaking during a ceremony at the Israeli consulate in New York to commemorate the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the massacre Tuesday overnight, she spoke about the other women who are still held in Gaza. 'I was put in a cage with five young women; they’re still there, tortured and abused,' Schem said at the event. 'I was placed in a dark cage, with no air or light, only 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) high. Each of us had a brutal abduction story; we were wounded and shocked.' 'After 50 days, weak and injured, I was led to the tunnels. Two hours of walking with an armed terrorist in front and one behind, 60 meters (196 feet) underground. I was put in a cage with no light or air. In the cage, I met five young women, each with her own horrific abduction story.' 'We spent five days in that dark cage, with two armed guards switching shifts every 12 hours. I tried to encourage them and promised we’d be freed soon. We were wounded and shocked by what had happened to us. We were innocent young women only weeks earlier. On the fifth day, I was taken out. I managed to hug them and promised they’d be freed the next day, that we’d meet again in our homeland to pick up the pieces.' 'It’s been a year; I’m here physically, but my innocence was left in fields of blood and my heart remains captive in Gaza with five young women still held there, tortured and abused, with no air, in the depths of hell,' she added. 'I stand here before you today — no longer a child but a strong woman who won’t rest until everyone returns from those depths of hell.' Ayelet, the mother of hostage Yonatan Samrano whose body is still held in Gaza, spoke about her son’s abduction at the event. 'An UNRWA social worker kidnapped my son. This person, who worked in an organization meant to do good and alleviate human suffering, kidnapped my son. This UN worker took him after he was shot by terrorists. Today, we mark a year since the darkest, most haunted day since the founding of the Jewish state.' Her words come against the backdrop of a bill approved in the Knesset on Monday banning UNRWA’s activities in Israel. Around 600 guests attended the event, including Israeli-American Council (IAC) CEO Elan Carr, leaders of New York's Jewish community, bereaved families, foreign consuls general, social media influencers, journalists and more. In his speech, Israel's Consul General in New York Ofir Akunis, said, 'What Hamas intended on doing on that day was to destroy Israel. They aimed to commit genocide. As they wrote in their founding charter in 1987 — to destroy the State of Israel and build an Islamic state in its place. 'This wasn't the first massacre in our nation’s history. We've seen many since 1920. But this was certainly the most brutal. If anyone thinks the Jewish people will ever forget or forgive this, they're mistaken. If anyone thinks we'll apologize for defending ourselves, they're wrong.'

US blacklists firms tied to Iran, Pakistan weapons programs	The United States adds 26 companies from Pakistan, China, Egypt, and the UAE to a blacklist, citing support for missile and drone developments and violations of export controls The United States has imposed sanctions on more than two dozen companies, alleging their support for ballistic missile and drone development in Pakistan and Iran. The US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced last week that 26 companies from Pakistan, China, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates were blacklisted due to activities deemed contrary to U.S. national security, including violating export controls, aiding restricted weapons programs, and attempting to bypass sanctions on Russia and Iran. The BIS, a division of the US Commerce Department, stated that 'nine Pakistani entities were added [to the ban list] for acting as front companies for the Advanced Engineering Research Organization, listed in 2014, and seven others for contributing to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.' Three entities from the UAE and one from Egypt were also blacklisted for allegedly attempting to obtain restricted U.S. parts after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Additionally, six Chinese firms were sanctioned for assisting China’s military and procuring U.S. technology for Iran’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs. According to Thea D. Rozman Kendler, assistant secretary of commerce for export administration at the BIS, the U.S. will continue blocking entities 'that attempt to bypass our controls and endanger U.S. national security.' 'Programs such as Iran’s WMD program, their UAV program, and Pakistan’s ballistic missile program pose significant threats to the national security of the United States and will not be aided by U.S. technologies,' Kendler added. Matthew S. Axelrod, assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement at the BIS, stated, 'When we identify parties transshipping U.S. items to support WMD and UAV programs in countries like Pakistan and Iran, or aiding Russia’s war efforts, we take action. Today’s listings also make clear that when foreign parties engage in dilatory or evasive conduct with respect to our end-use checks, they will face consequences.' The U.S. State Department in April 2024 acted against four entities involved in weapons of mass destruction proliferation. These entities were accused of supplying crucial materials and technologies to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, including long-range missile capabilities. The State Department noted that 'three of the targeted companies are based in China, with the fourth in Belarus,' providing missile-related items to Pakistan’s program. In response to American sanctions on entities allegedly linked to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry voiced concerns, with spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch noting that 'similar listings have occurred before without any evidence being shared.' She suggested that Islamabad was open to transparency discussions to protect legitimate commercial ventures from being 'unfairly impacted by export controls.' Pakistan’s ballistic missile program is a key component of its national defense strategy, developed in response to regional security challenges and the country’s long-standing rivalry with India. As part of Pakistan’s strategic deterrence and conventional strike capabilities, its missile systems are designed to deliver both nuclear warheads and conventional munitions. To manage these weapons, specifically their precision and security during missile operations, Pakistan has implemented a state-of-the-art command and control infrastructure. Additionally, a specialized security force, operating under the leadership of a three-star general, has been deployed exclusively to protect these strategic assets. Arsenal mainly consists of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, with ongoing advancements in cruise missile capabilities This security framework aims to prevent unauthorized access, safeguard the country’s defense assets, and ensure swift and effective response in any scenario. The arsenal mainly consists of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, with ongoing advancements in cruise missile capabilities. Among Pakistan’s short- and medium-range missiles, the Shaheen-III has a range of approximately 1,710 miles, while the Ababeel can reach up to 1,400 miles. Islamabad has consistently emphasized that its advancement in missile technology is to maintain a credible deterrent and achieve strategic balance in South Asia. Dr. Maria Sultan, the Islamabad-based chair of the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute University and Pakistan’s leading defense and security analyst, told The Media Line: 'Pakistan’s ballistic missile program is indigenous and not reliant on U.S. technology, so the sanctions have minimal impact on its development.' 'Moreover,' she continued, 'if any listed companies were trading with the U.S., it suggests there were compliance lapses on the U.S. side.' Sultan added that the 'U.S. has lost its role as the leader of the non-proliferation regime since it has been the sole facilitator of not only leading an arms race in South Asia but has contributed towards the defense industry development of India after STA-1.' STA-1 or Strategic Trade Authorization-1, is a U.S. designation that enables certain countries to access advanced and sensitive American technology, including dual-use items for both civilian and military purposes. In 2018, India became the first South Asian country to receive STA-1 status. 'In a faltering U.S. Middle East policy, the creation of a false narrative surrounding sanctions against Pakistani and Iranian companies serves to deflect pressure and reflects an irresponsible unilateral approach to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which has been previously undermined by U.S. sanctions on Iran,' Sultan explained. The JCPOA is the 2015 agreement between Iran and six world powers—the U.S., UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany—to limit Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. 'The timing and nature of these sanctions appear more aimed at appeasing a domestic audience rather than genuinely addressing missile proliferation,' she added, stressing that 'this strategy ultimately detracts from the necessary efforts to control the proliferation of missiles.'

Hezbollah names Naim Qassem as new chief	Long-serving deputy secretary-general of the terror group is approved by Hezbollah's religious council after the designated successor of Hasan Nasrallah, Hashem Safieddine is also killed in a targeted strike Hezbollah on Tuesday named Naim Qassem as the new head of the terror group after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in September. He was deputy secretary-general under Nasrallah since 1991. 'Based on the faith in Allah, our commitment to Islam and our dedication to its principles and purposes, Hezbollah, in accordance with its established mechanism, approves Naim Qassem at secretary-general,' the terror group said in a statement. 'We are committed to working together to achieve Hezbollah's aims and to preserve the flames of resistance and our flag held high until victory is achieved.' Qassem was named as the new chief of the terror group after Nasrallah who served in the role for the past 32 years was assassinated in a targeted attack on his bunker in Beirut's Dahieh quarter along with other senior members, including the commander of South Lebanon, Ali Karaki. Israel also assassinated Hashem Safieddine, who was designated to succeed Nasrallah in a strike earlier in October. His death was confirmed by the terror group last week, three weeks after the IDF's targeted attack. Qassem who had been speaking publicly for Hezbollah even before Nasrallah's killing, said in a speech earlier this month that a cease-fire agreement could be reached apart from the war in Gaza. 'The solution is a cease-fire. Not from a position of weakness,' he said. 'We are no longer supporting Gaza and are now in war with Israel.' He said that since Israel was attacking all parts of Lebanon, the terror group had the right to target Tel Aviv, Haifa and beyond, as Nasrallah had wanted.

Iran threatens Israel in UN, US warns Tehran against further aggr...	Emergency UN Security Council session sees Iranian representative reiterating Tehran's right to act against Israel's retaliatory strike; U.S. says further Iranian aggression will have 'severe consequences' Iran's UN Ambassador Amir Saied said in an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday that his country reserves the 'inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing,' to what he called 'this act of aggression. The session was held to discuss Israel’s retaliatory attack in Tehran on Saturday. 'Israel’s attack constitutes a breach of international law. The U.S.’s support of Israel encouraged it to continue its aggression in Gaza and Lebanon,' Saied said. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council there would be 'severe consequences' should Tehran take any further aggressive action against Jerusalem. 'We will not hesitate to act in self-defense. Let there be no confusion. The United States does not want to see further escalation. We believe this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,' she said. 'As we have stated time and time again, we have the right and duty to defend ourselves and will use all the means at our disposal to protect the citizens of Israel,' Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon told the council. He also demanded the international body recognize the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, impose 'immediate, paralyzing sanctions against Iran’s military and economic infrastructure,' and implored the council to 'take every step necessary to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear state.' Meanwhile, members of Israel’s Security Cabinet discussed three main issues Sunday overnight including the Hezbollah drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea and deliberated on how to respond to Iran over the attack. Military representatives presented several options in the meeting; however, some ministers present were 'carried away' with their proposals and no decision was agreed on.

Strides in Lebanon cease-fire negotiations, Israeli officials say	Hochstein to arrive to finalize the deal stipulating a 60-day period of adjustment leaving IDF troops in tactical positions; Hezbollah to be kept north of Litani River while the Lebanese army to deploy thousands to the border; Russia to play a supervision role Senior Israeli officials said the negotiations on a cease-fire deal in Lebanon are 'in advanced stages.' White House special envoy Amos Hochstein may travel to Israel and Lebanon before the November 5 U.S. presidential elections, to attempt to reach final agreements. If the talks advance, the IDF will begin to withdraw most of its troops and redeploy forces in South Lebanon and leave areas where their mission to remove the threat from Radwan forces, has been completed, and likely remain only where there is tactical significance. The officials in Israel said that Lebanon's situation has completely changed after the IDF offensive and that there is an agreement in Beirut to disconnect both the Lebanon and Gazan fronts. They stressed the fact that fighting would continue while negotiations are ongoing and until they are completed. Western intelligence sources believe Iran would allow Hezbollah to agree to a ceasefire, and perhaps even encourage it, even if the fighting in Gaza does not end. The Israeli officials said a cease-fire agreement would begin with a 60-day acclimation period during which Hezbollah and the IDF withhold their fire and the Lebanese army will deploy to the south, while a new mechanism to supervise the region will be considered but there will be no new resolution passed in the UN Security Council. French and American officials said recently that Hezbollah, which suffered severe blows and lost all of its leadership, has been bolstered in the past two weeks, by the growing number of casualties among IDF soldiers. 'This is an opportunity that must not be missed,' they said. The proposed deal to be agreed by Israel, Lebanon, the U.S. and others, includes three components. The first is a wider implementation of UN resolution 1701, passed after the 2006 Second Lebanon War, that would ensure there would be no Hezbollah terrorists south of the Litani River, and at a significant distance from Metula. Lebanon's army is to deploy 5,000 to 10,000 troops along the border. UNIFIL forces will be increased, perhaps some, replaced by French, British and German forces. Israel has approached those countries to see if they would agree. The second component is the establishment of an international mechanism to supervise the area and consider violation claims by any of the sides. Israeli officials said the U.S> has agreed that if Hezbollah violates the agreement, for example by building fortifications south of the Litani, and the Lebanese army or UNIFIL fail to quickly respond, the IDF would be able to take prolonged action to remove the threat. Israel asked for a letter from U.S. President Joe Biden, stating Israel's right to self-defense, making it clear that the IDF would be able to act. American officials did not respond to questions on the matter. The third component in the agreement being negotiated is preventing Hezbollah from rearming. This means blocking military means, to be identified as banned, from being brought in by air, land or sea. Russia expressed a willingness to assist in implementing the agreement and is destined to play a part in stabilizing the region in Lebanon and Syria. 'The Russians will have a special role in preventing further escalation,' a foreign source said. Israel will engage with the Kremlin directly and is interested in Russian participation, in the hopes that it would contribute to the agreement's implementation and also to reduce its dependence on U.S. involvement. Netanyahu emissaries have been trying to enlist other countries to join supervision roles in the pending agreement. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer has been working with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has discussed the matter with Hochstein.

Guterres says UNRWA indispensable, after Israel banns agency	UN secretary-general says bill passed by Knesset could have devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees and will be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that the implementation of a law banning the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from operating in Israel 'could have devastating consequences for Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is unacceptable.' The Knesset passed a law to cut official ties with and halt the activity of the UNRWA, some of whose operators are suspected of participating in the massacres on October 7. The law passed by a vote of 92-10. 'There is no alternative to UNRWA,' Guterres said in a statement. 'The implementation of these laws would be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for peace and security in the region as a whole. As I said before, UNRWA is indispensable,' adding he would bring the matter to the attention of the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. Under the new law, UNRWA will not 'operate any institution, provide any service, or conduct any activity, whether directly or indirectly,' in the sovereign territory of Israel. In effect, UNRWA's activities in East Jerusalem will be terminated and the body's powers will be transferred to Israel's responsibility and control. Israel revealed the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, 2023 and the identity of another member of the organization who was a Hamas operative in Lebanon. Others are active in both Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

North Korea's foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, has left Pyongyang to visit Russia, state media KCNA said on Tuesday, amid concerns about the two countries' growing cooperation over Russia's war in Ukraine. KCNA said a delegation led by Choe left on Monday for an official visit to Russia, without elaborating. Her visit comes as NATO joined Seoul, Washington and Kyiv in confirming Pyongyang's dispatch of troops to Russia, saying North Korean military units had been deployed to Russia's Kursk region near the Ukraine border. The Pentagon said North Korea has sent 10,000 troops to eastern Russia for training, up from its estimate of 3,000 last Wednesday, adding Washington will not impose new limits on Ukraine's use of American weapons if North Korea enters the fight.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk3l0y6xyg	2024-10-28T14:22:09-07:00	
This is where where 1,000 armed Radwan fighters were poised to in...	Ynet reporter on the ground with troops in South Lebanon: For over 20 years, Hezbollah planned to capture Metula to invade the Upper Galilee; The IDF's 769th Brigade destroyed underground facilities and arms depots in Kila, a major Hezbollah hub, thwarting their invasion plans For more than two decades, Hezbollah has been plotting to capture the border town of Metula as a launch point to push into the Upper Galilee and northern Israel. However, since the outbreak of hostilities a year ago, and particularly in recent weeks, the Israel Defense Forces have been actively dismantling Hezbollah's attack infrastructure in the nearby village of Kila, located in southern Lebanon. Under the leadership of the 769th Regional Brigade, part of the 91st Division, Israeli forces have discovered and destroyed dozens of underground facilities, weapon depots, observation posts and hundreds of terrorist infrastructures scattered throughout and within Kila village. This village is considered one of Hezbollah's main terror strongholds, from which over 1,000 armed Radwan fighters were poised to invade Israel at a moment's notice. A tour of the ravaged village and neighboring Lebanese areas quickly reveals the scale of the destruction and the high level of Hezbollah's readiness to execute their 'Conquer the Galilee' plan, a strategy they announced in 2011 and have been preparing for ever since. 'The village of Kila represents all the evil and what Hezbollah intended to do,' explained Colonel Avraham Marciano, commander of the 769th Brigade. He added that, from this Shiite village adjacent to Metula, 'there was a plan for several battalions to storm into Israeli territory.' The IDF's heavy machinery is carrying out extensive demolition in the area, continuing to destroy homes and terrorist infrastructures located so close to the border wall. Just yards away from Metula's orchards and across from the Har Tzofiya neighborhood, near a local gas station owned by Hezbollah, Marciano described an exposed underground terror tunnel that did not breach Israeli soil. 'Fifty yards from here, within the rubble, we uncovered an underground shaft they planned to use,' he detailed. 'It was several hundred yards long, and from its entrance the terrorists planned to go underground on the main street of the village, collect their equipment, prepare for an attack and emerge from here.' Forces are now destroying this tunnel, along with other above and below-ground terrorist infrastructures. David, one of the soldiers protecting us, participated in uncovering the tunnel. 'We found it with the excavation equipment,' he recounted. 'There's no doubt we halted its further digging. In almost every house here, we uncovered terrorist infrastructures. Whether it's shafts, tunnels, or just weapons, in every house, you can find weapons, ammunition, vests, combat gear, or medical supplies.' In nearby areas, Hezbollah set up observation posts from which they monitored movement in Israel for years. Since the conflict began, the Lebanese Shiite terror organization has used these posts to direct fire and launch direct attacks on Israeli communities, including Kfar Yuval. 'From this point, they fired at the Ayalon family home while Mira and her son Barak were having lunch in their kitchen,' Colonel Marciano described. 'Today, we are settling scores and destroying Hezbollah's infrastructures.' He explained that the military activity in the area, which oversees the northern communities, aims to 'destroy the infrastructures, seize the weapons – and prevent Hezbollah's surprise invasion capability from Kila village.' According to the colonel: 'We're doing similar things in other villages. This is how the operation looks. Our response, besides eliminating the terrorists, their commanders, and the commanders of their commanders, is to ensure that the infrastructure does not exist.' However, he acknowledged this activity does not address the remote and steep-trajectory anti-tank fire. For example, during the tour of villages near Metula, they repeatedly took shelter due to mortar fire from the nearby village of Al-Khiam, where the IDF is not operating. Marciano emphasized that the forces on the ground are vigorously working to destroy Hezbollah infrastructures. 'We live every day as if it's the last day of the maneuver,' he said. 'We have a sense of activity and urgency. The machinery doesn't stop, the soldiers don't stop. The soldiers even push us, wanting to move forward and do the work. We don't want to stop.' He promised that 'we are doing everything we can – and everything that needs to be done – to ensure that the residents of the north can live here safely. We've waited for this for a year. Today we stand here, realizing what we've waited for, not because we are war-hungry; quite the opposite, we want peace. And for that, we need to come from a position of strength and bring this strength and victory to the people of Israel, who have waited for it for so long.' 'Hezbollah needs to flee, feel hunted, lose all its infrastructures, all the operatives we can take out now, and if we need to go deeper – we will.'

The United States warned Iran at the United Nations Security Council on Monday of 'severe consequences' if it undertakes any further aggressive acts against Israel or U.S. personnel in the Middle East. 'We will not hesitate to act in self defense. Let there be no confusion. The United States does not want to see further escalation. We believe this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,' U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the 15-member council. The Security Council met after Israel struck missile factories and other sites in Iran before dawn on Saturday. It was retaliation for Iran's Oct. 1 attack on Israel with about 200 ballistic missiles. Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saied Iravani accused Washington of being 'complicit' through military support for its ally. 'Iran has consistently championed diplomacy,' he told the council. 'However, as a sovereign state, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves its inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing to this act of aggression.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjamvt6ejl	2024-10-28T13:52:37-07:00

Yemen's Houthis said on Monday that they targeted three ships in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, attacks they called part of their efforts to enforce a naval blockade on Israel. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said in a televised address the vessels were targeted for attempting to approach ports bound for Israel. According to the latest data from LSEG, all three targeted vessels were Liberia-registered. One of the vessels, identified by the Houthis as Motaro, was last seen off Yemen's western coast in the Red Sea, en route from Egypt's Suez Canal to Shanghai, according to LSEG data. Another vessel, the SC Montreal, was reportedly targeted in the Arabian Sea while travelling from Seychelles' Port Victoria to Salalah, Oman. The third vessel, the Maersk Kowloon, was tracked by LSEG in the western Indian Ocean, also en route from Salalah. The Houthis said they will continue these actions until Israel halts its offensive on Gaza and Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkghiyaxjl	2024-10-28T13:49:55-07:00	
IDF soldier seriously injured by antii-tank missile in Jabaliya d...	Major Guy Yaacov Nezri, 25, dies a week after being injured in northern Gaza Strip; He told high school students: 'We're here to fight and stay alive. It's good to live for our country, and I'm not here to die' Major Guy Yaacov Nezri, 25, from Atlit, commander of a platoon in the 52nd Battalion of the 401st Brigade, died of his wounds after being severely wounded in a battle in the northern Gaza Strip on October 19, the IDF announced on Monday evening. Since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, 772 soldiers have fallen, including 361 who were killed during fighting in the Gaza Strip. Nezri was seriously injured in the incident in which Staff Sergeant Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and Sergeant Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, were killed after being hit by anti-tank missile fire in the battle in Jabaliya in northern Gaza. He is survived by his parents, a twin sister and a brother. His funeral will be held in Atlit. Tamar, his twin sister, posted a video of Nezri on Facebook, before his death was determined. 'Blessed are the people that have these men as their commanders. My brother, the hero who was seriously injured by anti-tank missile fire in Gaza, speaking to the students of the Hanasi School in Haifa, eight months before the injury. These are the words he chooses to use. We love life, fight for life, we are here to stay,' she wrote. Tamar added: 'Our nation is a strong nation that has survived difficult wars and suffered many losses and has always stood on its feet, with its head held high. Today marks the anniversary of the Iron Swords War. Guy fought for a year for a better life in our country, that was the goal and that's where we're going. We are not afraid of a long journey. Guy is still hospitalized and fighting for his life. Devote this day to his healing and the healing of all the wounded of this war, who sacrificed their bodies and souls so that we can live here united and loving!' In the meeting that his sister wrote about, Nezri told the students: 'I want to tell you something else. It's good to live for our country. It's good to live for our country! And I'm not here to die. I'll tell you the truth, we are here to fight and remain alive, to appreciate the continuity of the nation of Israel. The people of Israel are a strong people, they will not remain as we saw them on October 7. This is not the people of Israel. It is a people that has experienced destruction - And just as it falls, it also gets up very quickly and becomes even stronger.' Asif Izak, head of the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council, said: 'Guy was the salt of the earth, who grew up in Hof HaCarmel as a member of a deep-rooted and moral family. On behalf of the entire Hof HaCarmel community, I would like to hug the dear Nezri family, and hope that we will be worthy of the best of our sons that we lost, including Guy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1l00cotx1l	2024-10-28T13:43:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/28/Hkz92walJe/Hkz92walJe_0_36_736_414_0_small.jpg

Knesset passes law banning UNRWA activity in Israel, despite oppo...	Under the law which passed overwhelmingly, an agreement from 1967 that allowed the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency to work in Israel will be canceled, and UNRWA activities in the country will cease. Some of the agency's employees are suspected of participating in the massacres on October 7. US is 'very concerned' The Knesset plenum approved Monday evening in its second and third readings a law to cut official ties with and halt the activity of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, some of whose operators are suspected of participating in the massacres on October 7. The law passed by a vote of 92-10. Under the new law, UNRWA will not 'operate any institution, provide any service, or conduct any activity, whether directly or indirectly,' in the sovereign territory of Israel. In effect, UNRWA's activities in East Jerusalem will be terminated and the body's powers will be transferred to Israel's responsibility and control. Israel revealed the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, 2023 and the identity of another member of the organization who was a Hamas operative in Lebanon. Others are active in both Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee Yuli Edelstein said at the beginning of the debate in the plenary: 'As part of the committee's discussions on the law, a video was shown that proves the involvement of UNRWA personnel in kidnapping a body to the Gaza Strip and other evidence of their activity in Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. In addition, the person who commanded the massacre in the Be'eri bomb shelter, where 16 Israelis were murdered and from which four were kidnapped to Gaza, was a UNRWA terrorist.' 'In light of this, and since it has been proven to the State of Israel that UNRWA and its employees acted against the State of Israel, the State must determine that UNRWA's activities in its territory will be stopped,' Edelstein also said. 'The State of Israel will provide every service it is obligated to provide to its citizens and residents in all those places where UNRWA operated, coordinated by the Jerusalem Municipality. There is no place for enemies in the heart of the capital of the Jewish people.' One of the law's author's, Likud lawmaker Boaz Bismuth, said UNRWA's work has been counterproductive for years. 'If you really want stability, if you really want security, if you want real peace in the Middle East, organizations like UNRWA won't bring you there,' said Bismuth. 'If the United Nations is not willing to clean this organization from terrorism, from Hamas activists, then we have to take measures to make sure that they cannot harm our people ever again,' lawmaker Sharren Haskel, another author of the law, said. 'The international community could have taken responsibility and made sure that they used the proper organizations to facilitate humanitarian aid, like the World Food Organization, like UNICEF, and many others who work all around the world.' During the voting, Kobi Samerano, the father of Jonathan Samerano, who was murdered on October 7 and whose body was kidnapped into Gaza by a UNRWA worker, was present in the plenum. Despite the broad support for the legislation, both the coalition and the opposition voiced concern among that the vote or implementation would be delayed because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under great pressure in recent weeks from both the United Nations and the United States, due to the lack of an alternative body that would provide a humanitarian response for the Palestinians in Gaza. On Sunday, senior officials in the Foreign Ministry warned that if the legislation stating that ties with UNRWA must be severed is passed in the second and third readings in the Knesset Israel would be suspended from the United Nations, since this is a violation of the organization's charter. The foreign ministers of Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Great Britain issued a joint statement Monday before the vote calling on Israel to stop the legislation, expressing 'grave concern,' especially in light of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. 'UNRWA provides vital and life-saving humanitarian assistance and basic services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank and throughout the region,' the statement reads. 'This will have devastating consequences on an already difficult humanitarian situation, which is rapidly deteriorating, especially in northern Gaza.' U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Washington 'has made it clear to Israel that it is very concerned about the legislation that could ban the agency's activities in the Gaza Strip, because it plays a role in providing irreplaceable humanitarian aid. The humanitarian aid does not reach the residents of Jabaliya, where the IDF has increased its activity, and the U.S. will not agree to that.' In recent days, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew and officials at the embassy have appealed to Yesh Atid Chairman and Opposition Leader Yair Lapid, Yisrael Beitenu Party head Avigdor Liberman, and Nastional Unity party head Benny Gantz, with a request that they agree to postpone the advancement of the legislation at least until after the U.S. presidential elections. Lapid reportedly told U.S. officials that he disagreed with them and that the law is correct and appropriate, leading Liberman and Gantz to also reject the U.S officials' request. Knesset members from the Arab Hadash-Ta'al party objected, and Knesset member Ahmed Tibi said: 'Those who support this bill are those who do not recognize the Palestinian people. It is not new that people here in the Knesset ask to stop the activities of UNRWA .There will be no need for UNRWA when the occupation ends and a Palestinian state is established.'

Joe Biden waits in line 40 minutes to cast early ballot in Delawa...	The current US president chatted with voters and pushed a woman in a wheelchair in line ahead of him President Joe Biden, who will end a decades-long public career in January, cast an early ballot in the 2024 general election. Biden voted on Monday at the state of Delaware Department of Elections, not far from his home outside Wilmington, Delaware at an early voting site, where voters were lined up down the street to cast ballots. It’s a bittersweet moment for Biden, who decided to end his reelection campaign in July because of growing concerns about his health and Democrats’ worries about his chances of defeating former President Donald Trump. Biden chatted with voters as he waited in line to cast his ballot, and helped push an older woman in a wheelchair who was ahead of him. The president waited in line for about 40 minutes before he cast his ballot. He handed his identification to the election worker, who had him sign a form and announced: 'Joseph Biden now voting.' As the president cast his ballot behind a black drape, some first-time voters were announced and the room erupted in cheers for them. Outside the polling place, Biden was asked by reporters if he thought Democrats - including Vice President Kamala Harris - would win. 'I think we will,' he said. He also was asked about the war in Gaza and said that it 'must end.' Biden emphasized: 'We need a cease-fire. We have to stop this war. It has to end. It has to end. It has to end.' For all but a few years since 1970, Biden has either held office or been running for one during election season.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkzkn8plje	2024-10-28T10:56:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/28/SkokoSTxJl/SkokoSTxJl_0_148_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Northern mayor laments removal of protective barriers on border w...	A year after regular attacks from Hezbollah began, the protective barriers placed in major intersections in northern Israel have been removed, which has Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern concerned; 'It feels like a hasty move, signaling to residents that it’s safe to return home' Israeli Defense Forces have dismantled large protective barriers that were put in place about a year ago along major traffic routes near Kiryat Shmona, extending to Metula and Kfar Yuval on the northern border. This decision seems linked to the decreased threat of direct anti-tank missile attacks following military operations in southern Lebanon, especially over the past month. Mayor Avichai Stern of Kiryat Shmona voiced strong concerns over the timing of this decision. 'Why take them down now? They should be removed after the conflict is truly over. What’s the rush? It feels like a hasty move, signaling to residents that it’s safe to return home,' he said. Stern is worried that, while the army claims to have destroyed nearby terror infrastructures, the threat from more distant villages, which could still launch anti-tank missiles, remains unaddressed. He emphasizes that these concrete walls were installed as a protective measure when the military was not present in Lebanon. Although Stern understands the rationale behind their removal, he stresses that, for residents, these walls represent the necessary defense against Hezbollah forces just across the border. He expressed a personal wish to live in a city without these 'ugly defensive walls,' but insisted they should only be removed when there is absolute certainty they are no longer needed. Stern suspects political pressures might be pushing the IDF to wrap up operations in Lebanon, achieving only a temporary distancing of Hezbollah. He also fears a potential agreement that allows Hezbollah to regroup, which he believes should not be permitted.

ICC prosecutor who charged Netanyahu with war crimes says will co...	Karim Khan has called for internal investigation into allegations made by a female aide; Court officials say accusation part of an Israeli intelligence smear campaign to discredit the court. The International Criminal Court’s top prosecutor has called for an internal investigation into allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her. Karim Khan’s request Monday follows an investigation by The Associated Press detailing allegations made in May by two co-workers in whom the woman confided as the chief prosecutor was preparing to seek charges against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of Hamas over their actions in Gaza. Khan has previously said there was 'no truth' to the misconduct allegations and court officials told the AP they may have been made as part of an Israeli intelligence smear campaign to discredit the court. In a social media post Monday, the British jurist complained that recent media reporting had breached the confidentiality of the court’s internal proceedings and spread 'disinformation' that violated his rights as well as those of the alleged victim. Khan said he would cooperate fully with any inquiry made under the court’s Independent Oversight Mechanism — the same watchdog that closed an inquiry just five days after receiving the third-party complaint. The inquiry should be 'permitted to do its work without interference so that the crucial work of the Office may continue unimpeded,' he said, declining further comment. The court’s watchdog previously determined no investigation was necessary, and didn’t question Khan about his behavior, when the alleged victim opted against filing a formal complaint. People close to the woman, who still works at the court, told AP that she opted against a complaint at the time because she didn’t trust the internal watchdog and has since asked the body of member-states that oversees the ICC to launch an external probe. AP pieced together details of the accusations through whistleblower documents shared with the watchdog and interviews with eight ICC officials and individuals close to the woman. All spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the allegations or fear of retaliation. Among the allegations told to AP is that Khan during a foreign trip asked the woman to rest with him on a hotel bed and then 'sexually touched her,' according to the documents. Later, he came to her room at 3 a.m. and knocked on the door for 10 minutes. Other allegedly nonconsensual behavior cited in the documents included locking the door of his office and sticking his hand in her pocket. He also allegedly asked her on several occasions to go on a vacation together. While the watchdog could not determine wrongdoing before ending its initial inquiry, it nonetheless urged Khan in a memo to minimize contact with the woman to protect the rights of all involved and safeguard the court’s integrity.

The International Criminal Court's prosecutor Karim Khan has asked the ICC's oversight mechanism to open an immediate investigation into allegations of misconduct made against him, he said on Monday. According to the prosecutor, the investigations should cover the allegations and disinformation surrounding them, and he will cooperate fully. Last week, Khan denied accusations of unspecified misconduct after the court's governing body confirmed that it had been notified of the allegation. The Independent Oversight Mechanism said in its annual report for 2024 that the alleged victim in the Khan case would not explicitly confirm the allegations in talks with the oversight body earlier this year and therefore no formal inquiry had been launched. ICC judges are reviewing Khan's request in May for arrest warrants against Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense chief and Hamas leaders.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rja7qrax1g	2024-10-28T09:31:37-07:00

Iran executes Iranian-German national after terrorism conviction	Iran executed Iranian-German national Jamshid Sharmahd after he was convicted of carrying out terrorist attacks, Iranian state media said on Monday. Sharmahd, who also holds U.S. residency, was sentenced to death in 2023 on charges of 'corruption on earth.' He was accused by Iran of heading a pro-monarchist group accused of a deadly 2008 bombing and planning other attacks in the country. Sharmahd's arrest was announced in 2020 in an intelligence ministry statement that described him as 'the ringleader of the terrorist Tondar group, who directed armed and terrorist acts in Iran from America.' Based in Los Angeles, the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran, or Tondar, says it seeks to restore the Iranian monarchy that was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution.

Ben Shapiro, one of the world's most influential Jews, has some advice for Israel: 'Instead of advertising Tel Aviv's beaches in Santa Monica, start introducing your enemies to the world'; He speaks to Ynetnews ahead of the staging in Israel by the Aspaklaria Theater of a musical he wrote which has taken on new meaning following the October 7 massacre Ben Shapiro is one of the world's most influential Jews - with over 20 million followers on social media and firm connections at the top of American politics - and is a one-man media empire. About a decade ago, he founded The Daily Wire, and later a popular podcast - The Ben Shapiro Show - which was ranked second in the United States by Podtrac. Since then, he has not hesitated to confront Israel's opponents, and become a one-man advocacy enterprise. In a special interview with Ynetnews, he talks about disappointment with the West, which he says has normalized antisemitism and hatred of Israel; asks that we learn a historical lesson from what he says Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar understood well - that social divisions are the country's weak point; and explains why Israel repeatedly fails in the propaganda war. 'If Trump is elected, I think that the war in the Middle East will come to a swift and decisive conclusion,' he says, adding that 'I have significant doubts about the what a Kamala Harris administration would look like for Israel.' Shapiro spoke with Ynetnews on the occasion of the staging in Israel of a musical he wrote which has taken on new meaning following the October 7 massacre, 'We Will Rise,' by the Aspaklaria Theater, in collaboration with the Israel Sinfonietta Be'er Sheva.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he hopes to reach peace deals with more Arab countries once the war against Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah is complete.

But the day after includes something else of utmost importance,' Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament. 'I aspire to continue the process I led a few years ago of the signing of the historic Abraham Accords, and achieve peace with more Arab countries,' he said. Israel, under the U.S.-brokered 2020 accords, normalized relations with four Arab countries - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.

Erdoğan accuses Israel of genocide, and then bombs the Kurds	Turkey conducted over 130 airstrikes across most towns and cities along Syria's northern border hitting civilian homes, factories, and oil facilities of the Kurds, according to reports Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has emerged as one of Israel's most vocal critics since the onset of the war. He has urged the Arab world to unite against Israel, claiming that it has no intention of stopping in Gaza and will extend its actions to Turkey. Erdoğan repeatedly refers to the ongoing war against Hamas as 'genocide,' even labeling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as 'the Hitler of our time.' Meanwhile, Erdoğan continues to carry out ruthless operations against the Kurds in Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Wednesday marked a new escalation in the already strained relations between Turkey and the Kurdish groups seeking independence. An attack targeted the headquarters of Turkey's aerospace industry company TUSAS in Ankara, resulting in five fatalities and 22 injuries. Videos from the scene circulated on social media. According to Turkish reports, at least two assailants were involved, and they were killed. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya stated immediately after the strike that it was 'very likely' that the attackers were Kurdish operatives from the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Turkey designates as a terrorist organization. On Friday, the PKK claimed responsibility for the attack. Even before the PKK took responsibility, Turkey launched intensive air and ground strikes against Kurdish positions in Syria and Iraq. According to the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, positions of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes a significant Kurdish military component in Syria, were targeted. Turkey's Defense Ministry announced on Wednesday evening that it had attacked PKK targets in northern Iraq and northern Syria: 'In accordance with our rights to self-defense, an air operation was conducted against terrorist targets in northern Iraq and Syria. A total of 32 targets were successfully destroyed, and operations are ongoing.' Following the events, Erdoğan declared that 'no terrorist organization attacking our country will be able to realize its hopes.' According to a report on Sunday from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organization linked to the Syrian opposition based in London, Turkish forces have intensified their air and ground assaults in northeastern Syria since Wednesday. The report noted that over 100 airstrikes had been conducted, including 84 drone strikes and 18 by fighter jets. Ground assaults also were reported in several areas, resulting in 17 deaths and more than 60 injuries. The observatory indicated that many civilian homes, oil facilities and factories were damaged in the attacks. Protests against the Turkish escalation were reported in several locations across Syria. Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, associated with Hezbollah, also covered the Turkish strikes, noting that sources on the ground indicated Turkey had conducted over 130 airstrikes across most towns and cities along Syria's northern border within four days. In the targeted areas in Syria, some claimed that Turkey was using the Ankara attack as a pretext to target groups unrelated to the incident. Syria's media reported that Turkey employed a significant amount of ammunition during these strikes. Turkey's Defense Ministry claimed it was targeting 'terrorists,' but the reality is that Turkey has long fought against the Kurdish quest for independence, ruthlessly attacking Kurds in Turkey, Syria and Iraq out of fear that the ethnic group might realize its aspirations in the Kurdistan region. The historical animosity between the PKK and Turkey is not new. The PKK is a Kurdish armed organization founded in Turkey in 1978 by Abdullah Öcalan and Kurdish activists. Initially focused on advocating for Kurdish rights, it later sought independence for southeastern Turkey. In its early years, the PKK was viewed as a political movement, but it is now recognized as a terrorist organization in Turkey and many Western countries, including the U.S. A report from Saudi Arabia's Al-Arabiya network highlighted significant events influencing the PKK, such as Öcalan's arrest in 1999 and his subsequent life imprisonment. The report noted that the PKK has carried out attacks against the Turkish military and government sites, primarily in southeastern Turkey. The conflict between Turkey and the PKK spans borders, particularly since Turkey accuses the organization of strengthening ties with Kurds in neighboring countries like Iraq and Syria, launching attacks on PKK positions in those states. Efforts to reach a cease-fire between the two sides have repeatedly failed, as Ankara remains firmly opposed to the PKK's demands for independence. Over the years, there have been numerous reports of connections between Israel and the Kurds, whose population numbers in the millions and spans Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. The Kurds have often expressed warm sentiments toward Israel. In Iraq, the autonomy achieved by the Kurds is referred to as the Iraqi Kurdistan.

Hostage negotiations summit in Doha concludes with progress repor...	Talks cover several proposals by mediators, with sources indicating momentum toward aligning these frameworks within the week; officials aim to convene follow-up summit, potentially engaging Hamas directly A negotiation summit in Doha concluded on Monday with reported progress toward a unified framework for a hostage release plan, following intensive discussions between Mossad Director David Barnea, CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al Thani. The talks, which saw Barnea remain overnight in Qatar, reportedly covered Egyptian, American and Qatari proposals, with sources indicating momentum toward aligning these frameworks within the week. Officials aim to convene a follow-up summit with top intelligence leaders, including Egypt’s new intelligence chief Hassan Rashad, potentially engaging Hamas directly. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Sunday floated a proposal involving a 48-hour cease-fire to facilitate the release of four hostages in exchange for some Palestinian prisoners, describing it as a trust-building measure. Hamas welcomed the Egyptian proposal but expressed concern over the lack of Israeli guarantees and reiterated its stance that no deal could be finalized without a comprehensive cease-fire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, including the strategic Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors. Israeli and Qatari sources familiar with the discussions at the summit noted reluctance from both sides on smaller deals, as both parties are focused on a more comprehensive agreement that could potentially involve both Gaza and Lebanon. Negotiators also considered the broader regional context, with some Israeli officials insisting that any truce in Lebanon would depend on Iran and Hezbollah pressuring Hamas toward an agreement. A diplomatic source quoted by Lebanon’s LBCI said the Doha talks had shown incremental progress on Gaza and noted genuine interest in a future prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel.

The first fallen soldier in Oct. 7: 'Steinberg was always a compa...	Nahal Brigade Commander Colonel Yehonatan Steinberg was killed on October 7 and left a void in the hearts of his loved ones; his widow shares stories about the revered commander When the late Colonel Yehonatan Steinberg left his house on the morning of Simchat Torah last year, his wife felt that she had no reason to worry. She was already used to sudden calls to base; on Saturdays, holidays, at odd hours. ''There is an infiltration of terrorists from the Gaza Strip and I am going to my soldiers in Kerem Shalom.' I walked him to the door, gave him some cookies and sent him on his way. Nothing unusual,' recalled Yiska Steinberg. However, she had another reason to be calm. During Operation Guardian of the Walls, Yehonatan's force was under fire in the West Bank while he was the Binyamin Division commander. His communications officer was slightly injured, as well as an officer who was with them, but he came out unscathed. 'Yehonatan managed the event calmly and rescued his men under fire,' continued Yiska. 'This is the moment when I said to myself: My husband is protected. There is no one who can beat him.' It was an illusion. In the morning hours of October 7, 2023, the commander of the Nahal Brigade, Colonel Yehonatan Steinberg, was killed in battle against a squad of 12 terrorists near the Ma'on junction near Nir Oz. He was the first IDF soldier whose name was allowed to be published. Col. Steinberg, 42, left behind six children and a wife. Two more brigade commanders died in battle that morning: Colonel Asaf Hamami and Colonel Roy Joseph Levy. More than a year has passed since then, but Yehonatan's spirit, legacy, and dedication continue to accompany the Nahal Brigade. The brigade lost 53 officers and soldiers in the war, 22 of them on the cursed October 7 Massacre. 'He wasn't the commander of the sector but he summoned the brigade and went ahead, knowing he was there alone under fire,' said the current brigade commander, Col. Yair Zuckerman, who replaced Steinberg after his death. 'When Yehonatan detected the Nukhba forces, he got out of the vehicle and fought. His act of heroism was later reflected in all the brigade's fighting in Gaza: the initiative, the desire to be in front, to complete every task. When the commander behaves like this, it affects us all.' The wedding and an operation in Jenin We met last week at the spot where Steinberg fell: his widow Yiska, Col. Zuckerman and two of Yoni's subordinates: the commander of the 932nd Battalion, Lt. Col. Dotan Malul, and the brigade's logistics officer, Major Shahaf Cohen. Somewhere between Ma'on Junction and Eshkol Park, the late Lieutenant Colonel Yehonatan (Barnash) Tzor, commander of the Nahal patrol, who also came from home into the line of fire, was also killed in battle on October 7. At the place of Yehonatan Steinberg's fall, there are two olive trees. One was planted not long ago. The other, ancient and embroidered, was specially brought here. On Memorial Day, more tender saplings were added to them. 'When I planted the first tree, I said: In the place where Yoni's life was cut short, we are planting life and deepening roots,' said Yiska. She grew up in Gush Katif in the former Gaza settlements. She met Yehonatan, from Givat Ze'ev, when he was a deputy platoon commander in the 931st battalion. 'A week after the wedding, Yoni went on an operation in Jenin for 18 days. Immediately after that, he spent another 21 days away from home,' she recalled. 'Today it sounds like nothing, but back then there was no war. This was our routine.' According to her, despite his intensive service Yoni was a devoted husband and father. 'He would do everything in the house: clean, wash. Everything you need. He would arrive very tired from the army, but that didn't stop him from having a full family Shabbat meal. 'Officers usually fall asleep after the Kiddush,' she added. He instilled the value of family in his subordinates as well. 'My wife told me that she wanted to go abroad with her family and that I should stay with the girl,' said Major Shahaf, the brigade logistics officer. 'I told her: 'I'm in the army, how will I be with the girl at home for five days?' I didn't know how to tell Yehonatan the brigade commander that I had to take time off. When I told him he said 'Of course you should let her travel. She needs it and she will appreciate you for it.'' On the morning of Simchat Torah, when Yehonatan was on his way south, the residents of Shomriya, where the family lived, were asked to stay in their homes due to the terrorist infiltration. 'I said, well, if this is my Simchat Torah, we'll make it happy,' Yiska pointed out. 'The little children danced with the Torah books and the older ones threw candy at them. I look at them and said, 'How sweet, I can't wait to tell Yoni what a Simchat Torah we had.' When the soldiers knocked on the door, around six p.m., we were in the middle of a Stratego game. Unitl then I was disconnected from what was happening in the country. I keep Shabbat, but this time Shabbat kept me from all the chaos and anxiety of that day.' The division commander stopped the vehicle and told me 'Take command of the Nahal Brigade.' Col. Zuckerman was at home in Moshav Nov in the Golan Heights on October 7. A month and a half earlier, he concluded his tenure as deputy commander of the 162nd Division (to which the Nahal Brigade belongs) and was about to be appointed commander of the Northern District of the Home Front Command. 'I was debating whether to go to the district or go down south,' he said. 'I decided to go south, to the brigade's headquarters in Nahal Sorek, and when I got there I joined the 162nd Division Commander Brigadier General Itzik Cohen. We both already knew that Yehonatan was not answering since the morning. When we arrived at the Kibbutz Beit Kama area, we spoke with Lt. Col. Yoni Dahan, who informed us that he had found Steinberg's body. The division commander stopped the vehicle and told me 'Take command of the Nahal Brigade.'' Dahan, who had finished his position as 932nd Battalion's commander two months earlier, was at the time a squad commander in the company commander course. 'I was at home, in Kfar Haroeh, and I went down south with a relative who is also a combat officer,' he recalled in a telephone interview. 'On the way, I called Malul, who replaced me as the battalion commander in Hebron, and he sent me reinforcements. We passed through the Nova music festival, fought with terrorists in Urim, and then we were asked to come to Ein HaShlosha to back up Golani. 'We drove through the fields and until we spotted terrorists on road 241. We unloaded the vehicles and opened fire on them. Then I see a kippah on the side of the road that looked familiar. I look and see Yehonatan Steinberg lying lifeless. I also saw Barnash's car there, but I didn't make the connection. Then an officer I knew called me and told me that he found Barnash dead and evacuated him. At Around 11 a.m. the division commander asked me to take command of the patrol force. I asked one of the officers to evacuate Yehonatan and drove to Kerem Shalom to join the patrol. Only when I got there did Zuckerman call me and inform me that he was now the brigade commander.' 'The earth was shaking' After several months of commanding the patrol, Dahan passed the reins to Lt. Col. Naor Bublil, who was appointed to be the patrol unit's commander before the war, and returned to his previous position. 'Yehonatan was my battalion commander and then my brigade commander. I experienced difficult things that day, but when I saw him lying there I felt like the earth was shaking. If they took Steinberg away from us, it's already a drastic event. Steinberg was always a compass for us, in his life and certainly after his death. Every time you are in a dilemma, you ask yourself what Steinberg would have done,' said Dahan. And this compass also guides the soldiers and junior officers. 'When I commanded the patrol unit, there were quite a few soldiers and commanders who were wounded and returned to combat,' he added. 'They told me - 'If our brigade commander gave his life, who are we to say anything?'' Col. Zuckerman knew Steinberg even before he was drafted into the IDF. 'Yehonatan was an instructor at the Bnei Akiva branch in Givat Ze'ev with my friends. In the army, he was always a position ahead of me. We studied together for our bachelor's degree in education with a teaching certificate. Yoni was tall and a splendid leader,' he said. Yiska finds solace in the beautiful years they had. 'The greater the pain, the greater the gratitude that we were blessed with such a meaningful life together and such wonderful and sweet children,' she said. 'I cry that it's over, and in the same breath, I feel the power of gratitude. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Yoni.'

IDF clears out Hamas terror base in northern Gaza hospital	Army says completed raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, used as Hamas command center, seizing weapons, funds and documents tied to terror group, with 60 suspects arrested inside, including some linked to October 7 attacks The IDF announced Monday that it had completed a high-stakes raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya, which the army said served as a 'terror command center' for Hamas terrorists. The raid, led by the 162nd Division, uncovered weapons, terror funds and Hamas documents, with 60 terrorists reportedly apprehended within the hospital itself, including some linked to the October 7 attacks. These detainees were questioned on-site by Unit 504 intelligence operatives before being transferred to Israel for further investigation. During the raid, IDF commandos from the elite Shayetet 13 unit were captured on film searching hospital grounds and questioning an ambulance driver, who claimed that Hamas used hospital premises and ambulances to transport wounded fighters. 'Hamas operatives are everywhere—yards, gates, offices, schools, hospitals. They even use ambulances to move their fighters,' the driver reportedly said, expressing frustration at the situation. The military noted that the operation would continue in Jabaliya with two brigades remaining while a third unit would be rotated out. The IDF estimates a few hundred Hamas fighters are still present in the city, while around 600 terrorists surrendered in the broader campaign, including many who reportedly passed through new checkpoints around Jabaliya's refugee camp. The IDF’s larger effort across northern Gaza has also seen significant challenges, with Hamas employing extensive guerrilla tactics, explosive devices and fortified positions. The operation revealed what the military says is Hamas' reliance on explosive devices fashioned from unexploded Israeli ordnance scattered across the sector, which IDF forces neutralized via controlled detonations to prevent future use.

The IDF estimates that only a few hundred Hamas fighters remain in Jabaliya, noting that the concentration of Hamas forces in the northern Gaza sector underpins the significance of the recent operations. The military reported initial difficulties in evacuating civilians from Jabaliya, but this hurdle has eased over the past week as more residents reportedly feel less constrained by Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syejqg6ejl	2024-10-28T03:23:04-07:00

Close call: IDF says investigating near-collision between F-16s a...	Fighter jet cleared for strike mission in Lebanon aborts takeoff at last moment upon spotting another aircraft on runway, veering sharply to avoid potential collision; 'It’s coming, it’s coming. Aborting takeoff,' pilot heard saying in recording A potentially catastrophic incident was narrowly averted over the weekend at northern Israel's Ramat David Air Base when an F-16 jet preparing for a strike mission in Lebanon cleared for takeoff nearly collided with another fighter jet crossing the same runway, the IDF reported Monday morning, adding that it was investigating what has led to the near-collision. According to a recording of the event, the F-16 pilot was forced to quickly adjust, averting a close call that raised immediate concerns about airfield safety protocols. Video footage reveals the pilot urgently relaying, 'It’s coming, it’s coming. Aborting takeoff.' The quick response kept the F-16 from advancing within a few hundred feet of the other plane on the runway. According to the military, the near-collision was caused by an erroneous takeoff clearance from the air traffic control tower with the pilot’s rapid response preventing what could have been a major accident. No damage or injuries were reported. Brig. Gen. Roi Bakshi, head of the IDF’s multi-domain division, was piloting the F-16 and reportedly asked the control tower, 'Did you see that plane on the runway?' The Israeli Air Force has since launched an in-depth investigation to understand the circumstances and ensure such an incident does not recur.

ICC in turmoil as top prosecutor's harassment scandal deepens, re...	Sources allege Karim Khan pressured female staffer for nearly a year to deny sexual harassment claims against him amid speculation arrest warrant requests for Israeli leaders might be cover for allegations International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan has allegedly pressured a female subordinate to deny sexual harassment claims against him, British newspaper The Guardian reported on Sunday. According to the report, Khan allegedly tried to engage in unwanted sexual relations with the employee and reportedly 'pressed his tongue' into the woman’s ear, as well as making other inappropriate advances. When she sought to file a complaint, Khan allegedly pressured her to submit a written statement retracting her allegations. The report also noted that the ICC swiftly dismissed the case after a brief investigation, despite having warned Khan to avoid contact with the woman. The case has prompted internal scrutiny and raised questions about the ICC’s handling of harassment complaints against senior figures. As speculation circulated, the newspaper clarified that Israel is not implicated in these emerging allegations, despite unrelated tensions over Khan’s recent calls for arrest warrants against Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The Guardian has previously been critical of Israel, having published claims of Israeli surveillance targeting ICC officials, though it did not link this recent investigation of Khan to his rulings on Israel-Palestine cases. The allegations were first reported by the Daily Mail, and according to The Guardian, based on interviews with 11 court officials and sources, there has been internal upheaval at the ICC as Khan faces these accusations. The ICC has yet to comment on any actions it may take regarding Khan’s role. At home, in the office, in hotel rooms The report alleges that Khan has harassed a lawyer under his supervision, with reports suggesting that the harassment spanned a year, from April 2023 to April 2024, escalating across various settings including Khan’s office, his home and on work trips. Sources indicated that the lawyer, in her 30s, attempted to distance herself from Khan, leading to adverse effects on her work. On one work trip to London, Khan allegedly held her hand and, over time, made repeated attempts to initiate physical contact, reportedly even engaging in inappropriate physical acts such as inserting his tongue in her ear, as shared by colleagues. Documents obtained by The Guardian suggest the lawyer feared filing an official complaint due to potential repercussions on her career and family. She also reportedly worried that critics of the ICC, such as Israel, might exploit her allegations. The ICC’s independent review mechanism advised Khan to avoid contact with the lawyer. However, the response to the allegations reportedly consisted of a rushed meeting with the victim in a hotel room in The Hague, where, according to the report, the investigation was closed within two days after the lawyer expressed distrust in the ICC’s handling of the review. The Guardian's investigation highlights persistent issues within the ICC’s internal processes, where skepticism about the independent review body has led some employees to avoid official complaints. Despite the ICC claiming the lawyer refused an external investigation, records show she agreed to meet with investigators again, contradicting claims that an outside review was offered. The incident has stirred controversy amid the ICC’s ongoing high-profile work, including Khan’s requests for arrest warrants for Israeli officials. The attempted silencing After the allegations surfaced, the court advised him to limit his contact with the employee, including avoiding evening or solo meetings and refraining from taking her on business trips. However, sources claim that, in defiance of these guidelines, Khan allegedly continued to interact with the employee, including discussing the allegations directly with her in private meetings and phone calls. An associate in Khan’s office reportedly pressured the employee to write a letter retracting her claims, emphasizing Khan’s concern about the potential political fallout if the allegations were made public. The Guardian further reports that Khan and his associate persistently encouraged the employee to retract her claims in writing between May and September, suggesting this would allow a return to 'normalcy' in their professional relationship. The employee declined to retract the allegations, yet also refrained from filing a formal complaint, though sources believe Khan's attempts to suppress the accusations may have ultimately led to a complaint being filed regardless. The Israel link and the next step Khan, 54, has firmly denied the allegations, dismissing them as a possible 'smear campaign' by court opponents. While Khan has not directly accused Israel, he has insinuated that critics of the ICC may be exploiting these claims. However, The Guardian noted that there is no evidence linking Israel to the allegations against Khan. The investigation reported that senior officials at the ICC are increasingly concerned about the court's internal handling of the allegations. Additionally, the court's staff union has called for an independent probe, managed externally to ensure impartiality. Meanwhile, the complainant is reportedly in communication with the Assembly of States Parties (ASP)—the ICC's oversight body—although no formal investigation has been launched. Sources within the ICC told The Guardian that while they worry the scandal could be politically exploited by ICC critics, including Israel, they emphasized that the arrest warrant requests against Netanyahu and Gallant were in motion before Khan was made aware of the allegations. Khan’s legal team has also denied claims that he or his associates pressured the complainant to retract her allegations, saying no such requests were made on his behalf. The ASP’s response and potential action in the matter will determine Khan’s future as ICC prosecutor, though the organization has yet to announce any formal inquiry.

IDF says investigating near-collision between F-16s at northern I...	A potentially catastrophic incident was narrowly averted over the weekend at northern Israel's Ramat David Air Base when an F-16 jet cleared for takeoff nearly collided with another fighter jet crossing the same runway, the IDF reported Monday morning, adding that it was investigating what has led to the near-collision. The F-16 pilot was forced to quickly adjust, averting a close call that raised immediate concerns about airfield safety protocols. According to the military, the near-collision was caused by an erroneous takeoff clearance from the air traffic control tower. The pilot’s rapid response prevented what could have been a severe accident. The Israeli Air Force has since launched an in-depth investigation to understand the circumstances and ensure such an incident does not recur.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sya2paneyx	2024-10-28T01:28:10-07:00	
Satellite images show extent of Israeli strike at 2 Iranian bases	Additional satellite images from Parchin base, previously linked to nuclear development, reveal destroyed building and damage to others; significant damage also visible at Khojir production site An Israeli strike on Iran damaged facilities at two military bases southeast of Tehran, previously linked by experts to Iran's former nuclear weapons program and its ballistic missile efforts, according to satellite images analyzed on Sunday. Some damaged structures were at Iran’s Parchin military base, where the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suspects high-explosive tests connected to nuclear weapons were conducted in the past. Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful, though the IAEA and Western intelligence agencies say Tehran had an active weapons program until 2003. Further damage was visible at the nearby Khojir military base, believed by analysts to house an underground tunnel network and missile production facilities. Iran’s military has not acknowledged damage at either Khojir or Parchin from Israel’s attack early Saturday, though it has said the assault killed four Iranian soldiers working in the country’s air defense systems. Iran announced Sunday a civilian also had been killed, but provided no details. Satellite images reveal damage to facilities used for combining solid fuel for missiles. Researcher David Albright noted that images from Parchin show damage to three buildings, including two used for integrating solid fuel into ballistic missiles. Another researcher stated that Planet Labs satellite photos from Parchin indicate Israel destroyed three buildings used for ballistic missile production with solid fuel, along with a warehouse. Images from Khojir show two similar buildings were also destroyed. It remains unclear how many sites in total were targeted in the Israeli attack. There have been no images of damage so far released by Iran’s military. Iranian officials have identified affected areas as being in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. Burned fields could be seen in satellite images from Planet Labs PBC around Iran’s Tange Bijar natural gas production site in Ilam province on Saturday, though it wasn’t immediately clear if it was related to the attack. Ilam province sits on the Iran-Iraq border in western Iran.

Israel inks $500 million defense deal for expanded laser intercep...	This deal heralds a new era—the era of laser defense,' Defense Ministry says after signing massive deal; first operational deployment of ground-based laser system expected next year The Defense Ministry announced Monday a major deal worth approximately NIS 2 billion (around $500 million) to boost its acquisition of advanced Iron Beam laser interception systems. Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, who signed the agreement Sunday, said, 'This deal heralds a new era—the era of laser defense,' adding that the first operational capability of the ground-based laser system is expected to be deployed within the next year. The multi-billion-shekel agreement, reached between the Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&D) and primary contractors Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems, marks a significant increase in production pace to ensure timely, high-volume delivery of laser units. The Iron Beam system, designed to intercept various aerial threats such as rockets, mortar shells, drones and cruise missiles, has demonstrated its capabilities in recent trials and is set to join Israel’s multi-tiered defense network as a cost-effective addition to the Iron Dome. 'Since the outbreak of the war, the Defense Ministry has signed hundreds of procurement orders worth billions to bolster Israeli-manufactured defense capabilities and ensure Israel’s self-reliance,' said Zamir. The ministry’s statement noted that the integration of Iron Beam will significantly enhance Israel's defensive capacity against current and future threats at a fraction of conventional interception costs. 'Global superiority' 'The Iron Beam is yet another testament to the professionalism, creativity and innovative prowess of our defense industries, supported by partnerships between defense companies and startups,' DDR&D head Brig. Gen. (res.) Dr. Danny Gold said. He noted that Israel's capability to develop and deploy advanced laser interception technology on the battlefield is a reflection of both technical mastery and effective project management. Rafael CEO Yoav Turgeman highlighted that after years of research, the Iron Beam laser system—the first of its kind worldwide—is set for deployment. 'Rafael is proud to lead the development of this high-powered, versatile laser interception system. Following a series of rigorous tests, the Iron Beam will soon reach operational maturity,' Turgeman said. Elbit President and CEO Bezhalel Machlis (Butzi) Machlis called the development 'a significant leap forward in defense against diverse threats.' Elbit, known as Israel's 'laser powerhouse,' collaborated closely on Iron Beam’s development. 'Our teams at Elbit have played a critical role in advancing this groundbreaking defense capability, which we believe will set a new standard in strategic defense for Israel,' Machlis said.

Mother recounts how she saved her infant as Hamas terrorists set ...	Amy Laban, a member of Kibbutz Nirim, recalls how she, her husband Uriel, their newborn son Kai and her mother Deborah huddled in the safe room for 6 hours, opening and closing the window to get some fresh air until IDF troops arrived to rescue them Nothing prepared 30-year-old Amy Laban, a Kibbutz Nirim member and teacher in the Eshkol Regional Council, and her husband, Uriel—a capoeira instructor and hydrotherapist—for the traumatic turn their parental leave would take. Just 10 days before the October 7 Hamas terror attack they welcomed their first son, Kai. The day before, they celebrated Simchat Torah in a decorated sukkah with their kibbutz community. The joy was threefold—they celebrated the holiday, Kai’s circumcision, and their official acceptance into Kibbutz Nirim, where Uriel had grown up after emigrating from Argentina at age 10. Amy's mother, 60-year-old Deborah Mintz from Eilat, had come to celebrate and stayed overnight. 'We woke up to rocket sirens, Amy recalled. 'I called my mom, and we rushed to the safe room. We thought it would be like usual—a few rockets, then we’d have breakfast and move on. But the rockets didn’t stop, and we realized something was different. After an hour, we started hearing gunfire and people shouting in Arabic around the kibbutz. We didn’t understand much, but my husband and I locked the safe room door and shut the metal window tight, waiting for whatever came next.' 'At 8:30 am, I heard them break into our house. We couldn’t see anything because they’d cut the power. My husband and I held the safe room door handle tightly, while my mom held our 10-day-old baby, trying to quiet him by gently putting a finger in his mouth. They couldn’t break in—they only managed to chip a small slit in the door. That’s when they set the house on fire.' 'We were in the safe room, with my mother and our 10-day-old, as the house burned around us. Smoke and soot filled the air for six hours. I got our dog into the room, but my mom’s smaller dog, scared, hid under the couch outside. When they set the house on fire, we heard him crying. We believe he was burned. They even torched our cars to make sure we had nothing left. We begged for rescue on WhatsApp. It was terrifying, but we each focused on a task. After the fire started, I stayed by the door while my husband opened the window intermittently to release the smoke. My mom held the baby.' 'I nursed Kai whenever he cried. When we thought things were quiet outside, we’d open the window and let him get some air. Whenever a terrorist passed by, we’d quickly pull him in, put him on the bed, shut the window, and crouch down. They even shot at the metal window, but thankfully, the glass held. For six hours, we played a game of opening and closing the window just to breathe until they finally rescued us. Our kibbutz’s amazing response team managed to neutralize a few terrorists with the help of four brave members until the army arrived around 2:30 pm.' 'They broke down the shutters and got us out, took us to a shelter, and guarded us outside. They found an oxygen tank to share before we headed to the hospital. Since the ambulance couldn’t reach us, two incredible soldiers, unarmed, took the risk and drove us to Soroka Medical Center. Kai was hospitalized for three days. Thankfully, all his tests came back normal. My husband and I alternated in the ER with eye irritations and smoke inhalation; we’re all still coughing. A few days later, we managed to relocate with the kibbutz to Eilat, where my mom lives.'

Chicago police investigate shooting of Jewish man en route to syn...	Gunman exchanges fire with police, reportedly shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ during confrontation; local Jewish community expresses frustration, criticizing law enforcement for not acknowledging religious identity of victim in initial reports A 39-year-old Jewish man was shot in the back while walking to a synagogue in Chicago’s West Rogers Park neighborhood on Saturday morning, in what some community members allege may be a hate-driven attack. The incident, reported by Yeshiva World News, occurred around 9:35 a.m. in an area with a significant Orthodox Jewish population. Witnesses recounted that the shooter, reportedly a 23-year-old man, yelled 'Allahu Akbar' as he exchanged fire with responding officers. The suspect initially fled but returned to a nearby alley about 20 minutes later, where he reportedly fired at police and emergency responders, striking an ambulance during the exchange. Police noted that the suspect fired from multiple locations, prompting a prolonged confrontation that ended when officers shot him multiple times, leaving him in critical condition at St. Francis Hospital. The victim was treated at a local hospital for a shoulder wound and has since been discharged. Chicago police have not publicly addressed speculation about the attack’s potential antisemitic motive, although local Jewish leaders have voiced frustration over the absence of statements acknowledging the victim's background. Police recovered the weapon used in the shooting and have refrained from commenting on an alleged motive, while local Jewish groups continue to press for answers and assurances regarding the safety of their community.

‘We’re negotiating with ourselves’: Israeli officials pessimistic...	In first summit since Sinwar’s death, Israel remains skeptical of Egypt's proposal, while officials stress any cease-fire requires Hezbollah and Iran to pressure Hamas toward negotiations Mossad Director David Barnea began talks in Doha on Sunday with CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani in an effort to renew negotiations on possible frameworks for a deal to secure the release of 101 hostages held by Hamas. This marks the first high-level meeting between the parties in two months and the first since the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The primary goal of this meeting is to advance a new plan that takes into account recent proposals brought forward by the negotiating teams. Officials have indicated that a broader, four-party summit, potentially involving Egypt and Hamas representatives, could take place in the coming days to advance these efforts. Positive developments for Israel in Gaza and Lebanon are seen as creating significant momentum for returning to intensive negotiations. The Egyptian proposal Meanwhile, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi publicly presented Cairo’s proposal, which involves a 48-hour cease-fire in exchange for the release of four hostages in return for some Palestinian prisoners. The proposal, aimed at 'moving the situation forward,' would allow for a 10-day negotiation period to discuss terms for a long-term cease-fire. According to sources cited by Al Arabiya, Hamas has welcomed Egypt’s proposal but expressed reservations about the lack of Israeli guarantees. Hamas reportedly opposes a cease-fire without a full Israeli withdrawal from northern Gaza and the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors. 'Our demands are clear and transparent, and an agreement is within reach if [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu commits to the terms discussed,' Hamas official Hossam Badran told Al Jazeera. ‘We’re negotiating with ourselves’ Israeli officials expressed skepticism about any potential breakthroughs in negotiations with Hamas, citing the upcoming U.S. presidential election on November 5 as a significant factor likely to delay progress. Officials in Jerusalem remain unconvinced of the viability of a proposal from Egypt’s intelligence chief, Hasan Rashad, according to sources familiar with the discussions. 'It’s been like this since January,' said an official close to the talks. 'We’re negotiating with ourselves, or at best with intermediaries. At no point has there been a real negotiation with Hamas. They’ve set a demand and haven’t moved an inch from it: a complete end to the fighting and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and that’s not happening.' This pessimism is rooted in a widespread belief in Israel that Hamas will settle for nothing less than a full withdrawal from Gaza, including from the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah crossing. Netanyahu is seen as unlikely to agree to such terms, fearing it could destabilize his coalition due to opposition from ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. Still, Mossad Director Barnea has been developing a new negotiation framework over the past three weeks. On Thursday, Barnea met with Rashad in Cairo to update him on the plan, which will likely incorporate elements of both the Egyptian proposal and other options. Barnea remains hopeful that the intimate setting of Doha could restart direct negotiations for a hostage deal. The discussions in Doha are also expected to touch on the Lebanese front. According to a source quoted by The Wall Street Journal, Barnea does not believe Israel should agree to a cease-fire in Lebanon unless Hezbollah and Iran pressure Hamas to release the hostages in Gaza. Separately, Lebanese network LBCI cited a diplomatic source who said, 'The meeting in Doha has opened a door. There’s been slight progress on Gaza, and there’s genuine interest in a prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel.' The diplomatic source added that Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri had informed Qatar and Egypt that Hezbollah is willing to separate the fronts and accept UN Resolution 1701 as part of a combined package, meaning the Lebanon issue will be included in the ongoing negotiations. A Qatari-Egyptian meeting with Hamas is expected, and a high-ranking Qatari security envoy is set to visit Beirut to address Lebanon’s concerns and demands. In response, Berri’s office said, 'The recent media reports on Speaker Berri’s remarks regarding the negotiations are inaccurate.'
