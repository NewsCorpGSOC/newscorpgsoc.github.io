Senior Hamas member and UNRWA staffer, killed in Tyre, Hamas says	Fatah Sharif Abu al Amin praised the Hamas massacre on October 7, was temporarily suspended from the UN agency for 'violating regulations' The Hamas terror group said on Monday that its senior member, Fatah Sharif Abu al Amin, was killed in an IDF strike in the area of Tyre, along with his wife, son and daughter. Al Amin who was quick to praise the Hamas massacre on October 7 was described as the terror group's leader in Lebanon and a member of its international leadership. He was also employed by the UN's Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees UNRWA and was chairman of its teacher's union. UNRWA said he was suspended from his position as teacher in the UN's school last march for a period of three months over what it described was a violation of regulations. After his suspension, dozens protested outside the UNRWA offices in Beirut. Israel accused the UN agency of employing terrorists in Gaza, some of whom participated in the October 7 atrocities. The UN admitted that at least nine of its employees were probably involved in the massacre. The western areas of South Lebanon are Hamas's main stomping grounds and its operatives there, have been responsible for much of the rocket fire targeting Nahariya and towns north of Haifa.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syc0nadac	2024-09-29T23:39:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/rkGISnD00/rkGISnD00_0_143_628_354_0_small.jpg

Senior PFLP members killed in Beirut strike	The attack on an apartment block in Beirut was the first carried out on a Sunni neighborhood outside the Hezbollah stronghold in the Dahieh A Palestinian terror group said on Monday that three of its leaders were killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut, the first attack within city limits as Israel escalated hostilities against Iran's allies in the region. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the three leaders were killed in a strike that targeted Beirut's Kola district. The strike hit the upper floor of an apartment building in the Kola district of Lebanon's capital, Reuters witnesses said. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military. The PFLP is another group taking part in the fight against Israel. Israel's increasing frequency of attacks against the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and the Houthi militia in Yemen have prompted fears that Middle East fighting could spin out of control and draw in Iran and the United States, Israel's main ally. Israel on Sunday launched airstrikes against the Houthi militia in Yemen and dozens of Hezbollah targets throughout Lebanon after earlier killing the Hezbollah leader. The Houthi-run health ministry said at least four people were killed and 29 wounded in airstrikes on Yemen's port of Hodeidah, which Israel said were a response to Houthi missile attacks. In Lebanon, authorities said at least 105 people had been killed by Israeli air strikes on Sunday. Lebanon's Health Ministry has said more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said a million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes. The intensifying Israeli bombardment over two weeks has killed a string of top Hezbollah officials, including its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Israel has vowed to keep up the assault and says it wants to make its northern areas secure again for residents who have been forced to flee Hezbollah rocket attacks. Monday's attack in the Kola district appeared to be the first strike within Beirut's city limits. Syrians living in southern Lebanon who had fled Israeli bombardment had been sleeping under a bridge in the neighborhood for days, residents of the area said. The United States has urged a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Lebanon but has also authorized its military to reinforce in the region. U.S. President Joe Biden asked if an all-out war in the Middle East could be avoided, replied: 'It has to be.' He said he would be talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1h7qiwac	2024-09-29T21:13:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/BkxWXksvR0/BkxWXksvR0_0_60_800_450_0_small.jpg
Hezbollah names new leader after Nasrallah assassination, report ...	Terror group's executive council head Hashem Safieddine reportedly tapped to succeed cousin slain in Israeli airstrike in Beirut; Iranian axis making arrangements for 'historic funeral' Hezbollah's Shura Council has chosen Hashem Safieddine as the organization's new secretary-general, following the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike on Beirut’s Dahieh district on Friday, Saudi television channel Al Hadath reported Sunday. Safieddine is Nasrallah's cousin and the head of Hezbollah's executive council. His appointment has yet to be officially confirmed by either Hezbollah or Lebanese authorities. Reports over the weekend identified Safieddine as a likely successor to Nasrallah, and various outlets noted that he was not present at the senior meeting where Nasrallah was killed. Safieddine, who closely resembles Nasrallah, is also the son-in-law of former Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani. Often referred to as Nasrallah’s 'shadow,' he has served as Hezbollah’s second-in-command, overseeing the group’s daily operations, including its institutions, finances and investments both in Lebanon and abroad. Since 1994, when Nasrallah recalled him from his studies in Qom, Iran, to lead Hezbollah's executive council—essentially the group’s government—Safieddine has managed all sensitive issues while Nasrallah handled strategic matters. His close ties to both Hezbollah's military wing and Iran have been well-documented, and he has been on the U.S. terrorist list since 2017. Meanwhile, it remains unclear when Nasrallah's funeral will take place. According to Reuters, his body was recovered from the site of the attack. A medical and security official in Lebanon told Reuters that the body was intact and Nasrallah did not suffer direct injuries. His death was attributed to the trauma caused by the explosion. Initial reports suggested the funeral would be held on Monday, but there has been no confirmation from Lebanese or Hezbollah officials. Lebanon’s An-Nahar newspaper reported that Hezbollah's leadership has been holding high-level consultations, involving officials from Iraq and Iran, to finalize funeral arrangements. Although no official statement has been made by Hezbollah, sources say a 'historic funeral' is planned in Beirut. There are also reports that prayers will be held in Iran, after which Nasrallah’s body will be flown to Karbala, Iraq, for burial near Imam Hussein, grandson of Prophet Muhammad and one of the most important figures in Shia Islam. In Iran, a portrait of Nasrallah was displayed alongside President Masoud Pezeshkian during a government meeting on Sunday. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari, in an interview with Sky News Arabia, said Nasrallah 'escalated tensions in Lebanon for Hamas. He paid the price. The world is safer without him; he terrorized many in the region.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1g113nva0	2024-09-29T14:08:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2022/05/20/HyaGDCEv9/HyaGDCEv9_0_0_680_396_0_small.jpg

Strike on Hodeidah port disrupts Houthi fuel supply, military say...	Gallant says cost of attacking Israel 'seen on television screens around the world' in response to repeated missile launches by Houthi rebels The IDF said Sunday that it launched airstrikes on the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah and nearby targets in Yemen after the rebel group repeatedly fired missiles at Israel. Dozens of Israeli fighter jets bombed the city's power station and port, hitting infrastructure used for oil intake as well as an oil depot that had been spared in a previous Israeli strike in July in retaliation for a deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv. The IDF said the attack has halted fuel supplies through the seaport and is expected to severely impact the Houthis' military capabilities. 'This time we targeted the Houthis' bottleneck,' the military said. The IDF confirmed that Air Force jets, which flew 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from Israel, refueled mid-flight during the operation. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was present at the Air Force command center during the strikes. 'The military's ability to strike on seven fronts almost simultaneously speaks volumes about its strength,' Gallant said. 'We are targeting the tentacles of Iran that are spread across the region.' Gallant praised the IDF's long-range capabilities, saying, 'These strikes send a clear message to those who seek to harm us: Israel will exact a heavy price, and we mean it. The cost of attacking Israel is seen on television screens around the world.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk001bmprr	2024-09-29T13:24:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/BkalHyDA0/BkalHyDA0_1_241_352_198_0_small.jpg
Since October 7, 170 new books on the war published, report revea...	National Library report finds most frequently covered topics in recent publications include hostages, stories of heroism, protests, soldiers' memories and rise of antisemitism in diaspora As the first anniversary of the October 7 terrorist attack approaches, Israel's National Library released a special report on Sunday highlighting books published in the wake of the war. According to the report, 169 books and publications have been released, covering topics such as the hostages, stories of heroism, protests and memories of soldiers, as well as the rise of antisemitism in the Diaspora. Of these, 42 are research papers and reports, 30 are nonfiction and reference books, 29 are personal testimonies and accounts of heroism, 14 are poetry collections, 9 are works of fiction and 3 are children's books. The National Library emphasized that the report is only partial, noting that writing and publishing books is a lengthy and complex process, predicting that hundreds more books will be published in the coming years, including a significant number of memorial and tribute books expected to be released around the anniversary of the war. For comparison, the library examined the number of books published after the Yom Kippur War and found that about 300 were released within the first year (by the end of 1974). Over the following 50 years, thousands more books were published on the topic, both in Hebrew and other languages. Since the outbreak of the war on October 7, the National Library has been tasked with creating an archive that documents all aspects of the digital response. So far, this includes 500 million online items, such as WhatsApp messages, social media posts and videos, as well as two million digital files, more than a thousand printed materials like posters, flyers and booklets, and thousands of filmed testimonies. As part of its commemorative efforts, the library has launched a project titled 'Lives Lost: The Works of the Victims of October 7,' which honors those who wrote, edited and translated books before their lives were tragically cut short. Additionally, on October 6, the library will host a musical performance titled 'At the End of Tishrei: An Evening of Poetry and Remembrance,' featuring journalist Ben Shani as host and performances by Shlomi Saranga, Alma Gov, The Backyard and others. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryzhjyvr0	2024-09-29T13:07:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/10/SJr00F042DC/SJr00F042DC_145_147_1057_595_0_small.jpg
IDF chief’s cryptic photo sparks questions as Sinwar vanishes aft...	Army releases photo showing IDF chief seated in front of screen with picture of Hamas leader and question mark over his face, amid rumors Sinwar may be dead; speculation grew after reports he went incommunicado The IDF released a photo Sunday evening showing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi at his desk, with an infographic in the background featuring a picture of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar with a question mark over his face. Speculation has grown in Israel over the past week regarding Sinwar's status, with rumors circulating about whether he has been killed or injured after reports that he has been out of contact. However, defense officials said there is no concrete information confirming his whereabouts, and no recent targeted strikes have been reported in areas where Sinwar was believed to be. On Saturday, Saudi-based Al Arabiya reported that Sinwar changed his location in Gaza following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. The report also claimed that Hamas has adjusted its security protocols for Sinwar and other leaders in recent days. Sources told Al Arabiya that Hamas leaders are seeking guarantees in any future cease-fire agreement to ensure their safety. Additionally, Hamas has halted organizational meetings in Lebanon and restricted internal communications to written correspondence to avoid potential Israeli interception or tracking of senior officials' locations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdwngdrc	2024-09-29T12:50:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/11/HJa74KHSA/HJa74KHSA_0_0_713_401_0_small.jpg

Mocked Israel, suppressed hijab protests: Iranian general assassi...	Iranian deputy foreign minister vows killing of Abbas Nilforoushan 'will not go unanswered'; sanctioned by US in 2022 for role in suppressing civil rights protests in Iran Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi vowed on Sunday that Iran would avenge the killing of senior Quds Force officer Abbas Nilforoushan, who was killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's Dahieh district. 'This will not go unanswered,' Araghchi said, following confirmation from Iranian officials that Nilforoushan had been present in the underground headquarters at the time of the strike. Araghchi’s remarks come amid reports of an internal debate within the Iranian regime over how to respond to Nasrallah’s far more significant assassination. According to The New York Times, hardliners in Tehran are pushing for swift retaliation, while Iran's more moderate President Massoud Pezhkian is cautioning against a regional war that could severely damage Iran's economy. Regardless, Tehran may feel compelled to retaliate, as it did after the assassination of another top Iranian general in an Israeli strike on Damascus in April. Nilforoushan, 58, was described by Iranian media as the 'deputy commander of operations' for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, where he oversaw ground forces. While it’s unclear what he was doing in Lebanon, AP notes the Quds Force’s crucial role in arming and directing Iran’s proxies throughout the Middle East, most notably Hezbollah. Recent reports suggest that Nilforoushan was effectively the Quds Force commander in Syria and Lebanon. Iran’s deputy judiciary chief Ahmad Reza Kahan declared that Nilforoushan had been 'a guest of the Lebanese people' and that Iran has a right to respond under international law. Nilforoushan had previously mocked Israel, frequently repeating anti-Israel rhetoric similar to that of Nasrallah. In a 2022 interview with Iran’s state news agency IRNA, he said: 'The Zionist regime has many cracks—ethnic, cultural, social and military. The regime is more vulnerable to collapse than ever.' That same year, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Nilforoushan, accusing him of playing a direct role in suppressing civil rights protests in Iran. The sanctions coincided with widespread demonstrations following the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died after being detained by Iran's morality police for not wearing a hijab in accordance with strict Sharia law. Nilforoushan blamed Iran's enemies for stoking the protests. Nilforoushan also fought alongside Syria’s Assad regime in the bloody civil war that saw the Syrian dictator maintain power with the help of Iran, Hezbollah and Russia. He began his military career during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, and Iranian media described him as a close associate of powerful Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2020. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj8wwwp0r	2024-09-29T12:22:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/S1P00iuSCR/S1P00iuSCR_0_10_800_450_0_small.jpg
Israel strikes on four fronts, sending stark warning to Iran	Senior official says fighter jets flew 1,800 kilometers to strike Houthi assets in Yemen, including Hodeidah port and airport, underscoring Air Force capable of reaching targets at similar distance to Iran if required The Israel Defense Forces launched extensive airstrikes Sunday on targets in Yemen, Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, including the Lebanese capital Beirut. The strikes reportedly targeted sites in Homs, western Syria and areas near Damascus. Senior officials told Ynet that the strike on Yemen came in response to Houthi missile fire on Tel Aviv on Saturday. The attack was also aimed at deterring Iran from retaliating for the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli officials said the strikes were intended to send a clear message to Iran, with the IDF showing it can engage on multiple fronts. Air Force jets flew 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) to strike Hodeidah, a distance comparable to that from Israel to Iran. 'The strike on Yemen aims to exact a heavy price for their attacks,' an Israeli official said. 'If the Houthis continue targeting Israel, our strikes will intensify.' Iran has vowed to avenge the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran last July in an attack attributed to Israel. The IDF said in a statement that dozens of Israeli Air Force planes, including fighter jets, mid-air refueling aircraft and reconnaissance planes, struck military targets belonging to the Houthi forces in the Ras Issa and Hodeidah areas of Yemen. The targets included power plants and a seaport used to import oil, which the Houthis used to transfer Iranian weapons. The military added that the damage to Houthi infrastructure would take time to repair. 'The IDF is determined to continue operating at any distance—near or far—against all threats to Israeli citizens,' the statement concluded. The military also confirmed targeted strikes on Hezbollah officials in Beirut’s Dahieh neighborhood, including a senior commander from Unit 1600, responsible for producing rocket and missile materials and trafficking the addictive stimulant Captagon. In Gaza, the IDF said it targeted a Hamas command center operating from a school. The military stressed it had taken precautions to avoid civilian casualties. Meanwhile, Syrian state media reported that air defenses were activated in response to Israeli strikes near Damascus, following earlier strikes on Homs. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkuvrevca	2024-09-29T11:59:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/By7x5sJPA0/By7x5sJPA0_0_453_520_293_0_small.jpg

New Hope Party leader Gideon Sa'ar joins government amid war	Veteran lawmaker assigned minister without portfolio, will be included in inner circle of war consultations and serve as member of Security Cabinet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday that New Hope Party leader Gideon Sa'ar is set to join the government as a minister without portfolio. He will also be included in the inner circle of war consultations and serve as a member of the Security Cabinet. Sa’ar’s return to government comes after years of tension between him and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Once a close ally and a senior figure in the prime minister's ruling Likud party, Sa’ar broke away from Likud in 2020 to form the New Hope Party, citing deep disagreements with Netanyahu’s leadership and policies. Sa’ar had previously held key roles under Netanyahu’s leadership, including serving as minister of education and the interior. However, his defection was seen as a direct challenge to Netanyahu, as Sa’ar became one of his most vocal critics, positioning himself as an alternative leader on the right. In the early days of the war, Sa'ar joined an emergency unity government with Netanyahu under the National Unity alliance with former IDF chiefs of staff Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, taking part in the War Cabinet. Sa'ar, Gantz and Eisenkot resigned from the Cabinet in June, citing their inability to influence key decision-making processes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryaeq11prr	2024-09-29T09:46:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/SJ5WXZv0C/SJ5WXZv0C_0_0_1280_836_0_small.jpg

Saudi crown prince says doesn't care about 'Palestinian issue'	Mohammed bin Salman reportedly tells Blinken kingdom's young population first learning about Israeli-Palestinian conflict through Gaza war Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in January that, while he does not personally prioritize the Palestinian issue, it holds significant importance for the Saudi people, according to a report by The Atlantic. 'Do I care personally about the Palestinian issue? I don’t, but my people do,' he reportedly said during a meeting in Al-Ula, a remote oasis in Saudi Arabia, as part of American efforts to address the ongoing war in Gaza and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages. The crown prince explained that with 70% of Saudi Arabia’s population being young, the Gaza war marked the first time many of them were exposed to the Palestinian issue. During the meeting, Blinken sought to revive talks on Saudi-Israeli normalization, which had stalled after the October 7 Hamas attacks and the subsequent war. When asked what it would take to resume progress, the crown prince responded, 'calm in Gaza.' According to the report, Blinken also inquired whether Saudi Arabia would tolerate Israeli operations in Gaza to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. Bin Salman reportedly replied that such incursions might be acceptable 'in six months or a year,' but stressed they could not be tied to any cease-fire agreement. A Saudi official later suggested that the details of the crown prince's comments in The Atlantic report were inaccurate but did not deny the overall substance of the remarks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1s1111ypra	2024-09-29T09:07:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/03/21/rylmMSKAT/rylmMSKAT_0_156_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF confirms strike on Houthi-controlled targets in Yemen	The IDF said it carried out a large-scale aerial operation on Sunday, striking what it described as 'Houthi-controlled military targets in Yemen,' about 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from Israel's border. 'The airstrikes focused on key military infrastructure in the Ras Issa and Hodeidah regions, including power stations and a port used for importing oil. These facilities were being used by the Iranian-backed Houthi regime to transfer weapons and military supplies, including oil, to their forces,' a statement read. According to the army, dozens of aircraft, including fighter jets, tankers and reconnaissance planes, participated in the operation, which was directed by the Military Intelligence Directorate. The IDF said the operation was in direct retaliation for recent Houthi missile attacks on Israel.

Houthi-controlled Hodeidah Port hit by explosions, reports say	Blasts comes after several missile launches by Iranian-backed rebels toward Israel over past week; port attacked by Israel in July in response to deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv Initial reports surfaced of explosions at the Hodeidah port in Yemen on Sunday evening. The incident follows a recent spike in missile activity from Yemen, where just Saturday night, a surface-to-surface missile was fired toward Israel, triggering air raid sirens across several regions. The missile was successfully intercepted outside Israeli territory. This latest missile was the second launched by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the past three days, adding to growing tensions. Earlier this month, the Houthis fired a missile at Israel, partially intercepted near Ben Gurion Airport, raising concerns over Israeli deterrence. Israel struck the Hodeidah port in July following a deadly drone strike in Tel Aviv—claimed by the Houthis. The drone attack at the time killed one person and injured 10 others. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1dbx1pac	2024-09-29T07:30:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/BJQ9QJP0C/BJQ9QJP0C_149_1_700_395_0_small.jpg

IDF targets senior Hezbollah commander in fresh Dahieh strike	Strike reportedly targets commander of Unit 1600, which oversees production materials for rockets and missiles, as well as drug manufacturing operations organization traffics globally to fund its activities The IDF resumed airstrikes on Sunday, targeting the Dahieh district in Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. The main target of the attack was reportedly the commander of Hezbollah's Unit 1600, a division responsible for developing missile and rocket materials, as well as weapons production. Unit 1600 is also allegedly behind the production and trafficking of the addictive, amphetamine-type stimulant drug Captagon, which funds Hezbollah's global terrorist activities. The unit's highly restricted bases are located within civilian neighborhoods, with access granted only to those with personal authorization from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah or his cousin, Hashem Safieddine. Safieddine, seen as Nasrallah's successor, was also reportedly targeted in a separate Israeli strike on Saturday. In the early hours, another strike was reported in Dahieh, raising tensions as Hezbollah revealed on Sunday the identities of senior commanders who died alongside Nasrallah. Among them was Ali Karaki, third in command and the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, who had previously survived an Israeli assassination attempt, and Nabil Qaouk, a central council member in charge of internal security. Hezbollah confirmed that Nasrallah’s body was recovered from the underground command bunker bombed on Friday. While Hezbollah's initial statement did not detail the exact circumstances of his death, sources indicated that Nasrallah had no visible wounds, and the likely cause of death was blunt trauma from the force of the blast. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk11211cl0a	2024-09-29T07:17:37-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/HJctRhIA0/HJctRhIA0_0_251_961_540_0_small.jpg
Pilots reveal: The tactical feints that led to Nasrallah's assass...	After leading successful assassination mission targeting Hezbollah leader in Beirut, 69th Squadron commander calls operation 'historic,' emphasizing precision, team effort and emotional impact; 'We knew exactly who the target was' Following the airstrike that eliminated Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah and key operatives, Hatzerim Air Base commander Brig. Gen. Amichai Levin hailed the operation as a historic military success. In an interview, Levin explained, 'Dozens of bombs hit the target within seconds, and no anti-aircraft missiles were fired.' The precision strike took out Nasrallah's command bunker in Beirut’s Dahieh district, a move Israel hopes will reshape the strategic landscape in the Middle East. Levin, in command for just two weeks before the operation, said the mission was a critical step toward achieving Israel's war objectives. 'Nasrallah was the central figure in the Shiite axis,' he said, adding that his elimination would significantly impact Hezbollah and Iran's regional strategies. The operation, conducted by Israel’s elite 69th Squadron, was executed with high-level coordination between intelligence and military units. 'The intelligence provided was incredibly precise, which allowed for such a successful mission,' Levin said. He emphasized that the mission showcased a level of decisiveness and initiative that had been missing before October 7, when Israel was caught off guard by surprise attacks from Hamas. 'This is my most important lesson from that day because we must act aggressively and proactively against those who seek to harm us and there are more of them. The mission is not over and we will keep striking Hamas at its roots as we deal with the northern threat.' 69th Squadron commander Lt. Col. M. noted that his wife is from a kibbutz near the northern border and her family was evacuated at the beginning of the war. 'This is a significant firepower with many planes. We waited for a few days until an opportunity arose. People realized this was an unusual opportunity, and therefore they had to know how to succeed and be very precise. Young teams that had only completed training a year ago, along with 50-year-olds in the reserves, participated in the mission. 'We knew exactly who was the target' The squadron commander led the formation alongside a reservist pilot. Describing the mission, Lt. Col. M. said, 'The operation went smoothly, exactly as planned. We knew exactly who was the target.' Following the landing, the emotional commander reflected on the significance of the mission. 'I hugged the crew because you probably only do something this big and historic once in a lifetime. The second hug was for my technical officer, who worked tirelessly to arm the planes. His brother was killed on the Lebanese border. The third was to my family, at Friday night dinner. We didn't talk much, waiting for results, but they understood.' Lt. Col. M. revealed that the target's identity was kept secret until just hours before the operation. 'When the pilots learned who the target was, they understood the mission's value and risk.' Brig. Gen. Levin added, 'The key operational challenge was precise intelligence—ensuring the target didn't flee before the strike. We employed creative tactics to ensure success.' He noted that Hezbollah's anti-aircraft defenses were neutralized prior to the operation, and the pilots synchronized a large amount of ordnance, striking within seconds of each other. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1svs2l00	2024-09-29T06:53:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/HkQ1ccWmAA/HkQ1ccWmAA_194_220_890_501_0_small.jpg

Syrian national wearing keffiyeh goes on rampage in Germany, crit...	A Syrian man wearing in the city of Essen set fire to a building, then threatened passers by with a machete while locals scrambled to safety; He was eventually apprehended, and the media is curiously silent about the incident A 41-year-old Syrian man launched an attack in the city of Essen in western Germany on Saturday night, injuring 31 German citizens, including eight children. Two of these children, ages 2 and 4, are in critical condition. Video footage from the scene shows the Syrian man wearing a keffiyeh and armed with a long machete. He set fire to one residential building, got into his gray Opel van, drove a few hundred yards, and set another residential building on fire. In footage captured before the arrival of security and firefighting forces, citizens are seen placing ladders, which were too short, against the building's exterior wall in an effort to get people out of the burning buildings. Parents, screaming hysterically for help, were desperately trying to rescue their children by pulling them out of windows. Ten minutes later, the suspect returned to his van, drove a short distance, and crashed into the windows of two shops. At this point, he exited the vehicle wielding a large machete and attempted to threaten those around him, but bystanders managed to keep their distance by throwing objects at him and using iron rods and wooden sticks. The police captured the suspect, but have not yet disclosed the motive for the attack. One line of investigation suggests that the Syrian was enraged by his wife leaving him, prompting a destructive spree, although this does not explain the attack on the additional building, the shop crashes, and the use of a machete. Some media outlets reported it as a terrorist attack, with journalists noting that he wore a keffiyeh on his head. Two helicopters evacuated the injured from the Essen attack, including five who were seriously wounded, to a nearby hospital. In both cases, the suspect used a gas canister to set the buildings ablaze. He ignited fires in the wooden staircases, trapping the building's residents with no means of escape. Despite the horrific attempt at mass murder and the critical condition of two toddlers (lung damage in children from smoke inhalation is extremely lethal), the German media, preoccupied throughout the weekend with harsh condemnations of Nasrallah's elimination (including from Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock), attempted to downplay the incident, push it to the back of the news, and conceal the fact that the perpetrator was a Syrian national. This attack is part of a wave of terrorist assaults on German citizens by Muslim immigrants, which has resulted in the murder of four citizens, including an on-duty police officer. This surge in terror has prompted authorities to adopt a firmer stance against Islamist elements in the country and a more aggressive policy against immigration, including the redeployment of police forces at the country's borders. The violence by Muslim immigrants in Germany has also strengthened the far-right in the country, as seen in elections held this month in three federal states, and in polls for the federal elections to be held next year. In neighboring Austria, where federal elections are being held today, the right-wing is also expected to win, primarily due to dissatisfaction with immigration policies and citizens' personal security concerns. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b12cchia0	2024-09-29T05:41:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/HJx11x4o8AA/HJx11x4o8AA_1_501_800_451_0_small.jpg

Nasrallah's body recovered from rubble two days after assassinati...	His body is intact and cause of death appears to be blunt trauma from the force of the blast The body of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been recovered from the site of an Israeli air attack on Beirut's southern suburbs and is intact, a medical source and a security source told Reuters on Sunday. While Hezbollah's statement on Saturday confirming Nasrallah's death did not say how exactly he was killed nor when his funeral would be, the two sources said his body had no direct wounds and that it appeared the cause of death was blunt trauma from the force of the blast. The IDF confirmed Saturday that Nasrallah was killed in the attack on Hezbollah's central headquarters Dahieh district of Beirut, and more than three hours later Hezbollah also confirmed that their leader was killed in the attack, but the Shiite terrorist organization did not specify exactly how and when his funeral would take place. Along with Nasrallah, Ali Karaki, commander of the southern front in Hezbollah, and other commanders in the terrorist organization also were killed in the same attack. More than 80 bombs, with an average weight of one ton of explosive material per bomb, were dropped on the Hezbollah headquarters, which the bunker-busting munitions penetrated, though Israel has not confirmed the use of such bombs. Squadron 69 ('The Hammers') led the attack in Operation New Order with its F-15I ('Thunder') planes, which are considered the leading bombers of the IDF. According to the IDF, the attack was carried out while the top brass of Hezbollah was at its headquarters and engaged in coordinating terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wspnlra	2024-09-29T04:52:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/Sk5APcURC/Sk5APcURC_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
How do Palestinians truly feel about Nasrallah's demise?	Despite criticism and occasional mocking of Palestinian Authority, PA leaders not celebrating Hezbollah chief's assassination by IDF;’ We are confident that Hezbollah will continue his path and uphold the banner of resistance until Jerusalem is liberated’ Nearing the twilight of his tumultuous reign, Hassan Nasrallah fashioned himself as the 'guardian of Palestine,' offering Hezbollah's military might to the cause against Israel. Yet, the relationship between the leader of the Iran-backed Shiite terror group and the Sunni Palestinians was not always harmonious. While Nasrallah engaged in alliances with various terrorist factions, tensions were particularly pronounced with the Palestinian Authority. Animosity between Hezbollah's secretary general and the Palestinian leadership dates back to the era of Yasser Arafat, who died in 2004. In an interview from that period, Nasrallah, when asked about his disagreements with the Palestinian leadership, retorted: 'What Palestinian leadership? Yasser Arafat? We do not recognize this leadership, and it holds no legitimacy among the Palestinians.' In another speech, he provocatively questioned: 'Why isn't there a Palestinian officer or policeman who would assassinate Arafat and proclaim Arafat a disgrace to the Palestinians?' A senior official from the Palestinian Authority, speaking to Ynet following Nasrallah's elimination, stated, 'There were never any ties with Nasrallah or his organization. On the contrary, he preferred to insult us, glorify Hamas, encourage them to defeat Fatah and oust them from power. He sought to incite and deepen the rift between Hamas and Fatah.' Despite this history, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas issued a succinct condolence message to the Lebanese people on the death of Nasrallah and to the citizens of the country. The PLO, an umbrella organization, also released a statement expressing sorrow and calling for an urgent cessation of the conflict 'against Palestinians and Lebanese.' In Ramallah, a protest against Israel took place in the evening, with images of Nasrallah prominently displayed. For Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the relationships were markedly different. Nasrallah viewed them as a critical operational arm within the territories for the 'axis of evil.' Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy leader of Hamas, stated in a recorded message: 'We mourn with the Palestinian people and the entire nation the death of Hassan Nasrallah and his fellow fighters.' He added: 'The occupation bears responsibility and consequences for Nasrallah's elimination and the attack in Beirut. The assassination of Hassan Nasrallah will not break the resistance.' Ziyad al-Nakhalah, secretary-general of Islamic Jihad, was also known to be close to Hezbollah's secretary-general and the Iranian leadership, which provided him significant financial support. 'The Palestinian resistance understands that it has lost great support in its path, and it will remain loyal to his memory and great legacy,' al-Nakhalah stated. 'We are confident Hezbollah will continue his path and uphold the banner of resistance until Jerusalem is liberated.' In Gaza, a year into the war initiated by Hamas and joined by Hezbollah, opinions diverged following Nasrallah's elimination. Anas Sharif, a journalist from Jabaliya who is affiliated with Hamas, tweeted: 'We belong to God, and to Him we shall return. O God, compensate us for our disaster and give us something better.' In contrast, Gazan journalist Ihab Al-Fasfus wrote on Facebook: 'In a moment, he found himself before God, accountable for all his deeds in creation... and there will be no intercession or forgiveness.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkqgriuaa	2024-09-29T04:36:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/Sk11jaXaBAC/Sk11jaXaBAC_0_227_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Special report by Lebanese journalist: Everyone is asking, 'Who b...	As refugee centers fill up and rent is jacked up following assassination of Hezbollah's Nasrallah, Lebanese public is reacting with either hysteria, repression or suspicion; Despite major blow, fear of Hezbollah still exists on the street 'This man, Hassan Nasrallah, will not die,' claimed Lebanese Hezbollah supporters on Saturday. Many of them are still waiting to see him on television screens, explaining what will happen next. They think that the announcement of his death is a ruse and a tactic designed to confuse the enemy. It's hard to believe. Yesterday I went for a long walk through Beirut's streets. The city, which always was bustling with life, seemed dead. In the few places where young people still gathered, there was complete hysteria: 'This man was killed in his prime, they killed him and humiliated him,' claimed Nasrallah's supporters, who were almost the only ones who went out into the street. A few hours before, Lebanese citizens held a demonstration in Beirut, with dozens of young people standing in the street, holding Lebanese flags and remaining silent. Although they are still afraid of Hezbollah operatives, their goal is to convey a message to the world that 'Lebanon will remain Lebanon,' with or without the terrorist organization and its leaders who have been eliminated. It is interesting to discover that the people pointed fingers at Iran and not at Israel. 'They abandoned him,' they said in Beirut. 'Nasrallah was revered in Tehran, (Supreme leader Ali) Khamenei brought him closer, made him an ally, and abandoned him.' Khamenei, so the supporters claimed, has a habit of abandoning his allies. First, he abandoned Ismail Haniyeh, then all of Gaza, and now Nasrallah. Lebanese Hezbollah supporters consider Nasrallah's death an Iranian betrayal. The Shiites in Lebanon, who are not members of my sect, are calling to boycott the Iranian ruler, whose representative was eliminated in the strike in the Dahieh district. On the night of the attack, people in the streets of Beirut were already telling stories about Iran's distance from Nasrallah, about his scorn in the eyes of leader Khamenei. These are stories that no one can confirm nor deny. Lebanese Hezbollah supporters consider Nasrallah's death an Iranian betrayal We now know that Hezbollah's actions were completely visible to Israeli intelligence. All his steps were monitored for many months. All the phone calls had another ear listening. A question that disturbs the Lebanese public is: 'Who betrayed Hezbollah?' Conspiracy theories are circulating, with one of them claiming that the Iranians betrayed him to reach a new nuclear agreement with the Americans. According to this theory, the Iranians lied to Nasrallah that the fighting against Israel would not last long but gave him up to the Israelis. Some believe it was the Syrian intelligence officers who led Israel to Nasrallah. Either way, someone betrayed Hezbollah, and Israel was able to discover the exact location of the organization's leadership. Somehow, Israel managed to discover the location and the participants of the secret meeting. The echoes of the explosion were felt dozens of kilometers away from the site of the bombing. This explosion reminded me of the mega-explosion in the port of Beirut in 2020 when the whole city shook following the magnitude of the horrific destruction, with hundreds of dead and injured. Citizens of Israel, think of us, of the innocent citizens of Lebanon. We are not a party to the war. We are suffering. The Lebanese waited with bated breath for confirmation of the rumors of Nasrallah's assassination. At first, they were sure that this was Israeli propaganda and Hezbollah waited almost a day to make the announcement. In the meantime, refugees from Dahieh found themselves and their families without a roof over their heads, crying, destitute, lost and refusing to believe that this disaster had befallen them. This situation did not start with Nasrallah's death. On Monday the residents of South Lebanon woke up to the sounds of sirens from the Israeli army bombings, which called them to evacuate their homes immediately. The residents fled, carrying a few belongings, and escaped in cars, creating an endless traffic jam. Their journey from southern Lebanon to Beirut, which usually takes two hours, took 20 long hours. When they finally arrived in Beirut, they found that no reception centers were waiting for them. There was no emergency plan. The Education Ministry opened makeshift schools, and Beirut residents voluntarily took refugees into their homes. The churches also took in refugees, but the Lebanese government was nowhere in sight to help or mobilize. Dahieh refused to take refugees at the beginning of the week. Now, when the residents fled in fear, they discovered that the reception centers were already full. Many had to spend the nights in their cars. Others slept by the side of the road, on blankets that they managed to get out of their homes before fleeing. Other refugees spent their days and nights in the Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, forced to reside near the dead buried there. There are also refugees who chose to flee to areas hostile to Hezbollah, such as the city of Tripoli in northern Lebanon. They discovered signs meant to welcome them. However, the refugees were warned not to hang pictures of the hated Nasrallah and to remove his pictures from their cars. Citizens of Israel, think of us, of the innocent citizens of Lebanon. We are not a party to the war. We are suffering. Even if some of the food stores are open, no one can afford to buy enough food. Meat has not been on our table for many days. Power outages last at least nine hours a day, and rent has tripled. A house that cost $1,000 two weeks ago has now jumped to $3,000. Two families squeeze into a small two-room apartment. We were promised a short war, but for almost a year the citizens of Lebanon have not known their fates. Anyone who can afford it, tries to escape or runs away. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese refugees are still sleeping under the stars. They say that Hezbollah is done! So they say. Some argue that this is just a short break before the next stage of the campaign. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hjgb45u0c	2024-09-29T04:19:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/yk14096132/yk14096132_1_134_1256_708_0_small.jpg

Pro-Palestinian campaigners protested at the gates of RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus on Sunday, accusing Britain of offering tacit support to Israel's ongoing operations in Gaza and elsewhere.

The changes were widely seen as an attempt by Putin to draw a 'red line' for the United States and its allies by signaling that Moscow will consider responding with nuclear weapons if they allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range Western missiles.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjzjdjicr	2024-09-29T03:12:37-07:00

Some 18 years have passed since the Second Lebanon War, and families whose loved ones were killed during that time are experiencing mixed emotions; Some are happy he's gone, but for many it just triggers a flood of painful memories The assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, one of Israel's premier enemies in recent decades, has elicited mixed reactions among bereaved families whose loved ones were killed during his tenure. For some, it represents personal and historical closure. Yet, emotions are far more complex: while it is indeed a significant achievement for Israel's security forces, it does not heal the deep wounds left by war on the souls of grieving parents, siblings and children. Liora Hasson, whose son, Staff Sergeant Guy Hasson, fell on August 13, 2006, during the final day of the Second Lebanon War, said she is 'not getting carried away' with celebrating until the entire so-called axis of evil is destroyed. 'If we put everything in perspective, I'm not celebrating or handing out sweets. I've already taken my hit. I am glad that the head of the 'axis of evil' has been eliminated, but I will only truly rejoice when the entire axis is destroyed. Until then, this is just a small point in my heart, warming another corner, but I'm not getting carried away. Revenge won't lead to anything. After today, we should remember what all the fallen in this current war have said and what our sons hoped for – that when this nation unites and works together, we will prevail eightfold. The only comfort would be if Guy returned; nothing else will help. As a Jewish Israeli, I am proud that we have wonderful sons in the sea, air and land forces who know how to do the job,.' she said. 'In a sense, quite the opposite – today I am sadder, and the pain is sharper. This entire period is déjà vu of what happened 18 years ago. If we were united and did not have this hatred among the people, we could have reached this operation much sooner. We have the capabilities and everything, but everything is overshadowed when there is hatred,' she added. 'There's a song written by Moshe Klughaft called 'We Deserve More.' I think what summarizes the IDF's tremendous success today in eliminating Nasrallah is seeing that we deserve more. We have an excellent army, a wonderful nation, and if we know how to direct it, unite it and not incite, then we will reach perfection, and as a people we deserve more. Today, there's nothing more fitting than this song to tell our leaders: we deserve more, more than what you are. We deserve leadership that understands and knows how to unite this nation. We deserve people who know how to take responsibility.' 'For many years I waited for Nasrallah to be held accountable' Tal Sheinbrum, whose brother Yaniv Sheinbrum fell in the Second Lebanon War alongside Guy Hasson, reflected on the sense of closure. 'This is something that has accompanied me personally and my family for 18 years since the Second Lebanon War, where I fought alongside Yaniv. We were both in Lebanon. On the last day, when the cease-fire terms had been agreed but had not yet taken effect, Yaniv was hit by an anti-tank missile. While they were treating him, another missile hit, and he died. I was deep in Lebanon at the time and was informed in the evening hours, and from that moment our lives changed. I won't say that I was preoccupied daily with Nasrallah's future, but for many years I waited for him to be held accountable for what happened to my brother and others during the 30 years he has led this organization. Hearing that it happened gave me a significant sense of closure and revenge for all the evil he brought to this world,' he said. Is there a message you’d like to convey to our leaders? 'The policy of containment has not proven itself. This attempt not to heat up the area and not to disturb the calm in the north and south has led us to a harsher reality than before. We need to respond wherever and whenever they try to harm us. Beyond that, I think the policy that relies solely on military action and strikes will not change the future for my children in the Middle East and in our country. We need to leverage military successes for a more strategic solution to change the reality so our children have a future here. As a citizen of the state, a father, and a bereaved brother – with all due respect to Nasrallah, Hezbollah and Hamas, in the end, the only thing that will determine the fate of the state and the chance for our children to live here is the internal relations among us within Israel. We need to stop the division, look at each other, and see our brothers.' Lt. German Rozhkov fell in battle near Hanita in the Western Galilee in March 2002, at the age of 22. That day, two terrorists infiltrated from Lebanon, positioned themselves on two hills near Kibbutz Hanita, and opened fire on cars passing by on a road near Kibbutz Matzuva. About 20 poeple were wounded and five were killed. Rozhkov, who happened to be in the area, bravely charged at the terrorists but did not survive the encounter. His mother, Ludmila, who lives in Kiryat Shmona and was evacuated to a hotel in Tiberias at the start of the war, called the assassination of Nasrallah an 'amazing event.' 'You have no idea how much I waited for this moment, as a bereaved mother. A single bullet from Hezbollah terrorists who infiltrated Israel caused me to lose my only son, German. He was a young officer who loved Kiryat Shmona so much and charged the terrorists courageously. Since I lost him, I haven't really had a life,' she told Ynet. She describes her feelings upon hearing about the assassination: 'I'm already waiting to visit German's grave in the military section of the cemetery in Kiryat Shmona. I will tell him that our army is strong and mighty, and there's nothing like our air force. The assassination of Nasrallah is an amazing event, something we should have seen long ago.' However, Ludmila emphasizes that the assassination does not end the struggle. 'Sure, they eliminated Nasrallah, the man who frightened us for many years, but this is not the time to be dazzled or relax. We must continue to act and deliver more blows. Who knows who will step into the shoes of this wicked man. It might be someone even more violent and determined in their ideology to destroy Israel.' During the Second Lebanon War, a great tragedy occurred in early August. Near the entrance to Kibbutz Kfar Giladi, soldiers from the Hiram battalion were preparing to enter Lebanon. As they were organizing at the entrance to the kibbutz cemetery, a rocket fired from Lebanon hit them directly. The blast killed Major Eli Alkarif and 11 other reserve soldiers. Alkarif's widow, Libi, talks abut the aftermath of the incident with pain. 'We have a group of widows who lost what was most precious to them. The husband who was killed left behind a wife and small children in the great tragedy of Kfar Giladi. Yesterday, there were rumors that perhaps Nasrallah had been killed, and today it became certain by morning. To tell the truth, there's no sense of relief; this is something that should have been done long ago, despite the complexity involved in such an assassination. Personally, I feel that justice has been done. I thought I would feel relief, but it didn't really happen. We went through a prolonged nightmare of threats and intimidation with Nasrallah, and it's good that he was eliminated. We must see who will come in his place and ensure that the residents of the north can safely return to their homes.' Tzion Saadia, whose son Liran was killed in the Second Lebanon War in 2006, responded to Nasrallah's assassination with a Biblical verse: ''I will pursue my enemies and overtake them; I will not turn back until they are destroyed.' The soil of Lebanon has claimed over a thousand soldiers' lives and wounded thousands, including our son Liran who fell in the Second Lebanon War, along with many fighters. The Israel Defense Forces is a strong army that we trust. For us, today feels like closure as the air force killed the arch-terrorist.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rj50zyic0	2024-09-29T02:45:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/SkShoYrRC/SkShoYrRC_0_166_1280_721_0_small.jpg

According to an IDF spokesperson, Qaouk was considered to be close to the top of the terrorist organization Hezbollah, and was directly engaged in promoting terrorism against the State of Israel and its citizens. He joined the organization in the 1980s, and is considered a knowledgable in his field.

He added that 'if Iran dares to open a front with Israel, the reaction will be severe and the price it will pay will be impossible for it.

Jared Kushner in an unusual post: 'No to cease-fire, let Israel f...	Son-in-law and adviser of former US President Donald Trump, praised assassination of Hassan Nasrallah as 'the most important day in the Middle East since the Abraham Accords breakthrough' which he brokered, and called on Israel to finish the job: 'It has no option to back down' Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump, who alsothe most important day in the Middle East since the Abraham Accords breakthrough.' 'I have spent countless hours studying Hezbollah and there is not an expert on earth who thought that what Israel has done to decapitate and degrade them was possible. This is significant because Iran is now fully exposed. The reason why their nuclear facilities have not been destroyed, despite weak air defense systems, is because Hezbollah has been a loaded gun pointed at Israel. Iran spent the last forty years building this capability as its deterrent,' Kushner posted on the X platform. 'President Trump would often say, 'Iran has never won a war but never lost a negotiation.' The Islamic Republic’s regime is much tougher when risking Hamas, Hezbollah, Syrian and Houthi lives than when risking their own. Their foolish efforts to assassinate President Trump and hack his campaign reek of desperation and are hardening a large coalition against them,' he also wrote in a long post. Kushner also said that 'Iranian leadership is stuck in the old Middle East, while their neighbors in the GCC are sprinting toward the future by investing in their populations and infrastructure. They are becoming dynamic magnets for talent and investment while Iran falls further behind. As the Iranian proxies and threats dissipate, regional security and prosperity will rise for Christians, Muslims and Jews alike.' Trump's advisor, who is Jewish, emphasized that Israel now finds itself with threat from Hamas in Gaza 'mostly neutralized' and with the 'opportunity to neutralize Hezbollah in the north', saying that 'It’s unfortunate how we got here but maybe there can be a silver lining in the end.' He emphasized that 'Anyone who has been calling for a ceasefire in the North is wrong. There is no going back for Israel. They cannot afford now to not finish the job and completely dismantle the arsenal that has been aimed at them. They will never get another chance.' Kushner described Iran as 'reeling' and said that Hezbollah's weapons cache is 'unguarded and unmanned.' 'Failing to take full advantage of this opportunity to neutralize the threat is irresponsible,' he wrote. 'This is a moment to stand behind the peace-seeking nation of Israel and the large portion of the Lebanese who have been plagued by Hezbollah and who want to return to the times when their country was thriving, and Beirut a cosmopolitan city. The main issue between Lebanon and Israel is Iran; otherwise there is a lot of benefit for the people of both countries from working together.' 'The right move now for America would be to tell Israel to finish the job. It’s long overdue,' he wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1poqflcc	2024-09-29T01:26:03-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/12/21/rygNGu6ZPp/rygNGu6ZPp_1717_459_1284_723_0_small.jpg

Iranian president at odds with hardliners on how to respond to Na...	Regime in Tehran was dumbfounded by Nasrallah's death and immediate steps were taken to secure Ayatollah Khamenei, fearing he might be next, NYT reports; President Pezeshkian thinks an attack on Israel might prove detrimental to Iran's security, while hardliners in Tehran advocate for a powerful response The assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah represents a significant strategic blow not only to the Lebanese terrorist group but also to the broader Iranian axis. This development raises pressing questions about how Iran will navigate its next steps. As detailed in the New York Times, which cites insights from four Iranian informants, the assassination of Nasrallah –a long-standing ally of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei – sent shockwaves of anxiety through Tehran's corridors of power. Iranian officials are reportedly pondering whether Iran itself might be Israel's subsequent target, with Khamenei – who, according to a recent Reuters report, has been relocated to a secure location – possibly in the crosshairs. 'This loss is devastating and, frankly, we have no means to recover from it,' Mohammed Ali Atbani, a former vice president of Iran, told the New York Times. 'We will not engage in war; that's not an option. Yet, Iran will steadfastly support armed groups in the region and continue efforts to ease tensions with the West. These objectives can be pursued concurrently,' he asserted. In the wake of Friday's attack on Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut, Khamenei convened an emergency session of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. Iranian sources briefing the Times reported that during this meeting, held at Khamenei's residence, there was significant discord over the nature of Iran's response. Conservative council members, including Saeed Jalili, who lost the recent presidential election to Pezeshkian, argued for a rapid move to 'restore deterrence' against Israel, fearing Netanyahu might otherwise push the conflict to Tehran’s doorstep, according to a source familiar with the meeting's details. In contrast, Pezeshkian, representing Iran's reformist camp that seeks to de-escalate tensions with the U.S. and lift sanctions, warned against a harsh and quick response, urging caution to avoid falling into what he claims is Netanyahu's trap –a bid to provoke a regional war. Additional moderate council members expressed during the meeting that Israel has 'crossed all red lines,' while voicing concerns that an Iranian attack on Israel might invite a direct counterstrike against critical infrastructure within the Islamic Republic. Given its current economic fragility, they argued, Iran cannot afford such a confrontation. In his first public statement following Nasrallah's assassination, Khamenei exercised caution, implying that he anticipates Hezbollah will spearhead the retaliation, with Iran playing a supportive role. 'All resistance forces in Iran stand alongside Hezbollah,' Khamenei declared. 'It will be Hezbollah, leading the resistance forces, that will shape the region's future.' Analysts consulting with the New York Times suggested that Khamenei's remarks indicate that Iran currently lacks an effective strategy to counter Israel's assaults on its proxies. 'Faced with the choice between full-scale war with Israel and 'lowering its profile' for self-preservation, it seems to opt for the latter,' they wrote. Despite Khamenei's cautious approach, the Times notes that Iranian state television—controlled by Jalili's hardline allies – called for the Ayatollah regime to launch a direct attack on Israel. 'There is no distinction between Tehran, Baghdad and Beirut,' an Iranian TV host claimed, arguing that Israel aims to harm them all. 'Netanyahu understands only one language: that of ballistic missiles and drones.' The report emphasizes that, before deciding on retribution against Israel, Iran's primary focus is to rehabilitate Hezbollah after the severe setbacks it has encountered in recent weeks. Two sources from the Revolutionary Guards, including one involved in recent regime discussions on Iran's response, stated that Iran's immediate priority is to enable Hezbollah to 'regain its footing,' appoint a successor to Nasrallah, establish a renewed command structure, and rebuild a secure communication network (following the beeper and walkie-talkie bombings attributed to Mossad). Subsequently, they indicated, Hezbollah could plan its response to Israel. Revolutionary Guards sources added that Iran plans to dispatch a senior Quds Force officer to Beirut, via Syria, to aid in Hezbollah's recovery efforts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjvubdlcc	2024-09-29T00:48:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/09/By6dSUhn0/By6dSUhn0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Austrian voters appear ready to elect far-right 'Freedom Party'	Should the latest polls prove accurate, it's likely that Herbert Kickl, chairman of the 'Freedom Party of Austria' will become the nation's newest chancellor after Sunday's elections; The party is highly resistant to immigration from the Middle East, and also has adopted some antisemitic views As Austria edges toward its general elections on Sunday, the political landscape is poised for a seismic shift. Polls forecast a significant triumph for the far-right Freiheitliche Partei Österreich, or 'Freedom Party of Austria,' an entity with historical ties to the Nazi movement. This could herald the ascent of its leader, Herbert Kickl, to the chancellorship, marking the first time since World War II that such a position is held by a member from this faction. The election outcomes are anticipated to mirror the prevailing European trend toward policies that resist immigration, oppose the European Union, and waver in their support for Ukraine, while adopting a conciliatory stance toward the Kremlin. The Freedom Party's manifesto is rooted in a stringent anti-immigration stance. It seeks to emulate Austria's neighbor, Hungary, which has successfully curtailed the influx of Muslim immigrants, fortified its defenses against radical Islam, and drawn inspiration from Austrian cities where party representatives have prioritized security. These cities have bolstered police forces, installed street surveillance and linked immigrant integration with access to municipal social benefits. In contrast to its neighbor Germany, Austria's far-right party has historically participated in coalition governments, notably under Jörg Haider in 2000. It was also part of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's coalition and remains a coalition partner in three major Austrian states. However, this election might witness an unprecedented milestone with a party member vying for the chancellery and the formation of a government. Currently, the Freedom Party leads the polls with 27%, holding a two-point lead over the People's Party. Despite its modest population of nine million, Austria holds significant clout within the European Union, primarily due to its strategic geographic positioning for trade: the Tyrol region serves as the north-south conduit, while the country's eastern frontier is the nexus between Western Europe and the Balkan states. Should the party ascend to power and pursue initiatives akin to Brexit, distancing or even severing Austria from the EU, it could deal a severe blow to trade relations. However, Austria's geographical importance transcends commerce, extending into security dynamics. The Freedom Party’s rise, perceived as staunchly pro-Russian, could forge a coalition of EU nations sympathetic to Moscow – Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia – thus facilitating the Kremlin's efforts to undermine Western European morale. Geography also plays a pivotal role in immigration and asylum policies: Austria has absorbed more immigrants relative to its population than any other EU country. This is a significant factor behind the Freedom Party's impressive polling performance. These dynamics have led Austrians, who for decades saw themselves as the Nazis' first victims, to rally behind a party founded in the 1950s by former Nazis. Twenty years ago, Jörg Haider elevated the party from obscurity to prominence, and now Kickl, his protégé, is steering the party toward national leadership post its 2019 expulsion due to major scandals. Kickl has advanced a platform that can be viewed as 'Haider-plus': under his leadership, the party openly advocates for a policy of re-migration for those deemed foreigners by authorities. Those anticipating that Kickl might temper his extreme views in a pragmatic turn, reminiscent of Giorgia Meloni in Italy, should recall his tenure as Interior Minister. He orchestrated raids on state security services over suspicions of infiltration by informants and rebranded reception centers as 'departure centers.' The sole hope for Kickl’s opponents lies in the People's Party, the conservative Christian-Democratic faction, opting to isolate the Freedom Party. However, given their historical alliances – having twice entered coalitions – and policy alignments that are closer to the Freedom Party than the current Green Party partners, the likelihood is favorable that Herbert Kickl will emerge as a leading candidate for Austria's chancellorship following Sunday's elections. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk7eldirc	2024-09-28T23:39:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/By0IXmX0C/By0IXmX0C_0_207_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Nasrallah elimnated: Days of mourning and demonstrations; Syrian ...	A TV presenter choked on tears, Lebanese citizens mount protest marches and wonder 'Who will lead the battle now?', and in Iraq and Yemen they announced three days of mourning; In Iran, protesters took to the streets in support of Hezbollah and the residents of the Gaza Strip The Shiite axis lost one of its most prominent leaders, and the announcement of the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah stunned many. A news anchor on the Lebanese Al-Mayadeen network, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported Saturday afternoon in a voice choked with tears that the leader of the terrorist organization had been assassinated in Beirut. According to a report on the Qatari Al-Araby TV channel, Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon felt deep sadness and shock when they learned of Nasrallah's assassination. Mohammed Shabaro, an Al-Araby network journalist, reported that hundreds of Lebanese citizens spontaneously went out Saturday day for protest marches in the streets of Beirut after hearing the news. He reported that he also witnessed several of those in the street crying and suffering emotional breakdowns and claimed that these reactions were not limited to Hezbollah supporters, but also included other sectors of the Lebanese public. 'We are talking about a large-scale security and political event that will change many things in Lebanon,' the reporter said. The Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat also described the feeling of confusion on the Lebanese street after the assassination of Nasrallah. According to the report, people who left their homes were waiting for an explanation about what was going to happen next. One of the residents was quoted as saying: 'A big loss... we will wait for a response.' A young man in his 20s asked: 'Who will lead the battle now? How will we face our fate without him?' While the supporters of the terrorist organization were still in shock, in the city of Tripoli in Lebanon they actually celebrated the death of Nasrallah. Videos of Lebanese and Syrians sharing sweets and shooting in the air as a sign of joy were circulated on the networks. Also from Idlib in Syria, which is under the control of the Syrian opposition, similar scenes of celebrations spread since Nasrallah has many enemies in Syria. Many Syrians remember the atrocities committed by his men when they were sent to assist Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. In recent weeks, many Syrians, mainly Sunnis, celebrated the vulnerability of Hezbollah, from the attacks of explosive pagers and walkie-talkies to the assassination of the organization's leader. They handed out sweets in the streets and posted videos explaining why they hate the terrorist organization so much. The Syrian regime, however, holds a different position. The Syrian Foreign Ministry issued an official condemnation of the assassination on Saturday. 'Lebanon today lost the Secretary General of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, in a cruel and cowardly Israeli attack, which targeted a residential area in the Dahieh area of ​​Beirut, with devastating bombs that caused his death along with a large number of innocent civilians,' it said in a statement. The statement added that Syria 'lays the full responsibility on Israel of the serious consequences of the criminal act.' In the hours after the assassination was officially confirmed, first by the IDF spokesman and later by the terrorist organization Hezbollah, condemnations began to appear from the countries of the Shiite axis. Iraq was among the first countries to announce three official days of mourning. Iraq's Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani said in a statement that the assassination of Nasrallah is 'a crime that confirms that Israel has crossed all the red lines.' In Iran, after the official authorities in the country categorically denied that Nasrallah was killed, with the the official confirmations the condemnations and chants against Israel began to emerge. The spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Nasser Kanaani, said that 'Nasrallah's path will continue and achieve the goal - the liberation of Jerusalem.' Iran's official Tasnim agency posted videos of demonstrations by Iranians against the assassination of Nasrallah. The agency added next to one of the videos that the protesters expressed their willingness to support and help Hezbollah and the residents of the Gaza Strip. The videos also show signs promising violence against Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced Saturday night that Iran is determined to protect its security and confront Israel over its actions. The Houthis in Yemen also announced three days of mourning on Saturday. Pictures of Nasrallah and memorial videos were distributed on the group's social media channels. Abd al-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis in Yemen, spoke Saturday night, and condemned the attack saying: 'No matter how great the casualties, it increases our motivation toward escalation. His (Nasrallah's) martyrdom is a loss for the entire Islamic nation. We confirm that the fronts of support, the axis of jihad and the flag of Islam will remain and rise higher.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkdlpd8rc	2024-09-28T23:26:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/H1yo6y800/H1yo6y800_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

China says US missile deployment in Philippines undermines peace	Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the U.S. deployment of intermediate-range missiles in the Philippines 'undermines regional peace and stability,' the foreign ministry said on Sunday. Speaking to South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in New York on Saturday, Wang also called for avoiding 'war or chaos on the Korean Peninsula', the ministry said in a post on its website. The U.S. deployed the Typhon system, which can be equipped with cruise missiles capable of striking Chinese targets, this year. China has demanded its removal, and Russia has joined in condemning the first deployment of the system to the Indo-Pacific, accusing Washington of fueling an arms race. Wang said the deployment 'is not in the interests of regional countries.' Wang said exchanges and cooperation between China and South Korea have become more active this year.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qwewira	2024-09-28T22:07:44-07:00	
Small scale' movements into Lebanon may have started, US officia...	Netanyahu promised to continue attacking into Lebanon and Gallant met with IDF chief of staff to discuss 'expansion of military action' in north; ABC News reports Sunday morning that small-scale cross-border operations may have begun, or will soon begin, in order to destroy Hezbollah positions; 'Not enough to behead organization to return residents of north to their homes Small-scale operations or cross-border movements have begun, or will soon begin, into Lebanon in order to disable Hezbollah positions located right on the border with Israel, ABC News reported on Sunday morning, citing two American sources. The report comes hours after other reports in U.S. media, including by CNN, which reported that Israel is preparing for a ground maneuver in Lebanon. The sources who spoke with ABC emphasized that Israel does not appear to have finally decided whether to launch a ground operation against Hezbollah, but, according to them, it is ready for it. The officials also emphasized, as recently clarified by IDF officials, that if a ground operation happens its scope will be limited. The key is fulfilling the promise to Israelis that the tens of thousands displaced from northern Israel will be able to go home. To do that, decapitating Hezbollah is not enough, the officials said, referring to the assassination of the leader of the Shiite terrorist organization Hassan Nasrallah on Friday night. The reports come as Israeli officials signal that the elimination of Hezbollah will indeed not be enough to complete the goal of returning the residents of the north to their homes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clarified in a televised statement on Saturday night that Israel will 'continue to strike at its enemies,' and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced that he was holding an operational situation assessment, 'with an emphasis on the readiness of the IDF forces to expand offensive activity in the northern sector,' with IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, who himself said after the elimination of Nasrallah that the IDF had not completed using its 'toolbox.' The US officials who spoke with ABC also referred to reports of tensions between Israel and the Biden administration following the assassination of Nasrallah, which Washington publicly insists it was not informed about in advance, although according to officials it did receive an advance update of 'few minutes notice at best.' In response to reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin 'blew up' when Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed him about Nasrallah, the officials said, 'We do bear a lot of risks' in the region, and their people were not given a lot of notice to prepare for possible hostile responses to the assassination, which did not please U.S. officials. In addition, according to one source, U.S. 'interests in the region could be badly harmed' if U.S. officials lose their contacts with the Israelis. According to the sources, the U.S. approach has not changed; it believes that only a diplomatic settlement is a long-term solution to the crisis. They also noted that a military campaign might lay the groundwork for such a solution. President Joe Biden himself was asked Saturday night by reporters whether Israel's ground entry into Lebanon is inevitable, and he answered evasively: ''It's time for a cease-fire.' When asked whether Washington would respond to missile attacks on American warships in the Red Sea, he said: 'We are responding.' Meanwhile, the extensive bombings against Hezbollah targets continue, as part of the Northern Arrows operation. Israeli Air Force fighter jets, under the direction of the Northern Command, attacked terrorist targets in the territory of Lebanon overnight, the IDF spokesman announced on Sunday morning. The targets attacked included rocket launchers aimed at Israel, buildings where weapons were stored and military structures belonging to the terrorist organization. The IDF spokesman also noted that over the past day, the army attacked hundreds of Hezbollah terrorist targets throughout Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h100lru8a0	2024-09-28T21:56:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJd11iZ40R/SJd11iZ40R_11_0_1270_715_0_small.jpg

Rocket from Lebanon explodes on outskirts of Jerusalem	The rocket knocked out power to the area and sparked several fires; Meanwhile, in the western Galilee there were explosions in Nahariya as two armed drones were intercepted: Watch the footage A rocket launched from Lebanon into the Binyamin area east of Jerusalem exploded Saturday night in an open area near the settlement of Mitzpe Hagit sparking fires in the area. In footage of the impact, the rocket knocks out electricity in the settlements. Watch the video: At 10:05 p.m., alarms were activated in a series of settlements in Binyamin, including: Nofei Prat, Mishor Adumim industrial area, Kfar Adumim, Almon, Alon, Geva Binyamin, Ma'ale Michmash, Shaar Binyamin industrial area, Mitzpe Yericho and Ma'ale Adumim. The IDF spokesman reported that the rocket alert sirens were activated following a single launch from Lebanon. Following the impact, fires broke out in the Michmash area of ​​Binyamin, and firefighting teams from the Binyamin regional station were dispatched to the area. Fire and rescue spokespersons reported that the fire threatens the settlement, and that after scanning the area it is clear that the rocket did not land on a building, contrary to reports circulating through various channels. Teams from Magen David Adom arrived at the scene after receiving several calls for help. In addition, the Binyamin Regional Council reported that due to the fire there are power outages in several localities. A short time later, the electric company updated that it had restored the electricity supply to the localities of Ma'aleh Michmash and Mitzpe Hagit. About an hour later, alarms were set off warning of the intrusion of hostile aircraft in several communities in the Western Galilee, including Nahariya, Gesher HaZiv, Betzet, Rosh Hanikara, Liman, Matzuva, Hof Betzet, North Military Industrial Zone, Ben Ami, Shlomi, Sa'ar, Evron and Shavei Zion.

Israel preparing limited ground incursion into Lebanon, senior US...	Israel has rejected a cease-fire proposal - even a limited one - in Lebanon, even though it has already eliminated many of Hezbollah's top officials, official tells ABC News Israel is preparing for a limited ground incursion in Lebanon, a senior US official claimed in a report published on ABC News. The source claimed that Israel is preparing for the ground operation even though it has already killed more than 30 senior Hezbollah officials, most significantly the organization's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. According to the unnamed source, Israel has rejected a proposal for a cease-fire, even a limited one, and is continuing its attacks against targets which are believed to contain long-range missiles and weapons. At the same time Israel is not listening to the Biden administration despite its repeated calls for a diplomatic solution, according to the report. The U.S. and Western countries still hope, despite the assassination of Nasrallah, to find a way toward a cease-fire in the north. At this stage it is not clear what will happen to the U.S. initiative and whether it even still exists. The chances of a cease-fire at this stage are not high, but if there is someone able to make decisions in Lebanon who will agree to the terms of withdrawal to the north of the Litani River and a disengagement from Gaza then it is possible. As for who this responsible party is, the answer is not clear. The preferred option from Israel's point of view is for the Lebanese government to fill the vacuum, but the problem is that within the government there are quite a few ministers who are under Hezbollah's authority. It must be assumed that whoever succeeds Nasrallah will not make such a move without the blessing of the patrons from Tehran, so everything ultimately goes back to Iran. Regarding the joint cease-fire initiative of the U.S. and France, sources in Israel familiar with the matter say that from the beginning of the discussions the contacts were with the Lebanese government and not with Hezbollah and the initiative did not have much chance of materializing even before the elimination of Nasrallah. It is difficult to know what the chances of such a cease-fire initiative are now. It is unclear who the Lebanese government can talk to on the ground itself. It may take some time before Hezbollah appoints a successor to Nasrallah, so it is not clear how feasible this move is. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wzokicc	2024-09-28T14:06:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/BkzTBir00/BkzTBir00_0_83_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Nasrallah elimination will return residents to north and bring ho...	Settled accounts with those responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans,' Netanyahu says in address to the nation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday night that the elimination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was necessary to achieve Israel's war goals. In a statement from the Kirya defense headquarters in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, a few hours after returning from the United States and a little more than a day after the assassination of Nasrallah, Netanyahu said that: 'We settled accounts with those responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans and dozens of Frenchmen. 'Nasrallah was not a terrorist. He was the terrorist. He was the axis of the axis, the central engine of Iran's axis of evil. He and his men were the architects of the plan to destroy Israel. He was not only activated by Iran, many times he also activated the Iran.' Netanyahu said that 'at the beginning of the week I came to the conclusion that the powerful blows that the IDF landed on Hezbollah in the last few days would not be enough. Nasrallah's killing was a necessary step toward achieving the goals we have set, returning residents of the north safely to their homes and changing the balance of power in the region for years to come. Because as long as Nasrallah was alive, he would quickly restore the capabilities we took away from Hezbollah.' Netanyahu said that Nasrallah's elimination both promotes the return of the residents of northern Israel to their homes, 'but also advance the return of our hostages in the south.' 'The more (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar sees that Hezbollah is no longer coming to save him, the greater the chances for the return of our hostages,' he said. There is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach Netanyahu thanked the IDF, the Israeli Air Force, Military Intelligence, the Mossad and the Shin Bet for their 'great achievements, and not only yesterday.' 'We have great achievements, but the work is not yet complete. In the coming days we will face significant challenges, and we will face them together. Nasrallah spoke of us as 'spider webs'. But instead of 'spider webs,' he discovered steel tendons of a united people And we are determined to ensure its existence and its future, and not only Hezbollah has discovered this,' Netanyahu continued. 'All those who oppose the axis of evil, all those who groan under the violent tyranny of Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, in Syria, in Iran itself and in other places, all of them were filled with hope today,' Netanyahu stressed. 'I say to the citizens of those countries: Israel stands with you.' He addressed the leaders of Iran: 'I say to the Ayatollah regime - whoever strikes us, we will strike. There is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach, and today you already know how true this is. These are great days. We are at what appears to be a turning point in history. A year ago, on October 7, our enemies attacked us and thought that Israel was on the way to extinction. One year later, blow after blow, they realize how much their hopes have faded. We are determined to continue to strike our enemies, to return our residents to their homes and all our hostages. We don't forget them for a moment.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rksuz0bra	2024-09-28T12:39:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/02/B1e9ybs72A/B1e9ybs72A_145_98_1058_596_0_small.jpg

Sinwar runs scared after Nasrallah assassination, changes locatio...	Hamas has also changed leader Yahya Sinwar's security protocols in recent days, and has decided not to meet in Lebanon in the near future Yahya Sinwar and senior Hamas officials are running scared after the wave of assassinations in Lebanon. Al Arabiya reports Saturday that, after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Sinwar changed his location in Gaza. It was also reported that in recent days Hamas has changed security protocols for the organization's leader in the Gaza Strip. Sources told the channel, which is owned by Saudi Arabia and broadcasts from Dubai, that Hamas leaders want any future cease-fire to ensure that they will not be harmed. As an additional precaution, Hamas decided to stop the organization's meetings in Lebanon in the near future. In addition, Hamas is limiting communication within the organization to correspondence only to prevent the possibility of intercepting conversations or locating locations. Senior Islamic Jihad officials also decided to suspend meetings in Lebanon in the wake of the strike on Nasrallah and other Hezbollah leaders, according to the report. Earlier on Saturday, Hamas issued a statement following the assassination of Nasrallah. 'We mourn for His Honor Hassan Nasrallah and remember his life and the journey full of sacrifices for the liberation of Jerusalem and the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, and his honorable roles in supporting the Palestinian people, our brave resistance and our legitimate rights , and his insistence on continuing on the heroic front of supporting our people and our resistance in the Al-Aqsa flood. 'We are sure that this crime and all the crimes and assassinations of the occupation will not affect the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine except with determination, and continue with all the strength, courage and pride, in the way of martyrs, follow their path and in their footsteps, and continue the path of resistance and steadfastness until victory and defeating the occupation.' Nasrallah's maternal cousin, Hashem Safi al-Din, is believed to have survived the attack or was not in the bunker with Nasrallah when it happened. He was designated as Nasrallah's successor and reportedly has taken over, although perhaps secretly for the time being, until the official meetings of the Shura Council are held to appoint a successor. The appointment of Safi al-Din is a step with a double declarative meaning – both to show continuity and continuity in command and leadership, and also to entrust it to someone who is known for his extreme positions toward Israel and the struggle against it. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by4fo6bcr	2024-09-28T11:42:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/BJDQD1qp0/BJDQD1qp0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Lebanon locked down to prevent Hezbollah , IDF says	Military says it aims to prevent arms being brought in to replenish Hezbollah's depleted arsenal after Israel attacked missile storage facilities The IDF has placed Lebanon under lockdown to prevent Hezbollah from rearming itself with Iranian weapons after its arsenal was depleted in Israeli strikes. Since the targeted killing of Hassan Nasrallah in the terror group's underground command bunker in the Dahieh quarter of Beirut on Friday, the Air Force has repeatedly attacked Lebanese heavy machinery sent to rebuild six military border crossings to Syria, damaged in previous strikes. The military also informed Lebanon officially, that it would not allow cargo planes arriving from Syria and Iran, to land at Beirut's international airport. Earlier on Saturday, an Iranian cargo plane was refused landing permission and had to return to Iran. The IDF breached communications at the control tower and warned against allowing the plane to land under threat of attack. According to reports, Israeli jets attacked an industrial area 500 meters from the airport. Reuters quoted a security source who said it was the closest strike yet to the airport. Middle East Airlines CEO Mohammad al-Hout said the airport was operating normally. 'The Beirut airport is not being targeted, there are no weapons there,' al-Hout told Reuters. Civilian travel and border crossings would not be impacted, the IDF said. Thousands of Lebanese civilians crossed into Syria in recent days, many of them hoping to escape the Israeli attacks. But if an Iranian ship attempts to doc in a Lebanese port, it may encounter Israeli action off the Lebanon coast. Some 600,000 Lebanese residents of the South have left their homes heading north and 400,000 residents of the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the southern sector of Beirut have also escaped the bombings. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bke0011tbca	2024-09-28T11:19:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/HyA7uhBAR/HyA7uhBAR_1_0_1094_615_0_small.jpg

The IDF said on Saturday evening that it carried out a targeted attack on Hassan Khalil Yassin, a senior member of Hezbollah's intelligence array. 'Yassin stood at the head of a department responsible for the identification of civilian and military targets, on the northern border and deep within Israeli territory,' the military said in a statement. 'As part of his role, Yassin collaborated with all of Hezbollah's offensive units, was personally involved in the planning of terror attacks that were executed during the war against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and planned additional attacks to be carried out in the coming days.' The Air Force also carried out strikes in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley after targeting Hezbollah assets in South Lebanon, Beirut and the Lebanon Mountains to the north. In total, some 3,500 bombs were dropped on Lebanon in the past week. The IDF said it had more surprises for Hezbollah in store and aims to diminish the terror group's military capabilities. 'We are now focused on strangling Hezbollah and are fully prepared to face Iran and its proxies including in Syria,' the IDF said. Earlier, the Homefront Command announced restrictions on crowd sizes in central Israel, limiting them to no more than 1,000 people in any given location. A missile fired from Yemen targeted central Israel including the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, the central plains and the Ben-Gurion airport.

Biden: Killing of Nasrallah 'a measure of justice' for his many v...	The United States fully supports Israel's right to defend itself against Iran-supported groups, president says, but aims to deescalate conflicts in Lebanon, Gaza through diplomatic means US President Joe Biden on Saturday referred for the first time to the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, since it was confirmed earlier in the day by the IDF and by the terrorist organization itself. In a statement, Biden said that the killing of Nasrallah 'and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror. His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese civilians.' Biden noted that 'the strike that killed Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre on October 7, 2023. Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a 'northern front' against Israel.' The U.S. president emphasized that 'The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups. Just yesterday, I directed my Secretary of Defense to further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war.' He called for a diplomatic solution to Israel's conflicts on both the northern and southern borders. 'Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means. In Gaza, we have been pursuing a deal backed by the UN Security Council for a cease-fire and the release of hostages. In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,' he concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkdobnbar	2024-09-28T10:21:25-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/06/B1gwA7LyHC/B1gwA7LyHC_0_148_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

IDF shoots down Yemen missile after sirens sound across central I...	Army confirms 'sirens activated due to surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen, which was intercepted outside country’s borders' The IDF reported that a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the Arrow defense system outside Israeli territory on Saturday, triggering air raid sirens across central Israel. The army confirmed that 'the sirens were activated due to a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen, which was intercepted outside the country’s borders.' The Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance services said there were no immediate reports of casualties, aside from individuals who suffered shock or were injured while rushing to shelters. Hazem Al-Asad, a member of the Supreme Political Council of Yemen's Ansar Allah (the Houthis), posted a photo of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah on X shortly after the missile launch with a Hebrew caption, reading 'They will not pass, and revenge will come.' Nasrallah was assassinated by Israel in a targeted attack on Hezbollah's central command bunker in Beirut's Daheih district. This incident follows another missile launch from Yemen on Thursday night, which also set off sirens in central Israel. Earlier this month, a Houthi missile targeting central Israel was 'partially intercepted,' with fragments of its warhead exploding near Ben Gurion Airport. Israel did not respond to that attack, leading to concerns about eroding deterrence. This contrasted with Israel’s previous response when the Air Force struck the port of Hodeidah in Yemen after a deadly drone attack on Tel Aviv in July that killed one person and injured ten others. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who returned from the UN General Assembly in New York, is expected to hold security consultations and assessments later Saturday, his office announced. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy36p9rrr	2024-09-28T08:40:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/SkiJh9r0R/SkiJh9r0R_33_601_532_300_0_small.jpg
IDF changes guidelines following Nasrallah assassination	In first statement since Nasrallah's death, the IDF spokesperson informs that gatherings will be limited to 1,000 people in central Israel but school will be held as usual: 'It's not over yet' A day after he made the dramatic announcement about the IDF's strike on Hezbollah's central headquarters and hours after the confirmation of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah's assassination, IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari informed that the Home Front Command will change its guidelines.

We will make sure that does not happen. We killed him and will continue to bolster our strength.' The IDF continues to strike Hezbollah terrorist targets in Lebanon. Among the targets that were struck are Hezbollah launchers that were aimed toward Israeli territory, structures in which weapons were stored and additional Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure. The IDF is continuing to operate to degrade and dismantle Hezbollah’s terrorist infrastructure and capabilities. According to reports, the Air Force conducted an airstrike against Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah and additional senior operatives in the Dahieh district in Beirut on Friday. Nasrallah served as the terror organization's leader for the past 32 years. 'He was responsible for directing and executing terrorist attacks around the world in which civilians of various nationalities were murdered. Nasrallah was the central decision-maker and the strategic leader of the organization,' the military said. 'The IDF will continue operating against anyone who promotes and engages in terrorism against the State of Israel and its people.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ju6thrr	2024-09-28T07:57:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/B1fSx9BAR/B1fSx9BAR_0_0_1129_636_0_small.jpg

IDF strikes Hezbollah missiles threatening navy, Haifa port	Overnight attacks on the Dahieh quarter of Beirut target underground facilities housing Iran-made missiles belonging to covert unit and able to disrupt maritime traffic along Israel's coast The IDF on Saturday struck targets in Beirut's Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold, targeting a missile storage facility, housing guided missiles belonging to the terror group's covert shore-to-sea unit, a specialized, highly trained force made up of dozens of operatives involved in smuggling and operating the missile array.

Nasrallah's likely successor has close ties to Iran	Hashim Safi Al Din is slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's cousin who oversees the group's education system and finances including its investment arm financing terrorism; He is on U.S. terror list since 2017 Hashim Safi Al Din, head of Hezbollah's Executive Council could replace the group's slain long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. He was reported to have survived the Israeli attack on the terror group's underground bunker on Friday. Al Din is Nasrallah's cousin and has been designated, next in line since the 1990s when he was called back to Beirut from his studies in Iran, to head Hezbollah's Executive Council just two years after Nasrallah took over leadership of the Group. According to a report in the Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper he is also related by marriage to Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Quds force, killed by the U.S. in 2020. Over the past three decades, he oversaw all daily and sensitive aspects of Hezbollah's civilian operations including its education system and finances including foreign investments, leaving strategic matters to Nasrallah. He heads an investment group operating in Lebanon, across the Arab world, in Africa, Europe and North and Latin America. Al Din has close ties to the military wing of Hezbollah as well and has been on the U.S. terror list since 2017. He maintains good relations with Tehran and supports its regime after his religious studies there. His brother Abdullah is Hezbollah's envoy to Tehran, which the Saudi newspaper says could increase his chances of being named the next leader of the group. He was born in 1964 in a village near the coastal city of Tyre in South Lebanon, to a well-established family of clerics. Since the outbreak of the war, Al Din represented Nasrallah in public events including at the funeral of high-ranking members of terror-group, who were killed in the coordinated detonation of communication devices, attributed to Israel. 'The wounded will return to their Jihad,' he said. 'We tell the enemy that if its aim is to stop support of Gaza, it must know that that will only grow.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1y0kirrr	2024-09-28T02:56:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2017/05/20/7792688/7792688_0_1_750_422_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah fires at West Bank, rockets hitting Palestinian village...	Rocket sirens sound in northern West Bank for second time since war, just five days after previous attack; large interception fragments cause damage in Palestinian town of Huwara, south of Nablus Rocket sirens blared across several settlements in the northern West Bank on Saturday, including Ofra, Kokhav Ya'akov, Tel Tzion, Ma'ale Mikhmas, Talmon, Psagot and Beit El, following the official announcement of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's assassination by the IDF. This marks the second time since October 7 that Hezbollah has targeted the northern West Bank, with rocket fire causing damage in Palestinian villages as well. In the village of Huwara, south of Nablus, large fragments from an interception landed on a house, though no injuries were reported. 'We are at risk every moment,' said local residents. 'Hezbollah is firing indiscriminately. We are already facing economic and social distress, and now we have an aerial threat as well.' A Huwara resident added, 'There are no sirens or shelters here. The piece that fell today could have killed someone.' Sirens first sounded at 7:35 a.m. in Ofarim, Halamish, Beit Aryeh, Beit El, Peduel, Neria, Nachliel, Atarot, Kerem Re'im, Harsha, Ofra, Talmon and Ali Zahav. Thirty minutes later, additional sirens were activated in Hinanit, Shaqed, Tal Menashe and Reihan. On Monday, 10 rockets were fired at the northern West Bank from Lebanon.

Nasrallah dead, IDF says	Military says it can confirm that the Hezbollah leader was eliminated in the attack on the terror group's central command bunker in Beirut The IDF said on Saturday that it can confirm the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in the strike on Beirut on Friday. 'Following precise intelligence from the IDF and Israeli security establishment, IAF fighter jets conducted a targeted strike on the Central Headquarters of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, which was located underground embedded under a residential building in the area of Dahieh in Beirut,' the military said in a statement. 'The strike was conducted while Hezbollah’s senior chain of command was operating from the headquarters and advancing terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel.' The announcement went on to say Nasrallah was responsible for the murder of many Israeli civilians and soldiers, and the planning and execution of thousands of terrorist activities. 'He was responsible for directing and executing terrorist attacks around the world in which civilians of various nationalities were murdered. Nasrallah was the central decision-maker and the strategic leader of the organization,' the military said. 'The IDF will continue operating against anyone who promotes and engages in terrorism against the State of Israel and its people.' Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said more options remained in Israel's toolbox in the fight against Hezbollah. The message is clear, whoever threatens Israeli citizens, we will reach, in the north, south and and beyond,' he said in a statement soon after the military confirmed Nasrallah's death. 'This strike was prepared overtime and executed well and in a timely fashion. We are now moving on to the next stage. We are in peak readiness on all fronts,' he said. The Air Force had prepared synchronized operations, working around the clock to eliminate senior members of Hezbollah, whenever the opportunity presented itself. Bunker-busting bombs were selected to target Nasrallah's bunker. The images from the scene showed pillars of fire as the result of the attack while surrounding buildings were mostly unharmed, to minimize collateral damage. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyxkfesar	2024-09-28T01:12:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/13/ByS5D6O9A/ByS5D6O9A_0_133_2762_1554_0_small.jpg

PM leaves NY early to return home; IDF continues strikes on Hezbollah's stronghold in Lebanon's capital while rescue efforts continue in terror group's command center The IDF continued its strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon including in the capital Beirut, from the air and sea, after targeting the terror group's leader Hassan Nasrallah in a massive strike on the group's underground headquarters on Friday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut his U.S. visit short and departed for Israel a day early in the wake of the attack. Nasrallah's fate remains unknown as rescue efforts continued to reach those trapped under the rubble after some six apartment blocks above the bunker were leveled in the attack. Rocket fire targeted the West Bank early on Saturday after strikes on the Galilee region overnight. Pro-Iranian Iraqi militias claimed responsibility for four attacks on Israel, claiming to target strategic sites in the north including the Golan Heights and the south using attack drones. Israel said it did not know about such attacks. A senior Israeli official told the New York Times that the strike on the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the southern sector of Beirut, was to eliminate the group's senior leaders and commanders, to avoid a ground incursion into Lebanon. The officials also said it may take weeks before the results of the strike are known including the fate of Hassan Nasrallah who was thought to have been in the bunker when the IDF attacked. A U.S. official said on Friday that if he was there, he could not have survived. The military said Hezbollah's missile unit commander in South Lebanon, Muhammad Ali Ismail and his deputy terrorist Hussein Ahmad Ismail were killed in a targeted strike. on Friday that it was attacking Hezbollah's strategic assets including their weapons storage facilities. IDF spokesperson in Arabic, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee urged civilians to immediately leave areas where Hezbollah command centers and weapons were located including the Munir Shadid building and adjacent structures in the Laylaki neighborhood, the Shiyit building and nearby structures in the Al Hadath neighborhood and the Al Salam complex in the area. In a televised statement, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that the IDF exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapons cashes in South Lebanon in recent days and their strikes aim to reveal how Hezbollah stores strategic weapons and arms in Beirut’s Dahieh, using buildings as shields. 'We will not allow any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah in any way,' Hagari said. 'We know about these transfers and are thwarting them. IAF aircraft are patrolling the Beirut area, and we are making it clear that hostile flights with weapons will not be allowed to land at Beirut airport.

IDF strikes Hezbollah strategic assets in Beirut, issues evacuati...	Army plans to escalate strikes as large secondary explosions reported in Lebanese capital; Israel warns Iran it will block any weapon transfers, including hostile flights to Beirut The IDF struck Hezbollah weapon depots stored beneath civilian buildings in Beirut’s Laylaki neighborhood, the IDF said in a statement early Saturday. The attack followed a televised announcement by IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, who said that Israel would soon target strategic capabilities, including an Iran-funded anti-ship missile array hidden in the heart of Beirut’s Dahieh district. Hagari noted that during the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired such missiles, one of which hit the Israeli naval vessel INS Hanit, killing four sailors. 'Nasrallah himself has threatened strategic and critical facilities in Israel at sea and near the shore,' Hagari said, adding that these missiles pose a serious threat to global shipping routes and Israel’s strategic infrastructure. He warned that the explosion from the strikes could cause the targeted buildings to collapse. After the IDF struck the suspected sites, large secondary explosions were reported across Beirut, indicating the destruction of weaponry. Earlier, a source close to Hezbollah told Reuters that contact with the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, had been lost. The IDF believes Nasrallah was at least injured and likely killed in the strike on Hezbollah’s central command in Dahieh. The operation, launched at 6:20 p.m., was described by the IDF as 'highly significant, with potential implications for the Middle East.' However, the military is still assessing the results and has not confirmed if other senior Hezbollah commanders were present. The IDF plans to continue targeting Hezbollah’s capabilities following the strike in Laylaki neighborhood, aimed at crippling the group's resources. 'Challenging days lie ahead,' Hagari said, adding that the military will intensify its attacks in a coordinated effort. In addition to Iranian-supplied coastal defense missiles, the IDF plans to strike other strategic assets in Beirut that Hezbollah could use for retaliation. In recent days, the IDF has exposed Hezbollah’s hidden weapon caches in southern Lebanon, and the current strikes aim to reveal how Hezbollah stores strategic weapons and arms in Beirut’s Dahieh, using buildings as shields. 'We will not allow any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah in any way,' Hagari emphasized. 'We know about these transfers and are thwarting them. IAF aircraft are patrolling the Beirut area, and we are making it clear that hostile flights with weapons will not be allowed to land at Beirut airport. It is a civilian airport and must remain as such.' Hagari also said that the IDF has conducted a readiness assessment under the chief of staff's direction, saying, 'The IDF is prepared on all fronts, and we are still evaluating the results of the attack on the command center located in the heart of the Dahieh district. The strike was very precise. We are conducting a situation assessment, and there are no changes in [Home Font Command] guidelines. We will update immediately if anything changes.' Earlier, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee urged the immediate evacuation of three buildings in central Dahieh: the Munir Shadid building and adjacent structures in the Laylaki neighborhood, the Shiyit building and nearby structures in the Al Hadath neighborhood and the Al Salam complex in the area. 'If you are near Hezbollah properties, for your safety, you must evacuate the buildings immediately and move 500 meters away,' Adraee said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1uxsovaa	2024-09-27T15:11:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/SkeAtwjVCC/SkeAtwjVCC_0_352_961_541_0_small.jpg

Looking east: The importance of Jordan to Israel’s security	Across Israel’s longest border, danger is mounting constantly; while King Abdullah’s reign is stable and a quiet border is in both sides’ interest — can the Hashemite regime deliver the goods? Jordan is a ticking bomb. Israelis love quiet, and we all find it comfortable not to probe too deeply into what’s happening in the kingdom that safeguards our eastern border — Israel’s longest border with any next-door neighbor. Beyond that kingdom, an ocean of threats, hostility and chaos extends. We find it comfortable to believe that the king, despite occasional unfriendly statements, will be sure to do whatever needs doing in order to maintain quiet. But the king’s throne, which in any case hasn’t always excelled in stability, is wobbling. And that wobble is growing stronger by the day. The instability threatens to undermine security not only in Jordan but throughout the Middle East. The troubles of the Hashemite kingdom are also the troubles of Israel, and the Israeli public only partly realizes what’s eating away at the foundations of the monarchy. The first reason for the Hashemite regime’s fragility derives from the kingdom’s large refugee population. In 1948, there were 400,000 people in Jordan and today there are 11.5 million, including many refugees. That growth has come mainly from enormous waves of immigration. Immigration from where? After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, many refugees arrived in Jordan from the east. Tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees are estimated to still reside in Jordan, but today their numbers are small in comparison with the Syrian and Palestinian refugees. A huge number of refugees fled into Jordan from the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. According to figures from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, some 670,000 Syrian refugees are registered in Jordan; but according to unofficial estimates, those refugees could even number a million or so. Besides accommodating 'new' refugees, Jordan has housed Palestinian refugees since 1948. How many? The Hashemite regime has an interest in concealing the actual number, so it isn’t clear. But out of 11.5 million Jordanian citizens in all, the Palestinian population is estimated to total at least 3.5 million. And along with all those refugees, Jordan also hosts refugees and immigrant workers from countries such as Yemen, Sudan and Egypt. Given shelter in times of trouble, asylum seekers might be expected to show gratitude. But not necessarily. The flood of foreigners in Jordan is under incitement from various ideological and political sources aiming to topple the Hashemite dynasty and take over the kingdom. Given shelter in times of trouble, asylum seekers might be expected to show gratitude. But not necessarily. The flood of foreigners in Jordan is under incitement from various ideological and political sources, each with its own motivation to topple the Hashemite dynasty and take over the kingdom. The Muslim Brotherhood’s ideology, for example, has won great sympathy among Jordan’s large Palestinian sector. It’s the same ideology that’s shared by Hamas and that inspired the assassination of President Sadat in Egypt. Moreover, Iran is of course also troubling the waters and creating great pressure by way of Iraq and Syria at the borders of the kingdom. So Jordan has changed from a country adjoining territories such as an American-dominated Iraq to a country adjoining Iranian proxy organizations — all this at a time when the King’s loyal Bedouin minority is waging tough domestic battles that ruinously weaken it. The volume of weapons smuggled from Iran into the West Bank area, and even into Israel proper, results directly from the Jordanian army’s inaction. Israel can already distinctly feel the effects of the Jordanian government’s weakness. The volume of weapons smuggled from Iran into the West Bank area, and even into Israel proper, is a direct consequence of the Jordanian army’s weakness. And the Iranian–Palestinian effort to mount terror attacks against Israel, such as the one at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, is no less a consequence. Sensing weakness, the Iranian octopus is focusing considerable effort on turning Jordan into one more proxy of the Ayatollahs, like Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. If Iran succeeds in its plan for Jordan, there’s no need to explain what a serious challenge Israel will face. The question now is how to confront that security challenge in its present form, because it threatens to turn into a serious headache before long. The first thing to do is to beef up the relatively scanty Israeli forces in the Jordan Valley and the Arava. In addition, a network of meaningful obstacles should be set up, centered around a barrier like the one at the Egyptian border. The sphere of economics is also critical to our eastern neighbor’s stability. So Israel should continue following through on programs that are now partially in effect, such as the economic corridor that crosses Jordan eastward to India, the Sea-to-Sea Project and increased industrial and agricultural cooperation. Remember that Jordan relies heavily on Israel for energy. And the supply of water to the East Bank rests on agreements between Amman and Jerusalem. Granted, anti-Israeli statements are heard more than rarely from east of the river. The relationship has known ups and downs and it isn’t all rosy today. But diplomatic and geopolitical strategy requires cool consideration in view of the alternatives, rather than emotionally colored thinking. It’s important to bear in mind that not everything depends only on us. Jordan is an independent country, with complicated internal dynamics that Israel can influence only so far. But Israel has helped the Hashemites more than once to stay on the throne. The best-remembered example was during Black September, when King Hussein was facing substantial danger and Israel threatened to step in against any Syrian invasion of Jordan. Granted, anti-Israeli statements are heard more than rarely from east of the river. The relationship has known ups and downs and it isn’t all rosy today. But diplomatic and geopolitical strategy requires cool consideration in view of the alternatives, rather than emotionally colored thinking. Brig. Gen. (Res.)

Nasrallah was present at command center,' Israeli officials say	Israel and the world await updates on Hezbollah leader's fate following Beirut strike; 'No one there could have survived,' Israeli official says; Nasrallah was reportedly on brief visit to Beirut 'Enough is enough,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, without hinting at the imminent military action. Behind the scenes, however, plans for the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Dahieh district had been approved before the Israeli leader departed for the UN. An operational window presented itself, and the final green light was given. According to a U.S. official who spoke with ABC, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and some of his associates were in Beirut for a brief visit when the strike occurred. The official did not confirm whether Nasrallah was at the targeted site, but this may have been the operational opportunity identified by Israeli intelligence. Israeli officials believe Nasrallah was present at the command center, with one saying, 'Anyone there could not have survived.' Netanyahu, who authorized the strike while in the U.S., abruptly left a press briefing following his speech at the UN General Assembly after being approached by his military secretary. The Prime Minister’s Office later announced that Netanyahu would cut his trip short and return to Israel, departing the U.S. at 3 a.m. Israel time. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement that Hezbollah’s central command was located beneath residential buildings in Dahieh. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Manar reported that at least six buildings were destroyed in the attack. Local reports indicated that around 10 explosions were heard in the Lebanese capital. Footage from the scene showed extensive damage, with the Lebanese news agency reporting that the attacks created a 'belt of fire' from Burj Barajneh to Haret Hreik. Security sources in Lebanon told Reuters the attack, the most extensive Israeli assault on the southern Beirut Hezbollah stronghold since the war began, targeted an area where top Hezbollah officials are usually based. Iran's embassy in Lebanon said on X that the strike represents a dangerous game-changing escalation that will 'bring its perpetrator an appropriate punishment.' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar were in the Air Force command center in Tel Aviv during the attack. Israel updated the United States about its upcoming operation, but a Pentagon spokesperson denied Washington knew of the strike in Beirut in advance. The spokesperson also said that U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart as the operation was ongoing. Netanyahu, addressing the United Nations earlier Friday, said Israel must defeat Hezbollah and prevent the group from posing a threat along its northern border. 'Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that has murdered American, French and other civilians. We will not allow them to sit on our border and plan another October 7,' Netanyahu said. 'Israel has no choice—and every right—to eliminate this threat, and that is exactly what we are doing.' 'We have eliminated commanders responsible for the murders of Israelis, Americans, and French citizens, and then we took out their replacements, and their replacements’ replacements,' Netanyahu added. 'We will continue our strikes until we achieve all our objectives.' Friday's attack came on the heels of a spree of assassinations of high-profile Hezbollah commanders and figures. On Thursday, the IDF killed Hezbollah’s air unit commander Mohammed Srur in Beirut, using three missiles near the site where Ibrahim Aqil, Hezbollah’s head of operations, and other senior Radwan Force commanders were killed last weekend. On Tuesday, the IDF targeted Ibrahim Qubaisi, Hezbollah’s head of missile operations, in a strike on Dahieh. According to the army, several key commanders in Hezbollah’s missile and rocket divisions were with Qubaisi at the time of the strike. Earlier this week, the IDF attempted to eliminate Ali Karaki, Hezbollah’s southern front commander and the organization’s third-highest-ranking official. However, Hezbollah announced that Karaki survived and had been moved to a secure location. In July, Fuad Shukr, described as Hezbollah’s 'most senior military commander and head of the group’s strategic operations,' was killed in Dahieh. According to the IDF, Shukr was a close aide and strategic adviser to Nasrallah. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkeh1ynra	2024-09-27T12:39:34-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJmyNdVAC/SJmyNdVAC_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

Israeli officials believe Hassan Nasrallah was killed in the strike, with one saying, 'Anyone present did not survive.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryovwfv0c	2024-09-27T12:28:47-07:00

Israel 'crossed all lines' with Dahieh attack, Hezbollah parliame...	Lebanon’s health minister says buildings hit in Israeli airstrike on Beirut housed civilians and condemned IDF flights near airport, calling them 'serious threat'; at least 2 killed and 76 injured Israel has 'crossed all lines' with its attack on Hezbollah's command center in Beirut’s Dahieh district Friday, a Hezbollah parliamentary source told Qatari newspaper The New Arab but vowed it would not destabilize the organization. The powerful strike, which reportedly targeted Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, killed at least two people and injured 76 others, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Search efforts for survivors continued in the area amid widespread anger in Lebanon. Lebanese Health Minister Firas Al-Abyad said that some of the targeted buildings were occupied by residents, and Lebanese media reported that the strike was carried out by F-35 fighter jets while civilian aircraft were landing and taking off at the nearby Rafic Hariri International Airport, posing a serious risk to passengers. Khalil Nasrallah, a commentator close to Hezbollah, suggested on social media that the 'rules of the game have changed.' The airstrike, aimed at Hezbollah’s central command, has raised questions in Israel about whether Nasrallah was present at the time and his fate. Iran’s Tasnim News Agency and Sky News Arabia reported that Hezbollah sources claim Nasrallah is alive and in a secure location. However, an Iranian official told Reuters that 'Tehran is assessing his condition.' A U.S. official told ABC News that Nasrallah and his deputies were in Beirut for a 'brief visit' during the attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who authorized the strike while in the U.S., abruptly left a press briefing following his speech at the UN General Assembly after being approached by his military secretary. The Prime Minister’s Office later announced that Netanyahu would cut his trip short and return to Israel, departing the U.S. at 3 a.m. Israel time. The Pentagon said that Israel did not notify the U.S. of the strike in advance, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during the operation. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the command center was located beneath residential buildings in the Hezbollah stronghold. Reports from Lebanon indicated around 10 explosions were heard, and at least six buildings were destroyed in the strike. Footage from the scene showed extensive damage, with the Lebanese news agency reporting that the attacks created a 'belt of fire' from Burj Barajneh to Haret Hreik. A Lebanese security source confirmed to Al Arabiya that this was the most significant Israeli assault on southern Beirut since the beginning of hostilities, targeting an area frequently used by senior Hezbollah officials. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hybmtun0a	2024-09-27T11:41:49-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/ByMDhMP40R/ByMDhMP40R_0_105_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

32 years at the helm: Who is Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah?	Nasrallah, 64, has led Hezbollah since the assassination of his predecessor in 1992; after Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon, he was perceived as a Arab hero; the arch-terrorist targeted by Israel in Beirut Israel attempted to assassinate Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on the Dahieh district of Beirut on Friday, but his fate remains unknown. Nasrallah, 64, has served as Hezbollah's secretary-general since 1992, following the assassination of his predecessor, Abbas Musawi. Known for his fiery rhetoric, charismatic presence and eloquent speeches, Nasrallah has become one of Lebanon’s most prominent figures and a significant leader within the broader radical Islamist movement. Born in a refugee camp in eastern Beirut, Nasrallah was the eldest of nine children in a poor Shiite family originally from a village in southern Lebanon. From a young age, he was deeply interested in Islam and dedicated much of his time to religious studies. During the Lebanese Civil War, he and his family returned to their village, where he joined the Shiite Amal movement. Nasrallah’s talents and dedication were soon noticed, and he was taken under the wing of a prominent local cleric. At 16, he was sent to study at a prestigious seminary in Najaf, Iraq, under the guidance of Abbas Musawi, a fellow Lebanese who would later become Hezbollah’s leader. The two developed a close friendship. In 1978, as the Iraqi regime began cracking down on Shiite clerics, Nasrallah and Musawi fled Iraq along with hundreds of other Lebanese seminarians. Upon returning to Lebanon, Nasrallah continued his studies and taught at a religious seminary established by Musawi in Baalbek. His charisma and militant messages quickly elevated his status as a religious leader, attracting a devoted following. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Nasrallah, following Musawi’s lead, left the Amal movement and joined forces with the newly formed Hezbollah, which was supported by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Nasrallah's leadership abilities quickly became evident, and he was appointed commander of Hezbollah’s forces in the Bekaa Valley. Under the guidance of the Revolutionary Guards, the Lebanese Shiites worked to develop a new framework known as Hezbollah. Nasrallah was a founding member and part of the organization's leadership from its inception. Over the years, Nasrallah consolidated his position as both a military and religious leader within Hezbollah, leading several successful operations against Amal fighters in the late 1980s. He later traveled to Iran to continue his studies in the holy city of Qom. When the conflict between Hezbollah and Amal resumed in 1989, Nasrallah returned to Lebanon, where he participated in the fighting and sustained minor injuries. By the following year, he had become one of Hezbollah’s top military commanders and a member of the group's highest decision-making body, the Shura Council. During that time, the organization’s leadership was divided between different factions loyal to Syria and Iran. In 1991, amid negotiations between the two countries, Musawi, who was seen as an ally of Damascus, was appointed secretary-general of Hezbollah, with Iran-backed Nasrallah’s influence within the organization further solidified. The campaign to eject Israel from Lebanon In 1992, Musawi was assassinated by Israel and Nasrallah took over the helm. Under his leadership, Hezbollah launched a wave of retaliatory attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets worldwide, including bombings at the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which left dozens dead. Nasrallah’s leadership faced a significant challenge in 1997 when former Hezbollah leader Sheikh Subhi Tufayli led a 'revolution of the hungry' in protest of what he saw as the group’s abandonment of its social commitments to Lebanon’s Shiite community in favor of becoming a mainstream political organization. However, with support from Iran and Syria, Nasrallah successfully quashed the uprising, disarming Tufayli’s supporters in the Baalbek region. From 1985, following Israel’s withdrawal from most of Lebanon, Hezbollah waged a persistent guerrilla war against Israeli forces and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the security zone. Under Nasrallah’s guidance and with backing from Iran, Hezbollah’s military capabilities grew significantly. However, the IDF's superior firepower resulted in high casualties for Hezbollah fighters, and many of their operations ended in failure. Israeli attempts to end the prolonged conflict, such as Operations Grapes of Wrath and Accountability, were met with Hezbollah rocket and mortar fire on northern Israel, international condemnation and the group’s entrenchment within the civilian population. Under Nasrallah’s leadership, Hezbollah shifted its strategy to include targeting Israeli public opinion, recognizing that the Israeli public’s sensitivity to casualties was a potential vulnerability. This approach turned the media into a key battleground for Hezbollah, contributing to a protracted conflict that inflicted ongoing casualties on both sides, including Hezbollah fighters, IDF soldiers and SLA forces. By the late 1990s, the continuous casualties and lack of a decisive outcome led to growing public opposition in Israel to the military presence in Lebanon. This pressure culminated in the Israeli government’s decision to withdraw from the security zone. In May 2000, the IDF executed a unilateral withdrawal to the international border, ending its 18-year presence in southern Lebanon. An Arab hero post-Israeli withdrawal The Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon elevated Nasrallah to a hero’s status across the Arab world. Shortly after, he was promoted to the religious rank of Hojjat al-Islam. During celebrations marking the withdrawal, Nasrallah delivered a speech declaring, 'Israel has nuclear weapons and the strongest air force in the region, but in reality, it is weaker than a spider’s web.' His so-called 'Spider Web' theory suggested that Israeli society’s sensitivity to casualties and perceived decadence made it vulnerable to a prolonged struggle and heavy losses. Domestically, Nasrallah focused on solidifying Hezbollah’s influence within the Shiite community, particularly against its main rival, the Amal movement. A significant portion of the group’s budget was allocated to establishing welfare, education, charity and healthcare institutions, providing free services to the community. Despite Israel’s withdrawal, Nasrallah refrained from ending hostilities, frequently attacking and mocking Israel and its leaders in his speeches. While the intensity of the conflict decreased, it was marked by sporadic skirmishes and preparations for future confrontation. In early July 2006, a Hezbollah squad attacked an Israeli military patrol along the Israel-Lebanon border, capturing two Israeli soldiers and killing three others. In response, the Israeli government launched a large-scale military operation against Hezbollah, later known as the Second Lebanon War. During the war, Nasrallah went into hiding, fearing an Israeli assassination attempt. However, he continued to deliver messages to the Lebanese public and engage in psychological warfare with Israel through speeches broadcast on Hezbollah’s television station. The last speech Since then and until October 2023, Hezbollah, with significant Iranian support, has armed itself extensively but largely avoided direct clashes with Israel. Over the past month, Israel has killed several senior Hezbollah commanders close to Nasrallah. Foreign reports have also attributed to Israel a large-scale sabotage operation of communication devices used by the group’s operatives, resulting in dozens of deaths and thousands of injuries. Last week, in a televised speech, Nasrallah vowed that Israel would face a 'harsh and just punishment' for its recent actions, warning, 'We are currently in the most sensitive phase of the campaign.' However, he did not specify what Hezbollah’s retaliation would look like, saying that the details are kept within a 'small circle' of the group’s leadership. 'I won’t speak of the time, form or place. The response will come,' Nasrallah declared, adding, 'The aggression is unprecedented and will face a harsh reckoning and just retribution—whether from an expected or unexpected place.' He accused Israel of intending to kill 5,000 people—presumably referring to Hezbollah members—in the communication device blasts, claiming, 'The enemy has crossed all red lines with this action.' Nasrallah also hinted that Israel’s actions could be considered a declaration of war, though he stopped short of making such a declaration himself. Nasrallah is married to Fatima Yassin. His eldest son, Hadi Nasrallah, was killed by Israeli forces in September 1997. His body was transferred to Israel and later returned to Lebanon as part of a prisoner exchange deal for the remains of an Israeli Navy commando killed in a separate incident the same year. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj5rfdva0	2024-09-27T10:55:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/HklEg112KaA/HklEg112KaA_0_0_3000_1672_0_small.jpg

Army says terror group's HQ located beneath residential buildings in Lebanese capital's Dahieh district; no changes to Home Front Command safety guidelines The IDF said it carried out an airstrike on Friday evening targeting Hezbollah’s central command, located beneath residential buildings in the Dahieh district in southern Beirut. Some media reports suggested that the Lebanese terrorist group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was the intended target. 'On October 8, Hezbollah, led by Nasrallah, initiated a war and has since escalated the situation,' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement. 'Israel warned them, but they continued their aggression against our citizens and sovereignty. The Air Force continues to strike terror targets to diminish their capabilities.' Hagari added there are no changes to the Home Front Command’s safety guidelines and any updates will be provided immediately through official channels. Security sources in Lebanon told Reuters the attack, the most extensive Israeli assault on the southern Beirut Hezbollah stronghold since the war began, targeted an area where top Hezbollah officials are usually based. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Manar reported that six buildings were destroyed in the attack. Local reports indicated that around 10 explosions were heard in the Lebanese capital. The strikes hit Beirut shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue Israel's attacks on the Iranian-backed terrorist group in Lebanon in a closely watched United Nations speech, as hopes faded for a cease-fire that could head off an all-out regional war. He abruptly left a press briefing he was holding following his speech after learning about the strike. *This is a breaking news story* >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycgxi4ca	2024-09-27T08:50:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/S1VOf8N0A/S1VOf8N0A_0_139_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel aims to keep Lebanon ground operation as brief as possible...	Army completes call-up of 2 reserve brigades in preparation for a potential expansion of the conflict in Lebanon and a possible ground incursion The IDF announced on Friday that it has completed the mobilization of the 6th and 228th reserve brigades in preparation for a potential expansion of the conflict in Lebanon and a possible ground incursion. An Israeli official told AFP that the aim would be to keep any ground operation in Lebanon as brief as possible. 'We will try to make it as short as we can. We are preparing for this every day, and we definitely have the means,' the official said. The official also dismissed claims that Israeli airstrikes have resulted in high civilian casualties in Lebanon, asserting that many of those killed were Hezbollah members. 'They are not publishing the names of the dead. Many were from Hezbollah,' he said, accusing the militant group of using civilians as human shields. In addition to the two brigades, the IDF has also mobilized several additional reserve battalions to support efforts to secure the northern region and enable residents to return to their homes safely. Emergency depots have been opened, and logistical and combat equipment has been distributed to reservists. Photos from the north show dozens of tanks poised for possible deployment. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, visiting the northern border, said, 'The enemy wanted attrition, and they are getting crushed instead. There have been blow after blow to key operatives and the command chain, dramatic moves to eliminate their missile and rocket capabilities, and many more operations from air and sea.' During a briefing with 91st Division commander Brig. Gen. Shai Klapper and other senior officers, Gallant emphasized the need for readiness in the region. 'What you’ve seen in the past two weeks has changed Hezbollah significantly, and we need to capitalize on that. Continuity in battle and exploiting success are key. We are looking at how Hezbollah is behaving—it’s a problem of capability, fear, and control. The lack of commanders in their chain of command is significant, especially with the Radwan Force. The dramatic operation last Friday changed a lot.' Gallant added, 'We have been waiting for this opportunity for a long time, not just in the past year, but for many years. We have unfinished business with many elements here, and in the end, we want to live here properly, both in this region and in the more western fronts. So keep going, use the time, and surprises will come—both for the enemy and for our forces. We will give you as much warning as possible, but the dynamics are known.' Meanwhile, airstrikes in Lebanon continued. The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Manar reported that 14 villages across the country were hit afternoon within two hours. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjp11znncr	2024-09-27T06:33:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJeuboZ400/SJeuboZ400_0_0_1280_773_0_small.jpg

We have to make a deal with Iran,' Trump says	Republican presidential candidate says would attempt and negotiate a new deal with Tehran should he be elected without providing details U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday he was willing to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran if elected. 'I would do that,' Trump said without elaborating on the potential deal’s details. 'We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal.' Trump's statements, made in the context of his tight race against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, are notable given the hostility he previously demonstrated toward Tehran — both as president and during his campaign. Trump's campaign claimed this week that U.S. intelligence informed him that Iran was planning an assassination attempt on his life. According to Politico, Trump's comments were aimed at easing tensions with the Iranian regime. Trump said that he would have been ready to reach an agreement with Iran within a week after the elections were he reelected in 2020. ' I would’ve made a fair deal with Iran. I was gonna get along with Iran. The deal was simple: Iran can’t have a nuclear missile. It cannot have that nuclear capability,' he said. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who arrived for the annual UN General Assembly in New York alongside Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, said that Tehran was ready to resume nuclear talks. He noted that Iran is prepared to restart negotiations 'if the other parties are also ready,' to do so. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers collapsed after Trump decided to withdraw from the agreement and reinstate sanctions on Iran. Iran has since violated many of the agreement’s clauses. In his speech at the UN this week, Iran's president stressed that Tehran was willing to cooperate with major powers to save the agreement. Pezeshkian said in his address that the sanctions against the Islamic Republic are 'inhumane' and harm Iranian residents. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byixjmnac	2024-09-27T05:23:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/SyFswO9TA/SyFswO9TA_1_25_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Once buildings in Beirut start collapsing, it'll be clear we're ...	As IDF operation against Hezbollah continues military is adamant to cut off Lebanon from smuggling routes used to deliver weapons to terror group from across the Middle East Amid Operation Northern Arrows against Hezbollah announced by IDF Chief of Staff LTG Herzi Halevi last week, military indications point out the Iran-back terror group is maximizing its efforts in receiving new munitions and military equipment from Tehran via smuggling routes in Syria, Iraq and Iran — which the IDF is now adamant in disrupting. More than 200 Hezbollah targets were attacked on Thursday out of approximately 3,000 since Israel’s large-scale operation began. Four border crossings in Lebanon were attacked by Israeli Air Force fighter jets as well, with plans to escalate strikes in the coming days to disrupt Hezbollah's smuggling routes. A mid-operation assessment by the IDF indicated that the operation’s initial strikes, which severely impacted dozens of Hezbollah commanders — including top officials who were eliminated — are the primary reason the Shiite terror army has struggled to implement its contingency plans. These included the daily firing of thousands of rockets, precision missiles and drones against Israel in general and Tel Aviv in particular in large-scale barrages. Hezbollah’s initial shock over the elimination of its key leaders, including its air unit commander, has hindered its ability to reassess and formulate additional actions. The IDF, however, said it has yet to fully unleash its force. 'It will be clear that we are applying our full strength once buildings in Beirut start collapsing or the IDF Northern Command forces initiate a ground operation. We're not there yet.' The IDF believes that the past week demonstrates Hezbollah has lost its operational balance, though it still retains significant capabilities for major attacks deep within Israel. As a result, prolonged strikes are necessary which will possibly last several more weeks. At this stage, the IDF isn’t attacking dual-use infrastructure in Lebanon, such as bridges that Hezbollah could also use, reserving these elements for an all-out war. One of Israel's primary objectives in this operation is to sever the connection between Lebanon and Gaza. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah committed — and followed through on his promise — to fire at Israel as long as fighting continues in the Gaza Strip. The Ground operation in Gaza has been dramatically reduced to a minimal force maintaining the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors in the past month, with only a few hundred soldiers involved and without the widespread ground raids that were initially planned for the war’s 'Phase C'. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force sees both fronts as joined. The pilots who attacked hundreds of additional targets in Lebanon on Thursday also participated in airstrikes against Hamas's recovering positions in Gaza, as part of support for divisions defending the Gaza border. According to IDF estimates, Hezbollah is still equipped with thousands of short-range rockets as well as thousands of drones and precision missiles. However, the elimination of senior figures in recent days has disrupted its ability to use them. The IDF is aware Hezbollah hasn’t yet deployed its heavy arsenal, much of which has been targeted: precision missiles, and not only surface-to-surface missiles but also advanced Russian-made Yakhont cruise missiles which the IDF believes the terror group still holds from its part in suppressing the Syrian civil war. The Yakhont missile can hit any target along Israel's coast within a range of about 300 km (186 miles), potentially crippling the Haifa and Ashdod ports and endangering Israel's gas rigs. However, the IDF believes Hezbollah would need to assemble the missile’s components from various hideouts In order to deploy it, a process the IDF has detected and disrupted. Another key target being gradually worn down is Hezbollah's Radwan Force, the terror group’s elite unit comprising thousands of highly trained soldiers organized into battalions. Israel has made significant efforts to distance the unit's operatives from southern Lebanon. The Radwan Force’s command chain has been hit or eliminated by the Israeli Air Force in recent days, which the IDF believes has disrupted Hezbollah's plans to invade the Galilee which took over two decades to develop and designed to mirror Hamas’s invasion on October 7. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1tla114rr	2024-09-27T04:37:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/SJXUZJm00/SJXUZJm00_0_159_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Local reports say terror group operatives stopped Islam Hijazi's car and fired over 90 bullets at her after she refused to provide them with money donated to her organization Hamas terrorists on Thursday killed Islam Hijazi — program director of the Heal Palestine organization working to medically support the Strip — near a hospital in Khan Younis after she refused to hand charity funds she collected over to the terror group. According to eyewitnesses, three masked Hamas terrorists stopped Hijazi’s Thursday overnight and fired around 90 bullets at her while she was on her way to visit patients. Gazan reports noted that the motive for the murder was Hamas operatives' takeover of large portions of the aid and funds entering the Strip via donations. 'Islam was a mother of two young children, a humane woman with the highest level of ethics and professionalism. She stayed in Gaza intentionally to help others. She always said, 'I'm staying here to help our people,'' The NGO said in a statement following the murder. Iyad Khader, a Gaza resident, posted on social media following the murder, writing, 'A mafia has recently been established in the southern part of the Strip to loot, kill, steal and terrorize the residents. War must declare war on them immediately.' 'This isn’t the first of such a case,' said Hussein Jamal, a political researcher from Gaza. 'The truth is that civilians are murdered daily and no one talks about it. Hijazi was unfortunately well-known; otherwise, no one would have known the circumstances or details of her death.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry00kqzera	2024-09-27T03:24:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/H1RV067AA/H1RV067AA_0_94_680_383_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah focuses fire on Tiberias and Haifa, man moderately inju...	Lebanese terror group resumed heavy fire on north amid American efforts to avoid conflict spiraling into regional war; reports say six rockets fell inside Sea of Galilee Sirens blared incessantly in northern Israel’s Tiberias and Haifa throughout Friday morning as Hezbollah renewed its fire against the country amid ongoing efforts by the U.S. and France to secure a three-week cease-fire. According to the Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service, a 25-year-old man received moderate injuries after being hit by ricochets in the southern Golan Heights following Hezbollah’s fire. Launches toward the area began around 8 a.m. with the Tiberias municipality reporting a hit was seen inside the Sea of Galilee after several interceptions took place above the city. 'The rocket fell 20 meters away from the shore, it’s a Rosh Hashanah miracle that no one was hurt. It fell right at the point where boats are lowered toward the Sea of Galilee,' Tiberias Mayor Yossi Nava said following the attack. Shortly afterward another rocket salvo was launched toward the city, with the municipality reporting at least five rockets were seen landing inside of the Israeli lake. The MDA said no injuries were reported in either incident. Hezbollah also resumed launches toward the Haifa Bay area on Friday, with the IDF reporting that 10 rockets were fired toward the city and were intercepted. 'Approximately 10 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon. Some of the projectiles were intercepted and others were identified as having fallen in open areas,' the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said in a statement. Two individuals received minor injuries running for safety during the barrage, and a car was damaged from ricochets hitting Kiryat Haim. The rising conflict on the northern border comes amid efforts to calm the situation and attempts to avoid an all-out war with Hezbollah amid fears such a war could span the entire Middle East. Sources close to the talks to end the fighting in the north voiced their disappointment late on Thursday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the fight against Hezbollah in Lebanon would continue until the objective of returning Israelis to their homes in the north safely, is met.

Nasrallah, hit Tel Aviv': Belgium protest calls on Hezbollah to ...	Israel's ambassador to Belgium posts clip on social media in which extreme pro-Palestinian group calls for attacks on country and say they support Hamas Israel's ambassador to Belgium Idit Rosenzweig-Abu, posted a video on her X account on Thursday showing a pro-Palestinian demonstration in central Brussels in which hundreds of protesters participated, chanting in Arabic for Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah to launch rockets at Tel Aviv. 'Hassan (Nasrallah), hit, hit Tel Aviv, please sir, in the name of Allah,' they chanted. 'Hamas, we are here for you.' The demonstration was organized by a group called 'Samidoun,' a Palestinian organization advocating for Palestinian 'prisoners.' The extremist group even opposes the Palestinian Authority, believing that anyone negotiating with Israel is a traitor. They support the establishment of a Palestinian state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean and accuse the United Arab Emirates of betrayal for making peace with Israel. The group's leader was deported from Germany and now lives in Canada, while the head of its European center, Mohammad Khatib, resides in Brussels. A few months ago, Belgium's interior ministry announced plans to deport Khatib, but the issue is still under legal proceedings following a public uproar and he still resides in the country. During the war in Gaza, the organization's activists held a webinar with a Hamas spokesperson. They regularly organize demonstrations on university campuses in the country, often marked by violence. Pro-Palestinian protesters in Belgium have a structured plan to turn campus demonstrations violent, both in Europe and beyond. Belgian authorities appear powerless in dealing with the group. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skoaqpmrc	2024-09-26T23:25:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SyFxI5XR0/SyFxI5XR0_288_247_746_420_0_small.jpg

IDF thwarts Houthi missile strike on Tel Aviv, central Israel	The IDF intercepted a missile fired by the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the military said late on Thursday after sirens were heard in many communities surrounding the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, the central plains and the city of Modi'in. No injuries or damage were reported.

A UN report published on Thursday said Yemen's Houthi rebels have grown 'from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization' with the help of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists. After a drone launched by the Houthis exploded over Tel Aviv in July, killing one man and wounding others, Israel attacked the Yemeni port of Hodeidah causing major damage.

Major hurricane Helene menaces Florida with 'unsurvivable' storm ...	The storm became a major Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds near 120 mph, worrying weather officials of potential destructive outcomes Driving rain flooded roadways and closed down airports in Florida as an intensifying Hurricane Helene marched toward the state's panhandle region, bringing the threat of a potentially deadly storm surge to much of the coastline. The storm became a major Category 3 hurricane on Thursday afternoon with sustained winds near 120 mph (193 kph), the National Hurricane Center said, and was expected to continue gaining power. Helene was forecast to make landfall in the evening in Florida's Big Bend region, possibly as a Category 4 storm with sustained winds in excess of 130 mph (209 kph). Officials pleaded with residents in the path of the storm to heed mandatory evacuation orders or face life-threatening conditions. Helene's surge - the wall of seawater pushed on land by hurricane-force winds - could rise to as much as 20 feet (6.1 meters) in some spots, as tall as a two-story house, the center's director, Michael Brennan, said in a video briefing. 'A really unsurvivable scenario is going to play out' in the coastal area, Brennan said, with water capable of destroying buildings and carrying cars pushing inland. The hurricane was about 160 miles (274 km) west-southwest of Tampa, Florida, as of 3 p.m. EDT, the center said. Strong rain bands were whipping parts of coastal Florida, and rainfall had already lashed Georgia, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina and portions of Tennessee. Atlanta, hundreds of miles north of Florida's Big Bend, was under a tropical storm warning. In Pinellas County, which sits on a peninsula surrounded by Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, roads were already filling with water before noon. Officials warned the storm's impact could be as severe as last year's Hurricane Idalia, which flooded 1,500 homes in the low-lying coastal county. Videos posted on the county's social media site showed some swamped beachside roads and water rising over boat docks. Airports in Tampa, Tallahassee and St. Petersburg all suspended operations on Thursday. Governor Ron DeSantis warned North Florida residents to flee before time ran out. 'You have time to get to a shelter, but you've got to do it now,' he said at a morning news briefing. 'Every minute that goes by brings us closer to having conditions that are going to be simply too dangerous to navigate.' Helene is expected to remain a full-fledged hurricane as it rolls through the Macon, Georgia, area on Friday, forecasters said. It could bring 12 inches (30.5 cm) of rain or more, potentially devastating the state's cotton and pecan crops, which are in the middle of harvesting season. 'The current forecast for Hurricane Helene suggests this storm will impact every part of our state,' Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said. After making landfall across the Florida coast, Helene is expected move more slowly over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday, the NHC said. Wall of water Storm surge was forecast to reach 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 meters) in the Big Bend area of Florida's Panhandle region where the storm is expected to come ashore. Numerous evacuations were ordered along Florida's Gulf Coast, including Sarasota and Charlotte counties. Pinellas County officials ordered evacuations of long-term healthcare facilities near the coast, including nursing homes, assisted living centers and hospitals. Not everyone heeded the evacuation orders. In coastal Dunedin, Florida, about 25 miles west of Tampa, state ferry boat operator Ken Wood, 58, planned to ride out the storm with his 16-year-old cat, Andy. 'We're under orders, but I'm going to stay right here at the house,' Wood told Reuters by telephone. 'The storm looks like it'll be a bit west of us, but who knows? I'm sure it'll be interesting, to say the least.' Tallahassee officials expressed concern that the storm could cause unprecedented damage. Reinsurance broker Gallagher Re said preliminary private insurance losses could reach $3 billion to $6 billion, with additional losses to federal insurance programs approaching a potential $1 billion. Energy facilities along the U.S. Gulf Coast scaled back operations and evacuated some production sites. The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, said at a White House briefing that she would travel to Florida on Friday to assess the damage. Helene was expected to dump up to 15 inches (38.1 cm) of rain in some isolated spots after making landfall in Florida, causing considerable flash and urban flooding, the hurricane center said. National Hurricane Center Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said about half of lives lost in hurricanes typically came from flash flooding caused by torrential rain, often among people who drive into flooded roads and are swept away. Rhome added that the expected hurricane-force wind impact area stretched around 180 miles (290 km) north from the Florida panhandle to southern Georgia. 'You need to prepare for prolonged (energy) outages. Those trees are going to come down in strong winds, block roads,' Rhome said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syix5hxr0	2024-09-26T14:17:48-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/S1tDM6f0C/S1tDM6f0C_0_527_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Algeria says Morocco using 'Zionist intelligence agents'	Ministry of Foreign Affairs accuses Morocco of taking advantage of the visa exemption regime to carry out 'actions detrimental to the stability of Algeria' Algeria announced Thursday the 'immediate reestablishment' of a visa regime for 'all foreigners holding a Moroccan passport', accusing its neighbor of deploying 'Zionist intelligence agents ' against a backdrop of growing tensions between these rival Maghreb countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs accuses Morocco of taking advantage of the visa exemption regime to deploy 'Zionist intelligence agents (....) and freely access the national territory' to carry out 'various actions detrimental to the stability of Algeria'. Algiers specifies that 'these acts constitute a direct threat to national security' and affirms that 'the Kingdom of Morocco is held solely responsible for the current process of deterioration of bilateral relations through its hostile actions against Algeria.' Algiers broke off diplomatic relations with Rabat in August 2021, denouncing a series of 'hostile acts' by its neighbor, particularly concerning the disputed territory of Western Sahara, normalization with Israel as well as support for the independence movement. of Kabylia (MAK) which Algiers has classified as a terrorist organization. Morocco deemed this decision 'completely unjustified', rejecting the neighboring country's accusations. Emboldened by the recognition by the American administration of its sovereignty over Western Sahara, in return for a rapprochement with Israel, Morocco has since deployed offensive diplomacy to rally other countries to its positions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkbehrqaa	2024-09-26T14:16:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/S1ecgAHQ0A/S1ecgAHQ0A_0_0_275_183_0_small.jpg

Israeli officials and military leadership including IDF chief continue to press for northern front campaign amid efforts by U.S. and France to foster cease-fire with Hezbollah Sources close to the talks to end the fighting in the north voiced their disappointment late on Thursday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the fight against the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon would continue until the objective of returning Israelis to their homes in the north safely, is met. The prime minister spoke to reporters upon landing in New York before his address to the UN General Assembly on Friday. The sources said that the prime minister backed away from 'quiet understandings' reached earlier that he would accept the international efforts to stop the fighting. The White House said the 21-day cease-fire proposal between Israel and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, unveiled Wednesday night, was coordinated with the Israeli government, which later rejected it. 'I’m just laying out the facts and what we know, and what we want to avoid,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a briefing. 'We do not believe an all-out war is the answer.' Jean-Pierre said she could not speak for the Israel side. 'Israel was aware of this statement and now, what I can tell you right now, we are having continued discussions that is happening with our teams in New York. … I can assure you these conversations are continuing,' she said. Another source said that there were no clear commitments that Israel would agree to a proposed lull in the fighting but there were sufficient indications that allowed for a public statement about a pending agreement to be made. 'But then Israeli politicians came out with their public reactions and the same occurred on the Lebanese side,' he said. 'We did not expect these reactions from Netanyahu and the Israelis. Our understanding was that the prime minister would at least welcome the initiative. We believe diplomacy is the best way to return residents to the north compared to a dangerous war that would have a devastating effect on both peoples and on the entire region.' 'It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety,' U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron said in a joint statement. 'The exchange of fire since October 7, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians. We are grateful for all of those who are making a sincere effort with diplomacy to avoid escalation, to avoid a full war,' the leaders added. The proposal was also supported by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. This was the first time that the Americans have referred to the northern front separately from the war in Gaza, which is advantageous to the Israeli position although it is devastating to the families of the hostages still held by Hamas who fear their loved ones would be overlooked in any deal. Netanyahu gave the green light to proceed with attempts to reach a temporary cease-fire before he departed for the United States and after a dramatic meeting of the security cabinet. He dispatched Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in New York. Officials close to the prime minister briefed reporters that Netanyahu's red lines are that Hezbollah be pushed back north of the Litani River but at the same time, he was involved in the wording of the American-French proposal, but wanted to maintain plausible deniability so as not to endanger his coalition. Both far-right ministers Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said they opposed a cease-fire and Ben-Gvir even threatened Netanyahu that he would remove his party from the coalition if one was imposed. Netanyahu may have intended to agree to the proposal under the assumption that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah would reject it, thus providing Israel with the international legitimacy to continue the war without the risk of a U.S. arms embargo. The announcement of the cease-fire was made while Netanyahu was airborne. This may have been intentional. But soon after it was made, the prime minister's coalition partners and members of his own party, came out with their statements opposing it. According to the source, the situation is at a critical junction. 'This does not mean we are on the cusp of an all-out war but the risk is high. A war would not yield better conditions than an agreement. Now, after the statements that were made, the path is even more narrow and it is more difficult for us but we have not lost hope.' U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew said the unacceptable risk of broader regional escalation demands immediate action. ' A cease-fire is the best way for diplomacy to restore safety for citizens to return to their homes,' he said. 'Conditions in the north of Israel and the south of Lebanon must change to permit their safe return. At the same time, we press forward every day for an agreement to release the hostages and achieve a cease-fire in Gaza.' The Prime Minister's Office released a statement earlier on Thursday, denying reports of an imminent cease-fire. 'It is an American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to,' the statement which was released while Netanyahu was on his way to the U.S. read. 'The report about an alleged directive to scale back fighting in the north is also incorrect. The prime minister instructed the IDF to continue fighting with full force, according to the plans presented to him. Likewise, the fighting in Gaza will continue until all the war's goals are achieved,' the statement added. IDF Chief of Staff LTG Herzi Halevi said earlier that the military had waited a long time for this opportunity to hit Hezbollah. He said strikes should continue and that the forces have succeeded thus far in eliminating the terror group's leadership, disrupting its arms supplies and diminishing its military capabilities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r159afmra	2024-09-26T12:24:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/20/BkTYLwK00R/BkTYLwK00R_0_15_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Children were shot and burned alive on October 7, police report s...	Police cyber and forensics teams work tirelessly across communities near the Gaza border to uncover facts about Hamas' brutal killing of children; warning: viewer discretion is advised Warning: The article contains graphic descriptions. Viewer discretion is advised. Israel Police data released on Thursday revealed 27 children between the ages of 0-17 were shot and burned alive on October 7. Commander Dudi Katz, the Israel Police special investigations unit’s Lahav 433’s cyber unit chief, was tasked with analyzing digital forensic evidence. One of the recordings received by the cyber team investigating one of the kibbutzim near the Gaza border featured a child's voice. The girl was on a call with the police emergency center while being held by a terrorist. She begged the terrorist to let her go, saying she was just a child and had school the next day. Despite the police dispatcher's pleas, the terrorist shot her to death. Her burnt remains were later located. This is just one of the many heartbreaking stories that police investigators have uncovered. The data, testimonies and hundreds of thousands of videos have been analyzed by Lahav 433, the national unit investigating the events of October 7. 'We collected 11,666 videos that provide a comprehensive evidentiary basis gathered from various sources from just one kibbutz, which will enable us to file some of the most severe indictments against the perpetrators of these brutal terror acts,' said Superintendent Reut Anoim, head of Lahav 433’ cyber investigation division. The data and testimonies were also collected from ZAKA Search and Rescue volunteers who operated in the kibbutz. Six days after the deadly assault began, ZAKA personnel returned to ensure no evidence was overlooked, guided by the smell of decay, flies and other signs. In one room, they found the small body of a child and the body of a woman in the stairwell. Both bodies were so badly burned they were nearly unrecognizable. The only thing left of the mother was her bra, and of the child, only ashes remained. 'Each cyber unit and the International Crime Investigations Unit was assigned to gather and analyze evidence based on specific areas. We relied on a web of testimonies collected from CCTV cameras in the affected towns, private homes near the Gaza border, testimonies from hostages, ZAKA volunteers, Hamas terrorists' body cameras and social media posts,' Anoim said. Any evidence that could not be verified was dismissed. 'All the materials we used helped complete an evidentiary framework as we worked hard to maintain the highest standards of verification and cross-referencing, compared to the fake materials circulating on social media,' she added, Katz explained the challenge was interpreting the significance of the evidence they located. 'As a law enforcement officer, I only work with definitive evidence. When I see a child shot with a severed finger, I can describe and document the scene but cannot definitively state the cause, as the finger may not have been intentionally severed but instead was injured by a fragment from the explosion in the safe room.' However, Katz was unequivocal about one fact: the torture of children by Hamas' Nukhba terrorists. 'That children were burned, shot and murdered alongside their parents is a proven fact. Children witnessed their parents being murdered and we found a scene with a pile of bodies from the same family more than once.' Among the other harrowing scenes was a photograph of a baby who was murdered alongside her father who tried to protect his family. She was the youngest victim of October 7. Another case that Katz said he would never forget was the tragic story of the Taasa family from Netiv HaAsara. The father, Gil, threw himself on a grenade that terrorists had tossed into their home to save his children from witnessing the horror. In another video, 'We identified a child around six or seven years old whose body was burnt, but his face remained intact. His glazed expression indicated that he had been burned alive,' Katz recounted. Over 90 members of Kibbutz Be'eri were murdered on October 7. The kibbutz secretary, Gal Cohen, said that the highest number of children murdered was in his community. 'What the children here went through is incomprehensible and we’re still burying our dead. This is an open wound, and we haven't digested it yet.' 'We’re scarred, but we’re rebuilding and trying to recover. Parents and grandparents who lost their children and grandchildren have said they will never set foot in the kibbutz again because they see the victims everywhere they look,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqyi11q0r	2024-09-26T11:38:48-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/11/03/S1g26PMm6/S1g26PMm6_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

80% of homes aren't protected': Safed worries after rocket makes...	Northern city residents and mayor say city doesn't have enough safe room in homes, putting them at risk after Hezbollah focuses its fire on the area Israel’s northern city of Safed felt Hezbollah’s most severe rocket salvos on Wednesday since the war began on October 7 and amid increased fighting across the northern border against the terror group. One home suffered a direct hit while its owners were abroad and avoided severe injury. Most homes in the city lack safe rooms or shelters because they were built before regulations demanded them, and many were also built using lightweight construction materials such as drywall. Many of these homes were part of assisted living housing complexes, where elderly people and new immigrants reside. The distance to public shelters, combined with advanced age, makes it impossible for many of the residents to reach a safe place in the 30 seconds between when sirens warn of fire and rockets arrive. The city was now examining the possibility of evacuating residents to a safer location. Unfortunately, we're being deserted,' Yitav Haddad, who lives near the home that took a direct hit said. 'We heard a huge explosion and quickly realized it hit the neighborhood, very close to us. The government and the municipality must wake up fast because tragedies will happen. We're talking about people's lives.' 'It was insane, the hardest volley we've experienced, Roman, another Safed resident, said. 'Some 80% of homes in the neighborhood aren't protected and that's a big fear here. It's a miracle no one was injured.' According to Safed Mayor Yossi Kakon, over 200 rockets targeted his city. 'Unfortunately, Safed also has a significant lack of shelters.' 'Generally, no evacuations are taking place in the city, but there are isolated cases where we may examine complex situations involving patients, the elderly and specific individuals. The decision to evacuate residents, are made by the Home Front Command in coordination with the municipality,' he said. Entire neighborhoods in the Druze cities of Daliyat al-Karmel and Isfiya, which have recently come within range of rockets from Lebanon, lack safe rooms or public shelters, leaving their residents feeling helpless in the face of this new threat. Parts of an intercepted rocket fell near the home of Suad Abu Rokhen living in Isfiya. Having recently undergone surgery, she can’t leave her unprotected home. 'When I hear the siren, I do nothing. I just wait for it to pass and pray that we don't get hit,' she said. 'According to the Civil Protection Law, the responsibility for building private safe rooms falls on the property owner, while the responsibility for public protection falls on municipalities. The Home Front Command is working in collaboration with various government ministries and local authorities to advance the permitting process for building various protection solutions,' The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk0zkx70r	2024-09-26T11:34:10-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/HyD800dhZA0/HyD800dhZA0_0_56_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Iran, Hezbollah enabled Houthis' rise, says UN report	The rebel group is transformed into an army with weapons training and assistance provided by other members of Iran's axis despite a de facto UN embargo on arms since 2015 Yemen's Houthi rebels have grown 'from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization' with the help of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists, according to a confidential report by U.N. sanctions monitors. The independent panel of experts, who report annually to the U.N. Security Council, said Houthi fighters had been receiving tactical and technical training outside Yemen, traveling on fake passports to Iran, Lebanon and Iraq. Over the past year the Houthis have launched repeated drone and missile strikes on ships in the crucial Red Sea shipping channels to show support for Palestinians in the Gaza war with Israel, disrupting global maritime trade by forcing shipping firms to divert cargo. 'The multiple testimonies gathered by the panel from military experts, Yemeni officials and even individuals close to the Houthis, indicate that they do not have the capacity to develop and produce, without foreign support, complex weapon systems,' the U.N. experts wrote in their latest report, seen by Reuters. 'The scale, nature and the extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,' they said. The Houthis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report. The sanctions monitors said weapons systems operated by the Houthis were similar to those produced and operated by Iran or armed groups of the Tehran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' opposed to Israel and U.S. influence in the Middle East. 'This transformation has been possible due to the transfer of materiel and the assistance and training provided by IRGC-QF, Hezbollah, and Iraqi specialists and technicians to the Houthis,' the U.N. experts reported to the 15-member Security Council Yemen sanctions committee. 'IRGC-QF' refers to the Quds Force, the overseas branch of the Revolutionary Guards. Built up over years or decades of Iranian support, the 'Axis of Resistance' includes the Houthis, Palestinian militants Hamas, Hezbollah and various armed groups in Iraq and Syria. The Houthis have effectively been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2015. Iran has repeatedly denied supplying weapons to the group. Iran's mission to the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. sanctions monitors report. At the United Nations on Wednesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters before a Security Council meeting that his country supported Hezbollah and would not remain indifferent if the Lebanon conflict with Israel spiraled. The U.N. sanctions monitors also expressed concern about an increasing collaboration between the Houthis and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. 'Both have agreed to cease internal conflict, transfer weapons, and coordinate on attacks against the forces of the Government of Yemen,' they said. 'Additionally, increased smuggling activities, involving small and light weapons (SALWs) are observed between the Houthis and Al-Shabaab, with indications of shared military supplies or a common supplier.' On the issue of fake passports, the U.N. sanctions monitors said that the Houthis issue the counterfeit documents to people who 'act on their behalf, for their support or under their control.' 'These people are tasked with the procurement and/or transfer of illicit goods or weapons or they travel abroad to participate in military training,' they wrote in the 38-page report that includes hundreds of pages of annexes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skp8qmq0c	2024-09-26T10:46:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/01/13/H1eEFeElKa/H1eEFeElKa_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Hamas massacre to be celebrated in Spain as Israel unable to sway...	Several pro-Palestinian organizations announce plans to celebrate atrocities committed on Israelis; Israel's position at a disadvantage with no Ambassador named to head mission harming efforts to counter Palestinian narrative Several Spanish organizations, some funded by Iran, are set to hold events across the country on October 6 and 7 to celebrate Hamas’ attack on Israel. Spain’s postal workers union decided to go on Strike on October 9 to protest 'Israeli aggression,' while failing to mention the massacre that took place across southern Israel before the war began. Israel's embassy in Madrid has appealed to the relevant Spanish authorities to cancel a planned parade by the Masar Badil organization, affiliated with Hamas, celebrating Hamas’ atrocities in the city. Despite the embassy's efforts, the parade is still set to take place. Senior officials noted that the embassy is tirelessly working to counter the Palestinian narrative and ensure Israel’s voice is heard — both among official figures in the government and opposition and with the Spanish public. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas was received with full honors in Spain this week, including in a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Sanchez promised that a bilateral meeting between Spain and the PA would take place soon following a major international conference held nearly two weeks ago with foreign ministers from Arab and European countries participating aimed at promoting the two-state solution. The only country not invited to the event was Israel, which is perceived as irrelevant to the process by the current Spanish government. The Foreign Ministry chose to avoid a direct attack on Spain and instead focused criticism on the European Union's Foreign Affairs Chief Josep Borrell, who’s due to end his term in late October. Israel itself seems largely absent from the Spanish arena amid the anti-Israel sentiment present there and its voice is barely heard. It's not that Israel lacks friends in Spain or people willing to help, but with the embassy operating without an ambassador since May, following Spain’s recognition of a Palestinian state, bringing Israel’s perspective to the media or initiating meetings with senior Spanish officials has hit snags. Sources familiar with Israel-Spain relations say that inaction only strengthens the anti-Israel stance and creates the impression that Israel has given up on Spain. Israel’s ambassador to Spain Rodica Radian, who was recalled in May, has since retired. Her replacement, Zvi Vapni, is waiting for the government to decide if and when he should leave to take up his post. Spain isn’t only a popular tourist destination for Israelis, but also the fourth-largest economy in the European Union. Its economy is thriving, and it has maintained significant business and economic ties with Israel which have been mutually beneficial but are now at risk due to the increasingly hostile stance in the country. 'Israel's frustration with Spain's recent conduct is understandable and justified, but now is the time to resume action, send an ambassador back to Madrid and take a firm and aggressive stance to counter the ongoing deterioration in relations. We must not lose Spain, and to prevent that, we need to operate at full capacity in the country,' sources said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by9mwjmar	2024-09-26T09:28:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/25/SkacwD1NC/SkacwD1NC_86_160_403_227_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu: war on Hezbollah to continue until objectives met	Prime minister speaks to reporters upon landing in New York ahead of his address to the UN General Assembly; Chief of staff says military waited years to deal blows to Hezbollah and succeeded in eliminating leaders, disrupting arms supplies and diminishing its capabilities Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that the fight against the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon would continue until the objective of returning Israelis to their homes in the north safely, is met. The prime minister spoke to reporters upon landing in New York before his address to the UN General Assembly on Friday. He said he approved the targeted strike on Beirut's Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold, that killed the terror group's head of aerial forces, Mohammed Srror, responsible for its drones, cruise missiles and gliders. According to Lebanese media, three missiles attacked a 10-story building located near the site of a previous strike that killed Hezbollah's senior military commander Ibrahim Aqil last week. Sources close to the negotiations said the prime minister backed away from 'quiet understandings' reached earlier that he would accept the international efforts to stop the fighting. The United States and France along with other European nations, were pressing for a cease-fire in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. A 21-day truce was said to be imminent earlier on Thursday, but Netanyahu's office said in a statement while the prime minister was still en route to New York, claiming he had not agreed to any lull in the fighting. Lebanon's LBCI Network said Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer informed U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein that Israel would continue the war on Hezbollah and would reject the proposed cease-fire. According to the report, the U.S. and France would continue discussions with Israel while Qatar and Turkey were speaking with senior Iranian officials to reach some agreement. IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said earlier that the military had waited a long time for this opportunity to hit Hezbollah. He said strikes should continue and that the forces have succeeded thus far in eliminating the terror group's leadership, disrupting its arms supplies and diminishing its military capabilities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkcf00l7r0	2024-09-26T08:58:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/S1jkN11X0A/S1jkN11X0A_0_0_478_268_0_small.jpg

UK police investigating Islamophobic hack of Wi-Fi at train stati...	Wi-Fi remained offline on Thursday following the incident at 19 stations including London Bridge and London Euston as well as Manchester Piccadilly and Edinburgh Waverley British police said on Thursday they had launched an investigation into a cyberattack after passengers at the country's major railway stations saw an Islamophobic message when they tried to use Wi-Fi services. The Wi-Fi system, which is managed by communications group Telent, was quickly taken offline after passengers said a message was displayed, that referred to terror attacks. 'We received reports at around 5:03 p.m. (1603 GMT) yesterday (Sept. 25) of a cyberattack displaying Islamophobic messaging on some Network Rail Wi-Fi services,' British Transport Police said. Tensions in Britain flared over the summer with a wave of anti-Muslim riots across the country after the killing of three young girls, an attack which was initially falsely blamed on an Islamist migrant following online misinformation. The police said they were working with Network Rail to investigate the Islamophobic cyber security incident 'at pace'. Network Rail, the group that manages tracks and train hubs, said the Wi-Fi remained offline on Thursday following the incident at 19 stations including London Bridge and London Euston as well as Manchester Piccadilly and Edinburgh Waverley. Telent said in a statement that no personal data had been affected by the hack, adding the matter was now in the hands of the police. It said an unauthorized change had been made to the Network Rail landing page, provided by Global Reach, from a legitimate administrator account. 'As a precaution, Telent temporarily suspended all use of Global Reach services while verifying that no other Telent customers were impacted,' it added. Network Rail said it expected the Wifi service to be restored over the weekend once final security checks were completed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1vclyxrr	2024-09-26T07:10:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/BJvvPCf0C/BJvvPCf0C_0_103_1000_563_0_small.jpg
IDF uncovers terror tunnel in Jenin	Troops find unusual tunnel shaft in a residential home in the area lacking an exit point; military says its troops find no weapons or people inside but some suspects were being questioned The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Thursday reported forces operating in the West Bank city of Jenin located an unusual tunnel shaft located at inside a residential apartment. According to the military, troops will use 'various operational means,' to dismantle the tunnel. The IDF said that the shaft was discovered deep within a civilian area, some six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the West Bank barrier wall during an operation overnight Wednesday. 'The tunnel is dug two meters deep without an exit point and no weapons or suspects were found within,' the military said, noting the site is being monitored. Several suspects were arrested and being questioned. Ynet also learned that the military established a dedicated unit to investigate suspected shafts and tunnels found in the Wes Bank, especially near the border wall, but thus far no tunnels reaching Israeli settlements were found. During IDF raids on the Jenin refugee camps, however, several underground passageways were discovered. One tunnel was found earlier this year, leading from a mosque where armed terrorists were hiding to an apartment filled with explosives. The IDF Central Command said it was aware of terrorist organizations' attempts to build underground tunnels across the West Bank and is acting accordingly amid growing concerns from residents of Israeli communities located close by. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjwktrzcc	2024-09-26T06:43:12-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/22/rJtaLkzzp/rJtaLkzzp_1_96_720_406_0_small.jpg

Rev. Franklin Graham delivers aid to Israel, all 'in Jesus’ name'	While in Israel to dedicate new ambulances to Magen David Adom, Graham - the son of the late Billy Graham - praised Trump's policies, calling them ‘good for America, good for the world, and also good for Israel’ Former U.S. President Donald Trump 'is a controversial person who has alienated many people,' Rev. Franklin Graham admitted last week during his visit to Israel. 'But I support him,' he added. At 72, Graham, president of Samaritan’s Purse, was in Israel to dedicate new life-saving ambulances to Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel’s national emergency medical service. Yet, with the U.S. election looming in less than two months, many wonder whether Trump will outpace Vice President Kamala Harris and reclaim the White House. Arguably America’s most prominent evangelist, Graham is the son of the late Billy Graham, famously known as 'America’s pastor' until he died in 2018. The elder Graham traveled the globe, spreading God’s word and earning the trust of presidents in various countries. The younger Graham has followed in his father’s footsteps and leads a Christian charity, delivering aid to war-torn areas from Ukraine to Israel, all 'in Jesus’ name.' During his visit to Israel Graham praised Trump’s policies, calling them 'good for America, good for the world, and also good for Israel.' According to Graham, Trump 'wants to fight terrorism and secure our borders – these are important for everyone.' Graham represents the evangelical base that helped elect Trump in 2016 and remains loyal to him. According to a Pew Research Center survey published earlier this month, most Christians across denominations continue to support Trump. This includes 82% of white evangelical Protestants, 61% of white Catholics, and 58% of white non-evangelical Protestants. 'Born Again' Christians like Graham comprise most U.S. Protestants. In appreciation for their support, Trump when president enacted policies aligning with his evangelical base’s beliefs and values. Notably, he appointed conservative Supreme Court justices who, in 2022, played a pivotal role in overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. Additionally, he signed an executive order on free speech and religious liberty. He introduced two federal rules allowing nonprofits and for-profit businesses to file religious or moral objections to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate under Obamacare, which requires coverage of contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs. Trump was the first president to speak at the March for Life and continues to open his rallies with prayers led by local church leaders. Despite rumored tensions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump’s strong pro-Israel stance is well-known. His administration is especially remembered in Israel for moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. When asked about whether Trump would support Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, Graham said it is 'hard to say' which policies will be prioritized if Trump is reelected. However, he noted that after surviving two assassination attempts, Trump might be weighing decisions differently, adding, 'I hope for the best.' Graham said that Trump would maintain 'a good relationship with whoever runs Israel because he loves Israel.' Love for Israel is also a fundamental part of Graham’s belief system. 'I believe Israel the nation and Israel the Jewish people are God’s chosen people. As Christians, we stand with Israel, we want to support Israel, and we do all that we can, especially in these times of great trouble,' he said. He added that 'the war is not over. It will take more time, and there will be even more need. As Christians, we believe the Bible and God’s word and want to stand with God’s people.' On Thursday, Graham visited the Gaza border community of Avshalom, where his organization dedicated two armored ambulances to MDA in memory of three American-Israelis murdered by Hamas: Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Roee and Smadar Idan. Goldberg-Polin was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival and survived 11 months in captivity. Earlier this month, he was executed by Hamas terrorists along with five other hostages. The Idans were murdered in their Kfar Aza home in front of their children on October 7. Their four-year-old daughter, Avigail, was kidnapped, while her older siblings survived by hiding in a closet for 12 hours. 'We are privileged to be in a position to help Magen David Adom with these ambulances,' Graham said. 'But it is also very sad, in the sense that these ambulances are dedicated to people who are no longer with us.' In addition to the ambulances, Graham laid the cornerstone for a new MDA dispatch station in Avshalom, which will significantly improve response times by Israeli paramedics and EMTs in future emergencies. 'The need is so great,' Graham said at the ceremony while pledging to provide 20 more armored vehicles to the organization. 'The MDA team are heroes, saving lives every day, and it is an honor to stand with them.' Samaritan’s Purse also supports Israel’s northern region by helping to establish a second dispatch center in Shlomi. So far, the organization has provided or committed to 42 rescue vehicles, including 28 armored ambulances and two dispatch stations. Fourteen of these ambulances are already in service, donated by the organization in January to replenish the fleet after Hamas targeted and destroyed rescue vehicles during the October attack. Additionally, Samaritan’s Purse has sent 1,000 trauma supply kits to Israel, packed with essential medical equipment such as chest tubes, sutures, intubation kits, and combat tourniquets. These supplies have been strategically placed with MDA first responders. 'The generosity of Reverend Franklin Graham and Samaritan’s Purse knows no bounds,' said MDA Director-General Eli Bin. 'The entire people of Israel are indebted to this great man and his organization.'

Terrorists who took part in the October 7 massacre eliminated	The IDF and the Shin Bet announced that warplanes, under the direction of the Shin Bet and the 215th Fire Brigade, killed in targeted strikes the commander of the Nukhba Force in Hamas, as well as a terrorist who took part in the October 7 attack. They were operating inside a command and control center embedded inside a compound that previously served as the 'al-Faluja' School in the northern Gaza Strip. The command and control center was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel. In addition, in the last day the forces of Division 162 killed about 15 terrorists in the Rafah area. It was also reported that the Air Force attacked in Rafah the terrorist Suleiman Jawad Suleiman Abu Lafi, who according to the IDF promoted transfers of IDF to the Gaza Strip and directed forces from Gaza to carry out attacks in the Gaza Strip. In the same attack, his brother Abdullah Abu Lafi, the islamic Jihadist terrorist, was also killed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjbet6gac	2024-09-26T05:04:37-07:00	
Shin Bet thwarts attack on Israelis visiting tombs of sages in no...	Basel Abahra, 23, from the Galilee village of Arraba, planned a coordinated shooting and explosives assault against Israeli pilgrims visiting the graves of revered figures; 'Particularly serious as they were to be carried out by Israeli citizens during wartime,' says Shin Bet official The Shin Bet and Israel Police announced Thursday they had thwarted a planned bombing and shooting attack orchestrated by a young man from the Galilee, with assistance from illegal Palestinian residents. In addition to this young man, two minors were also arrested, and indictments have been filed against all three. In a coordinated operation by the Shin Bet and the Northern District Police's Central Unit, 23-year-old Basel Abahra from Arraba in the Galilee was taken into custody on August 12. His interrogation revealed a plan for a combined attack involving explosives, followed by a shooting targeting Jews visiting the graves of Jewish sages in the Galilee region. In the months leading up to his arrest, Abahra sought help from Palestinians with expertise in explosives, who were staying in Israel without permits, to prepare the explosive devices while he conducted reconnaissance on potential targets. He also recruited two teenagers into the military cell he established; they were subsequently arrested and interrogated by the Shin Bet and the Northern District Police's Central Unit. The investigation led to the seizure of communication devices, a military vest and dual-use materials intended for making explosives. The cell's activities were disrupted in the early stages before they were ready to execute the attack. Additionally, Abahra's interrogation revealed that, at the start of the Gaza war, he had thrown Molotov cocktails at an access road near the community of Avtalyon, close to his home. On Sunday, the Haifa District Attorney's Office, represented by attorney Shikma Nachmias, filed an indictment against Abahra and the two involved minors, charging them with preparing an act of terror and manufacturing weapons. 'The aforementioned acts of terrorism are particularly serious as they were carried out by Israeli citizens during wartime,' the Shin Bet and the police said in a statement. 'We view any involvement of Israeli citizens in activities that endanger the security of the state and its citizens with great severity. We will continue to act within the authority granted to us by law and employ the measures available to us to thwart threats in a focused manner.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1en46ga0	2024-09-26T04:54:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/rJFmGnMRA/rJFmGnMRA_0_111_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu clarifies: 'Report of cease-fire incorrect; directed ID...	The IDF is attacking deep deep in Lebanon after massive rocket barrage to Acre; Prime Minister's Office responds to report that cease-fire in north expected 'in coming hours': 'We haven't reponded' After hours of silence, the Prime Minister's Office reacted to the proposal made by the United States and France for a 21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, and says that the Prime Minister 'as not even responded' to it. This announcement came after government ministers and residents and council heads in the north lashed out following news of an apparent imminent cease-fire. Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who is filling in for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he travels to the United States to address the UN General Assembly, wrote: 'There will be no cease-fire in the north. We will continue to fight against the terrorist organization Hezbollah with all our might until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' More than three hours after the report, and while Netanyahu was on the 'Wing of Zion' plane, a message was delivered from his office stating that 'The report about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal that the Prime Minister has not even responded to.' 'The report about the purported directive to ease up on the fighting in the north is the opposite of the truth,' the PMO also said in a message that was also posted on the prime minister's social media accounts. 'The Prime Minister has directed the IDF to continue fighting with full force, according to the plan that was presented to him. The fighting in Gaza will also continue until all the objectives of the war have been achieved.' The IDF, meanwhile, continued its attacks. An official announcement on Thursday morning from the IDF spokesman said that overnight the Israeli Air Force, directed by IDF intelligence, struck approximately 75 terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the area of Bekaa and in southern Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities, ready-to-fire launchers, terrorists and terrorist infrastructure. At noon there were reports of attacks in Tzur, an attack on a vehicle in the village of Shoba, and fighter jets breaking the sound barrier over various areas in Lebanon, including over Beirut. At noon, there were also reports of an attack deep in the country, in Ba-Lava, north of Baalbek. Rocket alert sirens were heard in the Acre area at about 10:45 a.m., the first rockets to be fired in more than 12 hours. Some 45 rockets were launched in the heavy barrage, and dramatic footage shows a sequence of falls in the sea off the coast of Acre. Following the attack residents of the northern Golan, Upper Galilee and Krayot-Haifa Bay were ordered by the IDF Homefront Command to stay near protected areas. On Thursday morning an Israeli source told CNN that the talks regarding a potential temporary cease-fire with Hezbollah were the main reason for Netanyahu's flight to New York. He noted that the message in the briefings from Israel the previous day were that 'Israel prefers a diplomatic solution.' The spokesman for Qatar's Foreign Ministry, Majed Al-Ansari, said at the same time that 'there is still no official mediation path that works for a cease-fire in Lebanon. We are not aware of a direct connection between the proposal for a 21-day cease-fire in Lebanon and the proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1qw52ma0	2024-09-26T04:07:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/S1Rp1hzRC/S1Rp1hzRC_0_278_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
New York City mayor indicted in foreign bribery scandal, refuses ...	Eric Adams faces historic indictment for alleged ties to foreign entities from Turkey, China, Qatar and possible illegal donations from Israel; Adams denies accusations and refuses to step down; progressive Netanyahu critic could replace him New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on corruption charges by a federal grand jury, U.S. media reported late Wednesday. The specific details of the indictment have not yet been disclosed and may be revealed during a court hearing on Thursday. The charges come after a year-long investigation into allegations of corruption and ties to foreign entities, including Israel. The indictment has sent shockwaves through the city’s political landscape, as Adams becomes the first sitting mayor in New York’s history to face criminal charges while in office. Despite mounting calls for his resignation, including from within his own Democratic Party, Adams has refused to step down, asserting his innocence. In a video statement following news of the indictment, Adams described the accusations as 'entirely false, based on lies.' He added, 'I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit.' Adams also accused investigators of leaking details about the probe in an attempt to damage his credibility. The federal investigation that led to the indictment has focused on serious allegations of corruption and bribery involving foreign actors. Suspicions about Adams and his top aides first emerged last November, days after federal agents raided the home of his chief fundraiser, Brianna Suggs, seizing electronic devices. Shortly afterward, Adams’ own phone and iPad were confiscated as he left an event in Manhattan. In recent months, four parallel investigations have been conducted, with some focusing on Adams’ ties to foreign donors, particularly from Turkey. Allegations include campaign finance violations, bribery and potential undue influence in securing expedited approvals for the construction of a new Turkish consulate building in exchange for perks like first-class Turkish Airlines flights. Meanwhile, the FBI is also examining the possibility of illegal campaign contributions from Israel during Adams' 2021 mayoral run, as well as prohibited connections with other foreign governments, including China, Qatar, South Korea and Uzbekistan. AOC joins the resignation choir Federal investigations into New York City’s government reached a climax earlier this month when the FBI seized mobile phones belonging to top city officials, including Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright and Schools Chancellor David Banks, who resigned Wednesday. Banks’ resignation follows a series of high-profile departures linked to the ongoing investigations, further intensifying pressure on Mayor Adams to step down. Lisa Zornberg, the city’s chief legal counsel and a key member of Adams’ inner circle, also resigned. Another dramatic departure was that of NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban, who stepped down after being questioned by the FBI over his twin brother’s involvement in nightclub businesses. Under state law, Adams is not required to resign even while facing serious criminal charges. The only official who could potentially remove him from office is New York Governor Kathy Hochul. However, sources in her office suggest that she is unlikely to turn against Adams, a close ally. A source close to Hochul’s office told Ynet that the situation is 'not like the Biden-Pelosi' dynamic, referencing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s pressure on President Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race. They indicated that similar pressure is not expected from Hochul on Adams. However, Hochul’s office described the reports of Adams’ indictment as 'concerning' and said that the governor is monitoring the situation closely while holding off further comment until the matter is confirmed by law enforcement. Adams, 64, was elected mayor of New York City in 2021 and took office in January 2022, becoming the city’s second Black mayor. He entered politics after serving 22 years as an officer in the NYPD. Over the past year, his popularity has declined, despite improvements in certain crime statistics and a drop in unemployment. The city has struggled to manage a massive influx of tens of thousands of migrants overwhelming homeless shelters, and the corruption scandals have fueled calls for his resignation. Shortly before news of the indictment broke, progressive lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined those calling for Adams to step down. She argued that the 'flood' of resignations in the city administration threatens its ability to function effectively and that the investigations would make it difficult for Adams to attract qualified individuals for key positions. 'For the good of the city, he should resign,' she said. Accused Netanyahu of 'war crimes': Adam's apparent successor Adams has been a vocal supporter of Israel, especially after the October 7 terror attacks. If he is forced to step down, the city's public advocate, Jumaane Williams, would assume the role temporarily. Williams, a progressive Democrat from Brooklyn, has been far more critical of Israel. Williams has frequently criticized Adams, accusing him of being overly supportive of Israel and condemning his refusal to call for a cease-fire in Gaza. He has also been outspoken against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, questioning why Netanyahu was given a platform to speak before Congress in July, despite what Williams described as 'international war crimes and human rights violations.' A shift in the city's leadership could directly impact Israeli interests in New York, raising concerns among the city’s large Jewish community as well as diplomatic and advocacy groups. Adams was scheduled to host world leaders, including Netanyahu, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Thursday evening during the United Nations General Assembly. However, following the news of the indictment, his participation in the event has been canceled. Despite refusing to resign, Adams is likely to face increasing public pressure in the coming days. While Governor Hochul is unlikely to remove her long-time ally from office, many speculate that Adams may eventually opt to leave Gracie Mansion on his own terms. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ly7hgr0	2024-09-26T03:58:45-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/06/22/BJZCc11SJ3O/BJZCc11SJ3O_0_80_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

On Thursday morning, Israeli Air Force fighter jets, directed by IDF intelligence, continued to strike Hezbollah terror targets in several areas in southern Lebanon. Among the targets struck were Hezbollah military sites, terrorists and weapons storage facilities. In the area of Kfarchouba in southern Lebanon, the IAF struck a number of terrorists who were identified in the area. 'The IDF is continuing to operate to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure,' it said in a statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1s3j5grc	2024-09-26T01:32:15-07:00	
Residents of north say cease-fire is gift to Hezbollah	Local leaders up north say they won't accept insufficient agreements with Hezbollah before returning home, demanding decisive action from Netanyahu's government and commending the IDF for recent successes; This comes amid rumors that a cease-fire agreement could materialize by the end of the day Amid Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approval to hold talks with the U.S. about a temporary halt to strikes in Lebanon for cease-fire negotiations, northern border community leaders are expressing concern. They refuse to accept any 'exit points' for Hezbollah that might allow the terror organization to regroup. Instead, they have put their hopes on IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, who has stated that the IDF is ready to enter Lebanon to dismantle terrorist infrastructure, a fundamental condition for ensuring the safe return of northern residents. Hezbollah rockets strikes have damaged over half of the homes in Metula. Despite military assurances, Metula Mayor David Azoulay remains troubled by statements from 'political sources' in Netanyahu's office. 'I sincerely hope the Israeli government isn't stepping back again but continues to move forward,' he said. 'We've experienced this after the Majdal Shams event, the preemptive attack on Tel Aviv, and other instances where the military launched a strong operation only to return to a containment policy. We're tired of this policy and the expectation of retaliation every time we strike.' Azoulay emphasized that, post-October 7, Israel's deterrence has been significantly eroded, and now is the time to restore it. 'Deterrence isn't regained through a single operation but through sustained efforts to sever Iran's proxy arm in Lebanon completely. We won't tolerate a cycle of forward and backward steps anymore; we demand consistent progress,' he said. In both the security and political arenas, it's understood that the northern conflict will eventually conclude with a settlement with Hezbollah. The key question is what position of strength Israel will bring to these discussions and how proactive it will be in achieving an agreement before international demands to halt the conflict arise. 'We must persist without pause, advancing daily until Hezbollah says 'enough.' I believe international pressure from Americans, French, and Europeans will lead to an agreement, but it must be robust. It shouldn't rely on (UN Resolution) 1701 and must be enforced by the IDF, with every violation addressed. I doubt we've already hit 50% of Hezbollah's capabilities; maybe only 30%,' Azoulay added. On Tuesday, the IDF Chief of Staff announced that the offensive in Lebanon would be named Northern Arrows. The announcement of this as 'another operation' worried many, including local leaders, fearing the military isn't aiming for a comprehensive campaign. IDF sources clarified that the operation is part of the broader campaign to restore security to the north, but noted that all aspects depend on political decisions and guidance. Avichai Stern, mayor of Kiryat Shmona, noted that after a year of attrition and displacement residents demand a war to bring them home. 'In 2006, it was a war, and they didn't finish the job. Certainly, an 'operation' with some made-up name won't do the job. We pay the price, and from the IDF, we expect just one operation for the holidays – Operation 'One Plus One' – Gaza plus Lebanon or Nasrallah plus Sinwar.' On Tuesday, in a rocket barrage on Kiryat Shmona, Hezbollah launched about 50 missiles, causing direct hits and significant damage to residential homes and municipal emergency facilities. Stern said that, in the past two weeks, 'the IDF has operated brilliantly, and we express gratitude and appreciation. The army has demonstrated its capability to surprise, initiate, destroy, and strike – these capabilities must continue in the war.' With the mobilization of two reserve combat brigades in anticipation of expanding the conflict and the recent deployment of numerous artillery units, the possibility of a ground invasion seems real. However, northern leaders aren't rushing to demand it just yet. Azoulay noted that he doesn't believe it's time for a ground operation in southern Lebanon. 'Once the Dahiyeh district falls, Nasrallah will capitulate. We should also target their airport in Beirut and power station; the Lebanese government should pay for this. Why aren't we destroying their drug fields? Brute force is the only language they understand.' 'If Hezbollah agrees to cease-fire now, it will undoubtedly end in certain massacre' Meanwhile, the Fighting for the North organization headquarters contacted Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, warning that residents won't settle for mere declarations of 'restoring security' or 'a sense of security.' The headquarters, which includes hundreds of evacuated families from the north, expressed appreciation for the IDF's actions against Hezbollah, alongside the decision to include the northern campaign in the military's war objectives, but stated that isolated operational moves are insufficient. 'We are more apprehensive than ever that soon we'll be told to return home after Israel reaches international understandings regarding the northern front,' they wrote. 'We declare that if the war is stopped prematurely, without a ground incursion and clearing the area, restoring security to the north, we will not return.' Rafael Slav, a leader of the headquarters, told Ynet: 'I see various former generals discussing the possibility of giving Hezbollah an 'exit point,' as if our lives are their investment portfolios. If Hezbollah agrees to a cease-fire now, before all its capabilities are destroyed, it will certainly end in a massacre as soon as they are able to execute it.' He added: 'We must not seek escalation to reach an agreement. We cannot return to our homes without an absolute buffer zone devoid of residents, certainly without Hezbollah.' Lobby 1701 stated: 'In the past week, the IDF has been attacking Lebanon with strength and sophistication. The government has finally made the return of residents home a part of the war objectives. But, as usual, when the enemy suffers, they run to plead with the French and Americans, who in turn pressure for a resolution. We've seen this scenario before. It won't happen again. We hear voices in television news studios starting to calculate whether the war is economically worthwhile, instead of asking how to repopulate the Galilee. This opportunity to continue striking the enemy must not be missed. There are no more pagers. Tens of thousands of northern residents have been evacuated from their homes for a year, and tens of thousands more live in a war zone, with hundreds of thousands joining this week. This must not be in vain. We must not return to October 6. We must not stop.' Meanwhile, Minister for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev and the Galilee Yitzhak Wasserlauf, of the Otzma Yehudit party, posted on his X account: 'Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister, I am now in the north. Another long day with the incredible and dedicated local leaders here. Just today I sat with sixteen of them. and I am informing you about their consensus: without a significant military decision against Hezbollah there is no point in discussing the return of northern residents to their homes. No one believes in agreements with terror. The State of Israel has learned this the hard way. Northern residents will no longer live under Hezbollah's sights. Now is the opportunity to vanquish Hezbollah.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjvhyfzrr	2024-09-26T01:28:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/rklzz4FbCC/rklzz4FbCC_0_214_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Moroccan immigrant, previously slated for deportation, murders 19...	The body of a 19-year-old student was located in the woods near her dorm and, following a manhunt, the suspect was apprehended in Switzerland, a Moroccan immigrant with a previous rape charge on his record, Incident has sparked debate in France about immigration and enforcement policy In response to the murder of a 19-year-old student, allegedly by a Moroccan immigrant slated for deportation, France's new right-wing Interior Minister has vowed decisive state action. The suspect, who reportedly abandoned the victim's body in a forest before fleeing to Switzerland, has been apprehended. Previously convicted of rape, the immigrant recently faced a deportation order from French authorities. The French media has identified the student only by her first name, Philippine. Her murder has ignited public outrage, intensifying pressure on the newly formed government and fueling demands for stricter immigration controls. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau described the crime as 'heinous' and committed to strengthening legislation to expedite the deportation of foreigners convicted of crimes. EU data shows France leads in expelling non-European nationals among member states, yet the sheer volume of deportation orders challenges enforcement. Addressing political leaders, Retailleau emphasized the need to enhance legal measures to safeguard France, advocating for legislative changes if necessary. Philippine was last seen on Friday at Paris-Dauphine University in the capital's western region. Her body was discovered on Saturday in a nearby forest. Witnesses reported seeing a man with a shovel. The 22-year-old Moroccan suspect was captured in Geneva and extradited to France. French prosecutors revealed the suspect was convicted in 2021 for a rape committed as a minor two years earlier. After serving his sentence, he was placed in administrative detention. A judge ordered his release in early September, conditional on regular contact with authorities and residency at a designated hostel. Days before the murder, he violated these conditions and went missing, prompting the state to issue a deportation order. The student's murder has sparked widespread debate in France, with politicians from both the far-right and the left urging a review of immigration policies. Former President François Hollande, representing the left, called for swift enforcement of deportation orders. Jordan Bardella, leader of the far-right National Rally party, said that 'Philippine's life was taken by a Moroccan immigrant under a deportation order.' Bardella's party, alongside Marine Le Pen's, holds the largest parliamentary presence but has yet to form a government. Bardella criticized the judicial system as weak and the state as dysfunctional, accusing leaders of placing French citizens in peril. He urged the government to take action, warning of the growing anger among perceived enemies. To facilitate the establishment of a right-wing government while maintaining political influence, Le Pen's National Rally party has opted to 'tactically support' Michel Barnier's new administration. They cautioned that the government's fate hinges on their support, reserving the right to withdraw if immigration and other critical issues are not adequately addressed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvl7ofr0	2024-09-25T23:58:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/r1p7ScbC0/r1p7ScbC0_0_129_981_553_0_small.jpg

Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire expected 'in coming hours'	Despite Israeli insistence that strikes on Lebanon will continue, report in Sky News says 21-day cease-fire set to take effect soon; Prime minister's office has not responded to report Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during security consultation that preceded the cabinet meeting late Wednesday night that 'negotiations will only be under fire,' but Thursday morning Sky News reported citing senior officials in the Biden administration that the cease-fire with Hezbollah is expected to come into effect in the coming hours. The Prime Minister is currently flying to New York, where he will speak at the United Nations on Friday, and his office has yet to respond to the report. The U.S. officials indicated that the ceasefire will last 21 days, as called for overnight in a statement by U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, which was also joined by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. As of 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, no rocket alert sirens were heard in the north. The IDF, meanwhile, continued its attacks in Lebanon. 'During these 21 days, the parties will hold negotiations. We hope for a solution that will return the citizens of both countries to their homes,' a U.S. official said. He added that 'the agreement will only be valid in Lebanon, but it will also buy time for negotiations with Hamas in Gaza. A diplomatic solution can be achieved.' The report led to stormy reactions in the political system. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that 'the campaign in the north should end in one scenario - crushing Hezbollah and denying its ability to harm the residents of the north. We must not give time to the enemy to recover from the severe blows it has received and to reorganize for the continuation of the war after 21 days. Surrender of Hezbollah or war, this is the only way we will restore the residents and security to the north and the country.' Minister Orit Struck also attacked: 'There is no moral mandate for a cease-fire. Neither for 21 days nor for 21 hours. Hezbollah turned Lebanon into a barrel of explosives. UN Resolution 1701 turned the residents of the north into hostages, and exiles in their own country. We do not repeat past mistakes. We won't stop until it is fixed.' Minister of Culture and Sports Miki Zohar added that 'the cease-fire without any significant return on the part of Hezbollah is a serious error that endangers Israel's major security achievements in recent days. I really hope that the reports are not true, we must continue with all our might until a clear decision is made in the north.' Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said: 'So now suddenly the world is pushing for a cease-fire with Hezbollah. It just doesn't work that way. Israel reacted very late and began to gradually destroy Hezbollah. So suddenly, the world decides that now is the time for a cease-fire? Israel must remove Hezbollah as a threat to our families. If Hezbollah wants the fire to stop, let it disarm and move 15 km away from the Israeli border.' In contrast to these words, opposition leader Yair Lapid said that Israel 'should announce this morning that it accepts the Biden-Macron cease-fire proposal, but only for seven days, in order not to allow Hezbollah to restore its command and control systems. We will not accept any proposal that does not include removing Hezbollah from our northern border.' U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement overnight between Wednesday and Thursday calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah. ''It is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes,' the statement reads. 'We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.' Senior White House officials hinted that Israel and Lebanon were familiar with the agreement, and even endorse it. A senior White House official said that the statement was coordinated with the Israeli and Lebanese governments and that they could endorse it in the coming hours. 'This is a breakthrough, we will try to use the time to make achievements on all fronts, including Gaza.,' he said. The official added that 21 days is a long enough period to allow practical contacts to reach a 'very complex agreement. It's not some magic formula, but we thought it fit. We have held talks in recent months and we hope to use these 21 days to reach a permanent agreement that will allow citizens to return to their homes, that is the goal.' The cease-fire will be along the blue line dividing Lebanon from Israel approved by the UN in 2000 for the purpose of determining whether Israel had fully withdrawn from Lebanon; During the cease-fire the parties would discuss a comprehensive agreement that will allow civilians to return to their homes in both Israel and Lebanon, according to the official. 'This is a great effort that has been made during the last 48 hours. The president and his advisers have dealt with this with countries around the world. Lebanon and Israel have worked tirelessly to reach this moment and we value their cooperation,' according to the official. U.S. officials said Hezbollah would not be a signatory to the cease-fire but believed the Lebanese government would coordinate its acceptance with the group, and that once it is approved by LEbanon it would be understood that Hezbollah is involved. They said they expected Israel to 'welcome' the proposal and perhaps formally accept it when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the General Assembly on Friday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk88cum00	2024-09-25T23:42:55-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/SyvoiuRT0/SyvoiuRT0_242_386_2753_1549_0_small.jpg

Hamas to cede civilian control of Gaza to Palestinian Authority, ...	A day after PA prime minister said that the PA would manage Gaza after the war with the participation of 'everyone,' a Hamas official said that the terrorist organization had reached an agreement with Fatah; They are expected to meet next week, in Cairo Hamas may have just given up civilian control in the Gaza Strip. Almost a year after the October 7 massacre and the outbreak of war, a Hamas official told the Saudi network Al-Hadath on Thursday that the terrorist organization that controls Gaza has reached an agreement that would make the Fatah party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas responsible for the civil management of the Strip, and the crossings. According to the same source, these will not be under the supervision of Hamas. The meeting between Fatah and Hamas leaders where this agreement is supposed to be signed is expected to take place next week. On Wednesday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa said that this meeting is expected to take place in Cairo, noting that the PA will manage the Gaza Strip after the war with the participation of 'everyone.' The previous meetings between the Palestinian factions were held in China, and ended with the Beijing Declaration on July 23, in which it was agreed to reach 'total national unity,' including all the forces within the PLO, and to form a temporary national consensus. A senior official in the Palestinian Authority responded to the report and downplayed the possibility of an agreement. He told Ynet that 'the PA manages civil affairs in the Gaza Strip anyway - education, health, the water and energy authority. For Hamas, this is a headache, so it will hand it over to the PA in order to continue to control security and military. Hamas understands that Israel will not give up control of the crossings from a security point of view, so it will let the PA face Israel. We will wait and see what happens at the meeting in Cairo, but there are not too many expectations for an agreement.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byb3fofra	2024-09-25T23:17:10-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/27/ryrSJfEiUA/ryrSJfEiUA_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

U.S. and France issue a statement, joined by several other countries, calling for stop to hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah ' to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement'; Calls on parties to 'endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately' U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement overnight between Wednesday and Thursday calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah. ''It is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes,' the statement reads. 'We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.' Senior White House officials hinted that Israel and Lebanon were familiar with the agreement, and even endorse it. As of 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, no rocket alert sirens were heard in the north. The IDF, meanwhile, continued its attacks in Lebanon. 'The exchange of fire since October 7th, and in particular over the past two weeks, threatens a much broader conflict, and harm to civilians,' the statement continues. 'We therefore have worked together in recent days on a joint call for a temporary ceasefire to give diplomacy a chance to succeed and avoid further escalations across the border.' The statement is endorsed by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. 'The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023 is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation. This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon,' according to a statement signed by all of the countries. 'It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety. Diplomacy however cannot succeed amid an escalation of this conflict. 'Thus we call for an immediate 21 day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement consistent with UNSCR 1701, and the implementation of UNSCR 2735 regarding a cease-fire in Gaza,' according to the statement. It concludes: 'We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately consistent with UNSCR 1701 during this period, and to give a real chance to a diplomatic settlement. We are then prepared to fully support all diplomatic efforts to conclude an agreement between Lebanon and Israel within this period, building on efforts over the last months, that ends this crisis altogether.'

The White House said Wednesday night even before the joint statement, that Biden and Macron talked on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York about efforts to reach a cease-fire in Lebanon to avoid a wider regional war. The joint statement comes after Israel's political-security cabinet convened Wednesday night for about four hours at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv, against the backdrop of the possibility that the IDF will soon enter into a ground war in Lebanon as part of the Northern Arrows operation . After the discussion ended, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to the United States where he will speak At the UN General Assembly in New York without providing a statement before take off. The Pentagon said that it does not appear that the entry of IDF forces into Lebanon is likely to happen immediately despite the messages coming out of the IDF, and the Wall Street Journal cited sources familiar with the matter as saying that the IDF is not yet in a position to carry out a ground operation until it moves more soldiers to the north, but that the Pentagon believes that an Israeli ground operation could happen in the coming days. The IDF announced Wednesday afternoon that it will mobilize two reserve brigades of combined infantry and tanks for operational missions in the north. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1spjvgcc	2024-09-25T22:00:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/08/BJeiD7ezrA/BJeiD7ezrA_1_80_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Haredi draft dodgers on collision course with IDF, face possible ...	In a first, Haredi youth who refuse to report for IDF enlistment after receiving a personalized draft order will face sanctions, which could result in jail time; IDF spokesperson: 'Those who do not report are committing an offense of absence without leave' Young ultra-Orthodox men in Israel who failed to respond to military draft orders were issued warning calls on Wednesday. These calls informed them that they must report to recruitment offices within 48 hours or face potential arrest warrants. This marks a shift as the military now considers employing sanctions and legal measures against those who do not comply. An ultra-Orthodox worker who received an exemption due to his limited weekly yeshiva study hours, shared his experience with Ynet. 'I was contacted by the Haredi administration, and they informed me of two orders I had missed. I told them that, just as they have a commander who instructs them, my commander is the rabbi, and he advised me not to enlist. They insisted I report within 48 hours or face an arrest warrant,' he said. Another young man, Yair, explained: 'I received a call from the army's Haredi administration, telling me I have 48 hours to report, or legal proceedings will be initiated against me.' He expressed his frustration, over the incident. 'The ultra-Orthodox members of the Knesset are not assisting us, nor is the Yeshiva Committee providing any answers,' he said. In an attempt to broaden recruitment, the IDF has issued over 1,000 initial draft orders to young ultra-Orthodox men in recent months, yet only about 70 have reported to recruitment offices. Brigadier General Shay Tayeb, head of the IDF's Planning and Manpower Directorate, addressed the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee recently, acknowledging the low turnout following the initial orders. 'Those who did not respond to the first order have received a second. We also make phone calls to clarify that they can report at a more convenient date without demonstrations. If any do not report, the process will continue, and we expect the numbers to rise.' According to the law, failing to respond to a second order results in a third warning, followed by potential economic sanctions, arrests, and travel restrictions. Rabbi Moshe Hillel Hirsch, a prominent figure in the Degel HaTorah party, met with heads of ultra-Orthodox high schools this week. 'If yeshiva students who received orders are arrested, I will come to support them in prison.' Rabbi Dov Landau, leader of the Lithuanian stream, also announced his support for those who do not enlist, even if they face arrest. 'Judicial authorities have declared war against the Torah world and are forcing the army to issue draft orders to yeshiva students. We publicly declare that under no circumstances should anyone report to the recruitment offices, and we stand with these yeshiva students and their families during this trial. We are with you, heroes of valor,' he said. The IDF spokesperson's unit responded. 'Those designated for security service who were summoned for recruitment and did not report are committing an offense of absence without leave, will be declared draft dodgers, and are subject to enforcement proceedings according to the law.' It is important to note that as part of the enforcement process, a draftee may be arrested, and their departure from the country could be delayed,' the unit said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skvl02wrc	2024-09-25T15:39:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/04/17/Bkw3g005Gh/Bkw3g005Gh_0_182_1024_577_0_small.jpg

This is the missile Hezbollah used to target Tel Aviv area	Hezbollah's Qader 1 missile, with a 118-mile range and 1,100-lbs. warhead, was intercepted by Israel's David's Sling system; The launch triggered sirens across central Israeli cities; 'Hezbollah attempted to send a message' Hezbollah has unveiled a video showcasing the features of the Qader 1 surface -to-surface ballistic missile – the first of its kind to be launched from Lebanese soil toward central Israeli cities. The David's Sling aerial defense system intercepted the missile, resulting in no casualties or damage. According to the Shiite terrorist organization in its video released on Wednesday evening, this surface-to-surface missile boasts a range of 118 miles. The missile's total weight is 2.87 tons, with a warhead weighing 1,100 lbs. Hezbollah claims that it is a tactical ballistic missile with high destructive capability, capable of maneuvering mid-flight and striking targets with precision. At 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday, sirens echoed through Tel Aviv, Glilot, Ramat Gan, Netanya and other central Israeli cities. Shortly after, the missile launched from Lebanon was intercepted. About half an hour following the launch, the Home Front Command confirmed there were no changes in directives for the center o9f the country, and schools in areas where sirens sounded would operate as usual. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the launch, stating in their announcement that a Qader 1 ballistic missile was fired at the Mossad headquarters – the site allegedly responsible for the explosion of Hezbollah beepers and communication devices, as well as the elimination of senior terror organization members. The Saudi television channel Al-Hadath reported, based on its sources, that 'Hezbollah attempted to send a message by launching a single ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. The launch occurred simultaneously with an attack on October 7,' meaning at 6:29 a.m. Residents of Netanya have grown accustomed to a life without sirens. The last time an alert was activated in the city was during Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. However, on Wednesday morning, residents were startled by sirens echoing through the city, waking many at an early hour. 'I woke up in a panic and ran with the kids to the shelter,' shared Michal Nechmani, a resident of the city's southern neighborhoods. 'Since the war started, we haven’t had a siren, so we were calm, thinking it wouldn’t reach us. People always joked that Hamas and Hezbollah are afraid of people in Netanya. This morning we realized that’s not the case. There were moments of fear, but we quickly understood there were no casualties, and they were holding school – so we returned to our routine.' Meanwhile, social media platforms were flooded with posts and humorous remarks. 'The Netanya municipality has asked residents not to get involved. This is between the IDF and Hezbollah,' read one post. 'I don't understand where Nasrallah got the nerve to shoot at Netanya,' another post quipped, along with a sarcastic message to criminal elements: 'So, what are we paying you such high protection fees for?' Also on Wednesday, Iran-backed militias in Iraq, operating under the moniker Islamic Resistance in Iraq, published footage of the launch of the two UAVs aimed at Eilat. One of them exploded in the city's port, causing minor injuries to two residents, and the other was intercepted by the Israeli Navy in the skies over the Red Sea. According to sources identified with the militias, the UAVs that were launched are of the Iranian model Shahed 131, a model that is also used by Russia in its attacks on Ukraine. According to reports, this is an attack UAV manufactured by Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Its weight reaches 135 kg, its length is 2.6 meters and its wingspan is 2.2 meters. The warhead of the UAV weighs 15 kg, and it is claimed that it can reach ranges of 900 to 1,000 km. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry3cgzgra	2024-09-25T15:17:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/Bk1LN1zRC/Bk1LN1zRC_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Mitch McConnell claim that the Biden administration is delaying the transfer to Israel of bunker-buster bombs that are used to attack Hamas and Hezbollah tunnels, as well as Apache helicopters and D9 bulldozers. In the letter they sent to Biden, they said they 'strongly condemn the ongoing delay' on the part of the Biden administration in supplying critical military equipment and weapons to Israel, 'in the midst of an existential war.' They added: 'Delays in equipment that Israel requires to win its multi-front war against Iran's terrorist proxies, plus statements by senior administration officials accusing Israel of escalation, undermine Israel's efforts to restore deterrence by encouraging Iranian-backed terrorists.'

Terror groups intensify efforts to target Israelis, Jews travelin...	National Security Council warns that elevated motivation and 'atmosphere of hatred' across the globe significantly increases the risk of attacks by lone-wolf assailants or organized terror cells targeting Israelis or Jews around the world The National Security Council (NSC) issued on Wednesday a public update on terror threats targeting Israelis and Jews traveling abroad ahead of upcoming High Holiday season, warning of heightened efforts to harm Israelis or Jews on October 7, marking the anniversary of Hamas’ deadly terror attack. 'We expect October 7, 2024, (the one-year anniversary of the Swords of Iron War) to be a significant date for terrorist organizations (and in particular Hamas and Global Jihad factions). Around that time, efforts to carry out attacks against Israeli/Jewish targets abroad are expected to intensify, both in planned attacks and in local initiatives or lone-wolf attacks.,' the NCS said in a statement. The NSC noted a sharp rise in motivation and attempts by terror groups to target Israeli or Jewish sites worldwide since October 7, 2023, citing a series of recent attacks and attempted attacks over the past year, as well as numerous threats of revenge from Iran. The statement also emphasized that the Sinai Peninsula remains a high-risk area due to its popularity among Israeli tourists, despite the significant terror threat there. The NSC reiterated that a Level 4 travel advisory remains in effect for Sinai, warning against any travel to the region. The NSC highlighted the elevated motivation of various terror groups (including Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and global jihadist factions) alongside the growing 'atmosphere of hatred' against Israelis and Jews due to the ongoing war. This, they noted, significantly increases the risk of attacks by lone-wolf assailants or organized terror cells targeting Israelis or Jews abroad. The NSC issued the following recommendations: 'We wish to emphasize the dangers of sharing or posting on social media (Facebook, Telegram, WhatsApp, TikTok, etc.) anything that could identify you as being a member of or active in Israel's security forces (be it regular service, standing army or as a reservist). Sharing any such information increases the risk that the person who shared it or is depicted in it will be marked as a target for attack.' 'We also wish to underscore the possible danger of being lured and kidnapped. We ask that you be wary of anyone unfamiliar who tries to make any type of contact with you, especially online and for those who do most of their business abroad. We stress the importance of refraining from travel to the following countries, in light of the real life-threatening danger facing Israelis in these places: Iraq (including the Kurdish region), Yemen, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia (restricted by law), Bangladesh, Somalia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya, Algeria, Jordan, Egypt (including the Sinai Peninsula) and Turkey. 'To clarify, if you are concerned that you have been exposed to a terrorist threat while abroad, you must first inform the local security forces in the country where you are staying and then contact the NSC's Travel Warning 24/7 hotline, at +972-2-6667444.' 'For updates or if you have questions relating to terrorist threats against Israelis, please contact the NSC's Travel Warning 24/7 hotline, at +972-2-6667444. For other matters, such as health services, consular issues, crimes related to personal security, or antisemitism, please contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 24/7 hotline, at +972-2-5303155.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ggq6bar	2024-09-25T11:47:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/01/16/rJVYvcXYa/rJVYvcXYa_1_174_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Brandeis University president, who banned campus Palestinian grou...	Ronald Liebowitz resigned after a narrow no confidence vote from the university's faculty; He was criticized for 'a consistent pattern of damaging errors of judgment and poor leadership' Brandeis University President Ronald Liebowitz resigned on Wednesday following a narrow no confidence vote from the university's faculty. In a letter addressed to the Brandeis community, Liebowitz confirmed his decision to step down, effective November 1. The faculty vote, passing by a margin of just 10 votes – 159 in favor to 149 against, with 26 abstentions – criticized Liebowitz for 'a consistent pattern of damaging errors of judgment and poor leadership.' Liebowitz, who had earned widespread attention for his staunch opposition to antisemitism following the Hamas attacks of October 7, found himself at the center of growing tensions on campus. His decision to ban the group Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) after the attack drew sharp reactions, with some praising his firm stance, while others accused him of overreach. This controversy, along with ongoing budget shortfalls, layoffs and fundraising struggles, ultimately led to frustration within the university’s faculty and administration. The faculty's resolution cited multiple grievances, including what they described as excessive responses to student protests, mismanagement of the university's financial challenges and indifference toward faculty concerns. A draft of the resolution, published by the Brandeis student newspaper earlier this month, summarized a litany of issues, ranging from budgetary missteps to staff layoffs that had shaken the university community. Liebowitz, in his role as president, had made Brandeis the first private university to ban SJP in the wake of the Hamas attacks. He stood by this decision despite criticism from certain quarters, arguing that free speech should not be a cover for hate speech or extremism. 'SJP was acting as a mouthpiece for Hamas, which has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S.', he explained in February. While Liebowitz’s strong position on antisemitism resonated with many, it unfolded against a backdrop of deeper issues at Brandeis. The university has faced significant financial challenges, including a $2 million budget deficit for the upcoming academic year. Graduate student enrollment has dropped by nearly 25% over the last five years, contributing to a need for budget cuts, including the elimination of 60 staff positions earlier this year. In his resignation email, he expressed 'mixed emotions,' praising Brandeis as 'an exceptional institution' and highlighting the significance of its founding principles, particularly in light of the university’s historical connection to Jewish values and identity. He will assume the role of president emeritus. Board Chair Lisa Kranc, in her message to the Brandeis community, thanked Liebowitz for his leadership and dedication to the university’s Jewish roots. She acknowledged his efforts to elevate these values, writing, 'He has continually reminded us that we are animated by Jewish values and identity, including a reverence for knowledge, a commitment to repairing the world, and openness to all.' While Liebowitz’s departure marks the end of a tumultuous period for Brandeis, Arthur Levine, a former president of Teachers College at Columbia University, will step in as interim president. Whether the new leadership can stabilize the university’s administration and restore harmony remains to be seen. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skuc00t110r	2024-09-25T11:33:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/S1yRBCZC0/S1yRBCZC0_0_0_960_640_0_small.jpg
Drone slams into Eilat port, injuring 2	A second UAV was intercepted by the Israeli Navy; News network with ties to Hezbollah claims militias in Iraq responsible A drone that approached the southern Israeli city of Eilat from the east on Wednesday night slammed into the Eilat port, injuring two people. Police officers and police sappers were working to isolate the scene of the crash. A second drone was intercepted by an Israeli Navy Sa’ar 5 class corvette missile ship, according to the IDF spokesman. Magen David Adom reported that two people sustained minor injuries at the scene, a 68-year-old who was hit by shards of glass, and another young man who was wounded and lightly injured. The Home Front Command confired that 'the incident is over.' The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an association of pro-Iranian militias, claimed responsibility for launching the drone attack against what it called a 'vital target' in Eilat. In addition, the Lebanese Al-Mayadeen news network, that has ties to Hezbollah, cited Iraqi sources as saying that the attack on Eilat was launched by militias in Iraq. In footage from the scene of the UAV impact in the port of Eilat, paniced voices are heard, and the man who took the video shows damage to the windshield of a truck, which was parked next to a building in the port that was also destroyed. 'The windshield flew off, it almost killed us,' he is heard saying. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkbkxrw00	2024-09-25T11:13:34-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/B1tM3Tb00/B1tM3Tb00_0_262_468_264_0_small.jpg

Families of 6 killed hostages send message to the people in power	Relatives of the 6 hostages murdered in a tunnel in Rafah publish an open letter in Time magazine accusing leaders and celebrities around the world of meeting with them, promising to take action – yet ultimately doing nothing The families of the six hostages who Hamas terrorists murdered in a tunnel in Rafah published an open letter in Time magazine on Wednesday, pointing the finger not only at Hamas, who kidnapped their loved ones, but also at others who failed to rescue them. 'On the clear, blue-skied Saturday morning of Oct. 7, 2023, our loved ones and 245 others were brutally stolen from us by Hamas terrorists. Carmel was visiting her parents at Kibbutz Be'eri. Almog, Alexander, Eden, Hersh and Ori had been celebrating peace and freedom at the Nova Music Festival. These six beautiful people were abducted into Gaza, several of them with critical injuries. They languished in miserable conditions for 328 days, then, on Aug. 29, were shot in the head, hands, shoulders and elsewhere in their battered and starving bodies,' it reads. 'Israeli forces found their emaciated corpses two days later in a tunnel 65 feet under a Gazan child's bedroom. The tunnel was just over two feet wide and 5 ft. 6 in. high. It had minimal oxygen, no light and no plumbing. Their Hamas captors executed our loved ones at point blank range, exited the tunnel, and shut a bolted door.' 'In captivity, Alexander, nearly six feet tall, dropped from 190 pounds to 132 pounds. Hersh, a couple inches taller, weighed just 116 pounds. Eden, 5-ft.-5, was found at 79 pounds,' the families wrote in their letter. The parents of the hostasges acknowledged that 'it was Hamas that took our loved ones, tortured them, and pulled the triggers that murdered them. But many others failed to save them. Israeli governmental decision-makers had opportunities to reach negotiated settlements to release our loved ones and, for calculations they deemed strategic, they chose not to. These choices will be the eternal legacy of these men. But there are so many other people who could have done so much more to save them-and still others who will join them as accomplices in avoidable deaths if they stand by and allow malevolent entities to triumph over the passive words of people with power.' They noted that for nearly over 10 months'many of us traveled the world and met politicians, diplomats, business titans, celebrities-people with power. They made promises, nodded, held our hands, cried with us, hugged us tightly...and then failed to deliver results.' They added that: 'Celebrities met us in secluded rooms but asked that we never acknowledge publicly that they did so; they feared losing followers. Leaders of humanitarian aid organizations, including the International Red Cross and the World Health Organization, claimed they would like to intervene but could not figure out how. Two Muslim clerics confidentially assured us, wrongly, that our loved ones would be okay because harming hostages violated Islam; but they and too many other religious leaders were publicly silent. More than one of these many people with power assured us that the hostages would survive, that their return was only a matter of time. Some said our loved ones were suffering but surely not dying.' The families questioned why the world's movers ad shakers have not pressed the cause of the hostages. 'Two hundred fifty-one hostages from 39 nationalities were stolen from their lives and from the world on Oct. 7. Why did the Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Foreign Ministers of those nations never stand, arm in arm, on a global stage and demand their release? Why are the names of the 101 hostages who remain in captivity not on the nightly news in countries around the world? Where is the global outcry calling for their release?' 'This is our clarion call now: There are still 101 hostages in horrific conditions in Gaza, and the time to save them is running out. Sympathetic words alone will not spare them the same fate as Almog, Alexander, Carmel, Eden, Hersh, and Ori. Now is the time for decisive, deliberate, meaningful action,' they wrote. The bodies of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Uri Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov were found in a tunnel in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah. The hostages were murdered by their Hamas captors , after apparently fearing a possible rescue operation by the IDF that was operating in the area. The bodies of the six hostages were found on August 31. An IDF investigation revealed that a day before, Hamas observers had seen soldiers approaching the tunnel, and ordered the terrorists to murder the six hostages. The terrorists shot the six hostages execution-style at close range. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hygtxnwaa	2024-09-25T10:24:37-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/10/BkK8PApnA/BkK8PApnA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu signals willingness to discuss cease-fire deal with Hez...	Several sources have confirmed that behind-the-scenes negotiations are taking place to achieve a cease-fire deal with the Iranian proxy, which the Biden administration is pushing for in time for the November elections; Blinken: 'Israel will have some tough decisions to make' Amid ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, coupled with Northern Command Chief Major General Ori Gordin's threats to launch a ground offensive into Lebanon, international diplomatic efforts are intensifying to de-escalate tensions. The United States is spearheading efforts to lower the flames, although Washington acknowledges the limited influence of the Beirut government over Hezbollah. Concurrently, consultations are underway in Jerusalem to soon decide Israel's next steps in the conflict. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized negotiations, led by himself and Minister Ron Dermer, with the U.S. to consider a temporary cessation of attacks in Lebanon to facilitate cease-fire talks. Since the U.S. does not have direct communication with Hezbollah, negotiations on the opposite side are conducted indirectly through the Lebanese government and European entities, including the French. Simultaneously, Iran is also engaged in attempts to prevent a full-scale war. As an Israeli source noted, 'We are approaching a crossroads of decisions on the war's trajectory.' U.S. initiative links Gaza, Hezbollah conflicts The United States is spearheading a new diplomatic effort to end hostilities in both Gaza and Lebanon, linking the two conflicts as part of a single initiative, six sources familiar with the initiative told Reuters. Details are being hammered out at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, according to two Lebanese officials, two Western diplomats, a source familiar with Hezbollah's thinking and a source briefed on the talks. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during an NBC interview on Wednesday regarding the northern escalation: 'Israel has a real and legitimate problem. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, and what everyone wants is a safe environment where people can simply go home, and children can return to school. That’s what Israel is looking for. The best way to achieve that is not through war, not through escalation.' 'A diplomatic agreement, whereby forces withdraw from the border, creating a safe environment for people to return home, is what we are aiming for. While there is a legitimate issue here, we don’t believe war is the solution. That’s our focus now, including working with many partners here in New York at the UN General Assembly, the Arab world, Europeans, and others. It’s unlikely people will be able to return home if there’s a full-scale war,' Blinken said. When asked whether Israel should have provided the U.S. with advance notice about attempts to assassinate senior figures in Iran or about last week's operations, Blinken responded, 'It's always nice not to be surprised by someone’s actions; it’s certainly preferable.' 'Beyond our efforts to ensure that October 7 never repeats itself, and the attempt to ensure that civilians in Gaza – men, women, and children caught in Hamas’ terrible crossfire – are better protected and receive the help they need, we have also acted to prevent this war from spreading, escalating, and reaching other places. Ensuring that the situation in northern Israel and southern Lebanon does not escalate into a full-scale war is our current focus, and conversely, addressing the issue Israel faces,' he said. Regarding the potential for a cease-fire agreement with Hamas, Blinken remarked: 'We have a draft agreement with 18 paragraphs. Fifteen of those have been agreed upon between Hamas and Israel. However, in recent weeks, Hamas simply has not been at the table, unwilling to engage with the remaining issues, which, if resolved, would finalize the deal. Israel will also have some tough decisions to make in the end, so we need to consider that.' He said that President Joe Biden is determined to finalize the deal before his term ends. 'He knows what he wants to achieve. He is determined to utilize the remaining months as president to reach the finish line. Our message, my message to anyone who perceives the U.S. as weak or indecisive – President Biden is here until January 20. He will use every day to advance the national interest.' Meanwhile, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stated the U.S. is 'very concerned' about reports of Hezbollah launching a missile at the Mossad headquarters this morning. However, Kirby noted Washington's belief that a diplomatic solution could reduce tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border. In a CNN interview, Kirby also highlighted: 'This again proves that Israel faces a legitimate threat from an Iran-backed terrorist organization. The U.S. continues to support Israel's right to defend itself. No nation should have to live with such threats just beyond its border, right next door.' Response in Lebanon In Lebanon, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri noted today that serious efforts are underway with international parties, including Americans, to halt what he terms 'the recent Israeli escalation against Lebanon.' In an interview with the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat published in London, Berri stated that the next 24 hours would determine whether diplomatic efforts have led to a political solution or failed. Berri was asked whether Hezbollah would be willing to separate the Gaza and Lebanon fronts, to which he replied that diplomatic efforts account for the inseparability of these arenas. The Lebanese official explained that those involved in de-escalation attempts are working on a solution based on proposals put forward by American envoy to the region, Amos Hochstein, even before the war in Gaza. Berri did not disclose the details of the solution but said it is the only feasible one. A senior Lebanese official and the source familiar with Hezbollah's thinking told Reuters that Hezbollah was 'open to any settlement that would include both Gaza and Lebanon.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s10rdsb0a	2024-09-25T09:46:10-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/S11100ACaa0/S11100ACaa0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah' IDF Chief of the General Staff, Liet. Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited the brigade exercise of the 7th Brigade at the northern border, and said that the IDF is preparing for a ground operation in Lebanon. 'You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day. This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah. Today, Hezbollah expanded its range of fire, and later today, they will receive a very strong response. Prepare yourselves,' Halevi said. Halevi made the visit along with the Commanding Officer of the Northern Command, the Commanding Officer of the 98th Division, the Commanding Officer of the Ground Forces Training Center, the Commanding Officer of the 7th Brigade and additional commanders. 'Today, we will continue, we are not stopping; we keep striking and hitting them everywhere. The goal is very clear—to safely return the residents of the north. To achieve that, we are preparing the process of a maneuver, which means your military boots, your maneuvering boots, will enter enemy territory, enter villages that Hezbollah has prepared as large military outposts, with underground infrastructure, staging points, and launchpads into our territory and carry out attacks on Israeli civilians,' Halevi said. 'Your entry into those areas with force, your encounter with Hezbollah operatives, will show them what it means to face a professional, highly skilled, and battle-experienced force. You are coming in much stronger and far more experienced than they are. You will go in, destroy the enemy there, and decisively destroy their infrastructure. These are the things that will allow us to safely return the residents of the north afterward.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rker3ibaa	2024-09-25T09:18:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/r1boUAq11RA/r1boUAq11RA_21_0_1580_1057_0_small.jpg

The National Security Council on Wednesday published an update to the public on the terrorist threats against Israelis abroad ahead of the upcoming Jewish holidays. The announcement stated that, since the beginning of the war, and against the backdrop of threats by Iran and Hezbollah to harm Israelis, a sharp increase in the motivation to carry out terrorist attacks against Israelis and Jews around the world has been detected. The National Security Council said that October 7 is a 'significant landmark' for the terrorist organizations, when efforts to carry out attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets are expected to increase. In addition, the public is asked to be vigilant, and recommended not to post content on social media indicating service in the security forces or operational activity.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b15hrjb00	2024-09-25T08:42:04-07:00	
Flooding in Thai hotel sends Israeli travelers scrambling for cov...	Hotel manager in the town of Pai wakes Israeli tourists in the middle of the night due to incoming floods; Israeli couple caught in hostilities in Ethiopia rescued by extraction team In the picturesque town of Pai in northern Thailand, what began as a peaceful evening quickly turned into a night of turmoil for dozens of Israeli tourists. Heavy rains had transformed the area into a flood zone, submerging hotels and bungalows under relentless waters. Among those affected was Yotam, who shared his experience with Ynet. 'It all started in the middle of the night,' he recounted. 'The manager woke us with urgent shouts as the porch was already overwhelmed by water. We immediately contacted Clal Insurance's emergency center, and they promptly dispatched a rescue team. Now we're in a safe hostel still within the Pai district, recovering from the ordeal but feeling relieved.' Floodwaters from the overflowing river forced the Israeli tourists to seek refuge on rooftops, where they were eventually rescued using ladders, ropes, boats and off-road vehicles. Dror Zesler, deputy CEO and head of Claims Division at Clal Insurance and Finance, explained. 'Upon learning of the situation, we immediately activated our rescue team to ensure the swift and safe evacuation of our insured clients.' Meanwhile, in the Horn of Africa Meanwhile, in a separate incident in Ethiopia, an Israeli couple's vacation took an unexpected turn when they found themselves embroiled in renewed hostilities in the town of Debark. Previously a site of conflict between the government and rebels, the area had enjoyed a period of calm until clashes resumed without warning. The couple, the only Israelis in the vicinity, became trapped in their inn as roads were blocked and fears grew about potential power and communication failures. Using satellite and cellular communication, they reached out to their families and the Magnus rescue team. An extraction team swiftly assessed the situation and plotted the safest evacuation route, relying on local contacts. On Saturday, two rescue teams navigated the precarious path to reach the couple, ensuring their safe transfer to a local airport, where they boarded a flight to safety, allowing them to continue their African adventure. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syon5qwcc	2024-09-25T08:35:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/H1WG11IYbA0/H1WG11IYbA0_1_705_720_406_0_small.jpg

Elon Musk said on Wednesday that he was not having an affair with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, replying to a joke after their mutual praise at a black-tie event in New York this week drew headlines on both sides of the Atlantic. Photographs of the two lit up social media after Musk presented Meloni with the Global Citizen Award from the Atlantic Council think tank on Monday. The New York Post called it a 'public love-in' between the world's richest man and the first female Italian prime minister. 'I was there with my Mom. There is no romantic relationship whatsoever with PM Meloni,' Musk wrote on X in response to a post of a photo of the two of them gazing fondly into each other's eyes at a banquet table, which had the jokey caption 'we all know what happened next.' In a speech before handing over the award, Musk said Meloni was 'someone who is even more beautiful inside than outside'. The Italian right-wing leader replied that the U.S. entrepreneur was a 'precious genius'. Meloni, who split from her long-time partner in 2023, requested that Musk be the person to hand her the award, while the tech businessman flew to Italy twice last year to meet the Italian leader -- in June and December.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryz11jjbr0	2024-09-25T08:24:36-07:00	
US concerned by report on Russia secret war drones project in Chi...	The United States is deeply concerned by a report that Russia has a secret war drones project in China that appears to be an instance of a Chinese company providing lethal assistance to a U.S.-sanctioned Russian firm, a White House spokesperson said on Wednesday. The United States has not seen anything to suggest that the People's Republic of China (PRC) was aware of these transactions or that there has been any government involvement in providing lethal aid to Russia, said a spokesperson for the National Security Council (NSC). 'However, the PRC government also has a responsibility to ensure its companies are not providing lethal assistance,' the spokesperson said. Russia has established a weapons program in China to develop and produce long-range attack drones for use in the war against Ukraine, according to two sources from a European intelligence agency and documents reviewed by Reuters. The United States is prepared to take immediate action against the Chinese companies identified in the Reuters report as well as look into which banks facilitated the transactions with a sanctioned Russian entity, the spokesperson said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjilfj110c	2024-09-25T08:15:53-07:00

Return of barred nuclear inspectors to Iran unlikely	The U.N. nuclear watchdog has been pushing Iran to lift its ban of several uranium-enrichment inspectors from Iranian nuclear sites, but the IAEA chief told Reuters that success seems unlikely. n'Unfortunately this ship has sailed,' Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. The IAEA has strongly condemned the step taken by Iran a year ago as 'unprecedented' and called it a 'very serious blow' to its ability to carry out meaningful inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. Grossi is seeking a meeting in Iran next month with new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that he hopes will bring some movement to long-running standoffs between the IAEA and Iran on issues that include unexplained uranium traces found at undeclared sites and expanding monitoring of some activities. While a country is allowed to veto inspectors assigned to visit its nuclear facilities, the IAEA has said Iran went beyond normal practice.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkwmuib0r	2024-09-25T08:12:47-07:00

IDF mobilizing 2 reserve brigades to north signaling possible gro...	IDF announced mobilization of two reserve brigades of infantry and tanks, which could participate in a ground invasion in Lebanon; Political-security cabinet set to meet Wednesday night in the underground bunker of defense headquarters at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv The IDF announced Wednesday afternoon that it will mobilize two reserve brigades of combined infantry and tanks for operational missions in the north. The call-up comes as fighting in the Northern Arrows operation against Hezbollah on the northern border continues. The mobilization 'will enable the continuation of combat against the Hezbollah terrorist organization, the defense of the State of Israel, and create the conditions to enable the residents of northern Israel to return to their homes,' the IDF spokesperson's office said in a statement. Meanwhile, the political-security cabinet is set to meet Wednesday evening in the underground bunker of defense headquarters at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv. The mobilized reserve brigades are integrated armored-infantry brigades that have previously been mobilized in this war, and will return to increase the defensive operations in the Galilee Division, as well as participating in a ground invasion of Lebanon if one begins. Earlier on Wednesday Northern Command head Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin said Israel has 'entered a different stage of the campaign' and threatened a ground entry into Lebanon, after another morning with dozens of rockets launched in attacks on areas of northern Israel, and waves of Israel Air Force attacks from the air throughout Lebanon, including north and south of Beirut. 'We have entered another phase of the campaign. We must be fully prepared for a ground incursion and action,' Gordin said during a visit to the 7th Brigade's divisional exercise on the northern border, to assess the readiness of the commanders and soldiers. Gordin said that the Northern Arrows operation 'began with significant strikes on Hezbollah’s capabilities, focusing on their firepower and a severe blow to their commanders and personnel. In light of this, we need to change the security situation.' The political-security cabinet will meet Wednesday night, hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takes off to the United States to give a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York . Netanyahu has postponed his trip again, and will only fly to the United States Thursday morning, instead of Wednesday evening. Before the cabinet meeting, he will hold limited consultations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will leave for his UN speech tomorrow (Thursday) instead of tonight, and will return on Saturday evening,' his office said in a statement. 'Throughout today, the Prime Minister will hold consultations with security officials in order to discuss the continuation of the attacks in Lebanon,' the statement also said. The announcement from Netanyahu's office came about an hour after Hezbollah expanded the circle of fire - and for the first time ever fired a missile from Lebanon into the center of the country . The IDF reported that one surface-to-surface missile was launched from Lebanon and, according to reports, it was aimed at the Camp Glilot intelligence military base, near Herzliya. Meanwhile, the IDF spokesman announced that Israeli Air Force fighter jets had completed attacks on 60 Hezbollah intelligence targets. The strikes destroyed surveillance equipment, command centers and other infrastructure used by the group for intelligence gathering, according to the military. The IDF spokesman also announced that, as part of the Northern Arrows operation against Hezbollah, about 280 targets in Lebanon were attacked during the day, including the launchers from which the rocket launches were carried out Wednesday morning toward Safed, Nahariya and the Jezreel Valley area. In addition, terrorists, ammunition depots and launchers ready for launch were also attacked, as well as military infrastructure of the terror organization. In addition, the IDF attacked ammunition depots and military infrastructure in the Nabatia region and other areas in the south of the country. The army is concentrating its efforts on attacks against the terrorist organization's intelligence infrastructure, as well as against long-range missiles. 'They have a lot to lose if Hezbollah increases the range of fire,' said a senior member of the General Staff yesterday. He added that 'the assassinations have an effect on Hezbollah's ability to command, which has been severely damaged.' The Lebanese Ministry of Health announced 23 dead and 95 wounded in Wednesday's attacks in Lebanon. The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported that more than 95,000 displaced people have left southern Lebanon so far, after the expansion of Israeli attacks there. According to the report, the displaced are staying n schools that have been turned into shelters in Beirut, Mount Lebanon, the Sidon area, al-Baqaa, Baalbek, al-Harmel, Bekhar and in the north of the country. It was also reported that the internal security personnel who were supposed to operate according to the government's emergency plan did not show up, and that the displaced were left to their fate. Only 'social solidarity and civil initiatives' managed to alleviate the situation, the report said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h18riqb0r	2024-09-25T07:35:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/21/HJLpH9rZf6/HJLpH9rZf6_0_21_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Tel Aviv maintains business as usual amid Hezbollah fire: 'We tru...	Despite missile attack, Tel Aviv parents decide to send their children to schools despite many facilities not having designated safe zone Despite air raid sirens triggered by a Hezbollah missile from Lebanon on Wednesday morning, many Tel Aviv residents chose to continue their daily routines. Hadar, a local, told Ynet she did not hesitate to send her daughter to kindergarten, even though the facility lacks a designated safe zone. 'If there is a siren, I will come immediately to take her home,' she said. 'Routine is the best approach, in my opinion.' Hadar, who works as an assistant in municipal kindergartens, noted that there had been discussions among parents about whether educational institutions should remain open. She emphasized that the municipality is well-prepared, with educational centers distributed throughout the city. 'There was no hesitation or alternative guidance,' she added. Or, another Tel Aviv resident, admitted he woke up with 'difficult feelings' but also decided to take his children to kindergarten. 'It’s scary, but we trust the IDF,' he said. 'I considered whether to send the children, but in the end, I don’t know any parents who didn’t. Everyone sent their children and felt safe.' How do you mediate the sirens for children at such a young age? 'We tell them what’s appropriate. I tell them a nice story. I told the children that the siren is like a song for a two-year-old; when you hear it, you go downstairs. There’s not much else to say.' 'Israel is strong, even Tel Aviv can endure it' Doron Shnaper, Kiryat Shmona's spokesperson, commented on the unusual fire against the Tel Aviv metropolitan and said, 'Our reality in Kiryat Shmona is bleak, with rocket fire, sirens, and drones. Tuesday broke the record with 50 launches.' Doron Shnaper, a municipal spokesperson for the northern city of Kiryat Shmona, commented on the unprecedented attack on the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. 'Our reality in Kiryat Shmona is grim, with constant rocket fire, sirens and drones. Tuesday set a record with 50 launches,' he said. 'We have 24,000 affected residents. Israel is strong, and we need to resolve this with force. It’s time to crush Hezbollah. The residents of Kiryat Shmona will endure, and so can Tel Aviv. We love our country. We want the IDF to win and for us to return home.' In Netanya, a city north of Tel Aviv, city council member Avi Salama acknowledged that the recent sirens marked the first time since 2021 that the city had been targeted. 'There is no doubt it is unsettling. We lack sufficient safe zones in the city and schools, and these are fundamental issues that need addressing,' Salama said. 'Many residents are reaching out, and the municipality is seeking solutions, but we stand united behind the IDF.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj4sqv11ac	2024-09-25T05:25:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/S1oR4cxA0/S1oR4cxA0_0_147_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

1,500 Hezbollah fighters lost sight and limbs to pager bombs, rep...	Senior Hezbollah official says many terrorists rendered unfit for combat due to explosions; new US report estimates Hezbollah’s strength at 40,000 to 50,000 members—around half of number previously claimed by Nasrallah Some 1,500 Hezbollah fighters have been disabled after their communication devices exploded en masse last week, with many losing their sight or suffering hand amputations from the blasts, a senior member of the Lebanese terrorist group told Reuters on Wednesday on condition of anonymity. Hezbollah published a list of casualties over the past week, following the explosions, reporting 37 deaths from various regions across Lebanon. These include the Bekaa Valley, the Dahieh district in Beirut, multiple locations in southern Lebanon and the Akkar region in the north. According to various Lebanese reports, around 3,000 people have been injured by the explosions. While Reuters noted that the incident represents a 'major blow' to Hezbollah, the disabled fighters represent only a small fraction of the group's total force, which, according to a recent report submitted to the U.S. Congress, numbers between 40,000 and 50,000 members. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had previously claimed the organization had 100,000 fighters. Three Hezbollah sources told Reuters that since October 7, the group has redeployed its fighters to 'frontline areas in the south,' including some who have returned to Lebanon from Syria. Additionally, Hezbollah has been rapidly moving more rockets into Lebanon in preparation for prolonged fighting. However, the sources emphasized that Hezbollah is seeking to avoid an all-out war. Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King's College London, said that while Hezbollah operations had been disrupted by the past week's attacks, the group's networked organizational structure helped make it an extremely resilient force. 'This is the most formidable enemy Israel has ever faced on the battlefield, not because of numbers and tech but in terms of resilience.' IDF strikes 100 Hezbollah targets and counting Amid reports of heavy losses for Hezbollah, Israel continued its extensive wave of airstrikes across southern and central Lebanon on Wednesday, with at least 10 people reported killed in the morning hours. By midday, the Israeli military said that its fighter jets had struck more than 100 targets in Lebanon, and the attacks were ongoing. In response, Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets and drones at northern Israeli communities, with one residential unit suffering a direct hit. Earlier in the day, Hezbollah fired a ballistic missile toward central Israel, triggering sirens in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area and the Sharon region. The missile was intercepted by the David’s Sling missile defense system. Saudi network Al Hadath reported that the target was the Glilot military base. Meanwhile, the pro-Hezbollah Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar reported that over 95,000 people have been displaced from southern Lebanon as a result of the intensified Israeli strikes. The displaced are reportedly sheltering in schools turned into temporary shelters across Beirut, Mount Lebanon, Sidon, the Bekaa Valley, Baalbek, Hermel, Akkar and northern Lebanon. The report added that internal security personnel, who were supposed to manage the situation according to the government's emergency plan, were absent, leaving the displaced to fend for themselves. Only 'social solidarity and civic initiatives' have managed to alleviate the situation, the report said. The newspaper also highlighted the economic impact of the displacement, noting that the influx of people into Beirut and its eastern suburbs has led to skyrocketing prices. The cost of bread has reportedly increased sixfold. In a separate article, Al Akhbar described severe congestion at border crossings into Syria from the Bekaa Valley and northern Lebanon, with thousands of people crossing daily. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkpyid11cr	2024-09-25T04:35:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/Bk9x11GDTR/Bk9x11GDTR_0_95_2500_1408_0_small.jpg

New faces in Tehran': Israeli academic meets Iran president at U...	Prof. Lior Sternfeld attends meeting in New York at invitation of Masoud Pezeshkian, touts ‘opportunity that shouldn’t be missed’ to ‘engage step by step’ with Tehran Israeli professor Lior Sternfeld, an expert on Iranian Jewry, met with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Despite laws prohibiting contact with officials from enemy states, Sternfeld informed Israeli authorities, who did not prevent the meeting. 'The president knew I was Israeli,' Sternfeld said, adding that he notified the UN delegation of his citizenship in advance, and his invitation was not rescinded. The meeting, conducted in Persian, was part of an 'Interfaith Dialogue' event, which also included American Jewish rabbis invited by the Iranian president. 'Are there new faces in Iran? The answer is yes,' Sternfeld said. Sternfeld, a historian teaching in the United States, noted that he was the only Israeli present. 'Nearly everyone had a chance to speak,' he said. 'President Pezeshkian responded to all at once. This is not a continuation of [former President Ibrahim] Raisi’s foreign policy; Pezeshkian spoke about renewing dialogue with the West. If Israel had leadership open to building a better future for the region, I believe there is a partner to work with. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.' The event focused on interfaith dialogue as a means of peacebuilding in the Middle East. Sternfeld emphasized the need for more than just dialogue, advocating for concrete steps to build working coalitions. He relayed Pezeshkian’s statement that if Israel and the Palestinians reached an agreement acceptable to most Palestinians, Iran would no longer carry the banner of resistance. Sternfeld urged Pezeshkian to reiterate this stance to a Western audience, suggesting it could positively impact perceptions of Iran. Sternfeld also referenced a past offer by Iran’s former foreign minister to help resolve the issue of hostages as a humanitarian gesture. When he asked Pezeshkian if Iran could assist with the current hostage situation, the president did not respond directly, instead saying it was now up to the West to take the next step in dialogue with Iran. 'He is a moderate and seeks dialogue,' Sternfeld said, describing the meeting as a significant opportunity for the West to engage with Iran. Although initially hesitant to accept the invitation, he ultimately decided that the chance to speak directly with Iran’s president was too important to pass up. Reflecting on the conversation, Sternfeld acknowledged that the war was a central theme, but Pezeshkian did not present a clear plan for ending the conflict. The professor highlighted the interconnectedness of the regional conflicts and emphasized the importance of initiating steps toward building trust. 'This is an opportunity that shouldn’t be missed,' Sternfeld said. 'We can’t wait for Iran to meet a list of demands before starting talks. We must seize this moment to engage step by step.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry8v25erc	2024-09-25T03:13:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/HknWLFxAA/HknWLFxAA_0_136_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Argentina’s Milei slams UN bias against Israel at General Assembl...	Pro-Israel leader criticizes organization for 'failure to defend democratic values,' while allowing 'bloody dictatorships' seats on Human Rights Council Argentine President Javier Milei delivered a sharp rebuke of the United Nations' policies toward Israel during his address to the General Assembly on Tuesday, condemning the organization for what he described as a double standard and failure to defend democratic values. Milei accused the UN of undermining Israel, calling it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, and criticized the body for not allowing Israel to protect itself against terrorism. He argued that the UN’s approach contradicts its founding principles of promoting peace and human rights. 'Israel is unjustly targeted while regimes that oppress their people are given a platform,' Milei said, highlighting what he sees as the UN’s selective criticism. During the assembly, Milei spoke with Israeli UN Ambassador Danny Danon. He also lambasted the organization for including 'bloody dictatorships' like Cuba and Venezuela on the Human Rights Council without holding them accountable, and allowing countries 'that punish their women just for showing their skin' to sit on committees dedicated to women's rights. Milei’s remarks come amid growing criticism of the UN's treatment of Israel and reflect his administration's pro-Israel stance. Since taking office in December, he has strengthened ties with Israel, and in July, Argentina designated Hamas as a terrorist organization, ordering the freezing of its financial assets following the group's attack on October 7. 'If the United Nations wants to return to the principles that led to its creation, it can count on Argentina’s full support,' Milei said. He concluded his speech with his signature catchphrase, 'Long live freedom, God damn it.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkkvtnzra	2024-09-25T02:52:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/21/Hk0K62tmR/Hk0K62tmR_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Dozens of rocket fired into northern Israel; Safed home takes dir...	IDF says some 40 rocketts fired in latest barrage, some intercepted by air defenses and one landing in Safed home; no casualties reported; Hezbollah says targeted IDF Northern Command headquarters The IDF reported that approximately 40 rockets were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel Wednesday morning, with some intercepted and one landing in a home in Safed. No casualties were reported. The army said that Hezbollah continues to target civilian areas and institutions in Israel’s rear, while the Israeli military is responding with strikes on Hezbollah’s terror sites and weapons depots. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it targeted the IDF Northern Command headquarters in Safed. Meanwhile, Saudi network Al Hadath reported on Wednesday that Israel scattered leaflets in the area of the village of Kahale in the Mount Lebanon region, near the Beirut-Damascus highway. According to the report, the leaflets called on residents of the village to evacuate within two hours. Earlier on Wednesday, air raid sirens blared in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area and the Sharon Planes early Wednesday following rocket fire from Lebanon, marking the first time that central Israel has come under attack from Israel's northern neighbor. The alarms sounded at 6:30 a.m. in cities including Tel Aviv, Glilot, Ramat Gan and Netanya, which experienced its first siren of the war. The attack came hours after the IDF struck a Hezbollah arms depot south of Beirut. The IDF confirmed a single surface-to-surface missile was launched from Lebanon and intercepted by the David’s Sling air defense system, with no reported casualties or damage. The army later said that it struck the launcher from which the missile was fired toward central Israel. Shortly after, the IDF resumed its strikes on southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah weapons depots and other military sites. Sirens also sounded in Zichron Yaakov, Yokneam Illit and several coastal towns south of Haifa. The IDF reported that five rockets were launched from Lebanon at the Carmel and Wadi Ara area in northern Israel. According to the army, some of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses, and at least one impact was reported. A hostile aircraft infiltration alert was also issued for the northern city of Tiberias. Saudi network Al Hadath reported that Hezbollah launched at least one missile toward the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. The report also claimed the missile was aimed at the Glilot military base. 'Hezbollah attempted to send a message by launching a single ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. The launch was timed to coincide with the start of the attack on October 7, at 6:29 a.m,' the report said. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it fired an Iranian-made Ghadr 1 medium-range ballistic missile at the Mossad headquarters, which it accused of coordinating recent assassinations of senior Hezbollah leaders and the detonation of thousands of communication devices belonging to the terrorist group's operatives. IDF Arabic spokesperson, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, urged residents in southern Lebanon to avoid returning to their homes for their safety. Overnight, the IDF continued airstrikes across southern Lebanon and deeper into the country. According to Al Hadath, Israeli forces targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot in the town of Jiyeh, about 12 miles south of Beirut. Later, rocket sirens were heard in several towns in the Upper Galilee and the Arava region. The army reported that a drone had crossed into Israel from the east, with an impact identified in the area, but no injuries were reported. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a group of pro-Iranian militias operating in Syria, claimed responsibility for the drone strike, saying it targeted 'a site near the Jordan Valley.' Wednesday's attack on central Israel follows days of intense fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, with multiple rocket barrages targeting northern Israel. The escalation has prompted the United Nations Security Council to hold an emergency meeting on Lebanon, called by France, with UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon participating. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad reported Tuesday night that at least 569 people have been killed and 5,000 injured since Monday morning in Israeli airstrikes. Meanwhile, Hezbollah confirmed that its head of missile operations Ibrahim Qubaisi was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s Dahieh district. In response to the escalating violence, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed his planned departure for the United Nations General Assembly, now set for Thursday. The Prime Minister's Office said that Netanyahu will hold consultations with security officials to discuss ongoing operations in Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/tygahaa70	2024-09-25T02:24:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/Sy8qdBZAC/Sy8qdBZAC_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Israel urges US to warn Iran against intervening in Lebanon	Israeli intelligence indicates Nasrallah trying to drag Tehran into war; US officials believe intervention would drag the region into a full-scale war As Israel targets Hezbollah's military capabilities while bracing for retaliation, it is working through the U.S. to prevent a broader war by urging Washington to pressure Iran not to intervene. The move comes after Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday suggested that Iran might support the terrorist organization. The U.S. is concerned about further escalation in the region and believes there may be several more days of conflict ahead. American officials have urged Israel to refrain from significant strikes that could provoke Iran to enter the fray. In response to IDF strikes on weapons caches in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah has expanded its operations, launching a surface-to-surface missile barrage toward central Israel. Air raid sirens sounded across the Tel Aviv metropolitan area Wednesday morning as one of the missiles, which Hezbollah claimed it aimed at the Mossad headquarters, was intercepted. A Saudi report suggested that the target may have been the Glilot base. While the U.S. is engaged in diplomatic efforts to 'pacify' Hezbollah, it appears that the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is demanding a cease-fire in Gaza as a condition for halting hostilities. U.S. officials acknowledge that without a resolution in Gaza, it will be challenging to stabilize the situation in Lebanon. Most of their diplomatic efforts are therefore focused on Gaza, but progress has been slow, reportedly due to a lack of response from Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt. IDF takes the fight to Lebanon Even before the missile attack on central Israel early Wednesday, Tuesday marked another day of intense clashes between Israel and Hezbollah. The terrorist group continued to fire barrages at northern Israeli towns, prompting widespread precision strikes by the IDF against Hezbollah's infrastructure, operatives and weapons stockpiles. Throughout the day, hundreds of rockets were launched from Lebanon, with a particularly heavy barrage at noon when 105 rockets crossed the border in less than an hour. In the evening, Hezbollah launched a drone toward the coastal town of Atlit, claiming it was targeting an elite Israeli commando unit. Earlier on Tuesday, a house in Rosh Pina was directly hit by a rocket. The family inside was unharmed after taking shelter in a safe room. A 25-year-old reservist was moderately injured by shrapnel from an intercepted rocket near Yokne'am and was taken to Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa for treatment. 'He defended himself well, lying on the ground, but was still hit by shrapnel,' said a Magen David Adom spokesperson. Meanwhile, the IDF conducted multiple rounds of strikes throughout Lebanon, including deep within Lebanese territory. The Lebanese Health Minister reported that the death toll from Israeli attacks over the past two days had risen to at least 569, including 50 children and 94 women, with around 5,000 people injured. Lebanese media reported that the IDF targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot near Jiyeh, about 12 miles south of Beirut. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited a training exercise by the IDF’s 7th Armored Division and the 202nd Paratrooper Battalion, simulating ground combat in Lebanese territory. 'Hezbollah today is not the same as last week’s Hezbollah,' Gallant said. 'The sequence of blows to its command and control capabilities, operatives, and combat resources are severe.' IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, emphasized the need to maintain pressure on Hezbollah. 'We must not give Hezbollah a break,' he stated. 'We need to continue working with all our strength, accelerating offensive operations and reinforcing all our efforts. The situation demands continued vigorous action on all fronts.' Another high-profile assassination in Dahieh In a significant achievement during the second day of Operation Northern Arrows, Israel successfully targeted and killed senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Qubaisi, known as 'Abu Musa,' in an airstrike on Tuesday in the Dahieh district of Beirut. Israeli sources identified Qubaisi as the head of Hezbollah's rocket and missile division and a direct subordinate to the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, making him the most senior military figure after recent high-profile assassinations. Qubaisi had recently been brought into Nasrallah’s inner circle, participating in closed meetings with the Hezbollah leader. According to the IDF, Qubaisi was responsible for several attacks against Israel, including the 2000 raid on Mount Dov, which resulted in the abduction and killing of Staff Sgt. Benjamin Avraham, 21, Staff Sgt. Adi Avitan, 22, and Staff Sgt. Omar Sawaid, 27. Their remains were returned to Israel for burial in 2004. Alongside Qubaisi, six other Hezbollah operatives were killed, and 15 civilians were injured in the attack. This marks the latest in a series of targeted strikes by Israel against senior Hezbollah figures. On July 31, Nasrallah’s military chief Fuad Shukr was killed, followed last week by the elimination of Ibrahim Aqil, the head of Hezbollah’s operations, along with senior commanders from the Radwan Force. Tuesday's strike in Dahieh is the fifth Israeli attack on Hezbollah’s stronghold since October 8, when the terrorist group began firing at Israel unprovoked. The first attack targeted senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri, who was killed in January. Residents of Dahieh are increasingly feeling the impact of these escalations. A Lebanese resident living near the building where Qubaisi was killed described the incident: 'We heard a deafening explosion, and three floors of the building collapsed at once. In the past few days, there have been several assassinations in Dahieh, and only after the attack did we learn from the Israeli media who was targeted. We, the ordinary residents of the district, had no idea.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s100wsqbr0	2024-09-25T01:54:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/rJgXzVEeR0/rJgXzVEeR0_0_114_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Suspected Trump gunman charged with attempted assassination	AG Merrick Garland says Justice Department will 'spare no resource,' on the case; Trump campaign says security officials briefed candidate of threats from Iran to assassinate him Ryan Routh, accused of staking out Donald Trump at his Florida golf course was indicted on Tuesday on a charge of attempted assassination of a political candidate as prosecutors alleged he intended to kill the former U.S. president, federal prosecutors said. Routh has not yet entered a plea. His lawyers unsuccessfully sought to have him released on bond. A Secret Service agent identified the barrel of an AK-47 in the bushes and fired at least four shots at Roth who escaped leaving his backpack behind which contained a GoPro camera and other items. He was later arrested after an eyewitness provided his license plate number to authorities. Routh, 58, was already facing two gun-related charges after authorities said he pointed a rifle through a fence at Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida on Sept. 15 while the Republican presidential candidate was golfing there. He has been ordered to remain in jail to await trial. A federal prosecutor said on Monday that the U.S. Justice Department would ask a grand jury to approve the more serious attempted assassination charge, which carries a maximum of life in prison. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday called the attempted assassination a 'heinous act' and said the Justice Department will 'spare no resource,' on the case. Prosecutors have in recent days revealed evidence they said pointed toward a plan to kill Trump. They alleged that months before the incident, Routh dropped off a letter to an unidentified person alluding to 'an assassination attempt on Donald Trump.' They said Routh spent a month in South Florida and cell phone data showed him near the golf course and Trump's Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago. He was found with a handwritten list of dates and venues where Trump spoke or was expected to appear, according to the court filings. A U.S. Secret Service agent searching the golf course ahead of Trump opened fire after discovering the gun poking through the fence, causing Routh to flee, prosecutors said. He was arrested within an hour along a Florida highway. Routh was initially charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Trump's presidential campaign said on Tuesday that they were briefed by U.S. intelligence officials on alleged threats from Iran to assassinate the candidate. Iran has previously denied U.S. claims of interfering in American affairs. Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York and the ODNI did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Tuesday. Earlier this month, a Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate an American politician in retaliation for the 2020 killing by the U.S. of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. The defendant named Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjhlsezac	2024-09-25T01:37:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/16/rkwbNlSpA/rkwbNlSpA_0_41_639_360_0_small.jpg
Donating to remember the fallen	Since October 7, Smile shifted from turning personal gifts into community support to helping bereaved families commemorate loved ones; ‘It’s natural that the urge to commemorate is arising only now,’ founders say Since October 7, hundreds of families have lost their loved ones to war and terror, leaving them grappling with immense grief and loss. Beyond the emotional and psychological support they need during this devastating time, these families are also seeking ways to honor and commemorate those they have lost. Yael Hollander, Daphne Seroussi and Yael Ouanounou, founders of the Smile Foundation—a platform established to turn private gifts into opportunities for donations and community aid—have stepped up to help the bereaved families. 'It’s natural that the urge to commemorate is arising only now,' they said. The platform has been used to promote the music of spouses who were murdered in Kibbutz Holit on October 7 and to fund a rehabilitative trip in memory of a fallen soldier. The Smile Foundation was founded in 2019 by Hollander under joyful circumstances: she was celebrating her 40th birthday, her husband’s 50th, her eldest son’s bar mitzvah and her father’s 80th birthday. 'It was a year filled with celebrations, but the subject of gifts irked me,' she recalls. 'Another massage gift card? More scented candles? Giving is important to me. I’m a physical therapist at Beit Izzy Shapiro, and I was looking for a way to combine private celebrations with giving back to the community.' After asking her friends to replace her birthday gifts with donations, Hollander recognized the need for an organized platform to connect private donors with the 40,000 non-profit organizations operating in Israel. 'Yes, I was also shocked by the number,' admits Yael. 'We all know the top 10 big organizations, which already receive large budgets, but there are thousands of smaller organizations doing amazing community work that remain in their shadow and don’t even have proper websites.' With the help of her two friends, Daphne and Yael, she founded the Smile Foundation, which they describe as a 'social BUYME' platform. To establish the foundation, each of the three friends contributed funds from their private savings ('a loan,' clarifies Yael, 'with the hope that at some point in the future, we’ll be able to repay it') to build the colorful app. 'I scoured the country and hand-picked 30 non-profit organizations working in various fields, from supporting abused women to assisting those leaving the ultra-Orthodox community. For each organization, I customized what a private donation could buy,' explains Yael. 'If you donate 10 shekels, that buys three sandwiches for a child. At the Starting Over Farm, you can choose between rescuing a sheep or adopting a donkey. That way, everyone knows exactly where their money is going.' However, the COVID-19 pandemic ground the foundation's operations to a halt. Despite the setback, Hollander used the forced lull to add crucial information about each organization featured on the Smile website, including Yad and Lev, which supports Holocaust survivors, and The Center for Training Service Dogs, which provides assistance to patients with PTSD. She also put together care packages at fixed prices, such as those including a cake, a flower pot and challah for Shabbat for 50 NIS. Even the smallest donations have an impact. 'A donation doesn’t have to replace a wedding gift; it can be a complementary gift for a new mother, or a way to thank the doctor who treated you. For that purpose, we’ve added a range of different notes to accompany each donation, because in my eyes, the note can often be more important than the gift itself. I’ve called this gifting option ‘a triple gift’ because there are three beneficiaries: the one who donates, the one on whose behalf the gift is given and the recipient.' Rachel Shapira was moved On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the trio was working tirelessly, 'but then October 7 happened, and everything collapsed. Who was in the headspace for gifts then? And who did you feel more obliged to help—the evacuees who had suddenly lost their homes or the already homeless people who had come to rely on your support?' Hollander recalls. 'I felt uncomfortable with the thought of evacuees from the north and south receiving second- or even third-hand clothing donations. With all due respect to those who opened their closets to donate, it still left a bitter taste in my mouth. I wanted to provide them with true independence. So we raised money to give evacuees vouchers. Each family received a BUYME gift voucher, which they could use in stores like Fox or at a baby clothing shop. 'I joined forces with Jewish communities abroad. A Jewish community in Cambridge adopted Kibbutz Nir Oz and financed the vouchers we provided for them. A community from Vancouver adopted Holit. Some organizations offered gifts to children, like Hanukkah presents, but I objected to that approach. We distributed vouchers so the children could choose their own pajamas or games. Receiving eight gifts in a row brings joy. It's a small smile.' The prolonged war forced Hollander to come up with creative ideas. 'At one of the rehabilitation centers, I selected five wounded soldiers and found a company that donates a voucher of one thousand shekels to each of them monthly, as well as to the families of reservists,' she explains. 'Tonight, one of our wounded soldiers is getting married, and I found someone who financed the wedding dress, a makeup artist and other goodies.' Now, almost a year since that fateful Sabbath, reality demands a new course of action. Bereaved families from the Nova festival massacre and the military are interested in establishing memorial exhibits in honor of their loved ones, and Hollander is determined to help. 'In my view, it's natural that the urge to memorialize is only now emerging,' she says. 'It took these families time to process, to build a new kind of routine for themselves, and to recover all their deceased loved ones. When families tell me they want to establish a memorial foundation, I explain that it is a process requiring financial resources, an accountant, a lawyer, and endless bureaucracy. It is not suitable for everyone.' As a result, the Smile app has opened a new page dedicated to memorializing. 'I don't interfere with the content; I only manage negotiations with the various suppliers to optimize fundraising and reduce costs,' Hollander explains. Among the projects that have come to fruition is an album dedicated to the late Shahar and Shlomi Mathias, who were murdered on October 7 in the shelter of their home in Holit. 'Shahar, my only sister, was a singer, and Shlomi, my brother-in-law, was the music teacher for all the children in the settlements around Gaza,' says Bar Yuval-Shani, a psychotherapist and marriage therapist from Lahavim. 'Nathan Salor, who studied with them in Ramon, played Rachel Shapira their rendition of her song, 'Consolation,' and she said it was the most moving version she had ever heard. So I went to see her in Shefayim to introduce her to my sister and play some original material from the album we produced.' Shapira was the one who approached Hollander and took it upon herself to raise 90,000 shekels for the project. Salor selected the pieces, and the musicians who gathered in the studio in Be'er Sheva were assisted by artificial intelligence to fill in the gaps. 'It's slow work, but I hope the album will be ready within the next year,' says Yuval-Shani, adding, 'If we hadn’t partnered with Smile, my sister's voice would not be heard.' The late Major Sivan Weil, a commando in the Egoz unit, died of his wounds on March 29 after being injured in a battle in the southern Gaza Strip. 'He was the second of our four children,' says his father Julian, who made aliyah from France 26 years ago. He owns a marketing firm, and his wife Helen is an occupational psychologist. 'What do I know about memorializing?' he asked, already during the week of his son’s shiva. Daphne Seroussi, one of the founders of the Smile initiative, knew the family from Ra’anana and offered her help. In the first phase, thousands of bottles of wine from the Bin Nun and Titora wineries were prepared with Sivan's picture and were also distributed abroad. 'Each bottle is accompanied by a leaflet that tells the story of Sivan’s short and beautiful life,' explains his father. 'Our Sivan loved skiing; he learned at the young age of four, and when he was asked what he wanted to do after his military service, he answered: 'go on a ski trip.' From the money we raised from the wine sales, we are flying 15 members of Sivan’s unit, who were injured in the same incident, for a week of rehabilitative skiing in Bulgaria. The Erez Foundation, which specializes in extreme sports and rehabilitative work with IDF veterans, will adapt the skiing to their needs.' And that's not all. 'On October 31, the date when Sivan was meant to celebrate his 21st birthday, we will launch a major campaign to establish a fund that will finance rehabilitative sports activities for disabled IDF veterans and provide scholarships. As part of the 'Israeli Journey,' two scholarships for math tutoring will be awarded to high school students. Sivan's organs were donated and transplanted into Druze and Bedouin recipients.' 'There are other platforms that conduct crowdfunding campaigns,' notes Hollander, 'but we, for a nominal fee of 500 shekels per month, accompany the creation of the commemoration project through to its completion.' 'Not trying to profit' Do Israelis like to donate? Hollander: 'Wealthy Israeli donors give millions to hospitals and research. But the average donor, the one who doesn’t donate large amounts, may be overlooked because they aren’t given the option to choose where their money goes. In the U.S., they recognized the need for a defined donation goal, and everywhere you look you’ll see ads like, ‘Adopt an orphan in Africa for $50 a month.’ I believe in the importance of such public education.' This is also her response to the question of how Smile generates revenue. 'Since we want 100% of the donation to reach its intended recipient, we have added an option to leave a tip for us. In the U.S., 3-5% of donations come with a tip for the facilitating app. At Smile, the tips add up to about 1%, which is fine. It’s a slow process.' These are the words of someone who is taking a big risk. 'No,' she laughs, 'but we’re really not trying to make a profit. The tips finance the website server. We don’t earn a salary, we don’t have an office, and we only pay for essential services, like a programmer, accountant and lawyer. To survive financially, we started another initiative that is doing well in the U.S.—donations by businesses. 'In Israel, most businesses donate generously but do not involve their employees in the process. We divide the donation amount into vouchers, which are distributed to employees via email, and each employee chooses from the platform who they’d like to donate to. It’s not a personal connection, but it does have a positive impact on the heart.' 'It’s incredibly fulfilling,' she concludes. 'On a personal and even egotistical level, this is what has kept me going for the past year. I get to meet the good people of Israel. And there are many.'

The journey of escape from death': Lebanese fleeing combat zones...	Thousands flee southern Lebanon amid heavy fighting, creating massive traffic jams and panic; ‘We left for Beirut not knowing where we were going’ Thousands of Lebanese civilians are fleeing combat zones in southern Lebanon as the IDF continues extensive airstrikes on the second day of Operation Northern Arrows. The evacuations follow Israeli warnings for civilians to leave areas where weapons were allegedly being stored by Hezbollah. Arab media outlets reported scenes of residents escaping under fire, enduring difficult road conditions and seeking refuge in schools converted into shelters. On Monday, the first day of the IDF’s precision strikes, 558 people were reportedly killed, the highest single-day toll in Lebanon since the civil war over 30 years ago. The Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar published an extensive report on the displaced, titled 'The Journey of Escape from Death.' One woman displaced from her home in southern Lebanon described her journey to Beirut, saying, 'Missiles were falling in front of us, behind us and on both sides. For four hours, we could not leave the house. We saw houses collapse on their occupants. We left for Beirut at 10 a.m. and arrived the next day at 7 a.m. due to heavy traffic. There was no food or drink on the way, everyone was in the same difficult situation.' She said that the Israeli attacks 'forced me, and thousands of families, to leave their homes instead of staying in place and dying.' Another displaced woman said: 'We were at home when we heard the attacks around us. We woke up in the morning and discovered that the house was shaking from the force of the rockets and attacks in the area. We left the house and hid under the trees. Then we packed our suitcases and left for Beirut without knowing where we're going. We arrived at a school in Beirut until we know what fate has for us.' A displaced person who fled from Nabatieh in southern Lebanon said, 'The attacks came closer to our house so we had to leave because there are children at home. If there were no children we would not have left. We do not have the financial ability to rent an apartment, so we came to a school to take shelter.' Another displaced person from the village of Ain Qana said, 'A missile exploded a few meters from me. We took the children and drove to Beirut. There was heavy traffic for eight hours on the road.' Saudi daily Asharq Al-Awsat shared similar stories of families making treacherous journeys lasting up to 16 hours. Many used any available transportation, including tractors and trucks, as they fled northward. A displaced person from the town of Shaitieh recounted his car breaking down, forcing him to spend the night in Zahrani before continuing his journey. 'It’s better to die on the road than in a place subject to dozens of attacks every day,' he said. Schools in Beirut and other cities have been turned into makeshift shelters as tens of thousands seek refuge. According to UN reports, about 6,000 people have crossed into Syria, and thousands more remain on the move within Lebanon. Volunteers at Bir Hassan Technical College in southern Beirut have been working tirelessly to provide food, water and medicine to those in need. Rami Najam, a representative of the Shiite Amal movement, which is taking an active part in fighting against Israel, said, 'In the beginning there were only a few families, by 5 p.m. we had 30 families.' Lebanon’s Health Minister reported at least 569 fatalities and over 5,000 injuries since the escalation began on Monday. Hezbollah confirmed the death of its missile commander, Ibrahim Qubaisi, in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s Dahieh district. Israeli officials said that Qubaisi, who oversaw missile units targeting Israel, became the group’s top military leader after recent high-profile assassinations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wrdfbra	2024-09-25T00:20:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/rkvNoRk00/rkvNoRk00_0_234_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IAEA chief sees willingness from Iran to re-engage on nuclear fil...	Iranian president tells UN General Assembly Tehran willing to cooperate with West revive 2015 nuclear deal UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he had sensed a greater willingness by Iranian officials to engage with the agency in a more meaningful way after talks in New York, and that he hoped to travel to Tehran in October. Several long-standing issues have dogged relations between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, including Tehran's barring of uranium enrichment experts on the inspection team and its failure for years to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. Grossi held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, one of the key architects of the 2015 accord that limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium in return for a lifting of Western sanctions, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. 'What I see is an expressed willingness to re-engage with us in a more meaningful fashion,' Grossi told Reuters in an interview. On Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in his speech to the UN General Assembly that Iran was ready to end its nuclear standoff with the West. 'We are ready to engage with participants of the 2015 nuclear deal. If the deal's commitments are implemented fully and in good faith, dialogue on other issues can follow,' Pezeshkian said. With nuclear diplomacy largely stalled between the Iranian presidential election and the U.S. one on Nov. 5, Iranian and European officials have met in New York to test their mutual willingness to reduce tensions amid Tehran's disputed nuclear program, its role in Ukraine and mounting regional tensions. Grossi said he wanted to make real progress in restoring proper technical discussions with Iran quickly and was aiming to travel to Tehran in October to meet with Pezeshkian. 'Of course now we have to give content and substance to this because we are not starting from zero. We have had a relatively protracted process without replies to some of the questions we have,' he said. 'We also need to calibrate together with them how we go through this period where they are waiting to see what is going to happen with their other partners, starting with the United States.' IAEA board resolutions ordering Iran to cooperate urgently with the investigation into the uranium traces and calling on it to reverse its barring of inspectors have brought little change, and quarterly IAEA reports seen by Reuters on Aug. 29 showed no progress. The development of Iran's nuclear program has also advanced. By the end of the quarter, the latest IAEA reports showed Iran had completed the installation of eight new cascades at Fordow but still not brought them online. At its larger underground site at Natanz, which is enriching to up to 5% purity, it had brought 15 new cascades of other advanced models online. 'Iran has kept a regular pace without accelerating too much, but it continues,' Grossi said, adding that the Fordow cascades remained offline. Iran has stepped up nuclear work since 2019, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned an agreement reached under his predecessor Barack Obama. When asked about the prospects of a revival of nuclear talks, Grossi said the preparatory work needed to start now, notably for the IAEA to get the necessary clarity on Iran's activities since it reduced cooperation with the agency. 'I think we need to, or the ambition should be to get results in a different way, because the old way is simply not going to be possible anymore,' he said, adding that he foresaw a more active role for the agency. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkiwrzbcc	2024-09-24T23:36:38-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/05/H1K7G4C4C/H1K7G4C4C_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Venue cancels, Israelis mobilize to find the couple a wedding alt...	A post on social media prompts many to offer a plethora of worthy options to ensure the IDF commando wounded on October 7 weds his bride They had been anticipating this moment for nine months, and on Monday it finally happened: Ofri Azulai, 23, from the religious community of Sde Ya'akov, and her partner A., also 23, a naval commando from the Jerusalem area, were married. A. was moderately injured during the battle of Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7 and is still undergoing rehabilitation before he can fully return to his role as a career soldier. A. proposed to Ofri, his partner of two and a half years, three months after his injury. Since then, they had been planning their wedding, which was scheduled for Sunday in the Jezreel Valley. However, on Saturday night, the venue owners informed them they had to cancel due to new Home Front Command instructions. In response to the cancellation, Ofri's mother posted on Hanoch Daum's Facebook page, seeking an alternative venue for the wedding. Just a few hours later, thanks to an overwhelming response on social media, the couple was able to get married at the 'Ein Hemed' hall in Jerusalem. 'We received hundreds of calls from businesses, hotels, event venues, and private individuals offering their gardens, even from people abroad connected to local businesses. It was overwhelming,' said Efrat, the bride's mother, about the outpouring of support. On Monday morning, she added, 'Thanks to the tremendous kindness extended to us at the last moment, the wedding will go ahead today.' During the final preparations before the emotional reunion with her fiancé, Ofri shared: 'He is still undergoing rehabilitation, and his condition is gradually improving. For now, he uses a sleeve on his injured arm. He has a journey ahead, but he will overcome it and return to combat. He has a long military career ahead as he continues his permanent service.' Reflecting on the opportunity to get married despite the challenges they faced, she added: 'We didn't expect such an amazing response; it made us feel like we weren't alone. There's nothing like the solidarity of the people of Israel. Thank you to everyone; you made our evening. Thanks to you, we had the chance to pause and celebrate our love.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1pmv11lcc	2024-09-24T21:38:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/HygEcy10T0/HygEcy10T0_0_105_1280_721_0_small.jpg

UK’s Starmer blunders with call for return of ‘sausages’ from Gaz...	In call for Gaza cease-fire during his first speech at Labour Party conference, British PM mixes up ‘sausages’ instead of ‘hostages’ British Prime Minister Keir Starmer made headlines Tuesday with an unexpected slip of the tongue during his first speech at the Labour Party's annual conference since taking office. Addressing the audience in Liverpool, Starmer mistakenly called for the return of 'sausages' from Gaza instead of 'hostages.' 'I am once again calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, for the return of the... sausages... the hostages...' he said, and although he quickly corrected himself, the gaffe spread rapidly online, with British media outlets humorously highlighting the blunder. In his speech, Starmer also called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and a return to a two-state solution framework and urged for restraint along the Israel-Lebanon border amid rising tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. During the address, Starmer also had to deal with a protester who interrupted his remarks to ask what he was doing to help children in Gaza. Starmer, who succeeded pro-Palestinian advocate Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, responded: 'We changed this party, and that’s why we have a Labour government now.' The crowd responded with applause as security escorted the protester out. Corbyn had previously accused Israel of genocide in Gaza and repeatedly refused to label Hamas as a terrorist organization. He led Labour into the 2019 election, where the party suffered a crushing defeat to the Conservatives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by87tdlcc	2024-09-24T14:14:44-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/r1v4bPxCR/r1v4bPxCR_0_95_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Armed to the teeth by Iran, Hezbollah gears up for ground war in ...	As Israeli airstrikes intensify, Wall Street Journal reports Hezbollah preparing for possible ground offensive in southern Lebanon, armed with Iranian weapons, including advanced anti-tank missiles reverse-engineered from Israel’s Spike; analysts fear such operation could become quagmire for Israel The IDF continued its extensive airstrikes in Lebanon for the second day of Operation Northern Arrows, aimed at degrading Hezbollah’s capabilities as much as possible. While the operation is focused on aerial attacks, the army has not ruled out the possibility of a ground incursion, according to IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. He emphasized that Israel will do whatever is necessary to ensure the safe return of northern residents to their homes after nearly a year of escalating conflict. The heavy strikes and Hezbollah’s intense rocket barrages on northern Israel have raised international concerns about a potential escalation into full-scale war, which could include a ground offensive in southern Lebanon to push Hezbollah terrorists away from the border. Several international news outlets have compared the military capabilities of the IDF and Hezbollah amid these fears. An article published Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal highlighted one of Hezbollah’s 'most lethal' weapons— the Iranian-made Almas anti-tank missile, based on the Israeli Spike missile, which was reportedly captured by Hezbollah during the 2006 Lebanon War and transferred to Iran. The Almas (Farsi for 'diamond') missile is reportedly comparable to advanced anti-tank systems like the American Javelin, which has been used extensively by the Ukrainian armed forces against Russian armored vehicles. It has been used by Hezbollah in recent years for precision attacks. Its first documented use was in January, when Hezbollah released footage of a missile strike on an Israeli radar and other reconnaissance equipment near the border. According to the report, Hezbollah has been bolstering its preparations for a potential large-scale war in recent months, expanding its tunnel network in southern Lebanon, relocating fighters, and increasing arms smuggling. U.S. and regional sources reported that Iran has increased its supply of light weapons, anti-tank missiles and long-range unguided missiles to Hezbollah. A former Hezbollah officer described the south as 'boiling,' claiming, 'We have everything the Iranians have.' During the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah used anti-tank missiles to inflict significant damage on Israeli forces. Last week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted at preparations for a ground invasion, calling it a 'historic opportunity' and expressing eagerness for such a scenario. 'We’re waiting for their tanks. When they come, they’re welcome,' he boasted. Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that Nasrallah’s emphasis on the possibility of a ground invasion indicates his apprehension about such a development. Syrian experience, Ukrainian methods The Wall Street Journal highlighted Hezbollah’s military buildup since the 2006 war nearly two decades ago, noting that the group has amassed tens of thousands of rockets, although thousands were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes in recent days. Hezbollah fighters have gained valuable experience in Syria’s civil war, fighting alongside Russian and Iranian forces and learning conventional military tactics. The report warns that a potential ground offensive in southern Lebanon would play to Hezbollah’s strengths. Military analysts fear such an operation could become a quagmire for Israel, akin to its entanglements in Gaza. 'It’s a little like saying to the United States in 1980, ‘Let’s go back into Vietnam,’' said Daniel Byman, a former U.S. government official and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Analysts cited in the report also suggest that Hezbollah could adopt tactics used by Russia in Ukraine, launching barrages of rockets and drones to overwhelm Israel’s air defenses. Israeli officials reportedly estimate that such a scenario could result in hundreds of casualties. 'It’s not going be a walk in the park,' Assaf Orion, a retired IDF brigadier general, told the Wall Street Journal, adding that preventing all damage in such a war would be impossible. While Hezbollah is unlikely to seek a conventional military victory against Israel, which holds a clear advantage in air power and intelligence capabilities, the terrorist group may try to draw Israel into a prolonged war of attrition. 'Israel can cause destruction in Lebanon, it’s not up for discussion. There is a gap in the military balance,' said Elias Farhat, a retired Lebanese army general. 'But Hezbollah has asymmetric weapons. They proved their skill in using anti-tank missiles in 2006. They are well-trained.' Israeli officials acknowledge the threat. 'Hezbollah is not Hamas—there are similarities, but there are also differences. The terrain is different, the enemy is different, the threats are different and the challenges are different,' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said during a visit with IDF soldiers from the 7th Armored Brigade and the 202nd Paratroopers Battalion, who were training for ground combat in Lebanon. Iran continues to threaten Israel 'One thing I know: every Hezbollah fighter you encounter, you will know how to eliminate. I am 100% sure of that, and they understand it,' Gallant added. 'Hezbollah is aware of what I’m saying and is concerned. You understand very well that the moment may come when we give the order, and this system will move forward. Therefore, we need to make the best preparations.' Gallant noted that Hezbollah has suffered 'severe blows' and that its morale is low. However, he cautioned troops to take Hezbollah’s threats seriously, saying, 'When they say they want to strike us, destroy us, harm us — take it seriously. That is their goal, and they mean it.' Amid fears of a broader conflict, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian did not rule out Tehran’s potential support for Hezbollah in the event of a full-scale war. 'We must not allow for Lebanon to become another Gaza at the hands of Israel,' he told CNN. 'Hezbollah cannot do that alone. Hezbollah cannot stand alone against a country that is being defended and supported and supplied by Western countries, European countries and the United States of America.' However, he stressed that Iran does not seek regional war and accused Israel of pushing for it. Pezhkian’s statements came as Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority, continued to threaten Israel. In Tehran, missile displays were set up alongside signs with messages of vengeance, including one in Hebrew that read: 'You started it, but we’ll finish it.' Pezeshkianemphasized that Iran’s response to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh would come 'in due course.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byumt5gac	2024-09-24T13:38:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/Bkmv8uxRR/Bkmv8uxRR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

I’m confident you will know how to eliminate any Hezbollah fighter you encounter,' defense minister tells troops; Netanyahu to Lebanese: 'Anyone with a missile in their living room won’t have a home' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday expressed confidence in the IDF’s preparations for fighting against Hezbollah after the Israeli military landed a series of unprecedented blows on the Iranian-backed terrorist group in recent days. 'Hezbollah today is not what it was a week ago. It has suffered severe blows to its command, personnel and weaponry,' he told troops during a visit to a military exercise simulating ground combat in Lebanon, involving the IDF’s 7th Armored Brigade and the 202nd Paratroopers Battalion. 'We have more strikes ready. We know what to do and how to execute it. Remember, Hezbollah is not Hamas. The terrain, the enemy and the threats are different. I’m confident that any Hezbollah fighter you encounter, you will know how to eliminate.' He emphasized that Hezbollah understands the IDF’s capabilities and is concerned. 'We must be fully prepared to give the order to move forward when necessary. I see what you’re doing, and it’s extremely important.' He added, 'You are the most trained forces the IDF has ever had. No one has faced a year of fighting like you have. But remember, you’re up against an organization that looks different — its morale is low, but its intentions to harm us are serious.' Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited an intelligence base, where he received a briefing from the head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder and the commander of Unit 8200, Lt. Col. Yossi Sariel. 'I am deeply impressed by the work that has been done and the work that will be done. We will continue to strike Hezbollah,' Netanyahu said. Addressing the people of Lebanon, Netanyahu said, 'Our fight is not with you; it is with Hezbollah. Nasrallah is leading you to the brink of disaster. I told you yesterday to leave homes where he has placed missiles in your living rooms and rockets in your garages. Anyone with a missile in their living room won’t have a home. He is putting your country at risk. Free yourselves from Hezbollah’s grip — for your own sake.' The IDF released data on its operations in Lebanon over the past two days. 'In recent days, the IDF has launched a widespread campaign in Lebanon aimed at degrading Hezbollah’s military capabilities and altering the security reality in the north. Fighter squadrons and drones have conducted nearly 3,000 flight hours over Lebanon. More than 1,500 Hezbollah targets, including over 1,000 types of weaponry, have been struck in 200 different areas,' the military said. The IDF added that the strikes involved over 250 aircraft dropping around 2,000 munitions and targeted roughly 400 medium-range rocket launchers, 70 weapons depots and 80 drones and UAVs. 'The IDF continues its strikes in the area,' the statement said. A senior air force official told Ynet that the scale of targets struck in such a short time is unprecedented. 'This is a broad and synchronized air operation, with intelligence and Northern Command coordination like never before in terms of target quantity and timeframe,' he said, but cautioned that this is not yet a full-scale war with all of the IDF’s capabilities. 'Hezbollah still has rocket-launching capabilities,' he noted. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that NASA satellite data, used to monitor global fires, shows that IDF airstrikes in southern Lebanon have covered an area of 650 square miles. The Fire Information for Resource Management System, based on satellite data, tracks flashpoints and fires caused by the strikes targeting Hezbollah’s weapon and missile stockpiles. According to AP, the satellite data also indicates secondary explosions resulting from the destruction of these weapons. As of Tuesday, numerous fires have been reported across southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1me9ugrc	2024-09-24T10:49:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/SJzdziwgAC/SJzdziwgAC_0_0_1280_852_0_small.jpg

Coastal communities south of Haifa jolted by first rocket alarms ...	Over 170 rockets fired toward northern Israel in three hours; Hezbollah drones target Atlit; Israeli Air Force launches fourth wave of attacks on terror targets; several fatalities reported in Lebanon's Bekaa The Israeli Air Force continued its extensive air campaign against Hezbollah targets across Lebanon Tuesday evening as the Shiite terrorist group launched barrages of rockets at civilian areas in northern Israel. Hostile aircraft infiltration warnings were issued for the towns of Neve Yam, Atlit and Megadim south of Haifa. This marks the first air raid warning siren sounding in Atlit since July 2019. Another siren sounded in Beit Jan in the Upper Galilee and several communities in the Lower Galilee, including Sde Ilan and Givat Avni, shortly after. Shortly earlier, rocket alert sirens were activated in the cities of Safed, Hatzor HaGlilit, Rosh Pina, Nof Kinneret and Elifelet in the Upper Galilee. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force launched another wave of airstrikes Tuesday evening, its fourth for the day. Five buildings were reportedly struck in the southern village of Maliki, resulting in casualties, according to Lebanon’s state news agency. Hezbollah’s Al Manar TV reported widespread strikes in nine locations across southern Lebanon shortly before the Maliki attack. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen network reported one fatality in an Israeli drone strike on the Litani Bridge near Baalbek. Additional reports from the Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar and the state news agency said five people were killed and six others injured in an airstrike on a house in Nabi Ila, in the Bekaa Valley. Earlier, sirens also sounded in Katzrin and the surrounding areas in the Golan Heights, where five rockets were fired, some of which were intercepted. No injuries were reported. Meanwhile, sirens warning of drone incursions were activated in Shlomi, Rosh HaNikra and nearby communities in the Western Galilee. Earlier, around 30 rockets were launched toward Safed and Merom HaGalil, with some intercepted. No injuries or damage were reported. Another barrage of 30 rockets was fired at Shlomi and the western Galilee at 5:27 a.m., with no reported casualties or damage. In total, about 170 rockets were launched within three hours. In Rosh Pina, four rockets landed, one of them striking a house. The four residents, who were in a reinforced shelter at the time, were unharmed but suffered from shock. Other rockets caused damage to infrastructure and open areas. Extensive damage was reported to the house that was directly hit in Rosh Pina. Images showed a large hole above the bathroom, adjacent to the shelter where the family had taken refuge. 'Mom, what happened to my room?!' a child was heard asking in footage from the destroyed home. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1nhswlca	2024-09-24T10:06:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/HkzHsve0R/HkzHsve0R_1_35_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

The protests will kill the hostages': Hostage families divided o...	Brother of hostage Omri Miran claims protests undermining efforts to secure hostages’ release and only ‘driving up the cost’; another family member criticizes ‘politicized’ demonstrations As thousands take to the streets every week demanding the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, some families whose loved ones have been held captive for almost a year fear these protests may be doing more harm than good. The debate over whether to push for a deal or apply military pressure has deeply divided the family of Omri Miran, who was abducted from Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7. Omri’s father, Dani, is part of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, advocating for negotiations, while his brother, Nadav, belongs to the Hope Forum, which calls for increased military pressure on Hamas and opposes any deal that doesn’t secure the release of all captives. 'In recent months, I’ve opposed the direction of the protests,' Nadav said, criticizing what he sees as a shift toward political aims, namely toppling the government. 'We hear [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar instructing the hostages in Gaza to tell their families to protest and bring down the government. And what do Israelis do? They follow Sinwar's orders.' Nadav believes the initial protests, born out of pain, have now been politicized, with calls for nationwide strikes and connections to last year's judicial reform demonstrations driving up the cost of a deal. 'The protests will kill the hostages. They’re essentially blocking a deal and driving up the hostages’ price,' he said, adding that using Omri’s photo to push political agendas 'misses the point.' 'The only one blocking a deal is Hamas— even the Americans say that,' he added. Shimon Or, whose nephew Avinatan Or was kidnapped from the Nova music festival along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, who has since been freed, shares Nadav’s concerns. As a member of the Hope Forum, Or supports the protesting families but believes the movement has taken on a more political tone, undermining its mission. 'I’m frustrated that the protests are now being politicized. It doesn’t help bring back the hostages,' he said. Or is skeptical of Hamas’s intentions, suggesting the group has no real desire to return the hostages. 'Even if we offered everything— all for all, cease-fire and a return to power— they wouldn’t agree. Their strategy is to drag negotiations out for years,' he said. 'I’m frustrated that we keep sending negotiation teams without considering alternatives or making real progress. I’m also frustrated with the government and the prime minister, who says the goal is to destroy Hamas. The envoys he sends to negotiate only strengthen Hamas’ grip, ultimately endangering the hostages.' He believes military pressure has its limits and advocates for taking control of Gaza as the only way to secure the hostages’ release. 'The military objectives are just tactics. The strategy must be to take control of Gaza. Without controlling Gaza, we won’t get the hostages back,' he said. Regarding Avinatan’s photo being used in the protests, Or says, 'I’m less concerned with who’s holding his picture, even if it's Kaplan-linked groups. They don’t care about Avinatan or the hostages— they have their own agenda, like toppling the prime minister.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjwhnvxar	2024-09-24T09:22:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/04/27/SJLWU9h5WA/SJLWU9h5WA_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Turkey's Erdogan says UN, Western values dying in Gaza	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that the values of the United Nations' system and the Western world are dying in Gaza as the conflict continues there, calling for an 'alliance of humanity' to stop Israel. In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Erdogan reiterated his harsh criticism of Israel over its military campaign in the Gaza Strip and the Western countries for their support of Israel. 'Along with children in Gaza, the United Nations system is also dying, the truth is dying, the values that the West claims to defend are dying, the hopes of humanity to live in a fairer world are dying one by one,' Erdogan said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/symhfperc	2024-09-24T09:04:06-07:00

Ibrahim Qubaisi, targeted in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut's Dahieh district, had only recently been appointed to report directly to Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, Israeli officials told Ynet on Tuesday. Following a series of recent assassinations, Qubaisi became one of the group's top military figures, responsible for Hezbollah's strategic capabilities and allegedly involved in recent rocket attacks on Tel Aviv. Officials noted that, at this stage, there is no confirmed verification of his death.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by11w9recr	2024-09-24T07:18:44-07:00

Hezbollah missile unit commander reportedly eliminated in Israeli...	Security sources say Ibrahim Qubaisi killed in attack on six-story building in Lebanese capital's Dahieh district; 6 reported dead and 15 injured in strike The IDF launched a targeted strike on Tuesday in Beirut’s Dahieh district, a Hezbollah stronghold, aiming at Ibrahim Qubaisi, also known as Abu Musa, the head of the terror group's missile unit. Security sources told Reuters that Qubaisi, who is responsible for directing missile attacks toward central Israel, was killed in the attack, which hit a six-story residential building, destroying three floors. Lebanese reports indicate at least six people were killed and 15 injured. 'We are in the midst of intense combat days in the north, and Israel has escalated its offensive against Hezbollah,' a senior Israeli official told Ynet. 'We’ve been systematically dismantling Hezbollah’s capabilities, including destroying thousands of rockets and missiles. 'Our strategy is not to enter a full-scale war but to increase pressure gradually. If Hezbollah didn’t understand the message with the assassination of Ibrahim Aqil, it will in the coming days.' Tuesday’s strike followed an air raid the previous day targeting Ali Karaki, Hezbollah’s Southern Front commander and the group’s third-ranking leader. Initially, reports suggested Karaki had been killed, but Hezbollah later confirmed he survived and was moved to a safe location. Over the past two months, Israel has eliminated two of Hezbollah’s top military leaders, considered part of the founding generation of the organization. In late July, Fuad Shukr, dubbed 'Hezbollah’s chief of staff,' was killed in Dahieh. Last week, Ibrahim Aqil, the head of Hezbollah’s operations unit, was killed alongside senior commanders of the elite Radwan Force. The attack on Dahieh marks the fifth Israeli strike on the Hezbollah stronghold since the beginning of the war, including the assassination of senior Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri. U.S. officials told CNN that the recent Israeli strikes have significantly impacted Hezbollah’s command and control structure, 'setting them back 20 years.' However, they expressed concerns that Iran may intervene to support Hezbollah if it feels its strongest proxy is at risk of collapse. 'We are closer to a regional war than at any time since October 7,' a U.S. official said. On Monday, Israel carried out a massive offensive in southern Lebanon, targeting over 650 square miles. NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System, typically used to track wildfires, detected multiple fires across southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, including intense blazes near the town of Naqoura, close to the Israeli border. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjnvergrr	2024-09-24T06:57:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/SJwIC7eC0/SJwIC7eC0_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
This is why West Africa is now the world's terrorism hotspot	Terrorist activities emanating from West African nations such as Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali up significantly, partly due to spread of Wahabist ideology via Islamic State offshoots like Boko Haram Having slipped undetected into Mali's capital weeks ago, the jihadis struck just before dawn prayers. They killed dozens of students at an elite police training academy, stormed Bamako's airport and set the presidential jet on fire. The Sept. 17 attack was the most brazen since 2016 in a capital city in the Sahel, a vast arid region stretching across sub-Saharan Africa south of the Sahara Desert. It showed that jihadist groups with links to al Qaida or Islamic State, whose largely rural insurgency has killed thousands of civilians and displaced millions in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, can also strike at the heart of power. Overshadowed by wars in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan, conflict in the Sahel rarely garners global headlines, yet it is contributing to a sharp rise in migration from the region towards Europe at a time when anti-immigrant far-right parties are on the rise and some EU states are tightening their borders. According to the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration (IOM), the route to Europe with the steepest rise in numbers this year is via West African coastal nations to Spain's Canary Islands. IOM data shows the number of migrants arriving in Europe from Sahel countries (Burkina, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal) rose 62% to 17,300 in the first six months of 2024 from 10,700 a year earlier, a rise the U.N. and the IOM have blamed on conflict and climate change. Fifteen diplomats and experts told Reuters the swathes of territory under jihadist control also risk becoming training grounds and launchpads for more attacks on major cities such as Bamako, or neighboring states and Western targets, in the region or beyond. Jihadi violence, especially the heavy toll it has taken on government troops, was a major factor in a wave of military coups since 2020 against Western-backed governments in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, the countries at the heart of the Sahel. The military juntas that replaced them have since swapped French and U.S. military assistance for Russians, mainly from Wagner's mercenary outfit, but have continued to lose ground. 'I don't really see the regimes in Mali, Niger and Burkina holding on forever. Eventually one of them is going to fall or one of them is going to lose a substantial amount of territory, which Burkina Faso already has,' said Caleb Weiss, an editor at the Long War Journal and an expert on jihadist groups. 'Then we're dealing with a jihadi state or multiple jihadi states in the Sahel,' he said. Global terrorism hotspot Western powers that previously invested in trying to beat back the jihadists have very little capacity left on the ground, especially since the junta in Niger last year ordered the U.S. to leave a sprawling desert drone base in Agadez. U.S. troops and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used drones to track jihadists and shared intelligence with allies such as the French, who launched air strikes against the militants, and West African armies. But the Americans were booted out after they angered Niger's coup leaders by refusing to share intelligence and warning them against working with the Russians. The U.S. is still looking for a place to reposition its assets. 'Nobody else filled the gap of providing effective air surveillance or air support, so the jihadis are roaming freely in those three countries,' said Wassim Nasr, a senior research fellow at The Soufan Center, a think-tank in New York. A Reuters analysis of data from U.S. crisis-monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) found that the number of violent events involving jihadi groups in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger has almost doubled since 2021. Since the start of this year, there have been 224 attacks a month on average, up from 128 in 2021. Insa Moussa Ba Sane, regional migration and displacement coordinator for the International Federation of the Red Cross, said conflict was a major factor behind the increase in migration from the West African coast, with rising numbers of women and families seen along the route. 'Conflicts are at the root of the problem, combined with the effects of climate change,' he said, describing how floods and droughts are both contributing to the violence and driving an exodus from rural to urban areas. In Burkina Faso, perhaps the worst affected of all, jihadists affiliated with al Qaeda slaughtered hundreds of civilians in a day on Aug. 24 in the town of Barsalogho, two hours from the capital Ouagadougou. The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) in Sydney said Burkina Faso topped its Global Terrorism Index for the first time this year, with fatalities rising 68% to 1,907 – a quarter of all terrorism-linked deaths worldwide. About half of Burkina Faso is now beyond government control, the U.N. has said, a factor contributing to soaring rates of displacement. 'The two, big veteran terrorist (groups) are gaining ground. The threat is spreading geographically,' said Seidik Abba, president of the CIRES think-tank in Paris, referring to al Qaida and Islamic State. A U.N. panel of experts that monitors the two organizations' activities estimates that JNIM, the al Qaida-aligned faction most active in the Sahel, had 5,000-6,000 fighters while 2,000-3,000 militants were linked to Islamic State. 'Their declared goal is to establish Islamic rule,' said Nasr of The Soufan Center. Jihadists use a mixture of coercion and the offer of basic services, including local courts, to install their systems of governance over rural communities that have long complained of neglect by weak, corrupt, central governments. 'Come with us. We will leave your parents, sisters and brothers alone. Come with us and we will help you, we will give you money,' said a man from Mali, describing his encounters as a teenager with jihadists who attacked his village. 'But you can't trust them, because they kill your friends in front of you.' The young man fled and made it to the Canary Islands last year before moving to Barcelona. He declined to be identified fearing reprisal attacks on family members still in Mali. Launchpad scenario The jihadi groups operate in different areas, at times fighting each other, though they have also struck localized, non-aggression pacts, reports by U.N. experts say. The groups receive some financial support, training and guidance from their respective global leaderships, but also collect taxes in areas they control and seize weapons after battles with government forces, the reports say. European governments are divided on how to respond to the conflict. Southern European nations who receive most migrants favor keeping communication with the juntas open, while others object because of human rights and democracy concerns, nine diplomats in the region told Reuters. One African diplomat said the EU needed to remain engaged as the issue of migration was not going to go away. Even if Europe were to agree a shared approach, it lacks the military capacity and political relationships to help because the Sahelian countries don't want Western input, the diplomats said. 'We do not have any influence in those countries on extremist groups,' said General Ron Smits, head of the Dutch Special Forces. The other major worry for Western powers is the potential for the Sahel to become a base for global jihad, like Afghanistan or Libya in the past. 'All these violent extremist organizations do have aspirations of attacking the United States,' General Michael Langley, head of U.S. Africa Command, told reporters this month. Other officials and experts, however, say the groups have not declared any interest in carrying out attacks in Europe or the United States as yet. Will Linder, a retired CIA officer who runs a risk consultancy, said the attacks in Bamako and Barsalogho showed that efforts by the juntas in Mali and Burkina Faso to shore up security were failing. 'The leadership of both countries really need new strategies for countering their jihadist insurgencies,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1fsh7g00	2024-09-24T06:29:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/05/22/SylmNdt8K00/SylmNdt8K00_0_0_3000_1882_0_small.jpg

Jerusalem Design Week opens under 'Ark' theme memorializing war	Dozens of artwork commemorating war in Gaza placed in Jerusalem event including a memorial for a brother taken hostage and greetings to soldiers on the frontline; Alongside many cancellations from international exhibitors, local creators, both Jewish and Arab, have united to express their vision of recovery and hope for the day after Jerusalem Design Week returns to the capital for its 13th year and will take place, as every year, at Hansen House in Jerusalem and other locations throughout the city. Nonetheless, this is not a typical year; it is a year marked by war and mourning, protests and instability, and 101 hostages, at the time of writing, who are still held in Gaza. The organizers of Design Week chose to respond to the situation with a unique theme: 'The Ark.' When the waters rise and the winds rage, the ark becomes a refuge where life is preserved, and thoughts turn to the day after the disaster. Jerusalem Design Week 2024 echoes the biblical story of the flood, a tale of destruction but also of redemption. Noah’s Ark was a human architectural creation that bore the responsibility of saving lives, bringing hope after disaster, and rebuilding society. For one week, Hansen House will be filled with installations, exhibitions and performances from all design disciplines. All the works respond to the theme of the ark in one way or another, addressing restoration alongside commemoration and reflection alongside dreaming of a better future. Amid a global boycott of Israeli culture, in which many international participants turned a cold shoulder to Design Week, there have been the most local collaborations between the event and Jerusalem's cultural institutions than ever before (under the general management of Smadar Tsook and Ran Wolf, Ran Wolf Company). Additionally, this year saw a record number of proposals submitted by Arab designers wishing to present at the event (all of whom submitted their proposals in Hebrew, unlike in previous years). As part of this, and in a unique move, the event will expand beyond the boundaries of Hansen House; for this one-time project, the city's legendary red bus has been enlisted to lead visitors on a daily route starting throughout the city and ending at the flagship event at Hansen House. Design Week will continue through September 26, and among the dozens of exhibits and installations, we have gathered the projects, experiences and exhibitions not to be missed: Yuval Buchstab’s 'The Matchmaker' project Designer and wood artist Yuval Buchstab received the offer to participate in Design Week while sitting shiva for his brother, Yogev Buchstab, who was taken hostage in Gaza on October 7. Yogev was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nirim along with his wife, Rimon Kirsch-Buchstab, who was released at the end of November in the first hostage deal after 53 days in captivity. On July 22, the family received the devastating news that Yogev had been murdered in captivity, and his body was recently returned to Israel. 'During the shiva, the curators of 'The Matchmaker' project, which I had worked with in the previous Design Week, reached out to me,' says Yuval. 'This year, the project pairs designers with musicians, and when they heard about Yogev, they decided to dedicate the exhibition to his memory.' Yogev was a musician who specialized in building experimental musical instruments. From his home workshop near the Gaza border, Yogev created unique and wonderful instruments, sometimes alone, sometimes with his brother Yuval. 'The offer came at a difficult and confusing time during the shiva, where it was hard to motivate myself to take action,' Yuval shares. 'I had plans to commemorate Yogev and do things to help us remember him, so the offer came at just the right time.' As part of the project, Yuval decided to complete a musical instrument that he and his brother had designed together four years ago: an electric wooden mbira, the national instrument of Zimbabwe. 'The mbira has a very pleasant and soothing sound, like a music box or lullaby,' says Yuval. 'My goal was to finish the project we started and make a few more copies, so people could come to the exhibition and play the mbiras together, interact with them, and maybe even play in Yogev's memory.' In the interactive installation, the audience will indeed be able to come and play the instruments that Yuval and Yogev built during better days. 'I imagine it as a space filled with pleasant sounds, a mix of several kalimbas at once, creating a whirlpool of sounds,' Yuval says. Nir Oz – Flowers of redemption and mourning Recent graduates of the Visual Communication Department at Bezalel, Eden Feinberg Sabach and Alon Butbul, didn’t expect to spend most of their final year in reserve duty near the Gaza border. The two met during their studies and were both called up to reserve duty at the beginning of the war, serving in the same intelligence unit. 'Shifting between studies and reserves were tough for us. Switching people, reality, language, city – it took a lot of energy,' Feinberg Sabach shares. 'When it came time to work on our projects, it was clear we'd do them together, and that we’d focus on something related to the situation. Then Alon told me he had been to Nir Oz and that we needed to do a project about that place.' Butbul shares that 'two months after October 7, my grandparents came to visit from France. After I took them on a tour of Nir Oz – a tour that deeply affected us – it became clear that I wanted to do a project about the kibbutz. The project idea came from an unexpected direction: amidst the heavy destruction of the kibbutz, I noticed something beautiful – the kibbutz’s botanical garden. 'The initial thought of focusing on something beautiful was confusing. What’s the point of beauty now?' Feinberg Sabach says, 'But after a walk in the botanical garden, we realized that the gate we entered through, the greenery, the kibbutz's unique beauty, was the right entry point for our project.'' As part of their project, the two worked on a photo book that began with a focus on the kibbutz's vegetation and gardens and evolved into documenting every home in the kibbutz, door to door. 'The book's opening interview is with Ran Fauker, who established and maintained the botanical garden,' Butbul explains. 'It was a symbolic start for us, the idea of creating life in a barren desert, acclimatizing plants and ensuring their survival in harsh conditions,' he said. Another conversation included in the book is with Rita, a kibbutz resident who took it upon herself to water some of the plants after the war broke out so that when the residents return, they would be greeted with greenery and flower blooms. She regularly photographs the plants to show the evacuated kibbutz members, attempting to preserve a sliver of hope. 'At first, we knew Nir Oz had gone through something terrible, but we didn’t know the full extent of the community’s suffering,' adds Feinberg Sabach. 'It's a kibbutz with a relatively small community, so the portion of it that was affected, in terms of those killed and taken hostage, was enormous. 'At some point, we realized the kibbutz would have to be demolished and rebuilt because most of the houses were burned and damaged beyond habitation. Once we understood that the sights around us would disappear and become part of history, we knew we had to document them. We embarked on an intensive documentation journey, from door to door.' The book they created includes an index of all the homes in the kibbutz, documenting every door and façade. It thus becomes a kind of historical document of a painful moment in the kibbutz’s history – the moment after the destruction and before the rebuilding. Additionally, the book features an index of plants from the botanical garden. Throughout the process, they were guided by Naama Tobias and Noam Shechter. 'Our work is for the kibbutz, and the entire book is dedicated to it, in memory of the murdered and in hopes of the return of the hostages,' Butbul concludes. The two even held a crowdfunding campaign to ensure that every family in the Nir Oz community could receive a copy of the book as a gift. 'Pool Party' by Bina Baitel International architect and designer Bina Baitel moved from Jerusalem to Paris 25 years ago and has since worked with some of the world's largest design companies. Over the years, Baitel has not exhibited any projects in Israel. However, this year, in light of the political climate in her social environs, Baitel decided to return to Jerusalem and present a special project she created for Design Week. 'It's hard to explain the Israeli side here in France, they don't understand it at all,' Baitel shares. 'I’ve never been a political person, and I don’t agree with many things happening in the Israeli government. But after October 7, I felt I needed to help explain the Israeli perspective in some way.' After the cultural attaché at the Israeli consulate in France approached her about Design Week, Baitel decided that now was the time to exhibit in Israel for the first time. 'I wanted to present an installation of hope for peace and also contribute to public diplomacy. I knew that the best way I could do this was through an artistic installation.' 'Pool Party' is an immersive installation inviting participants to a post-flood party. Using padded elements like lifebuoys, a ladder and a bench, the installation creates a space of comfort and sharing, responding to the theme of the ark. 'The idea was to create elements that resemble remnants after the flood, after the storm,' says Baitel. 'All the elements are padded with shiny fabric, like a mirror. The idea is to reflect the city of Jerusalem as well as the concept of water. The goal was to build a space for dialogue where one can sit on the bench and talk about coexistence.' The installation combines naive elements and an architectural language, in Baitel’s signature style. 'The material we worked with, along with the shapes, were meant to convey optimism, childhood, even innocence. It’s part of the atmosphere the installation is supposed to evoke.' The project was produced remotely by Baitel and the Design Week team, with her in Paris and them in Jerusalem. 'I never imagined that all this could be done in two months, but the production was amazing. They gave me an assistant to track the process in Israel, and they introduced me to an upholsterer, a welder, and a carpenter—all amazing, and all agreed to do it quickly and with joy. 'It’s very rare to work at such a pace in France,' says Baitel, who designs for companies like Roche Bobois, Leroy Merlin, IKEA, La Redoute, Habitat and the Korean brand iloom. 'Besides that, I designed the medal for the Paris Marathon this year. The French government has purchased dozens of my works, and I exhibit in many museums and galleries across Europe,' she adds. 'The Forecast' – An outdoor exhibition with many participants The outdoor exhibition, 'The Forecast,' is a collaboration between designers Shahar Kedem and Amit Portman, with the Meteorological Institute and the weather site 'Yerushamaim.' Curated by Kedem, the exhibition invited designers and artists to respond to issues of nature and weather. The exhibition serves as a kind of alternative meteorological farm in the courtyard of Hansen House, with the installations functioning as measuring devices. Some of the works artificially generate weather phenomena, others respond to real-time local weather, and some attempt to measure it in alternative ways. 'The choice of the Meteorological Institute as the central body for collaboration came from the overall theme of the ark through the basic ecological angle of natural disasters,' Kedem explains. 'Our concern about nature's instability or the inability to predict the future connects to this thing called 'forecast,' something at the end of every news broadcast, and we hold onto it as something to rely on for tomorrow.' All the projects participating in the exhibition were designed especially for it, most of which Kedem calls 'functional works,' meaning they have some dimension of kinetics, response, or change depending on the weather throughout the exhibition. For example, Studio 'Magenta' presents a large, tall sculpture made of dozens of small iron sheets connected at a great height, moving according to wind direction and speed, resembling a flying carpet. The artist collective 'Malhamami' presents an ark where, with the help of light and water, the conditions are created for a rainbow to appear. Through artificial means, a space is created where one can peek inside and see the rainbow enclosed in a capsule, creating climatic conditions in a very structured situation. Alongside the projects, a 'Control Center' will be set up in the courtyard, in collaboration with 'Yerushamaim' and EnvyTech. 'We’re essentially setting up a measurement station within the exhibition to measure temperature, humidity, radiation, and other metrics in real-time,' Kedem says. 'You’ll be able to stand inside the station and understand not only what the weather is but also what it’s supposed to make us feel and wear – connecting the weather to our sensations.' Orange lifeboat, survival and a message to the front 'This year, we chose to be both relevant and active,' says Hansen House director Smadar Tsook and curators Dana Benshalom and Sonia Olitsky. 'This was the feeling conveyed to designers this year – how to harness design as a tool for coping, not just to talk about the pain but to channel creation as a therapeutic tool. During Design Week, Hansen House becomes an ark—a boat where everything happens, is preserved, and formed while the flood rages outside.' Among the works are pieces dealing with survival and preparation for a journey. For instance, an oversized inflatable orange lifeboat by creator Adi Anna Telezhynski, reminiscent of refugee and migrant lifeboats headed for a better future. The works of Michal Luria address survival in extreme conditions, with her designing chic floral travel clothes. Noa Brosh created the UPF50 brand, combining high fashion and technology through a capsule collection offering maximum protection of about 98% against UV radiation. The 'Life Bag' was created by Eilon Armon and Amit Adini and contains food, emergency equipment, medical supplies, clothing for all weather, and sleeping gear, similar to what ultra-marathon runners carry in harsh field conditions. On the theme of emergency response, Alexander Frocht’s project 'Open in Case of Emergency' responds to the spirit of the times and its challenges. It's a set of simple instructions for quickly creating sturdy and comfortable furniture when resources are limited. The kit comes in flat packages and is intended for times of war, natural disaster, displacement, or urgent evacuation when there is a need to quickly assemble living furniture. Next to the ark imagery are works symbolizing the point where the water recedes, and there’s hope for land. For instance, Dafna Kaplan and Yael Ziv created delicate white feathers using 3D printing to wrap the exhibition visitors. They explain that feathers are the most complex form of skin in nature, and due to their unique properties like weight and softness, they are an irreplaceable raw material. Feathers are also a significant symbol in human culture. Raya Cohen created a giant white inflatable and deflating dove, symbolizing how fragile the concept of peace is. Architecture students at the University of Haifa’s design school were asked to create an architectural solution for a 'blackout scenario' in which Israel is hit by a cyberattack or significant power plant failure, causing the electrical grid to collapse for an extended period. The students designed a series of interventions based on alternative energy, distinguishing between different lighting conditions, using energy stored during the day for dark nights, and minimal red lighting on full-moon nights. They designed residential buildings that become illuminated, energy-harvesting bike paths, and a 'Firefly Park' in public spaces. This architectural project was translated into a video shown at Jerusalem Design Week in a pavilion made of thousands of connected black cones forming a round, elevated black ball. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjxqejec0	2024-09-24T04:08:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/16/HJZExTH6A/HJZExTH6A_1_176_781_440_0_small.jpg

The Kremlin warned on Tuesday that Israeli strikes on Lebanon had the potential to completely destabilize the Middle East and widen the conflict there. Asked about the Israeli strikes, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call: 'This is an event that is potentially extremely dangerous when it comes to the expansion of the conflict, to the complete destabilization of the region. Of course, this is of extreme concern to us.' In a separate statement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow condemned what she called 'indiscriminate' strikes on Lebanon that target civilians. 'It is urgent to stop the spiral of violence before the situation spirals completely out of control. We call for an immediate cessation of hostilities,' she said. 'We must do everything possible to prevent the Middle East from plunging into a full-scale armed conflict, the devastating consequences of which will inevitably affect everyone in the region and beyond. We are ready to coordinate with international and regional partners to prevent such a catastrophic scenario.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by1q5zxa0	2024-09-24T03:55:58-07:00	
Hezbollah rocket explodes in front of car on the highway	There have been 90 rockets fired on northern Israel since midnight; Here's what to do if you hear an alert siren while in your car Hezbollah continued to launch rockets Tuesday morning toward the Upper Galilee and the Jezreel Valley, after overnight and early on Tuesday it launched rockets toward Afula, Nazareth, the Haifa Bay area and many other populated areas. During the barrage toward Krayot-Haifa Bay Tuesday morning, a rocket exploded on Route 70, near the northern Israeli city of Tamra. In footage from a vehicle's dashcam taken during the rocket warning siren, the moment of impact can be seen a very short distance away. Watch the video: Since midnight, Hezbollah has launched over 90 rockets at Israel. According to the directives of the Home Front Command, the moment a rocket alert siren sounds one must stop the vehicle on the side of the road, turn off the engine and get out of it as safely as possible. If it is possible to reach a nearby building at the time of the warning, do so, and if not, move away from the vehicle over the side of the road or the safety barrier, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands for 10 minutes. 'There were no alarms or warnings. Everything was sudden. I saw people running away, everyone was in shock and didn't know what to do,' Omri Abu-Rish, whose car camera recorded the impact near the vehicle on Route 70, told Ynet. The Home Front Command called on the residents of Arab society to obey for instructions and to enter protected spaces during alarms, but in many localities there are almost no protected spaces. According to the IDF, Hezbollah launched five missiles toward the Jezreel Valley at around 9:30 a.m. Some were intercepted and others exploded in open areas. Fragments of interceptions were detected in several localities in the vicinity - including in the Arab Israeli town of Yafa an-Naseriyye, where a large piece of shrapnel was seen falling in the street, as residents gathered around it. In Moshav Balfouria in the Jezreel Valley, a crater was created from one of the falls. At the same time, Hezbollah launched about 50 rockets toward Kiryat Shmona and the surrounding area. Most of them were intercepted, but some of them exploded in the city area. Direct damage was recorded, among other things, to the warehouses of the municipality of Kiryat Shmona. No injuries were reported. Five fire crews from the Galilee-Golan station were called to the scene, and worked to put out the fire in the warehouses and other open areas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ltc11xar	2024-09-24T03:37:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/HygRbw11gRR/HygRbw11gRR_0_125_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

U.S. official: 'Hezbollah has been taken 20 years backward'	Biden administration source says Israel's recent attacks and eliminations severely hurt Iran-backed terror group; Iranian president doesn't deny Tehran's support of its strongest proxy in Lebanon Monday's intense series of strikes in Lebanon, which followed a string of eliminations of Hezbollah leaders in recent weeks, has led U.S. officials to believe that Israel dealt a significant blow to Hezbollah's command. 'They’ve probably been taken 20 years backward,' a U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday. In the past two months, two of Hezbollah's most senior military figures, considered part of the terror group's founding generation, have been eliminated. In a strike in Dahieh at the end of July, Fuad Shukr, dubbed 'Hezbollah's Chief of Staff' was eliminated. Last week, Ibrahim Aqil, Hezbollah’s head of operations, was terminated alongside senior commanders of the group's elite Radwan Force. On Monday, the IDF attempted to target Ali Karaki, Hezbollah's commander of the southern front in Lebanon, to no success. Hezbollah issued an official statement saying Karaki was 'fine' and had been 'moved to a safe location.' According to CNN, the U.S.'s biggest concern now is that Iran might decide to intervene in the conflict to aid Hezbollah. 'Tehran has not intervened yet, but they will if they believe they are about to lose their most powerful proxy force,' another official told CNN. According to the sources, 'We are the closest we’ve been to spiraling to a regional war.' U.S. officials believe the operation attributed to Israel in Lebanon, involving the detonation of Hezbollah's pagers and walkie-talkies, has shaken the terror organization and hampered its communication abilities, especially following Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's directive for members to avoid using mobile phones. On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also warned of the war potentially escalating into a regional conflict, saying that 'the danger does exist that the fire of events that are taking place (in Lebanon) will expand to the entire region.' Pezeshkian made these remarks in an interview with CNN in New York, where he's set to deliver a speech at the UN General Assembly. He didn't rule out the possibility of Iran aiding Hezbollah and noted that the terror organization is up against a state 'armed to the teeth and has access to weapons systems that are far superior to anything else.' 'We must not allow for Lebanon to become another Gaza at the hands of Israel. Hezbollah cannot do that alone. Hezbollah cannot stand alone against a country that is being defended and supported and supplied by Western countries, European countries, and the United States of America,' Pezeshkian added. He further stressed that a regional war 'can be dangerous for the future of the world and planet Earth itself, so we must prevent the ongoing criminal acts being committed by Israel.' 'We want to live in peace, we don't want war,' Pezeshkian said on Monday. 'It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict.' He asserted that Iran understands that there are no winners in war. 'There is no winner in warfare, everyone loses in war and conflict. We are only deluding ourselves if we think someone will be victorious in a regional war.' Meanwhile, the New York Times reported on Tuesday that U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is making last-ditch efforts to reach a hostage and cease-fire deal in Gaza while working to lower the flames on the northern border. According to the American outlet, Biden's advisors are aware the time before his tenure in office is running out and chances of reaching a deal now seem much lower amid ever-increasing bouts between the IDF and Hezbollah in the north. According to the New York Times, some of Biden's advisors are having difficulties hiding their disdain for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's inaction and added a recent talk between the two ended in a shouting match. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1vcp11xr0	2024-09-24T03:20:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/Bkg11ORRaaR/Bkg11ORRaaR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Sweden says Iran behind thousands of text messages calling for re...	Iran’ Revolutionary Guard hacked into a text messaging service last year and sent thousands of messages urging Swedes to take revenge over the string of public burnings of the Quran; Sweden is torn between its commitment to free speech and its respect for religious minorities Swedish authorities accused Iran on Tuesday of being responsible for thousands of text messages that were sent to people in the Scandinavian country calling for revenge over the burnings of Islam’s holy book in 2023. Officials in Stockholm claimed that Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard carried out 'a data breach' and managed to send 'some 15,000 text messages in Swedish' over the string of public burnings of the Quran. Senior prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said that a preliminary investigation, carried out by Sweden’s SAPO domestic security agency, showed that 'it was the Iranian state via the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC, that carried out a data breach at a Swedish company that runs a major SMS service.' The Swedish company was not named. There was no immediate comment from Iranian authorities on the accusations from Sweden. In August 2023, Swedish media reported that a large number of people in Sweden had received text messages in Swedish calling for revenge against people who were burning the Quran, Ljungqvist said, adding that the sender of the messages was 'a group calling itself the Anzu team.' Swedish broadcaster SVT published a photo of a text message, saying that 'those who desecrated the Quran must have their work covered in ashes' and calling Swedes 'demons.' The protests were held under the freedom of speech act, which is protected under the Swedish constitution. The rallies were approved by police. However, the incidents left Sweden torn between its commitment to free speech and its respect for religious minorities. The clash of fundamental principles had complicated Sweden’s desire to join NATO, an expansion that gained urgency after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine but needed the approval of all alliance members. Turkey and its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had temporarily blocked Sweden’s accession, citing reasons including anti-Turkish and anti-Islamic protests in Stockholm but Sweden finally became a NATO member in March. At the time, the Swedish government said it 'strongly rejects the Islamophobic act committed by individuals in Sweden,' adding that the desecrations did not reflect the country’s stand. In July last year, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a statement saying that 'the insult to the Holy Quran in Sweden is a bitter, conspiratorial, dangerous event' and that the desecrations have 'created feelings of hatred and enmity' in Muslim nations toward the people burning the Quran and their governments. In a separate statement, SAPO’s operational manager Fredrik Hallström said Tuesday the text messages ' intent was to also 'paint the image of Sweden as an Islamophobic country and create division in society.' He accused 'foreign powers' of seeking to 'exploit vulnerabilities' and said they were 'now acting more and more aggressively, and this is a development that is likely to escalate.' He did not name any specific country. Meanwhile, Sweden’ justice minister, Gunnar Strömmer, told Swedish news agency TT 'that a state actor, in this case Iran, according to (SAPO’s) assessment is behind an action that aims to destabilize Sweden or increase polarization in our country is of course very serious.' There is no law in Sweden specifically prohibiting the burning or desecration of the Quran or other religious texts. Like many Western countries, Sweden doesn’t have any blasphemy laws. 'Since the actors are acting for a foreign power, in this case Iran, we make the assessment that the conditions for prosecution abroad or extradition to Sweden are lacking for the persons suspected of being behind the breach, 'Ljungqvist said. Ljungqvist who is with the Sweden’s top prosecution authority said although the preliminary investigation has been closed, it 'does not mean that the suspected hackers have been completely written off' and that the probe could be reopened. Sweden’s domestic security agency in May accused Iran of using established criminal networks in Sweden as a proxy to target Israeli or Jewish interests in the Scandinavian country. Iran’s Embassy in Sweden could not be reached for a comment on Tuesday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkl300wlca	2024-09-24T02:54:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/06/28/8ir5z6ynq/8ir5z6ynq_0_131_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

She has experienced 10 childbirths, but Einat's 11th delivery took place underground, in a makeshift hospital ward in the parking garage designed to withstand a missile attack; 'I wondered if it would be quiet at night, and indeed it was, except for the sweet sounds of the newborns' Einat Nissim recently welcomed her 11th child, but this birth was unlike any she had experienced before. She was the first to deliver in the fortified underground facility at Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, shortly after the hospital's maternity and delivery services were relocated to the parking garage on sublevel 3. The newborn, weighing 7.91 lbs., joins the family of 10 other children of Einat, 39, and Moran, 43, from Moshav Ahihud: Tegal, 20; Elhai, 18; Barak, 16; Yinon, 14; Efrat, 12; David, 11; Ateret, 8; Hillel, 5; Yosef, 3; and Chamutal, 2. 'I arrived at Rambam on Sunday afternoon and delivered just half an hour later,' Nissim recalls. 'Before I left home, my mother mentioned there might be renovations at the maternity ward in Rambam. I assured her, 'Mom, I've delivered all my children at Rambam. I trust them and always go there.' When I arrived, they informed me that the delivery room was on sublevel 1, which seemed odd, but then they directed us further down to sublevel 3.' She adds: 'I realized the move was due to the war, but I had no idea the location was a parking garage. The delivery was swift and everything went smoothly. The midwives were wonderful, providing great support and assistance. It was only after the birth that I noticed my surroundings, and my husband pointed out, 'You know we're actually in a car parking garage.' It's astonishing how they transformed it into a fully functioning hospital in just one day. It's surreal. I wondered if it would be quiet at night, and indeed it was, except for the sweet sounds of the newborns.' Nissim notes that there are quite a few other mothers around her. 'It's not the level of privacy I had during my previous births but, given the circumstances, the staff is doing everything they can to make us feel comfortable and ensure our privacy,' she says. Michal Kranzler, director of Nursing, Division of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Rambam Health Care Campus, explains that she and her staff have learned many lessons from their experiences during the Second Lebanon War, which are now being applied to the current situation. 'At that time, our approach was more medically focused, but now we prioritize the mother's experience, her comfort and her emotional support, while ensuring the safety of both mother and child. In addition to being in the safest bunker possible, this is achieved through a slightly different care model that enables mothers to stay with their companions and newborns at all times, known professionally as 'zero separation.'' Kranzler adds: 'The current situation is challenging for both our mothers and our staff. Many of us are balancing our duties at Rambam with what's happening at home or on the front lines. However, we are dedicated to doing everything we can for the women who come to us, allowing them to concentrate on what truly matters now: their childbirth and the newborns they are bringing into the world.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rkt11i1er0	2024-09-24T02:12:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/B1yu11a1A0/B1yu11a1A0_0_6_1280_721_0_small.jpg
IDF calls Lebanese living near Sidon, telling them to leave their...	The Lebanese Al-Mayadeen network, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported attacks in southern Lebanon on Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has so far claimed responsibility for eight attacks against Israel. The last two, according to the organization, were aimed at Kiryat Shmona and the Naftali Mountains. Also, according to a Lebanese report, families living near Sidon, received calls from the IDF, demanding that they evacuate their homes.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybc0leaa	2024-09-24T01:58:17-07:00	
Trump vs Ukraine's president: 'Zelensky is greatest salesman, wan...	Trump speaks in battleground state of Pennsylvania hours after Ukrainian president tours factory there supplying ammunition for Ukraine; Ukrainians fear that if he wins the elections, Trump will stop U.S. military aid and hand victory to Putin; Zelensky to present 'victory plan' in New York Former U.S. President Donald Trump issued early Tuesday morning his harshest attack to date on the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in the shadow of the Ukrainian fear that if Trump wins the presidential election in November and returns to the White House he will stop aid to Kiev and hand victory to Russia. At a rally in Pennsylvania Monday night in the U.S., Trump said that Zelensky wants the Democrats 'to win this election so badly,' and presented him as someone who manages to underhandedly extract money from Washington. 'I think Zelensky is the greatest salesman in history,' Trump said at the rally. 'Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with $60 billion.' Trump added that: 'He wants them (Democrats)to win this election so badly, but I would do differently - I will work out peace.' The former president reiterated that, if he is elected president again, he will contact Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin and urge them to come to an agreement. Trump's words come amid concern in Kiev and the European Union about the possibility that he will return to the White House. Trump has often over the years praised the power of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other authoritarian and dictatorial leaders, and is seen as a much less confrontational candidate for the Russian president than his rival Kamala Harris and incumbent President Joe Biden. Washington is Ukraine's main arms supplier in its war against Moscow, but quite a few Republicans want to dramatically cut that aid, and Trump himself has often described it as a waste of money.' He also consistently refuses to state that he wants Kiev to win the war. His statements that if he is elected he will put an end to this war' have made it reasonably clear that Trump will stop the flow of funds and weapons to Zelensky's army or at least significantly reduce them, thus handing victory to Putin in his war against Ukraine. Trump's statements against Zelensky Monday night contradict the line that some of his allies have tried to adopt recently, claiming that Ukraine would actually be happy if Trump returned to the presidency because only he – according to them – has the talent needed to negotiate with Putin on ending the war. Zelensky himself is currently in the United States for the annual gathering of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and last week Trump said that he would likely meet with the Ukrainian president during his stay in the U.S. However, sources close to Trump said Monday night that no meeting has been scheduled between the two. Although in July Trump spoke with Zelensky by telephone, the two have not met face to face since Trump ended his term as president. Zelensky previously admitted that he cannot predict what Trump will do if he wins the election, but expressed hope that he will continue to provide U.S. military aid to Ukraine. In an interview with the BBC in July, he said that 'working with Trump will be difficult, but we are people who work hard.' Zelensky: 'Putin is afraid. The US needs to be decisive' Over the weekend, Zelensky visited a weapons manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania, accompanied by the state's Jewish Democratic governor Josh Shapiro, an ally of Harris. Their joint visit to the plant angered some Trump supporters, since Pennsylvania is a key state in the election, a state that divides its 19 electoral votes and because winning it is extraordinarily crucial for Harris to win the entire race. Americans of Eastern European origin, including those from Ukraine and Poland, have become in recent months a group of voters that Trump and Harris often woo, and this is especially true for Pennsylvania, where there are large Ukrainian and Polish communities. In an interview with ABC over the weekend, excerpts of which were revealed Monday night, Zelensky said that Ukraine is 'closer to the end of the war than we think,' and in a post he published overnight on Telegram after meeting with U.S. congressmen, he emphasized that decisive actions by the U.S. is required to bring about the end of the war. Also in the interview with ABC he said that, from a position of strength, Ukraine could make Putin stop the war. In the last few days, people around Zelensky are talking about a 'victory plan' that he formulated and which he intends to reveal later this week in Washington. So far he has not presented its details, but has said that it would lay the groundwork for a peace summit to which Kiev wants to invite Moscow later this year. The head of Zelensky's office Andrii Yermak said Monday in New York that the plan includes accelerating the process of Ukraine's admission to NATO - a step that Russia has made clear it will never agree to. Putin, meanwhile, insists that peace talks with Kiev can only begin after it withdraws its forces from large areas that Moscow has occupied in the east and south of Ukraine and gives up its ambition to join NATO. Russia currently controls about 20% of the territory of Ukraine and is making progress in its military campaign in the east, where it took control of a series of villages in the Dunbas region in recent weeks. Zelensky told ABC that the dramatic invasion of the Ukrainian army into the Kursk region in western Russia, where his soldiers remain a month and a half after they infiltrated it, revealed Putin's weakness: 'He is very afraid. Why? Because his people saw that he was unable to defend all of his territory.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1escr1ra	2024-09-24T01:24:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/Sys7bRyRC/Sys7bRyRC_0_200_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Swedish authorities accused Iran on Tuesday of being behind thousands of text messages that were sent to people in the Scandinavian country calling for revenge over the burnings of Quran, Islam’s holy book in 2023. Officials in Stockholm claimed that Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard carried out 'a data breach' and managed to send 'some 15,000 text messages in Swedish' over the string of public burnings of the Quran.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2blelac	2024-09-24T01:19:49-07:00

Rockets explode one after the other, some damaging municipal warehouses; Israeli Fire and Rescue services operating to extinguish fires caused by strikes At least 50 rockets were fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon at Kiryat Shmona and the surrounding area on Tuesday morning, in the latest barrage on the beleaguered northern Israel. The majority of the rockets were intercepted and several fallen projectiles were identified in the area, according to the IDF. Damage was caused to buildings in the area. Israeli Fire and Rescue services were operating to extinguish fires caused by the strikes in the area. About 50 missiles were detected firing towards Kiryat Shmona and the surrounding area, some of them were intercepted. In the documentation from the city, you can see rockets exploding in several locations one after the other. Minutes earlier, at about 9:30 a.m. rockets were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Some of the projectiles were intercepted and the rest fell in open areas. Fallen fragments from the interceptions were identified in the area. The Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya reported that, since the morning hours on Tuesday, nine lightly injured people were brought in, following the rocket barrages that were launched into the Western Galilee. Two young women ages 19 and 20 and two women ages 37 and 43 were injured in two car accidents during an alarm, one near Yarka and the other in Nahariya. In addition, a 62-year-old man and his 58-year-old wife, sustained head injuries when a rocket fell near their car. Three others, ages 69, 54, and 38, were injured while running to protected areas. Dozens of fragments of interceptors fell during the night throughout the Galilee, one of them, weighing more than 60 kilograms, fell near the city hall of Nof HaGalil, a town overlooking the city of Nazareth and the Jezreel Valley. After it was inspected, the fragments were transferred to Mayior Ronen Plot's office. 'We had a difficult night with a lot of luck,' he said. The barrage of rockets toward Kiryat Shmona scored a direct hit on a warehouse of the municipality. There were many reports to police of interceptor and rocket fragments falling in the Kiryat Shmona area and around Afula. Meanwhile, five firefighting teams are working at several areas in Kiryat Shmona following the latest barrage from Lebanon. While the rocket attacks continue, mayors and municipal councils across the north are outraged by the lack of protection in the area. The mayor of Safed, Yossi Kakon, told Ynet that: 'We have been living this for a year. The residents have hope that the problem may finally be taken care of. Half of our residents are not protected. There is great frustration and great fear.' Hatzor Haglilit Regional Council Head Michael Kabsa added: 'Intercept fragments hit several vehicles yesterday, this is our awful routine. We have no protection - this is a decades-old omission.' Ido Greenblum, head of the Kiryat Tivon local council, said: 'We canceled the education systems and I don't know for how long, it's not something that will last just a day or two.' Early Tuesday morning, the Homefront Command said schools must remain shut in the Carmel Mountain Ridge and the Jezreel Valley extending the range of only distance learning south of the Haifa-Tiberias line. Overnight some 20 rockets and missiles targeted the Lower Galilee where at least four people were reported to have suffered light injuries. Shrapnel fell in Nazareth and the surrounding areas. At least five people were hurt when they ran to seek shelter. Israel on Monday announced a nationwide state of emergency in anticipation of the Hezbollah fire spreading further south toward the center of the country after Haifa and its surrounding areas including the Carmel mountain ridge came under attack. A million Israelis were forced to seek shelter during the Hezbollah attacks on Monday after the Iran-backed terror group expanded its fire further into Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byakoye0r	2024-09-24T01:07:32-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/SJFVCyl0C/SJFVCyl0C_0_25_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israeli couple holds wedding kilometers from Lebanon border	Aviram Afota and Shani Vaknin say Hezbollah's extended rocket fire ruined their plans to marry in Haifa, forcing them to find a way to celebrate with their friends and family in another venue Israeli couple Aviram Afota and Shani Vaknin, both from Western Galilee, married on Monday in a Nahariya synagogue kilometers away from the Lebanon border despite security concerns after they realized their planned wedding set at a venue in Haifa would be unable to take place. The couple only had a few hours to find a makeup artist, event designer, DJ and catering, after everyone they had booked was hesitant to come to the new wedding venue in Nahariya. Eventually, after 12 grueling hours of last-minute planning, they were joined by 70 family members and friends in a wedding held according to the IDF Home Front Command's wartime guidelines. Among the professionals who stepped in to help were Mirit Zamir and her daughter Noa, residents of Acre. Both had left the city two days ago for Ra'anana, as their family home lackes a safe room and Mirit's husband, Eyal, is serving in the reserves. 'Several people reached out to me saying they were looking for a designer for a wedding that had been canceled. It was difficult to get back to the north from Ra'anana, but I understood that this is where I needed to be, and that I was needed now,' Mirit said. Just before the couple walked under the chuppah, the rabbi gave an explanation about the nearby shelters available. 'This won’t be a sad wedding because those who need to be here are standing right beside us,' the groom said. 'Sure, it would have been more joyous to be in a hall with all our friends and extended family, but we’ll celebrate with them later. Today’s chuppah is our way of poking back at Hezbollah, right here in Nahariya,' he added. 'No one will defeat us, Nasrallah won’t win,' Aviram's father, Yosef Afota added. 'We’ll make him regret the day he dared to go to war with us and especially for trying to ruin my son’s wedding.' The couple also wished for the return of Israeli hostages and the safety of IDF soldiers. 'At this moment, we ask that all our hostages and soldiers return safely and that our family, evacuated from our home in Moshav Shomera nearly a year ago, will return there as well.' Shani’s father and older brother have been part of Shomera’s local alert squad since October, only returning to their temporary apartment in Nahariya on weekends. Another brother recently returned from combat in Gaza and is now serving as a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade. 'We’re going through a difficult time, but we’re here and thanking God that we can even stand under the chuppah tonight and that our daughter is starting her married life in Israel,' Shani’s mother, Ayelet Chen Vaknin, said. 'This is our strength, the strength of the people of Israel – that we stand here against Nasrallah and Hezbollah,' she said. 'They won’t take away our joy. I also prayed for the safe return of all the hostages, that our soldiers will return home and that our troubles will end, because we’re exhausted.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sj00ah6y0r	2024-09-23T22:58:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/r1diaJ0aC/r1diaJ0aC_0_15_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Four people suffered light injuries as they ran for cover in the overnight barrage and the morning rockets fell in the sea causing no damage or injury. The IDF said it was responding to the source of the fire. Lebanese media said the Beqaa region in eastern Lebanon came under attack early on Tuesday morning Israel on Monday announced a nationwide state of emergency in anticipation of the Hezbollah fire spreading further south towards the center of the country after Haifa and its surrounding areas including the Carmel mountain ridge came under attack.

Iran willing to lay down weapons if Israel does too,' Pezeshkian...	Iranian president says his country wants peace not war but warns of irreversible consequences; says Iran willing to return to 2015 nuclear deal; denies providing missiles to Russia 'We want to live in peace, we don't want war,' Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said. 'It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict,' he told reporters upon arriving in New York to attend the UN General Assembly. 'We are willing to put all our weapons aside so long as Israel is willing to do the same,' he said adding that Israel wants to drag the Middle East into a full-blown war by provoking Iran to join the nearly year-old conflict between Israel and Tehran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, he said on Monday, warning of its 'irreversible' consequences. The Foreign Ministry in Tehran was quick to issue a statement denying the reported comments by the president. Pezeshkian, a relatively moderate politician who was elected in July promising a pragmatic foreign policy, accused the international community of silence in the face of what he called 'Israel's genocide' in Gaza. Pezeshkian's call to resolve the Middle East conflict through dialogue came after Israel unleashed an intense wave of air strikes against Hezbollah on Monday, making it the deadliest day in Lebanon in nearly a year of conflict between Israel and the Tehran-backed terror group. 'We will defend any group that is defending its rights and itself,' Pezeshkian said when asked whether Iran will enter the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. He did not elaborate. Pezeshkian said weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran and its military structures. 'We are still ready to live up to the same framework' that was agreed on in 2015, he said, but the Europeans tried to get Iran to sign a different accord, adding that Iran was willing to sit down with Europeans and Americans to negotiate.' Iran's regional policy is set by the elite Revolutionary Guards, who answer only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's top authority. Pezeshkian has repeatedly affirmed Iran's anti-Israel stance and its support for resistance movements across the region since taking office last month. Asked if Iran would retaliate for the assassination of Palestinian militant group Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil in late July, Pezeshkian said 'We will respond at the appropriate time and place, in an appropriate manner'. Haniyeh's killing, which both Tehran and Hamas have blamed on Israel, has aroused fears of direct conflict between Tehran and its arch-foe Israel in a region shaken by Israel's war in Gaza and a worsening conflict in Lebanon. Iran's powerful Guards and Khamenei have vowed 'severe' revenge for Haniyeh's killing, which happened while he visited Tehran. So far, Tehran has held back from direct retaliation against Israel, which has neither confirmed or denied its involvement. Three senior Iranian officials told Reuters in August Tehran has been involved in intense dialogue with Western countries and the United States to calibrate retaliation against Israel for Haniyeh's assassination. 'We were told that within a week there will be a ceasefire agreement' between Israel and Iran-backed Hamas, 'but that week has never come and instead Israel has kept expanding its attacks,' Pezeshkian said. Pezeshkian insisted that Iran has not and will not supply Russia with ballistic missiles to attack Ukraine. 'We have never approved of Russia's aggression against Ukrainian territory,' he said, adding that the two countries should establish a dialogue. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syar00oyrc	2024-09-23T20:34:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/21/rkpUyY7oC/rkpUyY7oC_0_212_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Katz to UN: 'Israel will no longer tolerate this war of attrition...	In letter to UN Security Council, foreign minister demands full implementation of Resolution 1701; 'Hezbollah deliberately embeds itself within civilian infrastructure, using the population as human shields.' he wrote Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on the UN Security Council Monday to take action against Hezbollah and Iran, declaring that 'Israel will no longer tolerate the war of attrition that Hezbollah and Iran are trying to impose on us.' In a letter to the council, Katz demanded full enforcement of Resolution 1701, which mandates the disarmament of Hezbollah and prohibits armed groups in southern Lebanon. He accused Hezbollah of embedding itself within civilian areas and using the population as human shields, urging the council to 'strongly condemn the latest attack launched by Hezbollah at Iran’s behest.' Katz also highlighted the Israeli airstrike against Hezbollah leadership in Beirut last Friday, saying it was necessary to prevent planned infiltrations into the Galilee and potential attacks similar to those carried out by Hamas on October 7. 'Israel does not seek a full-scale war,' Katz wrote, 'but we will take all necessary measures to defend ourselves and our citizens in accordance with international law.' He blamed Iran for directing Hezbollah’s aggression since October 8, as well as arming its proxies, including the Houthis, who he said threaten both Israel and international stability. He urged the international community to intensify sanctions on Iran and to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. Katz also emphasized Israel’s diplomatic efforts, saying that over the past year, Israel has pursued a diplomatic solution with Lebanon to allow the safe return of both Israeli and displaced Lebanese civilians. He claimed that Hezbollah rejected these efforts and linked the issue to a cease-fire in Gaza. 'While Israel has shown remarkable restraint over the past 11 months, we will not endure the continued war of attrition that Hezbollah and its patron Iran are trying to force upon us,' Katz continued. He concluded by urging the Security Council to act to ensure the full implementation of Resolution 1701. 'Now, this council must act to ensure the full implementation of Resolution 1701. Hezbollah is intentionally spreading its military operations within civilian infrastructure in Lebanon, using the population as human shields. Israel has monitored this and will act to protect its people from Hezbollah's attacks. 'We have issued warnings to civilians in Lebanon near buildings and areas used by Hezbollah for military purposes, advising them to evacuate for their safety. I call on the Security Council to strongly condemn Hezbollah’s latest offensive, directed by its Iranian patron, and its ongoing attempts to destabilize the region.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byjzoikar	2024-09-23T15:16:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/27/S18I2XMNC/S18I2XMNC_190_115_851_479_0_small.jpg
Ready-to-launch missile in family home attic: IDF unveils strikes...	IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari showcases terror group's caches hit in recent airstrikes, alongside image of missile stored in southern Lebanon family home; 'This is Hezbollah's cruel tactic' The Israeli military has launched a broad offensive targeting Hezbollah’s weapons arsenal, IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari announced Monday. He outlined the stockpile hit in the strikes, including long-range cruise missiles, rockets with 1,000-kilogram warheads, medium- and short-range rockets, drones and Sayyad 107 munitions, calling them 'strategic capabilities.' Throughout the day, Israeli fighter jets and drones targeted around 1,300 Hezbollah sites in Lebanon. Hagari shared an image of a missile stored in a hydraulic system on the roof of a family home in southern Lebanon, highlighting Hezbollah’s use of civilians as human shields. 'Hezbollah is hiding long-range rockets. This missile is ready to be launched from an opening in the roof. Below the attic lives a Lebanese family, used as human shields. This is Hezbollah's cruel tactic,' he said. Hagari also presented footage of an airstrike on a house in a southern Lebanon village, showing secondary explosions. 'This is further proof that Hezbollah has turned southern Lebanon into a combat zone,' he added. 'The IDF’s operations in the past 24 hours demonstrate high-level planning and precise execution, resulting in significant achievements,' Hagari said. 'However, challenging days lie ahead. We remain focused on defense across all fronts.' He urged Israeli citizens to 'act responsibly' and reiterated that the state of emergency on the home front remains in effect, with no changes to current Home Front Command guidelines. 'We will provide immediate updates if anything changes. I’ll be here to keep you informed. It’s important to emphasize that we have challenging days ahead,' he said. When asked about the possibility of a ground operation, Hagari responded, 'We’ll do whatever is necessary to bring residents home. There are detailed plans in place. We’re working—let us do our job.' Meanwhile, Lebanon’s Ministry of Health reported that 492 people have been killed and 1,645 injured in IDF airstrikes across the country since Monday morning. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1yib8kar	2024-09-23T15:06:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/Hk11aWhXJRR/Hk11aWhXJRR_0_109_829_467_0_small.jpg
This is just a promo,' Israel warns Hezbollah after fiercest day...	Operation Northern Arrows in full swing, with Israel striking more than 1,300 Hezbollah targets; death toll in Lebanon reaches 492; senior officials say Israel committed to offensive until northern residents can safely return home but hint at cease-fire if terror group agrees to settlement The IDF conducted on Monday its largest series of airstrikes in Lebanon since the start of the war, targeting around 1,300 Hezbollah sites across the country, including in southern Lebanon and deep into the Bekaa Valley. The strikes come as the Lebanese Health Ministry reported 492 people killed and 1,645 injured in one of the deadliest days in Lebanon since the end of the civil war in 1990. The IDF announced that the name of the ongoing offensive is Operation Northern Arrows. Hours after the operation was named, Israel launched additional strikes deep inside Lebanon. The IDF targeted long-range cruise missiles, heavy rockets with 1,000-kilogram warheads and explosive drones stored in civilian homes despite prior warnings to residents. Amid the escalation, the IDF called on Lebanese civilians to evacuate areas near Hezbollah weapon sites, prompting a mass exodus of tens of thousands from the south. Hezbollah responded by launching more than 200 rockets into Israel, targeting the Galilee, Golan Heights, the Haifa Bay, Jezreel Valley, Carmel and, for the first time, Haifa and the West Bank. Most rockets were intercepted by air defenses, and others fell in unpopulated areas, causing damage but no serious injuries. In a Cabinet meeting that lasted four hours on Monday, Israeli ministers praised the military for its achievements, including the assassination of top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil last Friday. While no decisions were made, some officials indicated that a full-scale war could still be avoided if Hezbollah agrees to a cease-fire. 'This is just a promo. We have tens of thousands more targets,' a senior security official said. 'If Hezbollah continues, so will we.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at a potential trip to New York later this week, where he is scheduled to address the United Nations General Assembly. Despite the ongoing fighting, Netanyahu indicated his intention to attend, citing the importance of Israel’s diplomatic messaging. Some ministers suggested that Foreign Minister Israel Katz could go in his place if Netanyahu cancels his trip due to the security situation. Meanwhile, the government declared a special state of emergency across the country, citing a high risk of attacks on civilians. Home Front Command guidelines remain unchanged, with schools north of Haifa set to remain closed until Thursday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1wt5810r	2024-09-23T14:41:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/S1l51IM1C0/S1l51IM1C0_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

US sending more troops to Middle East as Israel-Hezbollah violenc...	The U.S. is sending a small number of additional troops to the Middle East in response to a sharp spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon that has raised the risk of a greater regional war, the Pentagon said Monday. Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder would provide no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do. The U.S. currently has about 40,000 troops in the region. On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, two Navy destroyers and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Sixth Fleet area in Europe on a regularly scheduled deployment. The ships' departure opens up the possibility that the U.S. could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Arabian Gulf, in the region in case more violence breaks out. 'In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,' Ryder said. 'But for operational security reasons, I'm not going to comment on or provide specifics.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1lrnb1cc	2024-09-23T13:16:48-07:00	
They slaughtered, raped and buried us alive': Syrians praise blo...	Many Syrians still remember atrocities committed by terror group in support of Assad during civil war; 'We would be just as happy if the devil himself killed them, it is the right of all those oppressed by Iran and its militias,' one Syrian remarks The war between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated to a new phase, and in neighboring Syria, there are many who are glad to see the repeated blows the Lebanese terror organization has taken in recent days. Many Syrians, especially the Sunni population, have not forgotten Hezbollah's brutal role in their country's civil war, where it indiscriminately killed their relatives and friends. As part of the Iranian-Shia axis, Hezbollah supported the regime of Syria's Alawite president, Bashar al-Assad, fighting alongside Shia and Alawite forces against the rebels. Fearing the loss of their critical foothold in Syria, Iran and Hezbollah, along with Russia, provided crucial assistance to Assad’s military, which ultimately led to the defeat of the rebels. Hezbollah is blamed for numerous atrocities during the Syrian conflict. The group deployed forces to various parts of the country, and many of its commanders gained extensive combat experience, which may now be used in its fight against Israel. In the wake of the recent blows to Hezbollah, the joy in Syria — particularly on social media — has been unmistakable, as those who suffered at the hands of Hezbollah relish its suffering. A Syrian journalist, Hadi al-Abdallah, posted a video on the social media platform X, explaining why some Syrians oppose Hezbollah, consider its members terrorists, and celebrate each Israeli strike against the group. In a video he shared on Thursday, he emphasized that it doesn’t matter who attacks Hezbollah: 'Even if the devil himself came and killed Hezbollah’s criminal members, we’d be just as happy.' In the seven-minute video, Abdallah showed footage from Hezbollah’s operations in Syria, recounting the group’s cruelty. As he presented one video, he said: 'This footage shows Hezbollah fighters attacking the city of Zabadani in Syria’s Qalamoun region. Blind hatred. They attacked civilian homes and everyone in them—women, children, the elderly. All that mattered to them was that they were killing.' Saudi Arabia’s Al-Arabiya network also published a video highlighting the celebratory reactions in Syria after last week’s explosions targeting Hezbollah’s communication networks in Lebanon. In one scene, a man is shown handing out sweets, saying, 'This is to mark the deaths of some, or many, of Iran’s party members in Lebanon (Hezbollah).' Another clip features a man saying, 'The pagers exploded. What great news. We Syrians aren’t used to hearing such good news.' The video also included reactions from Syrian users on X, many of whom oppose Hezbollah. One user wrote, 'My problem with Hezbollah is that they killed my brother and my cousins. They killed our neighbor's daughter, a baby less than a year old, while she was in her mother’s arms. They killed my people in Madaya. My problem with Hezbollah is that they destroyed my country.' Another Syrian user added, 'Hezbollah participated in the killing of the Syrian people in the worst ways, including sieges and starvation. All the free people and those oppressed by Iran and its militias have the right to rejoice today.' Al-Arabiya emphasized that Syrians described the pager explosions — one of the most significant blows to Hezbollah in its history — as 'punishment for Hezbollah’s killing of children and raping of women.' Syrian journalist Qutaiba Yassin also shared his analysis of the events on X this past Saturday, writing, 'All three forces responsible for harming Syrians — Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah — have fallen into a trap.' He added, 'Hezbollah today will never be the same. Hezbollah is now at the beginning of its end.' On Friday evening, as Hezbollah began releasing the names of its fighters killed in recent Israeli strikes and the targeted assassinations of senior Radwan Force commanders in Beirut's Dahiya, Syrians were quick to react to the official announcement of the death of a militant named Hussein Ali Randour. On X, various posts surfaced about Randour, who, according to a video published by Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hadath network, was known as the 'Butcher of Madaya' in Syria — responsible for starving Syrians and burying them alive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkl5pzjac	2024-09-23T13:11:38-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/rJrRV6AaA/rJrRV6AaA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Government approves move in hastily convened phone vote, citing 'high likelihood of attacks on civilians across the country'; Home Front Command guidelines remain unchanged The Israeli government approved a nationwide state of emergency for civil defense on Monday evening through an urgent phone vote, following a proposal by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The decision allows the Home Front Command to operate with extended authority until September 30 amid rising security concerns. According to the attached document, the declaration enables the Home Front Command to issue alerts and instructions to the public proactively, regardless of enemy actions, and to manage potential threats effectively. 'Due to recent developments in the conflict and the high likelihood of attacks on civilians throughout the country, this declaration is necessary to guide the civilian home front,' the document stated. While the emergency declaration itself does not impose restrictions on civilians, it grants military and state authorities the ability to make rapid adjustments, including giving the Economy Minister the power to keep essential workers at their posts. The current Home Front Command guidelines remain unchanged, with no school in areas north of Haifa for the next two days. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjff11bk0c	2024-09-23T12:55:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/S1l51IM1C0/S1l51IM1C0_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah improves day by day, and so do we,' says Iron Dome com...	Captain M. highlights important role of Israel's air defense systems on the northern border but stresses evolving conflict means complete interception accuracy is impossible As winds of war blow on the northern border, those responsible for Israel’s defense and enabling the IDF to strike aggressively are the Iron Dome soldiers, intercepting dozens and hundreds of munitions fired toward Israel from Lebanon, Iraq and Iran. 'When I hear sirens, I get into alert mode and know it’s my time to act,' Capt. M., commander of an Iron Dome battery in the north, told Ynet on Monday. At 26 years old, she carries the heavy responsibility of deciding what and where to intercept. 'Each shift is managed by several roles, including interceptors and technicians monitoring the screens,' she explained. 'I sit in the central interception supervision vehicle, where we detect the targets. The moment a launch toward Israel is located, we identify the targets and decide what to do with them within seconds — either intercept them or let them fall according to policy. It’s a heavy responsibility and takes rapid decision-making,' she added. Capt. M. said will never forget the night of August 25, when Hezbollah attacked the north following a preemptive strike against them. 'We prepared for their fire and manned our strongest shift,' she recalled. 'After a few hours in the vehicle, it began. Suddenly, we received a barrage image unlike anything we’d ever seen before, with an enormous number of missiles and drones. The northern front hadn’t seen such a barrage in years. And everyone worked quietly, each person focused on their target,' she recounted. Capt. M.’s twin brother serves as an IDF drone operator. She enlisted in 2017 as an Israeli Air Force’s Air Defense Command soldier and went through a long training process. She was a platoon commander for military recruits and then a battery operations officer, including during Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. After several roles, she arrived in the north and has been commanding the Gideon Iron Dome battery for four months. 'We’re preparing for various challenges on the northern front, from precise rocket and cruise missile targets to drones. It’s a daily threat. Hezbollah improves day by day, and so do we.' Air defense soldiers have faced criticism, some justified, for not having a comprehensive response to Hezbollah’s short-range drones which sometimes explode without warning and are considered particularly deadly. 'As new capabilities are introduced to the systems during the fighting, we improve in this area. The Iron Dome is built with defense layers but it’s important to clarify — we won’t be 100% accurate at all times,' Capt. M. said. 'In the end, we do our best to protect civilians,' she continued. 'Hezbollah’s evolving threat, their quantities and the quality of the targets are significant. We’ve been at war for 11 months, with regular and reserve personnel working around the clock and we have very high success rates. Still, civilian adherence to guidelines is key to the defense systems’ success.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ieza0tc	2024-09-23T12:11:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/yk14088732/yk14088732_0_127_567_320_0_small.jpg

Southern Lebanese villages are empty': IDF air campaign spurs ma...	IDF calls on Lebanese residents to leave homes near Hezbollah weapon sites, prompting mass exodus; schools in Beirut, Tripoli and eastern Lebanon truned into shelters; UN reports over 113,000 people displaced before latest attacks Thousands of residents in southern Lebanon were seen fleeing their villages and towns toward Beirut and northern regions on Monday, as the IDF launched extensive airstrikes across the country. The mass evacuation followed an unusual warning from IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, who revealed that Hezbollah operatives had planned to launch a cruise missile from a civilian home in southern Lebanon and urged residents to distance themselves from Hezbollah weaponry. Hagari’s warning, widely covered by Arab media, stated that Israeli strikes would continue, advising residents to leave areas near Hezbollah assets. 'Hezbollah is endangering you,' Hagari said. The Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat headlined, 'The Israeli military urges Lebanese residents to avoid Hezbollah positions,' while social media was flooded with images and videos of the exodus from southern Lebanon. A split-screen broadcast by Saudi Arabia’s Al Hadath TV showed heavy traffic at the southern entrance to Beirut on one side and footage of the intense Israeli airstrikes on the other. Lebanese Education Minister Abbas Al-Halabi announced that schools in Beirut, Tripoli and other cities would open as shelters for those displaced from the south. 'The displacement to Mount Lebanon and Beirut has forced us to open schools as shelters,' Al-Halabi told Qatar’s Al Araby TV. According to AFP, hundreds of families have fled southern Lebanon following the airstrikes. The dramatic move comes after Lebanese Health Minister Firas Al-Abiad said on Saturday that preparations were underway to accommodate displaced persons should the conflict escalate. Although the images of evacuation were particularly striking on Monday, residents had already been gradually leaving southern border villages since the start of hostilities. According to Arab reports, in November 2023, the number of displaced people stood at 29,000, rising to 110,000 by August. The Saudi network Al Arabiya recently reported that 'Southern Lebanese villages are empty—113,000 displaced cannot return,' citing a United Nations report stating the number of displaced as of September 6. The report also noted that nearly a year after the conflict began, residents are unlikely to return anytime soon, and the number of displaced continues to grow each month. Visits to southern Lebanese border villages, even briefly, now require coordination with the Lebanese army, the Red Cross and UNIFIL forces. In recent weeks, Lebanese media have shown images of residents systematically evacuating belongings from villages like Odaisseh and Meiss El Jabal in southern Lebanon. Ibrahim, a resident of the town of Kfarkela near the Israeli border, told Al Arabiya last week, 'The town is almost empty due to the ongoing fighting. Some residents return only to check on their properties or take a few items, at pre-arranged times and under the escort of the Lebanese army and UNIFIL.' Ibrahim, who has refused to leave Kfarkela, said that over 500 of the town’s 1,500 homes have been destroyed in the strikes. Another resident, from the village of Khiam, who wished to remain anonymous, said, 'The village is deserted. The destruction is extensive, and it’s impossible to return until the war is completely over.' Reports from early 2024 indicated that most displaced persons were from the areas of Bint Jbeil, Marjayoun and Tyre in southern Lebanon and had sought refuge in other parts of Tyre, Nabatieh, Sidon, Baabda, Beirut and other locations. The number of displaced has increased since then, with more villages joining the list. Following Monday's airstrikes and images of the highways, it seems that even those who had insisted on staying in southern Lebanon over the past few months are now changing their minds. For many, fleeing northward to Beirut and Dahieh is no longer considered safe either, after an Israeli airstrike on Friday killed senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil and other leaders of the terrorist group's elite top Radwan Force. The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar reported that on Saturday, residents of Dahieh fled with their children to Mount Lebanon, many without a place to stay. Some slept in their cars, while others searched for apartments late into the night. Mount Lebanon cities have begun receiving a new wave of displaced people from the south and Dahieh. Unlike the high rents that followed the assassination of Fuad Shukr, prices are now more reasonable. Some Palestinian-Syrian families have opted to temporarily relocate to Syria to escape the possibility of an expanding war. By midday Monday, the IDF reported having struck over 300 targets across Lebanon and is preparing for continued large-scale operations. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported at least 182 dead and 727 wounded nationwide, later revising the numbers up to 274 fatalities and 1,024 injuries. At around 3 p.m., the IDF issued another targeted warning to residents of the Bekaa Valley, urging them to evacuate. In a statement by IDF Arabic Spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, accompanied by a map indicating the area to be evacuated, he called on residents to leave their homes 'urgently' within two hours. 'IDF actions are targeting Hezbollah’s terrorist infrastructure in your villages,' the statement read. 'The IDF does not want to harm you—if you are in or near a building containing Hezbollah weapons, you must leave and move at least 1,000 meters outside the village or go to the nearest central school and not return until further notice.' The statement concluded: 'Anyone who remains near Hezbollah members, their facilities, and weapons is endangering their own lives and those of their families.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy11bszjrr	2024-09-23T10:09:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/S14VXykCR/S14VXykCR_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

IDF confirms targeted strike aimed at Ali Karaki, one of Nasrallah’s last remaining top aides; Lebanese source claims Karaki eliminated in operation An Israeli airstrike in the Dahieh district of Beirut on Monday evening targeted Ali Karaki, the head of Hezbollah’s southern front and the group’s third-highest-ranking official, just three days after the assassination of senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil and several high-profile figures in the terrorist group's elite Radwan Force. A security source confirmed to Reuters that Karaki was the target of the strike but said his fate remains unknown. Meanwhile, Sky News Arabia reported, citing a Lebanese source, that Karaki was killed. In a brief statement, the Israeli military said it carried out a targeted strike in Beirut. Ynet security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that Karaki and Talal Hamiyah are the only remaining senior members from Hezbollah’s old military leadership following a series of recent assassinations in Beirut. Shortly before the airstrike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video message to the people of Lebanon, saying that 'Israel’s war is not with you, but with Hezbollah.' He accused Hezbollah of using Lebanese civilians as human shields by placing rockets and missiles in residential areas. 'These rockets and missiles are aimed directly at our cities and civilians,' Netanyahu said. 'To protect our people from Hezbollah attacks, we must neutralize this threat. This morning, the IDF warned you to evacuate the danger zone. Please take this warning seriously. Don’t let Hezbollah endanger your lives or the lives of your loved ones. Leave the area now. After our operation is complete, you can return home safely.' On Friday, along with Aqil, who helped found the Radwan Force, 16 senior commanders from the unit were killed in an airstrike in Dahieh. According to the IDF, the Radwan Force was tasked with capturing parts of the Galilee in the event of war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyefhz1ac	2024-09-23T09:31:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/B1Aw011y0C/B1Aw011y0C_1_248_720_405_0_small.jpg

Lower Galilee home takes direct hit from Hezbollah rocket, inches...	I immediately knew it hit the house; you can just tell,' says the homeowner who escaped unharmed with his family by taking shelter in a reinforced safe room Hezbollah rockets continued to strike northern Israel on Monday, with a house in Givat Avni sustaining a direct hit. The family inside escaped unharmed by taking shelter in a reinforced safe room. 'We got into the safe room, I locked the door, and then there was this crazy explosion,' said David Yitzhak, whose home was hit. 'I immediately knew it hit the house; you can just tell.' Yitzhak described the narrow escape, saying the impact was right beside the safe room. 'These rooms save lives. Thirty centimeters saved three lives today—it’s surreal.' He emphasized the importance of following safety instructions during rocket attacks. 'Anyone who doesn’t follow instructions, it needs to be documented. You need to run when told to; that’s the message everyone needs to hear.' Israeli police reported multiple rocket impacts across the Lower Galilee and said officers and bomb disposal experts were on-site managing the affected areas. Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency services said that a 59-year-old man was injured by shrapnel near the Golani Junction, a 25-year-old was hurt while running to a shelter, and three others were treated for shock. All five were evacuated to Baruch Padeh Medical Center in Tiberias. Ten rockets were fired at the Lower Galilee, including the one that hit Yitzhak’s home. Another 25 rockets targeted the Safed and Sea of Galilee area, with some intercepted and others landing in open fields near Ammiad and Nahal Amud. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant held a special briefing to assess the readiness of Israel’s civilian home front in anticipation of a potential escalation. He was joined by Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Amir Baram and Home Front Command Chief Maj. Gen. Rafi Milo. 'The resilience of the civilian front is key to enabling the IDF to fight and strike the enemy,' Gallant said. 'In the coming days, the public will need to show composure, discipline and full compliance with Home Front Command guidelines. This saves lives.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ihhxy0c	2024-09-23T08:31:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/rJZ1Qk0RT0/rJZ1Qk0RT0_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Planned for years': Behind the scenes of IDF's strikes in Lebano...	Security sources explain logic behind wave of strikes blanketing Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, every consideration calculated before attacks launched Security officials gave a glimpse behind the scenes of the intense waves of IDF strikes in Lebanon over the past few days — two of which began on Monday targeting about 300 Hezbollah sites, according to the IDF. Lebanese reports indicated that 100 individuals have already been killed in Monday’s Israeli strikes, with over 300 injured. 'Every house or site that’s attacked is one where weapons are present,' security sources told Ynet in a conversation on Monday. According to them, these operations have been planned by the IDF for years, specifically by the IDF Military Intelligence Directorate, the Northern Command and the Israeli Air Force. 'This operation involved hundreds of fighter jets simultaneously striking Hezbollah’s locations, infrastructures and launch sites,' they noted. Before the targets are bombed by hundreds of fighter jets across Lebanon, they’re examined by the Military Intelligence Directorate and the Northern Command. The strikes themselves are managed from the Northern Command's war room’s Air Force command rooms where Northern Command chief Major General Ori Gordin is stationed. 'The IDF Chief of Staff, who has been in the IDF’s headquarters in Tel Aviv since morning, is overseeing the operation.' The IDF has been urging Lebanese civilians to distance themselves from buildings known to house Hezbollah’s weapons since Monday morning. Meanwhile, local Lebanese reports indicated that 'hundreds have fled southern Lebanon.' As part of Israel’s efforts to move civilians away from targeted areas, Lebanese sources claimed Israel has taken over radio stations and sent messages to citizens urging them to evacuate immediately. Lebanon reported over 80,000 calls were received in the country calling on residents to evacuate. Rocket fire toward northern Israel has continued in recent hours, with the IDF Spokesman’s Unit reporting approximately 25 launches from Lebanon toward the Sea of Galilee and Safed areas. 'Air defense soldiers successfully intercepted several launches and impacts were identified in open areas and near Kibbutz Ami’ad,' the IDF said in a statement. The military also reported that following alerts in the Lower Galilee, about 10 launches crossed from Lebanon. Several impacts were identified in Israel, including one in Giv’at Avni. Two firefighting teams responded to a house hit by a rocket, searching for anyone trapped inside and disconnecting electricity to prevent fires. The house’s residents were in a safe room during the hit, avoiding injury. The attack’s peak may still be ahead. A security official told Ynet on Monday the military will launch a 'large-scale' attack across rural areas of Lebanon. According to him, Hezbollah’s possible response could include expanding its range of fire, possibly targeting 'selected sites in Tel Aviv.' During a situational assessment on home front preparedness held on Monday, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, 'In this new phase of the war, home front resilience is the key that allows the IDF to fight, achieve successes and strike the enemy. This has been ongoing for nearly a year and is being done impressively.' He added, ahead of the expected offensive, 'We’re deepening our strikes in Lebanon, and this course of action will continue until we achieve our objectives — returning the northern residents to their homes safely.' 'This success also depends on the home front’s behavior and that’s why we’re coordinating and focusing our efforts. The difference between success and failure lies in citizens following the guidelines and finding shelter promptly — this has saved lives.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1hhpca6c	2024-09-23T08:08:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/r1d7I20pA/r1d7I20pA_0_145_2048_1152_0_small.jpg

Iran ready for nuclear talks at UN 'if other parties willing', fo...	Iran is ready to start nuclear negotiations on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York if 'other parties are willing', Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Monday in a video published on his Telegram channel. The U.S., under then-President Donald Trump, withdrew in 2018 from a nuclear accord signed in 2015 by Iran and six world powers under which Tehran curbed its disputed nuclear program in return for a lifting of international sanctions. Indirect talks between Washington and Tehran to revive the deal have stalled. Iran is still formally part of the deal but has scaled back commitments to honour it due to U.S. sanctions reimposed on the Islamic Republic. 'I will stay in New York for a few more days than the president and will have more meetings with various foreign ministers. We will focus our efforts on starting a new round of talks regarding the nuclear pact,' Araqchi said. He added that messages have been exchanged via Switzerland and a 'general declaration of readiness' issued, but cautioned that 'current international conditions make the resumption of talks more complicated and difficult than before.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjcvu1yrr	2024-09-23T06:08:59-07:00

Amid Monday's wave of attacks in Lebanon, the IDF's Daniel Hagari warned resident of the Bekaa that Israel's planned attack is expanding; He accused Hezbollah of storing weapons in civilian buildings and knowingly putting them in danger The IDF attacked more than 300 targets throughout Lebanon by noon on Monday and prepared for the continuation of the massive attacks. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari sent a targeted warning to the residents of the Lebanon Valley, saying 'We will attack soon.' 'This morning, the IDF launched extensive, proactive airstrikes, based on precise intelligence, aimed at degrading the capabilities and infrastructure of the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon. This is infrastructure that Hezbollah has built over many years. So far, since this morning, more than three hundred terrorist targets across Lebanon have been struck,' Hagari said. He noted that Hezbollah has strategically placed missiles in civilian buildings in the Bekaa and is knowingly endangering the civilian population. 'The scenes that can be seen now in southern Lebanon show Hezbollah's weapons exploding inside homes. Every house that we strike contains weapons – rockets, missiles, UAVs that are intended to kill Israeli civilians,' he said. 'We are continuing to monitor Hezbollah’s preparations in the field in order to proactively thwart attacks against Israeli territory, and we are systematically broadening our strikes against Hezbollah. We are preparing to strike terrorist targets in the Beqaa Valley region soon,' Hagari also said. 'Hezbollah stores strategic weapons in civilian buildings, knowingly using the population as human shields and endangering them.' He warned the residents of the Bekaa, saying: 'This warning is focused on the villages in the Bekaa valley. I urge the Lebanese residents of the villages in the Bekaa Valley who are inside or near houses where rockets and weapons are stored, to move away immediately! For your safety and protection. You can see the operations we are currently conducting in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah intends to launch these weapons toward Israel, and we will not allow it! Stay away for your own protection. Hassan Nasrallah is lying to you and putting you in danger. Listen to the warnings and messages that will be issued by the IDF for your safety and the safety of your families.' He also gave a message to Israelis, saying: 'Citizens of Israel, the IDF is doing and will continue to do everything to protect you. We are conducting ongoing situational assessments and will update you with every development.' Following Hagari's statement, footage taken from Lebanon showed a mass exodus of residents of Sidon leaving for the north of the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qhtra6a	2024-09-23T05:48:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/rylKGOR0TR/rylKGOR0TR_0_295_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Damage in northern Israel amounts to 1 billion shekels,' tax off...	Damages reported across northern Israel since start of war on October 7 continue to climb amid conflict with Hezbollah, compensation fund director reports; damages to south estimated at additional 1.5 billion shekels Israeli property tax compensation fund director Amir Dahan spent Sunday morning in the northern region, visiting sites that sustained damage from rocket fire in areas far from the border with Lebanon, where, in many cases, damage was inflicted for the first time since the war began on October 7. 'There is damage at various sites,' Dahan told Ynet on Monday. 'The teams are already on the ground. Most of the damages, estimated at a few million shekels overall, were sustained in buildings in Kiryat Bialik, Moreshet, Sde Yaakov and the northernmost Kibbutz Kadita.' Do you have a rough estimate of the total damage in the north after almost a year of war? 'Our current estimate is that property damage amounts to around one billion shekels so far. We’ve heard numbers in the billions, but that’s an exaggeration. It’s important to understand that all the damages measured in the 40,000 claims submitted to us from the southern and central regions totaled 1.5 billion shekels. This means that the total damages have reached about 2.5 billion shekels from rocket fire to both Israel's north and south.' How many appraisers are working and have you hired more staff? 'We have 40 appraiser teams working with us regularly, based on tenders we issue. Due to the war, we’ve increased the number of appraisal teams to 120, exempting them from the tender process because of the emergency.' It’s very difficult to access the border communities under constant rocket fire. How do you assess damages? 'In places under a military order barring entry, like Metula and Manara, we’re currently only making general assessments and not yet repairing damages since rocket fire is ongoing in these communities. Recently, we’ve begun using drones to photograph the damaged buildings and property from the air in cooperation with the Defense Ministry.' What damage was caused by yesterday’s heavy rocket barrage in Kiryat Bialik? 'Buildings were damaged. We dispatched no fewer than five appraisal teams to Kiryat Bialik in the morning and the damage assessments and repairs will be addressed immediately.' What are the main damages in the north since the start of the war? 'Hundreds of homes have been damaged and some completely destroyed. Many cars have been damaged, though far fewer compared to the south. On October 7 alone, thousands of vehicles were damaged in the south, while a few hundred vehicles have been hit over nearly a year in the north,' he said. 'Additionally, large agricultural fields, chicken coops, dairies, electrical and water infrastructure and roads – some of which were partially destroyed by tank movement – have been damaged.' What’s the difference in the nature of the damage between the southern and northern borders? 'In the south, many homes were burned, while in the north, the damage was caused by rocket fire into homes. However, the overall damage to the structures is quite similar. Some 350 homes were damaged in Metula and Manara alone.' When will property owners receive compensation? 'In areas where damage can already be assessed and repairs carried out, payments will be made within a month. For homes we haven’t yet reached, payments will follow approximately a month after the damage assessment. In more complex cases, payments will be made in stages, according to the pace of the rebuilding.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjien2rac	2024-09-23T03:45:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/HkMtINi66C/HkMtINi66C_1_82_1601_901_0_small.jpg

IDF intensifies Hezbollah bombing campaign, warning locals to eva...	While the Air Force pummels southern Lebanon, it is also addressing locals via its Arabic spokesperson, urging them to remain far away from Hezbollah operatives; In Israel, Home Front Command asks residents to avoid large gatherings and non-vital outings Reports from Lebanon on Monday morning indicate that, following the revelation of Hezbollah's tactic of hiding heavy missiles in civilian homes and buildings, Israel is intensifying efforts to clear such structures of weapons. This involves sending warnings to Lebanese citizens, even in Beirut, by taking over radio frequencies. Concurrently, the IDF announced a new wave of strikes in southern Lebanon, targeting rocket launchers and launch sites, after a significant attack penetrated deeper into Lebanon earlier in the day. A broadcast on Lebanese radio stations issued an urgent warning: 'This is an important message for Lebanon's residents. The IDF is targeting Hezbollah's military sites. If you are in or near a building used by Hezbollah, you must evacuate immediately. Being near Hezbollah operatives or facilities poses a life-threatening risk.' According to the Lebanese National News Agency, Lebanon's Minister of Information, Ziad al-Makari, also received a call urging him to leave the building he was in. IDF Arabic spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Avichay Adraee, conveyed a message to the Lebanese people, indicating that 'strikes will commence shortly' and urging residents to 'immediately evacuate homes where Hezbollah hides weapons. Hezbollah is deceiving you and putting your lives at risk.' Earlier, a security source informed Ynet that, in the coming hours, the military plans an 'extensive' assault across Lebanon's rural areas. 'By early afternoon, the Air Force will launch massive strikes throughout Lebanon,' the source stated, warning that Hezbollah's response might include expanding their firing range, potentially targeting 'selected sites in Tel Aviv.' IDF reported that, since the morning, over 300 targets in Lebanon have been attacked from the air using dozens of fighter jets. The military launched another wave of attacks in the early afternoon. In a morning assessment of home front readiness, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated: 'In this new phase of the war, the resilience of the home front is crucial for enabling the IDF to fight, achieve successes, and inflict damage on the enemy. This has impressively continued for nearly a year.' He emphasized that 'in the coming days, the public will need to demonstrate composure, discipline and full adherence to the Home Front Command's instructions.' Ahead of the anticipated offensive, Gallant noted, 'We are intensifying our strikes in Lebanon. Our sequence of actions will continue until we achieve our objectives – returning the residents of the north safely to their homes. This success also depends on the proper conduct of the home front. Therefore, we are coordinating activities extensively. The difference between success and failure lies in citizens following the guidelines to enter protected rooms and spaces, which saves lives.' Following Home Front Command's assessment, new instructions were issued to residents of southern Hula Valley. The advisory said that: 'Movements in the area should be minimized, gatherings avoided, and residents should stay close to protected spaces and heed alerts from Home Front Command.' A message sent to residents of the Upper Galilee Regional Council stated: 'We remind you to maintain heightened vigilance in all council communities during these tense days. The relative calm can be misleading. IDF is striking intensively in Lebanon and, from experience, we know Hezbollah doesn't remain idle. Therefore, educational systems remain closed, and gathering restrictions (in all council communities) are set to 10 people in open areas and 100 in concrete-roofed buildings. It is recommended to stay attuned to guidelines and updates.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkiflsca0	2024-09-23T03:06:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/Byfpc11j0p0/Byfpc11j0p0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah pays village residents rent to store rockets in their h...	Ballistic AirBNB: Hezbollah covertly stationed long-range missiles in Shia homes across southern Lebanon, paying residents to store them; IDF now targets these rockets, urging civilian evacuation to minimize casualties and spotlighting Hezbollah's tactics to global audiences Nearly a decade ago, Hezbollah embarked on a covert and innovative military initiative. The group extended an offer to Shia villages and residents in southern Lebanon: provide a room in their homes in exchange for a steady rental payment. However, this unique tenant is not a person – it is a relatively long-range missile equipped with a heavy warhead. Stored on a launcher, the missile is ready to be deployed from a room adjacent to the hosting family's home. The design includes a roof that can be quickly removed, allowing the missile to be raised and launched within minutes. The families accommodating these missiles serve both as human shields and as camouflage. Hezbollah targeted impoverished Shia families living in villages around Tyre, Sidon, and even south of Beirut, who were in need of additional income. Over time, the project has expanded. Hezbollah even purchased plots and constructed homes specifically for this purpose, offering them free or at a nominal rent to Shia families willing to house medium-range missiles in a dedicated room. Some of these missiles are intended to reach central Israel. Hundreds of these missiles are stationed in areas south of Beirut, ready to be launched by Hezbollah operatives from special units. To date, Hezbollah has not deployed these missiles, reserving them for a critical phase in its conflict with Israel, where it aims to surprise the Israeli home front, including the central region, and target military and civilian infrastructure without warning. Hezbollah believed Israel either lacked awareness of these missiles or could not accurately locate them. The IDF refrained from targeting these missiles until now for three primary reasons: 1) To avoid widespread harm to Lebanese civilians, who, despite their involvement by agreeing to host Hezbollah's lethal tenants, are non-combatants. 2) Israel learned from its operations in Gaza that striking these missiles in the heart of Shia villages would result in civilian casualties and extensive destruction, providing Hezbollah with a propaganda tool to undermine Israel's legitimacy internationally. 3) These medium-range missiles carry heavy warheads, and attacking them previously would have provoked a strong response from Hezbollah, potentially escalating the conflict beyond the northern regions and the Galilee, where a war of attrition was actively taking place. Now, IDF has decided to take decisive action and is targeting these missiles after previously saying it is conducting a 'preemptive psychological operation' to minimize the damage of airstrikes within the villages. The objective is to encourage Shia villagers with missiles in or near their homes to evacuate, thereby avoiding harm when the missile-carrying rooms are attacked and destroyed. Unlike in Gaza, these villagers can return to their homes shortly after the strikes. Through this approach, IDF aims to draw global attention to Hezbollah's tactics of using civilian homes, which should be non-combatant spaces, as human shields. This strategy seeks to mitigate potential criticism from the U.S. and Europe. Additionally, this preemptive psychological effort is directed at the Lebanese population, who would directly suffer from the conflict. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1b4k50pc	2024-09-23T02:40:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/H1kQdOAT0/H1kQdOAT0_0_126_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Irish president: Israel intercepted a letter I sent to Iran; Isra...	Ireland's President Michael Higgins accuses Israel of intercepting a congratulatory letter he sent to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian following his recent election victory, but notes he has no idea how; Israeli embassy: 'A baseless accusation' Diplomatic tensions between Israel and Ireland are escalating as Irish President Michael Higgins accuses the Israeli Embassy of leaking a letter in which he extended congratulations to Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Higgins made these remarks while attending the UN Future Summit in New York. After his speech, Higgins was questioned by journalists regarding criticism from the Israeli Embassy about a 'courtesy letter' he sent to President Pezeshkian, who took office following the death of his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash in May. The leaked letter, which surfaced online last month, emphasized the importance of peace in the Middle East and the role of diplomacy. The Israeli Embassy in Dublin criticized the letter, arguing it sends 'the wrong message to the Iranian people who live in fear under this brutal regime.' When asked by a reporter from the Irish Independent about the letter, Higgins questioned the origins of the leak and suggested the Israeli Embassy was responsible for disseminating it. He also noted that the Israeli ambassador to Ireland, Dana Erlich, is currently not in the country, preventing him from summoning her for consultations. Erlich was recalled to Israel in May, following Ireland's recognition of a Palestinian state. At the time, the Israeli Embassy cited a 'troubling rise in anti-Israeli rhetoric in Ireland' as the reason for her recall, claiming that accusations against Israel had crossed into defamation and incitement. Higgins argued such accusations have created an 'unwelcoming environment for Jewish and Israeli communities in Ireland.' Earlier this month, the Israeli Embassy expressed hope that, under different and more amicable conditions, Erlich would return to Dublin to resume her duties. The Israeli Embassy in Dublin strongly rejected Higgins' accusation, stating in a declaration on its official X page that 'Unfortunately, in Ireland, since the October 7 invasion by Hamas and massacre in Israel, which triggered this awful war, Israel has been subjected to a high level of malicious statements and accusations that have often manifested as incitement to hatred. This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous and the embassy rejects it completely. 'The fact remains that the letter was written and therefore it is the burden of the author to defend its content, which did not mention the threat Iran poses in the region, that it calls for Israel's destruction, that it arms and funds terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, not to mention the violations of human rights against its own citizens,' it said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1lfsf0ar	2024-09-23T01:55:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/23/HyMx88Vzp/HyMx88Vzp_0_0_3000_1953_0_small.jpg

Large-scale attack on Lebanon coming; Hezbollah prepared to respo...	Security source tells Ynet that the Israeli Air Force will soon launch a broad attack and estimated that the terrorist organization would 'certainly respond' by firing on the north, and possibly on Tel Aviv. 'You can call this the Third Lebanon War'; Gallant: 'There are days ahead of us when the public will have to show composure'; As of this morning: More than 150 targets were attacked in Lebanon After the significant wave of attacks in Lebanon on Monday morning, including some deep inside the country, and the revelation of Hezbollah's method of launching heavy cruise missiles from homes, a security source told Ynet that in the coming hours the IDF will launch an attack 'on a large scale' in the countryside all over Lebanon. 'In the early afternoon, the Air Force will launch massive large-scale attacks in all of Lebanon,' the source said. According to him, Hezbollah's possible response may also include expanding the circle of fire. 'Hezbollah will surely respond by firing in large quantities on northern Israel,' added the source, 'and perhaps also on selected targets in Tel Aviv.' He also said that 'I think it is not too early to now call these events the 'Third Lebanon War.'' In assessing the current situation Monday morning, regarding the preparedness of the home front, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that 'at the new stage in which we have entered the war, the resilience of the home front is the key that allows the IDF to fight, to have achievements, to harm the enemy and this has been going on for about a year and has been done in a very impressive way.' Gallant added that: 'Ahead of us are days in which the public will have to show composure, discipline and complete obedience to the directives of the Home Front Command.' He stated, in preparation for the expected attack, that 'we are deepening our attacks in Lebanon, the sequence of operations continues and will continue until we achieve our goals - to return the residents of the north safely to their homes. This success also depends on the proper conduct of the home front, therefore, we sit, talk and coordinate the activity. The difference between success and failure lies in the fact that the citizens entered protected rooms and other places in accordance with the instructions we gave them; This saved lives.' And while Gallant is calling on the citizens of Israel to heed the instructions, in a statement Monday morning, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari urged the residents of Lebanese villages to distance themselves from ammunition and equipment depots used by the terror group and warned: 'In the near future we will attack targets in Lebanon. We call on those who are near properties or houses where Hezbollah is hiding ammunition to stay away. Hezbollah is putting you at risk.' Hagari revealed that Hezbollah terrorists planned to launch a cruise missile from a civilian house in southern Lebanon. The structure revealed this morning by the IDF spokesman, part of an extensive method of the terrorist organization, was attacked a few weeks ago. Hezbullah operatives made an opening in the walls at the front of the building, and planned to launch a DR-3 cruise missile with hundreds of kilograms of explosives from there. Footage shows a terrorist coming out of the building, then the building is attacked alongside the terrorists. The IDF called on the Lebanese civilians to stay away from these areas where Hezbollah hides from the IDF. Hagari explained that the wave of attacks Monday morning came after the army recognized that Hezbollah terrorists were preparing to fire into Israeli territory. SMS messages sent to civilians in South Lebanon and the Bekaa read: 'If you are in a building that has a Hezbollah soldier, stay away from the village until further notice.' The IDF’s objective is to return northern residents to their homes by pushing the threat away from the border fence and distancing Hezbollah's Radwan Force alongside destroying infrastructure near the border. The removal of Lebanese residents from the border with Israel is a major blow to Hezbollah and Lebanon. Simultaneously, the IDF aims to deny Hezbollah the ability to launch rockets from villages and homes where their weapons are stored. The widespread attack Monday morning came about 24 hours after Hezbollah's barrage deep into Israel, and beyond the Krayot in the Haifa Bay area. The targets focused not only on launch sites, but also on weapons sites located in populated areas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjh8lj0pa	2024-09-23T01:20:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/SyvoiuRT0/SyvoiuRT0_0_168_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF reveals Hezbollah planned to fire cruise missile from Lebanon...	Chief military spokesperson reveals footage of Hezbollah terrorists who removed the front wall of a residential home in order to fire the missile at Israel; IDF calls on Lebanese civilians to distance themselves from terror group's weapon silos IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari on Monday revealed that Hezbollah terrorists planned to fire a cruise missile at Israel from a residential home in Lebanon. Hagari called on Lebanese civilians to distance themselves from ammunition and equipment depots used by the terror group, warning the IDF will proceed to strike them in the country. The structure Hagari revealed was attacked a few weeks ago as well, after the IDF noticed Hezbollah operatives had created an opening in the walls of the building’s front, planning to launch a DR-3 cruise missile loaded with hundreds of kilograms of explosives. In footage released by the IDF, a terrorist is seen exiting the structure followed by the building being struck. 'Here we are exposing Hezbollah’s method of hiding a cruise missile inside a home. The terrorists create a designated opening for the missile launch. Here you can see how we identified the terrorists making an opening in the building that exposed the missile. In a precise strike, the IDF eliminated the terrorists and this missile launching infrastructure, shortly before the launch,' Hagari said. The IDF’s objective is to return northern residents to their homes by pushing the threat away from the border fence and distancing Hezbollah's Radwan Force alongside destroying infrastructure near the border. The removal of Lebanese residents from the border with Israel is a major blow to Hezbollah and Lebanon. Simultaneously, the IDF aims to deny Hezbollah the ability to launch rockets from villages and homes where their weapons are stored. Amid increasing threats from Israeli officials, Hagari was asked if the IDF is prepared and considering a ground operation in Lebanon and whether, in his view, such an operation is essential for Israel's security. 'We will do whatever is necessary to return the northern residents to their homes. We have detailed plans and we have presented them to decision-makers,' he responded. Following criticism that the IDF acted with full force only when the threat was directed at Tel Aviv, Hagari was asked if the IDF had diminished Hezbollah’s ability to launch missiles toward central Israel. 'Our strikes yesterday were also part of the effort to prevent fire aimed at northern residents and other areas,' he said. In the past 24 hours, alongside Hezbollah’s fire toward Israel, drones and cruise missiles were launched at Israel from Iraq by Shiite militias. Hagari was asked if Israel would retaliate against the militias operating on Iran’s incentive. 'We have been acting against all fronts since the start of the war. We will act to neutralize threats from any location necessary,' he answered. The extensive strikes in Lebanon came about 24 hours after Hezbollah's massive barrage into Israel which reached communities untouched by the conflict so far. The targets included not only launch sites but also Hezbollah weapons silos found in populated areas. Saudi outlet Al-Hadath reported that over 100 strikes were carried out in Lebanon by dozens of IDF fighter jets. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar network reported strikes across all border towns in Lebanon, and over 80 strikes took place in the Nabatieh region within half an hour according to the Lebanese news agency. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1htvya6r	2024-09-23T00:18:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/23/BJieHO0TC/BJieHO0TC_84_7_430_242_0_small.jpg
Israel unsure whether Sinwar is dead or alive	Since Yahya Sinwar has been incommunicado for a while, Israel is investigating whether he was injured or killed in an IDF attack, but it's just as likely he's still in hiding, using a cryptic method of relaying and receiving messages to stay off the IDF's radar Has Hamas chief and October 7 architect, Yahya Sinwar, taken his last breath? Israel is currently exploring that possibility, as he might have been injured or killed in recent IDF strikes on the Gaza Strip. This comes following reports that he has once again become 'unreachable.' However, defense officials emphasize there is no concrete information confirming his whereabouts. They also note there have not been any recent targeted strikes in areas where Sinwar's presence was indicated. In recent weeks, various Arab media outlets have reported that Sinwar sent thank-you messages to several leaders who offered condolences after the assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. For instance, Lebanese media recently reported that Sinwar sent such a message to Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. A few days earlier, Sinwar reportedly sent a similar note to Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. This marked the first reported message from the Hamas leader since the massacre on October 7. The Wall Street Journal recently published an in-depth article on Sinwar's secretive communication methods, which have allowed him to elude Israeli intelligence and avoid capture for over 11 months. Sinwar has managed to communicate with the outside world while keeping his hideout in Gaza's tunnels concealed. According to the article, Sinwar developed these methods during his time in an Israeli prison, relying on a complex network of encrypted messages delivered through a series of couriers, sometimes including civilians in addition to members of the terrorist organization. Israel, with support from the Biden administration, is investing significant resources to locate and neutralize the architect of the deadly October 7 terrorist attack. Despite Israel's operational control over large areas of Gaza and numerous underground battles, Sinwar has consistently managed to stay one step ahead. Although earlier reports suggested he used electronic communication at the beginning of the conflict, sources involved in mediation between Hamas and Israel indicate that he has since refrained from doing so. According to mediators who spoke to the Wall Street Journal, a 'typical' message from Sinwar is now written and initially passed through a trusted Hamas operative. From there, it is relayed through a series of couriers, some of whom may be civilians. These messages are often encoded, with encryption varying based on the recipient, the circumstances or the timing. Ultimately, the message may reach Arab mediators entering Gaza or another Hamas operative who uses a phone or another method to communicate it to members of the terrorist organization abroad. Sinwar has reportedly hardened his communication methods following the assassinations of senior Hamas and Hezbollah figures since the war began. The Wall Street Journal points out that a turning point was the assassination of senior Hamas figure Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut on January 2. Arab mediators told the newspaper that after al-Arouri's assassination, Sinwar almost entirely switched to relying on written or verbal messages and occasionally distributed voice messages through a small circle of close associates. These covert communication methods reportedly trace back to a system developed during Sinwar's imprisonment in Israel, from which he was released in the Gilad Shalit deal in 2011. Before his arrest in 1988, Sinwar established Hamas' internal intelligence unit, Majd, which executed suspected collaborators with Israel and operated inside the prison. According to Musab Hassan Yousef, the son of a senior Hamas leader who became a Shin Bet agent known as 'The Green Prince,' the Majd unit recruited prisoners called 'Sawad' (Arabic for 'the true hand') to disseminate written messages between different prison sections. They would wrap notes in pieces of bread, roll them into balls, let them dry and harden, and then toss them between sections while shouting 'Mail from the freedom fighters!' Despite Sinwar's reliance on non-electronic communication methods that help him evade Israeli intelligence while delaying his response time, the Wall Street Journal emphasizes that he continues to maintain the ability to communicate with the outside world quickly, sometimes in real-time. For example, he reportedly did so during negotiations in Doha last June. According to Arab mediators, CIA Director William Burns met with Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed Al-Thani and Egypt's Intelligence Chief Abbas Kamel, who then met with Ismail Haniyeh to pressure Hamas into accepting a hostage deal under the threat of sanctions and arrests. However, Sinwar reportedly sent real-time messages during that meeting, and Hamas refused the deal unless Israel agreed in writing to a complete cease-fire. The Wall Street Journal says it remains unclear how Sinwar transmitted these messages. Another example cited is a condolence letter Sinwar sent to Haniyeh after the assassination of three of his sons in Gaza in April, months before Haniyeh himself was killed at the end of July, and Sinwar took over as head of the political bureau. According to the American newspaper, that letter reached Haniyeh within hours of his sons' assassination. Nevertheless, in some cases, even at critical negotiation points, Sinwar could not be reached. The report suggests it is unclear whether this was a deliberate tactic or genuine delays caused by his complex communication methods. The Wall Street Journal also reports on the landline network Hamas established in the underground city of tunnels built in Gaza. However, the report does not specify whether Sinwar continues to use this method. Regardless, he sometimes arranged phone calls with mediators using that network, employing code words and aliases to set precise times for the calls. Sinwar occasionally used the names of people he knew in Israeli prison to mask his identity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyo8sucaa	2024-09-23T00:11:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/03/06/rJemKqCr6a/rJemKqCr6a_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

Iran's Revolutionary Guards bans use of communications devices af...	IRGC to inspect all devices, not just communication equipment, which are either homemade or imported from China and Russia, over concerns of Israeli infiltration Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has ordered all members to stop using any type of communication devices after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon blew up in deadly attacks last week, two senior Iranian security officials told Reuters. One of the security officials said a large-scale operation is underway by the IRGC to inspect all devices, not just communication equipment. He said most of these devices were either homemade or imported from China and Russia. Iran is concerned about infiltration by Israeli agents, including Iranians on Israel's payroll and a thorough investigation of personnel has already begun, targeting mid and high-ranking members of the IRGC, added the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. 'This includes scrutiny of their bank accounts both in Iran and abroad, as well as their travel history and that of their families,' the security official said. Iran's Foreign, Defense and Interior Ministries were not immediately available to respond to the comments made by the security officials to Reuters. In a coordinated attack, the pager devices detonated on Tuesday across Hezbollah's strongholds. On Wednesday, hundreds of Hezbollah walkie-talkies exploded. The attacks killed 39 people and injured more than 3,000 people. Lebanon and Hezbollah say Israel was behind the attacks. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed involvement. The security official declined to give details on how the IRGC force, comprising 190,000 personnel, are communicating. 'For now, we are using end-to-end encryption in messaging systems,' he said. According to the same official, there is widespread concern among Iran's ruling establishment. IRGC officials have reached out to Hezbollah for technical assessments, and several examples of exploded devices have been sent to Tehran for examination by Iranian experts. Protection of missile, nuclear facilities Another Iranian official said the Islamic Republic's main concern was the protection of the country's nuclear and missile facilities, particularly those underground. 'But since last year, security measures at those sites have increased significantly,' he said in reference to stepped up measures after what Iranian authorities said was Israel's attempt to sabotage Iran's missile program in 2023. Israel has never commented on this. 'There has never, ever been such tight security and extreme measures in place as there are now,' he added, suggesting that security has been significantly increased beyond previous levels after the pager explosions in Lebanon. The IRGC is a powerful political, military and economic force in Iran with close ties to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Set up after the 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the clerical ruling system, it has its own ground force, navy and air force that oversee Iran's strategic weapons. It exerts influence in the Middle East through its overseas operations arm, the Al Quds Force, by providing money, weapons, technology and training to allied groups: Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, Yemen's Houthis and militias in Iraq. Tehran has developed its own military-grade radio transmissions through its defense industry to avoid reliance on foreign imports Iran's military uses a range of encrypted communication devices, including walkie-talkies, for secure communication, said the first Iranian source. While specific models and brands might vary, Iranian military communications equipment was often developed domestically or sourced from a combination of local and foreign suppliers, he said. He said Iran's armed forces have stopped using pagers for over two decades. Tehran has developed its own military-grade radio transmissions through its defense industry to avoid reliance on foreign imports, especially due to Western sanctions imposed on Tehran over its nuclear program, he added. However, in the past, Iran has imported communication devices from countries such as China and Russia and even Japan. Iran and Israel have been locked in a shadow war for decades, with mutual allegations of sabotage and assassination plots. The conflict, including between Israel and Hezbollah, has intensified in the past year in parallel with the Gaza war, which erupted after the Palestinian Hamas group attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7. Iran and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for assassinating Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah's most senior military commander, Fuad Shukr, in Beirut a few hours earlier in July. Israel said it killed Shukr but it has not confirmed it was behind Haniyeh's death. Iran does not recognize Israel's right to exist.

These are the next steps in the war on Israel's northern border	Focus and targeted moves: The IDF is operating in order to return residents of the north to their homes and aims to present Hezbollah with a choice between a settlement or all-out war; Washington warns against an escalation that will bring Iran into the picture War in targeted moves. This is the Israel Defense Forces' strategy on the Lebanese border in the last few days and going forward, after the directive it received from the political echelon to return the residents of the north to their homes as part of the objectives of the current war. The IDF attacks powerfully in places where it has not attacked before and at different ranges, increases targeted countermeasures and special attacks, and re-examines the intelligence picture at each level and conducts renewed situation assessments to achieve its objectives. Meanwhile, preparations for the continuation of the fighting continue. The cabinet will meet Monday at 7 p.m. at the defense headquarters at the Kirya base in Tel Aviv. Overnight between Sunday and Monday, alerts about the intrusion of hostile drones were activated in and around Beit Shean for the first time since October 11, but it turned out that a false alarm had been activated since the drones never made it that far. According to Arab reports, a 'swarm of drones from Iraq' was sent to Israel, and the 'Islamic resistance in Iraq' claimed responsibility for 'a drone attack in the Jordan Valley.' According to the IDF spokesman, an unmanned aircraft that was launched from Iraq and crossed into the country from Syria was detected, and interceptors were launched against it. The incident ended without casualties. After many months on defense, the IDF recently went on the attack against Hezbollah, with an emphasis on eroding the organization's capabilities and damaging its terrorist infrastructure. Israel is interested in further expanding the offensive operation in Lebanon, on its own initiative and regardless of the operation of the Shiite terrorist organization, which decided Sunday night to expand the circle of fire to hundreds of thousands more residents of the State of Israel. Jerusalem understands that the actions of the last few days could lead to a real escalation on the northern border, but they understand that this is the only way to bring Hezbollah to a crossroads, where it must decide whether to continue with attacks or come to a settlement with Israel. As IDF Chief of Staff Major General Harzi Halevi said Sunday night in Tel Nof: 'Hezbollah will receive a blow and another blow until it understands.' In Israel they believe it is possible that the expansion of the offensive operation will cause Hezbollah to stop because it has no desire for an all-out war. The significant damage to the Radwan force, which was planning to invade the Galilee as Hamas did on October 7 in the south, as well as the assassination of Ibrahim Aquil, are part of the effort to deprive Hezbollah of the ability to act against Israel in the near term. In addition, the IDF is investing in locating and destroying short- and medium-range rocket launchers in order to reduce the direct threats to the northern communities. The fighting with ever-increasing intensity manifests itself in the intensive launching of rockets and missiles from Lebanese territory toward Israel, alongside the increase in IDF-initiated attacks with the aim of presenting Hezbollah with a clear dilemma: to be drawn into an all-out war or to strive for a political settlement. The IDF is operating in steps, a controlled escalation with the goal of being able to make Hezbollah reconsider its continued actions. The IDF is working to eliminate as many of the terror group's capabilities as possible, with the understanding that such an operational opportunity, if it returns, will only be in a few years. Security officials explain that all the actions of the IDF are approved two steps ahead by the cabinet, and also explain that, at this stage, there is a desire to reach a reality with which the political parties can arrive at an agreement that will ensure the security of the residents of the north. If Hezbollah continues to insist on its positions on the one hand, and will not be dragged into war on the other hand, there is a chance that the aggressive struggles will last for days or even weeks. At the same time as the threats of escalation from Israel, Hezbollah also threatened a war of attrition, as Hassan Nasrallah's deputy, Naim Qassem, made clear Sunday when he emphasized that Hezbollah is ready to continue the fight for a long time if required. Starting from the night between Saturday and Sunday, Hezbollah launched 150 rockets, drones and cruise missiles into Israeli territory. The vast majority of them were intercepted. There are those in Israel who wish to avoid an all-out war and end the conflict with a limited operation, but it is clear that, as long as Hezbollah continues its attacks, the situation could last for days or even weeks more . Because of this, Northern Command Major General Ori Gordin met with representatives of residents of the North, and told them: 'We have significantly harmed Hezbollah and we will continue and deepen the harm. We are at a point of change. Along with the defense mission, we are highly prepared for the additional attack plans on Hezbollah. I appreciate the way you are leading your communities in these complex days. We will continue to work together with you, in connection and full cooperation.' In closed conversations, senior military officials say that 'the relationship with the residents and heads of authorities is critical these days. The public needs to be prepared and informed of what is expected of them. These are going to be very intense days.' In the current reality, where the IDF is proactively escalating the attacks in Lebanon, it is difficult to know where things will develop. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Office is holding consultations on whether to cancel Netanyahu's trip to New York this week for the United Nations General Assembly or to shorten it by a day, so that he will arrive on Thursday morning, speak on Friday, and return immediately at the end of Shabbat. Netanyahu's office is examining the possibility of sending another minister in his place, possibly government ministers Ron Dermer or Israel Katz. There is also the possibility of not sending an Israeli representative, and then the person who will speak on behalf of Israel next Monday will be the ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon. The American warning Against the backdrop of the military moves, the opinion of the United States also affects the overall picture. Washington thinks that a diplomatic settlement can still be reached in the north, despite the escalation. The Americans support Israel's actions to erode Hezbollah's capabilities and are not sorry about the assassination of Ibrahim Aquil, who was also wanted in the United States, but they have asked Israel to act carefully so as not to exacerbate the escalation beyond what is necessary. The White House is warning against the possibility of an all-out war, which could lead to the involvement of Iran and the creation of an extensive regional conflict, a scenario that the Americans prefer to avoid in the run-up to the upcoming presidential elections. U.S. President Joe Biden was asked Sunday night about the tensions in the Middle East and said that 'we are going to do everything to prevent a large-scale war from breaking out.' Hezbollah's arsenal of tools Hezbollah, being part of the Shiite-Iranian axis, receives ammunition from Iran - and a lot of it. During the months of fighting since October 7, Hezbollah has used various types of weapons, which it revealed as the campaign progressed. It has used different types of rockets, including Fla' and Burkan, launched katyushas, ​​and Sunday night, according to Hezbollah, also used rockets from the Fadi family. In addition, Hezbollah also used various types of UAVs in the war, some for photography and others for attack, and anti-tank missiles - but the arsenal at its disposal is much larger. In fact, the organization's strategic weapons are located in different areas and even deep in the country. Hezbollah has the first line of defense in front of the border with Israel, where the simpler rockets are kept, but also short-range missiles with significant warheads that can cause heavy damage. Farther away, in the wide tunnels, among tangled vegetation, on the outskirts of villages, such as the Nabi Shayth is a village in eastern Lebanon, located in the Beqaa Valley and Baalbek District and even in the capital city of Beirut, under buildings, other strategic weapons are kept. 'There are strategic missiles under high-rise buildings,' said Ronan Solomon, an intelligence researcher and the owner of the Intelli Times blog. According to him, 'In Beirut, a large part of the precision missiles are located near soccer fields and underground complexes, such as parking lots that have been converted for this purpose. The IDF has previously revealed simulations that describe the method. In Baalbek it is hidden under the cover of the mountainous geographical route, and while taking advantage of the green undergrowth on the sides of the ridges.' According to Solomon, Hezbollah also possesses, among other things, air defense batteries, coastal missiles, warning systems and electronic warfare. The person responsible for smuggling all these means from Iran is Brigade 8000 in the Quds Force. 'This is a military supply unit. It transfers the weapons that are produced in Iran and deals with several layers of aid for Hezbollah, among other things in aid to the naval force,' Solomon explained. He added that Israel damaged Hezbollah's production chain, so the organization had to move things by land. According to him, these shipments can be seen - and Israel is attacking them. Another advantage, he explained, is that even if Hezbollah decides to shoot from its underground tunnels it will be visible. 'All along the Lebanon Valley there is a very complicated vegetation. There they built the tunnel openings under the auspices of the hangars and you can recognize this development over the years,' he said. 'The tunnel makes it easier for them and shortens their way, because the means of warfare enter from Syria straight there.' Among the familiar, more strategic missiles that are in Hezbollah's hands, there are also the Scud C and Scud D missiles - whose range can reach about 700 kilometers, according to reports. The organization also has rockets from the Zalzal family and Fateh 110 missiles, which according to reports can reach a range of 200 to 300 kilometers. The names of the missiles can change from country to country even if it is the exact same missile. In fact, many times missiles that pass through the smuggling route of the Shia axis receive a new name in the target countries, sometimes following small changes introduced to the same weapon. In addition, sometimes missiles with the same name, but with different characteristics, exist in different countries. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1my0pat0	2024-09-22T22:25:08-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/Bkg11ORRaaR/Bkg11ORRaaR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Hezxbollah was prepared to fire from civilian homes into Israel, ...	IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Daniel Hagari commented on the wave of IDF attacks in Lebanon Monday morning, saying that they 'will continue in the near future. In the near future we will attack. For more than 20 years, Hezbullah has distributed IEDs inside homes and armed them, thus turning South Lebanon into a fighting space.' Hagari revealed that a few weeks ago Hezbollah terrorists planned to launch a cruise missile from a civilian home, and presented documentation of the home. 'This is what a village in South Lebanon looks like. Hezbollah stores cruise missiles, rockets and UAVs inside civilian homes under the auspices of the Lebanese population, thereby endangering the citizens living in the village,' Hagari said in a message to the residents of South Lebanon. 'We advise civilians from Lebanese villages located in and next to buildings and areas used by Hezbollah for military purposes, such as those used to store weapons, to immediately move out of harm's way for their own safety.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1e00vdrtc	2024-09-22T22:12:34-07:00

Hostage negotiations going nowhere	Netanyahu denies allegations that he was obstructing a potential deal, adding that US envoy, Amos Hochstein, confirmed that Hamas was the one blocking progress, while he agreed to all US conditions for a deal Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that only half of the 101 hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas are alive. The information presented to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee earlier on Sunday was based on assessments made in Israel before the execution of six hostages in a tunnel in Rafah. Prior to that, Israel estimated that around 57 hostages were still alive. Now, after the execution, that number has dropped to 50-51 hostages. Netanyahu also denied allegations that he was obstructing a potential deal. At one point, he lost his composure, pounded the table, and expressed frustration over 'fake reports' claiming he was hindering a hostage exchange or ceasefire in Gaza. He said U.S. envoy, Amos Hochstein, had confirmed that Hamas was the one blocking progress. Netanyahu emphasized that he had agreed to all of the U.S. conditions for the deal, but Hamas refused. The White House corroborated this view. 'We haven't made progress in the last two weeks, not for lack of trying. But it doesn’t appear that [Yahya] Sinwar is willing to negotiate in good faith—especially after the execution of six hostages in a tunnel, which seems like a deliberate act of murder,' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. 'It looks like Sinwar doesn’t want to move forward, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t trying. Things seem unrealistic until they aren’t, so our team continues to engage with the Israelis, Qataris, and Egyptians to push for progress.' While the White House has denied reports suggesting the Biden administration doesn't expect a deal before the U.S. presidential election, sources familiar with the negotiations said. 'The Americans have adopted a strategy of solely blaming Sinwar because they don’t want, and can’t afford, to confront Israel for fear of alienating Jewish voters. Ultimately, the U.S. won’t succeed because in order to secure a deal, they would have to pressure Netanyahu and that would hurt them politically. So they won’t do it.' The sources also claimed that Netanyahu currently has no political incentive to push for a deal, and one would not happen unless Israel changes its position on the Philadelphi Corridors and the Rafah border. They explained that Netanyahu’s decision to insist on maintaining control along Gaza's border with Egypt caused Sinwar to harden his stance, leading both sides to take increasingly rigid positions. In short, the sources concluded that for a deal to move forward, both sides must show a willingness to compromise. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjoxagrpa	2024-09-22T14:19:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/ByexpO3p6C/ByexpO3p6C_69_597_1016_572_0_small.jpg
Guards protect secrets on sunken billionaire's yacht, report	Italian authorities ask for diver patrols and underwater surveillance to secure superyacht that sank in August killing seven including British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch who had ties to intelligence agencies, Italian authorities bolstered security around the site of the Bayesian yacht which drowned in Sicily’s waters last month amid fears foreign governments would seek to recover confidential documents stored inside the sunken boat’s waterproof safes, CNN said adding that divers were hired to patrol the area for the coming weeks, until the safes can be recovered within a few weeks. The superyacht capsized and sank at 5 AM Sicily time, on August 19, with 22 people aboard. Shortly after the yacht anchored near Porticello harbor, it was hit by severe weather and eyewitnesses reported it vanished beneath the waves within minutes. Some 15 people managed to escape the yacht and were later found on a lifeboat but seven others perished. By the end of that week, the bodies of all seven were recovered including British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, 59, whose wife owned the yacht. The group had been on a pleasure cruise to celebrate Lynch’s acquittal in a recent U.S. fraud trial. Most of the passengers on board had stood by Lynch and supported him during his legal battles, including family members, friends and representatives from his defense team at the Clifford Chance law firm. Lawyer Chris Morvillo, who died in the disaster along with his wife, led Lynch’s defense team. Experts in the maritime industry expressed great surprise at the yacht’s sinking and said it was very rare for luxury yachts of that size to capsize and sink due to weather events. Some have added that a yacht like the Bayesian, built by the prestigious Italian yacht manufacturer Perini, should have withstood the storm. An investigation has been launched against the yacht’s New Zealand captain James Cutfield and two of his crew members, who may face charges of manslaughter and causing the disaster through negligence. The case has taken a new turn, focusing on Lynch, who was at the center of the pleasure cruise and perished in the disaster, considered one of the most famous tech entrepreneurs in the UK. He founded the country’s largest software company, Autonomy, based on groundbreaking research he conducted at Cambridge University and sold it to HP in 2011 for $11 billion. Just a year later, HP claimed that Lynch had inflated the company’s value and that it was worth only $8.8 billion. Lynch was indicted in the U.S. and spent most of the last decade fighting legal battles and defending his name until he was extradited to the U.S.. last year. He denied the charges against him and was acquitted. After his acquittal, Lynch expressed his happiness and blamed HP for sabotaging the merger between the companies. Now, sources in the Italian prosecution say it's highly likely that Lynch kept extremely sensitive material inside the Bayesian, related to several Western intelligence agencies. Lynch had connections with the intelligence services of the UK, the U.S. and several other countries via various companies he owned including the Darktrace cybersecurity firm that he had founded. He also served as a science, technology and cybersecurity advisor to former UK prime ministers David Cameron and Theresa May. According to sources who spoke with CNN, the yacht likely had two waterproof safes that contained two highly encrypted hard drives. These drives likely held classified information, including passwords. An Italian prosecution source said some survivors told prosecutors that Lynch didn't trust cloud services, so he made sure to keep physical hard drives in a secure compartment onboard whenever he sailed on the yacht. CNN reported that Italian law enforcement authorities initially feared thieves might try to reach the wreck to steal jewelry and other valuables still on board. However, that fear has now shifted to concerns that foreign governments, including Russia and China, might covertly send divers to retrieve the sensitive information. According to CNN, relevant officials have requested that the yacht be guarded both above the water and via underwater surveillance. A civil protection authority source in Sicily confirmed to CNN that ' A formal request has been accepted and implemented for additional security of the wreckage until it can be raised.' The Bayesian was 56 meters (184 feet) long and according to its manufacturer, its 75-meter (246-foot) mast was the tallest aluminum mast in the world. The yacht could accommodate 12 guests in six suites and had a crew of 10 people. Over the years, it received numerous design awards. The weekly charter cost for the yacht was €195,000 ($215,000). >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skr009kc6r	2024-09-22T13:57:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/21/BywJ1qQoA/BywJ1qQoA_0_85_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Relatives of Aqil's American victims say justice is served	Retired Marine Steve Aiken, who was off Beirut coast when U.S. barracks attacked in 1983, says Aqil's killing more than 40 years later is 'God’s judgment'; 'Our memory is long. Israel’s is even longer' The killing of Ibrahim Aqil, Hezbollah's head of operations, over the weekend was not only the closing of a long chapter for Israel, his primary target for four decades, but also for the countless survivors and families of victims of the attacks he orchestrated against American targets in Lebanon during the 1980s. Aqil was wanted by the U.S. primarily for his role in two 1983 bombings that killed more than 350 people, most of them American soldiers. The first attack occurred in April that year, when a van loaded with explosives detonated at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people, including 17 Americans. Among the dead were CIA officers, U.S. Marines, embassy staff, and journalists. Six months later, in October, a suicide bomber drove a truck filled with explosives into a U.S. Marine barracks, killing over 300 people, including 241 American servicemen and 58 French soldiers. The American and French troops had been stationed in Lebanon as peacekeepers after Israel's 1982 invasion, aimed at neutralizing Palestinian terror groups launching deadly attacks against Israel. In 1984, months after the second bombing, the U.S. withdrew most of its forces from Lebanon, a decision still criticized by some today. Although Aqil played a key role in these attacks, as well as the kidnappings of American and German citizens, Washington never brought him to justice. Last year, marking the 40th anniversary of the bombings, the U.S. offered a $7 million reward for information leading to his capture. Steve Aiken, a retired Marine Corps sergeant major, reflected somberly on October 23, 1983, when truck bombs devastated buildings housing American and French troops. At the time a young lance corporal, Aiken was stationed off the coast aboard the USS Inchon, where he witnessed wounded service members being transferred to a fleet of U.S. ships providing medical care. He describes Aqil's killing more than 40 years later as 'God’s judgment' and said it would send a strong message to Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism. 'You might get away, but you’re not going to get by,' he said. 'Our memory is long. Israel’s is even longer.' For Americans still carrying the wounds of the Lebanon attacks more than 40 years ago, Hezbollah’s confirmation of the killing offers a long-overdue sense of justice. 'You know, my story is just one of those tiny tragedies. Big tragedy for me. Big tragedy for my family,' says Catherine Votaw to the Washington Post, whose father Albert, 57, was killed in the embassy bombing in April 1983. 'Everybody suffered these tremendous tragedies that blew their lives apart.' 'We’ve been engaged with Hezbollah for a very long time,' says retired Ambassador Ryan Crocker, a survivor of the April 1983 embassy bombing. 'It is still a source of some satisfaction that he(Aqil) finally got it.' Crocker, 75, was working as a political attaché in his fourth-floor office when a suicide bomber in a van packed with explosives slammed into the front of the building and detonated. He recalls seeing a bright flash through his window before being thrown against the wall by the explosion. At first, he thought that the building had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade but soon realized the devastation was far worse. As he left his office, he could see the Mediterranean Sea where the CIA station had once stood. 'It was pitch-black except for the fires,' he says. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ryictat60	2024-09-22T12:56:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2020/01/07/9706353/9706353_0_121_1300_732_0_small.jpg
Half of the 101 hostages still alive according to intelligence,'...	Prime minister presents to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Security Committee a plan for Israel to oversee the distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza to prevent Hamas from controlling it and maintaining its rule; PM says efforts to free hostages continue Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that intelligence indicates that at least half of the 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza were still alive. The prime minister spoke to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee where he also briefed lawmakers on the situation in the north. The prime minister was presented with a report prepared by retired generals in the IDF early in September, warning that as long as Hamas was in charge of the aid distribution, it would not be defeated. The plan that was originally devised by Giora Eiland who also served as head of Israel's National Security Council called for the the area in the Strip north of the Netzarim corridor and including Gaza city, to be declared a closed military zone and its estimated 300,000 residents removed to safe zones through IDF humanitarian routes within a set time of approximately one week. The IDF will then impose a siege on the military zone where only Hamas terrorists will remain, forcing them to surrender or die fighting. Eiland who had suggested the plan in television interviews said this would be in accordance to international laws of war. On Sunday, the Prime Minister's Office said the IDF was instructed to present to the government plans to take control of the distribution of humanitarian aid. Eiland claimed that as long as Hamas has control of the aid, it provides for its forces and markets the remaining supplies, ensuring a steady flow of cash and its continued civilian rule. The United States has not given its backing to the plan. Netanyahu told the Knesset committee that efforts to return the hostages were ongoing. 'Hamas' willingness to release the hostages is influenced by two opposing forces: the military and diplomatic pressure we’re applying on it and the pressure being applied on us.' He didn’t rule out the proposal presented by Israel's envoy for hostages and missing citizens Gal Hirsch who said Sinwar should be guaranteed safe passage out of Gaza along with other leaders of the terror group in exchange for ending the war, surrender of Hamas terrorists and returning the hostages. Netanyahu said he preferred another solution over the IDF's military rule in Gaza but didn’t dismiss the idea, saying that previous attempts to enlist Gazan clans to take over civilian rule, had failed and there were currently no other proposals to address this issue. In his view, the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah) isn’t any better than Hamas in its position on Israel. Although he said he opposed annexation of civilian areas he insisted that military control must be maintained over a perimeter close to the border Netanyahu said he believes the International Criminal Court will soon issue arrest warrants against him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Chief prosecutor Karim Khan had requested warrants for the arrest of the Israeli leaders and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1hqnpaaa	2024-09-22T12:44:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/06/13/BybyxjiBDh/BybyxjiBDh_267_408_2513_1415_0_small.jpg

IRGC official does not specify where and when arrests are made; says Israel and the United States are seeking to spread the Gaza crisis to Iran plotting against the country's security Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Sunday that 12 people had been arrested for being operatives collaborating with Israel and planning acts against Iran's security. 'As the Zionist regime (Israel) and their Western backers, most notably the United States, have not succeeded in their sinister goals against the people of Gaza and Lebanon, they are now seeking to spread the crisis to Iran with a series of actions planned against our country's security,' the statement said. Tensions in the Middle East have shot up since thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Lebanon's Hezbollah members exploded in an attack widely blamed on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged some of the heaviest cross-border fire in a conflict running in parallel to the almost year-long Gaza war. The Revolutionary Guards added that members of the network of 12 operatives were arrested in six different Iranian provinces, but did not say when. In late July, the political leader of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran in an assassination blamed on Israel by Iranian authorities. Israel has made no claim of responsibility. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj0zk06pc	2024-09-22T11:12:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/HJxm5Rap0/HJxm5Rap0_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Aqil's replacement as Radwan force was trained in Iran	Ali Reda Abbas was implicated in the kidnapping and murder of five American soldiers in Karbala, Iraq in 2007; He established Hezbollah's force on the Syrian Golan Heights and had survived past attempts on his life According to the Al-Hadath network in Saudi Arabia, Ibrahim Aqil, who was killed on Friday in Beirut along with the top commanders of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit, will be replaced by his deputy - Ali Reda Abbas. Ali Mussa Daqduq, who previously established a Hezbollah-operated unit on the Syrian Golan Heights will act as his second in command. His son was killed there in an Israeli airstrike. According to the Saudi outlet, Abbas who is known as Abu Hussein Barish will be named the new commander of the Radwan Force. Abbas, 60, is from the town of Barish in the region of Tyre in southern Lebanon. He has avoided appearing in the media in photos showing his face despite acting as a spokesperson for the terror group in South Lebanon. According to the Saudi report, both he and Aqil had survived attempts on their lives in the 1990s but there was no indication who was behind those efforts. Over the years Abbas held numerous military positions, was trained in Iran and was one of Hezbollah's notable operations officers in southern Lebanon. Al-Daqduq, was accused of kidnapping and killing five American soldiers in Karbala, Iraq in 2007. He returned to Lebanon after being released from prison in 2012 after an Iraqi court acquitted him of involvement in those crimes. His name made Israeli media outlets when in 2019, the IDF said it had uncovered a Hezbollah unit across the Israel-Syria border on the Golan Heights that was established to carry out attacks against Israel. Al-Daqduq was described as the Lebanese 'Brain' behind the unit, which consisted of Syrian soldiers. The attack on the predominately Shiite quarter in southern Beirut targeted Aqil and other senior Hezbollah officials from the Radwan Force who were planning an assault on the Galilee, like the one carried out by Hamas on October 7. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, at least 37 people were killed in the attack. According to the IDF, 16 were commanders in the Radwan force. Lebanese media said that three children and seven women were also killed when the buildings were leveled. Rescue efforts were still ongoing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sknqz3ppc	2024-09-22T08:31:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/rkb0ksaaR/rkb0ksaaR_112_0_982_552_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah's exploding pagers, part of decades long Israeli scheme...	Officials say the multipronged effort to develop 'red button' capability — allows a potentially devastating penetration of an adversary that can remain dormant for months if not years before being activated. The blackened remains of pagers and handheld radios, destroyed in a massive attack on Hezbollah last week, have become key evidence in what current and former Israeli and Western security officials describe as part of a decade-long Israeli effort to infiltrate the terror group, the Washington Post reported Saturday. Markings on the charred electronic components have led investigators back to a Taiwanese manufacturer and a Hungarian shell company, suspected to have been created or exploited by Israeli intelligence to obscure its role in supplying Hezbollah with booby-trapped devices. Security officials in a European capital are investigating whether a second shell company was the real seller behind the pager deal. According to officials cited in the report, the attack was part of a broader strategy referred to by Israeli officials as a 'red button' capability—designed to penetrate an adversary’s infrastructure and lie dormant until triggered. The exact reason Israel activated this capability now remains unclear, though experts believe the move was prompted by concerns that Hezbollah was on the verge of discovering the plot. Such operations are typically meant to create chaos ahead of broader military offensives, officials said. Tuesday’s explosions, which Lebanon’s Health Ministry reported killed at least 12 people and injured nearly 2,800, struck both Hezbollah operatives and civilians, including children. A second wave of explosions involving radios on Wednesday killed at least 25 and wounded 450 more. Despite the devastation, these attacks were not immediately followed by a major Israeli military incursion into Lebanon. An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb Friday killed over 30 people, including two senior Hezbollah commanders, along with more civilians. The so-called 'red button' concept, according to a former Israeli official familiar with the pager operation, allows for a devastating capability that can be used at a moment's notice. The former official explained that the detonation of the devices this week 'wasn’t part of the comprehensive plan' when the operation was initially conceived, but stressed that Israeli officials believe the impact was significant. 'Look at the outcome,' the former official said, noting the explosions that incapacitated Hezbollah leaders, overwhelmed hospitals, and left operatives unable to trust their communications gear. A second former Israeli intelligence official described the attack as the culmination of years of work to infiltrate Hezbollah’s communications, logistics, and procurement systems. Long before the devices were rigged with explosives, Israel’s Mossad and other intelligence agencies had gained detailed insight into Hezbollah’s operational needs, shell companies, and procurement networks. 'You need to create an infrastructure of companies,' the former official said, 'in which one sells to another, who sells to another,' all to get closer to Hezbollah’s agents while concealing any connection to Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjeqgi6ac	2024-09-22T07:50:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/S100cJ8dpA/S100cJ8dpA_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

See destruction after rocket makes direct hit on northern Israel	A Camera captures the harrowing moment of a rocket making hitting a house and the subsequent explosion as Hezbollah missile fire increases the range in the north Two heavy and long-range rockets struck the streets of the small community of Moreshet in Lower Galilee causing extensive damage. Vehicles were sent flying, and many homes suffered shrapnel and blast damage. Moreshet was one of the primary targets of Hezbollah's fire during the barrages late on Saturday and into the morning hours on Sunday. hundreds of rockets, cruise missiles, and UAVs were launched toward Israel overnight and during the morning, mostly targeting the north. Air defense systems intercepted the majority of these projectiles. Starting at 7 a.m., following multiple rocket salvos, sirens blared in the southern Golan Heights after a UAV launched in Iraq, neared the area, and shortly after noon, a series of sirens sounded in Kiryat Shmona and the Upper Galilee due to suspected aircraft infiltration. The home of Moti Parish in Moreshet was severely damaged by a rocket that struck the parking lot in front of his house. Parish, who was widowed last year, lives alone. His children who live in neighboring communities assisted to remove whatever belongings that were undamaged, from the home. 'We did not have sirens here since the war started. Throughout the night, there were heard the sirens for all around us and at 4 a.m., the siren in Moreshet was activated and I decided to stay here and sleep in the reinforced room. At 6:30 the rocket landed and the clock stopped. Books fell in the reinforced room, and I didn't understand what was happening,' he said. 'I've lived here for 27 years. I never thought I'd be in the line of fire, he said. 'Mentally, I don't feel traumatized or anything like that right now. I understand there's no choice but to engage in this campaign. What alternative is there if not a military one? We can't leave the situation as it is. We must continue with full force. Logically, there's no point in making an agreement with them (Hezbollah). Any agreement signed with them is just a truce and a sign of weakness.' Hanna (Agnes) Hartman, a resident of the community, recounted the tumultuous night: 'I heard explosions somewhere far away, and I thought to myself, 'Oh no, they're getting closer to us.' So this time, it was bigger. I was glad the kids came to my house because my bedroom is reinforced with concrete,' she said. How do you feel seeing the extensive destruction and your car in the garden? 'Unfortunately, I'm old enough and have been through many things. So I say, 'God Almighty, why again, when will it end?' I pray and hope for peace.' Itay Abecassis, married with five children and a resident of Moreshet who came there after being evacuated from Kiryat Shmona, was on weekend leave from reserve duty. 'Houses next to us took a severe hit, and our house has shrapnel in every corner, windows were torn from their hinges. Our cars were burned and destroyed. It's a tough feeling. You're lost. We have no home in Kiryat Shmona, which we left a year ago, and we have no home here,' he said. Linoy Amzaleg, 16, was injured by the rocket fall in Kiryat Bialik and was taken for medical treatment at Rambam Health Care Campus. 'We went out to see what happened because it was a serious boom, it hit me as if it was an explosion and fire entered the safe room. I felt like something was dripping on my face, and I thought maybe it was because I was crying, so I wiped it and saw blood. I have headaches, and pain in my face and the whole side is swollen. We miraculously survived; it could have ended completely differently.' The Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, began transferring patients from various departments to the underground facilities, set up when the war in Gaza began. A car park in times of peace it was adapted to serve as a hospital ward after it became clear in the wake of the 2006 Second Lebanon War, that there would be a need to treat the civilian population in a protected area. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk3navapc	2024-09-22T06:32:44-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/SJs651vapC/SJs651vapC_0_155_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Slain Hezbollah commanders were planning October 7-style attack o...	President reveals senior Radwan Force leaders killed in Israeli airstrike on Beirut gathered to 'launch the same horrific, horrendous attack that we had on October 7' The Hezbollah commanders killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Friday were meeting to plan an attack akin to the October 7 assault by Hamas, President Isaac Herzog told Sky News in an interview on Sunday. 'Israel does not want to get into a war with Lebanon, but Lebanon has been hijacked by a terror organization which is also a political party in Lebanon called Hezbollah,' Herzog said. 'All of these leaders were meeting together in order to launch the same horrific, horrendous attack that we had on October 7 by Hamas, by burning Israelis, butchering them, raping their women, abducting and taking hostage old people and young, and little babies – so this is exactly the same plan that they've been planning for years under the empire of evil of Iran. So we are fighting, actually the war for the entire Free World.' In Friday's attack, Ibrahim Aqil, the head of Hezbollah's operations unit and one of the terrorist group's top military commanders was also killed in the strike. The Israeli Air Force struck dozens of Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon over the weekend, including rocket launchers and military structures, in response to Hezbollah’s rocket attacks on the Jezreel Valley and the Haifa Bay area. These attacks caused heavy damage in Kiryat Bialik, Moshav Moreshet and Beit She'arim. Approximately 150 rockets, drones and cruise missiles were launched at Israel between Saturday night and Sunday morning, most of which were intercepted. Alarms sounded in Kiryat Shmona and the Upper Galilee later on Sunday due to a suspected aircraft infiltration. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning to Hezbollah in a video message on Sunday, declaring that Israel had dealt the group a series of blows 'it never imagined' and vowing further action if necessary. 'If they didn’t get the message, I assure you—they will,' Netanyahu said, following overnight rocket barrages on northern Israel and retaliatory Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon. 'We will take whatever action is necessary to restore security and to bring our people safely back to their homes.' Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant toured the Israeli Air Force’s command and control center, where he was briefed on the IAF’s readiness. 'Hezbollah is feeling the impact of the IDF’s capabilities. We will continue our operations until we can ensure the safe return of residents to their homes in northern Israel,' Gallant said. Days earlier, Gallant visited the Ramat David Air Base, the target chosen by Hezbollah in the overnight barrage, where he announced 'a new phase' in the war in the north. Gallant visited the base last Wednesday, the same day Hezbollah walkie-talkies exploded throughout Lebanon, an action attributed to Israel according to foreign media, which killed more than 20 Hezbollah operatives and wounded hundreds more. Foreign Minister Israel Katz also addressed the situation, warning that if the international community does not act to remove Hezbollah from northern Lebanon, Israel will take action. 'We will do everything necessary to protect our citizens from Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that has continuously attacked Israel since October 8,' Katz said, referring to the displacement of around 70,000 Israelis due to the conflict. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1ptkypa0	2024-09-22T05:53:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/HkKnyO6pR/HkKnyO6pR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

We can't accept it either,' PM says, vowing further blows to terror group if strikes on Israel persist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning to Hezbollah in a video message on Sunday, declaring that Israel had dealt the group a series of blows 'it never imagined' and vowing further action if necessary. 'If they didn’t get the message, I assure you—they will,' Netanyahu said, following overnight rocket barrages on northern Israel and retaliatory Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon. Netanyahu’s message came just before he delivered a rare security update to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, his first in nearly four months, amid rising tensions with Hezbollah. 'No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can't accept it either. We will take whatever action is necessary to restore security and to bring our people safely back to their homes,' he said in a video, which was later released in English with a watered-down text. Netanyahu’s briefing to the committee followed his last appearance on June 3, during high-stakes negotiations over a potential hostage deal and the unveiling of a cease-fire proposal by U.S. President Joe Biden. Committee chair Yuli Edelstein indicated he would seek answers from Netanyahu regarding the so-called 'generals' plan' which proposes potential military actions in Gaza, reductions in humanitarian aid and a new strategy toward Hamas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syepmyt6c	2024-09-22T05:31:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/HJOzruT60/HJOzruT60_8_0_453_255_0_small.jpg

IDF raids Al Jazeera’s Ramallah office, disrupts live broadcast	Soldiers present Qatari-owned network with 45-day military closure order, confiscate equipment and documents from offices and prevent senior reporters from broadcasting outside; Hamas condemns move Israeli forces raided Al Jazeera’s offices in the West Bank city of Ramallah overnight Sunday, enforcing a 45-day military closure order, just months after the network’s Jerusalem bureau was shut down. The raid, which was broadcast live, showed an Israeli soldier delivering the closure order to Walid al-Omari, the Qatari-owned network’s bureau chief who had relocated from Jerusalem to Ramallah. 'There is a court order to close Al Jazeera for 45 days. I ask that you take the cameras and leave immediately,' the soldier told al-Omari. Al Jazeera reported that the IDF confiscated equipment and documents from the offices and prevented senior reporters, including al-Omari and Givara Budeiri, from broadcasting outside. The building's surroundings were declared a closed military zone, and trucks were brought in to remove the confiscated items. Footage from the scene also showed soldiers removing a poster of Shireen Abu Akleh, an Al Jazeera journalist who was killed during an IDF operation in Jenin in May 2022. The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate condemned the raid, calling it 'a new aggression against journalistic work and the media.' Hamas’ government media office in Gaza labeled the closure 'a crime and a violation of the laws.' Al Jazeera continues to operate in Gaza with one reporter, despite the closures. In May, Israeli police raided Al Jazeera's offices in East Jerusalem, following a government decision to shut down the network in Israel. Last month, the Israeli government also approved a proposal to block the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese Al Mayadeen network, and ordered the confiscation of its equipment and the blocking of its websites. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hksci8ptr	2024-09-22T04:37:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/r1qW9EpaC/r1qW9EpaC_5_0_1251_704_0_small.jpg
Panicked by rocket siren, northern Israel driver crashes car, kil...	Authorities suspect driver panicked during siren and veered off road into barrier; 17-year-old dead, 4 more injured; Home Front Command: 'When you hear a siren in the car, slow down' A 17-year-old teen from central Israel died early Sunday after the car he was in collided with a barrier on Route 77 near Ramat Yishai, a small town southeast of Haifa, following a rocket alert in the Jezreel Valley. The accident occurred around 5:10 a.m., during the third barrage in the region that night. Authorities suspect the driver panicked during the siren and veered off the road. Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service medics and paramedics were alerted to the crash at 5:18 a.m. and found the young man trapped in the back seat of the vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Another man in his early twenties was transported to Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa with moderate to severe injuries. Two other passengers sustained minor injuries and were treated on-site. 'We arrived to find a crushed vehicle. A 17-year-old boy was trapped in the back seat, unconscious, not breathing and without a pulse. After extricating him, we had to pronounce his death,' said MDA paramedic Ofer Winik. 'A young man around 20 exited the vehicle with injuries. After initial treatment, we transported him to the hospital in moderate to severe condition.' Yaron Ben-Yishai, commander of the Migdal HaEmek police station, confirmed that the incident is being investigated as a possible result of panic during the siren. 'We urge all drivers to exercise caution and avoid traveling north during alerts. There have been multiple incidents of vehicles being hit by interceptor fragments, and we are handling numerous scenes,' he said. Speaking to Ynet, Brig. Gen. (res.) Hilik Sofer advised drivers on how to respond during a rocket alert: 'When you hear a siren in the car, slow down and try to pull over safely. Even if you can’t come to a complete stop, reducing speed can prevent accidents. Turn off the engine, get out, lie down, and wait for at least ten minutes. This can save lives, both from rocket fragments and accidents caused by loss of control.' The deceased teenager has been identified as Noam Yechiel from the moshav of Ahiezer, near Ben Gurion Airport. Yechiel, a student at Bnei Yissachar Yeshiva, was returning from a Shabbat Chatan celebration in the north for a friend’s wedding when the crash occurred. Yechiel was traveling with friends back to the yeshiva after visiting the grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. His father, Erez Yechiel, a singer and cantor, said, 'We spoke on Friday before Shabbat and wished each other a peaceful Shabbat. This morning, the head of the council and police officers came to deliver the bitter news.' 'Noam was a good boy, dedicated to his home and studies at the yeshiva,' Yechiel added. 'Even when things were tough, he persevered.' David Yifrah, head of the Sdot Dan Regional Council, visited the Yechiel family home following the tragedy. 'All the residents of the council share in the family's sorrow. Informing them about their son’s death was a difficult and painful moment. The family has deep roots in the moshav, and we are supporting them in these tough times,' Yifrah said. Noam leaves behind his parents, Erez and Anava Yechiel, and his siblings. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjqdh86ac	2024-09-22T04:01:03-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/ryVJa7p6C/ryVJa7p6C_0_122_1280_721_0_small.jpg

A day later, on October 8, another Iranian terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, attacked Israel completely unprovoked. They fired missiles and rockets into our cities. They made 60,000 Israelis leave their homes along the Lebanon border, becoming refugees in their own land. In the subsequent months, they haven't stopped for a single day attacking us. No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can't accept it either.

Alarms were sounded in cities and towns including Nazareth, Nof Hagalil, Migdal HaEmek, Acre, Shfar’am, Yarka, Daliyat al-Karme and Isfiya, as well as in numerous kibbutzim and villages, most of which had been largely untouched by the war until now. Early Sunday, around 6:30 a.m., the IDF reported 85 rockets were fired within a half hour, hitting communities from Kiryat Bialik to the Jezreel Valley, causing extensive damage and injuring several people. In total, over 115 rockets have been fired from Lebanon since midnight. A rocket struck a two-story residential building and several cars in Kiryat Bialik in one of the attacks, causing extensive damage. Four people were injured from shrapnel in the attack—a man in his seventies who was moderately wounded and another three who sustained light injuries, including a 16-year-old girl. Several others suffered from shock. 'I was at home with my granddaughter when we heard the explosion. The blast was so powerful it ripped the metal window frame out,' said one Kiryat Bialik resident who was hospitalized along with his granddaughter. 'The shrapnel flew into the room, injuring her, but if we hadn’t been in the safe room, we would have been killed. When I went outside, I saw the house was gone, and the cars too.' Twelve additional people were treated at hospitals in Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya and Emek Medical Center in Afula for light injuries sustained while rushing to shelters or due to shock. Following an assessment, hospitals across the region, including Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, moved their operations to protected areas. Hezbollah claimed it had targeted the Ramat David Air Base and a Rafael Advanced Defense Systems facility in Haifa Bay in what it described as an 'initial response' to last week's attacks involving pagers and walkie-talkies. Early Sunday, around 6:30 a.m., the IDF reported 85 rockets were fired within a half hour, hitting communities from Kiryat Bialik to the Jezreel Valley, causing extensive damage and injuring several people. In total, over 115 rockets have been fired from Lebanon since midnight. A Hezbollah rocket struck a cowshed in the small farming community of Moshav Beit She'arim in northern Israel’s Jezreel Valley early Sunday, killing 15 cows and causing significant damage to agricultural infrastructure. In a separate incident, a 17-year-old boy was killed and four others were injured in a car accident near Ramat Yishai during a rocket alert. The IDF said it intercepted all rockets and drones launched overnight, including two cruise missiles from Iraq. Alarms were also sounded in communities east of the Sea of Galilee. A fire broke out near Moshav Ramot in the southern Golan Heights due to rocket debris, and one person was treated for shock. Another alarm was heard in the Arava region in southern Israel, triggered by a suspected drone infiltration. The drone was intercepted before it entered Israeli airspace. In response, the military launched a new wave of strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. The IDF said that dozens of targets were struck in southern Lebanon, including launch sites and military infrastructure belonging to the terrorist group. The Home Front Command announced changes to safety guidelines starting at 6 a.m. and the cancellation of classes from Haifa northward. Schools were also closed in Migdal Ha’emek and Yokneam, south of Haifa. A scheduled Security Cabinet meeting was canceled, while the weekly Cabinet meeting was postponed. Kiryat Bialik Mayor Eli Dukorski said, 'A rocket hit a residential area in the city. Several homes were damaged, two of them severely. We are aware of three people who were evacuated to hospitals. Municipal and security teams arrived at the scene, and firefighters extinguished the blaze. The situation is extremely serious. The red line should have been drawn long ago at the confrontation line communities. We must take the necessary steps to end this saga. I believe a decisive action against Hezbollah in Lebanon will lead to a resolution with Hamas and the return of the hostages. We have no other choice.' Kiryat Bialik security chief Ofer Yakuti described the aftermath: 'There were multiple fires, cars were set ablaze, but our focus was solely on saving lives. The rocket hit in the middle of the street, which means the blast spread in all directions. The Home Front Command’s guidelines saved lives. We were incredibly fortunate—just three injuries, all minor because they were in the safe rooms. People must follow the instructions and stay in the shelters for at least 10 minutes; it saves lives.' Oleg Taubin, a resident celebrating his 55th birthday, said he was in the shelter when the rocket hit: 'We heard a huge explosion and thought it hit the roof. We waited 10 minutes before coming out to find shattered windows and glass everywhere. If we hadn’t been in the shelter or if we had been on the second floor, we would have been injured for sure.' Ilan, another resident who works on the Iron Dome production line at the Rafael facility that was purportedly targeted, said, 'I was at work when the alarms went off, and we took cover. My family called to tell me a rocket had hit our street. When I got home, it looked like a battlefield, like scenes from Gaza. My son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter were at home, and they were saved only because they were in the safe room. Iron Dome has saved countless lives, but unfortunately, it couldn’t protect my home.' Home Front Command chief Maj. Gen. Rafi Milo visited the site of the rocket impact. The IDF said, 'Home Front Command forces immediately responded to the scene and began conducting searches in coordination with the Israel Police, Fire and Rescue Services, Magen David Adom and the local authorities.' Amihai Ben Shluss, mayor of Acre, where several alerts were sounded, said, 'We are now in a heightened state of emergency. All shelters are open. It’s a difficult situation for us. We decided to cancel classes as some schools don’t have adequate shelters. I’m not willing to take that risk.' Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav explained the decision to close schools: 'We want to keep children near safe areas. I’ve been around the city, and it’s empty. People are following instructions, and that’s how it must remain. The north and south don’t seem to matter to anyone. No one from the government or the military has been here. We’re managing everything on our own. We’re running out of resources, and we have no plan for what comes next. Many buildings lack shelters, but they were built with thick walls. It helped during the Second Lebanon War, but it’s a 50/50 chance now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1w400ptac	2024-09-22T03:17:49-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/rJozhmpT0/rJozhmpT0_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

President Isaac Herzog revealed in an interview with Britain's Sky News that the head of Hezbollah's operations team Ibrahim Akil and other senior members of the Radwan force, who were killed in the attack on a meeting of Hezbollah Radwan forces commanders on Friday, were gathered there to planan October 7-style attack. 'Lebanon has been hijacked by a terror organization which is also a political party in Lebanon called Hezbollah. It's been armed to its teeth by the Iranian empire of evil. And all of these leaders who were eradicated on Friday by the Israeli attack, all of these leaders were meeting together in order to launch the same horrific, horrendous attack that we had on October 7th by Hamas. By burning Israelis, butchering them, raping their women, abducting and taking hostage old people and little babies. This is exactly the same plan that they've been planning for years under the plans of the empire of evil of Iran,' Herzog said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1fuhvttr	2024-09-22T03:11:12-07:00	
IDF strikes hits Hamas terrorist compound in former Gaza school	The IDF spokesman confirmed that Israeli Air Force aircraft, under the direction of IDF, ISA, and Southern Command intelligence, attacked in a targeted manner Hamas terrorists who were staying in a compound that was formerly used as the Kfar Qasem school in the northern Gaza Strip. Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harm to uninvolved civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information, according to the IDF. Earlier, the Palestinians reported six deaths in the attack on the school, which is located in the al-Shati refugee camp. According to the Palestinians, the director general of the Ministry of Labor was killed in the attack, and the Gaza housing engineer Majed Saleh.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1pi7dpac	2024-09-22T02:35:22-07:00	
A look at the rockets Hezbollah fired deep into Israeli territory	Despite heavy damage to residential areas in 3 different locations across northern Israel, terror group claims targeted military sites, using Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets, with range of up to 65 miles Hezbollah launched a series of rocket barrages into northern Israel, causing significant damage to residential and agricultural areas in Kiryat Bialik, Beit She'arim in the Jezreel Valley and Moshav Moreshet in the Misgav Regional Council in the Galilee. Hezbollah claimed it had targeted the Ramat David Air Base and a Rafael Advanced Defense Systems facility in Haifa Bay in what it described as an 'initial response' to last week's attacks involving pagers and walkie-talkies. The group said it used new long-range Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets, along with Katyusha rockets. The Beirut-based Al Mayadeen news channel reported that the Fadi-1 rocket has a 220 mm caliber and an 80-kilometer (37-mile) range, while the Fadi-2 has a 302 mm caliber and a 105-kilometer (65-mile) range. According to sources quoted by Al Mayadeen, 'this is the first time these rockets have been used since October 8,' when fighting on the northern front began. The sources said that in this attack, Hezbollah did not use precision-guided missiles. The rockets originated from one of the group's underground Imad facilities used for storing precision missiles and heavy rockets, which were reportedly unaffected by Israeli attacks. A recently released Hezbollah video showed missile launch platforms emerging from underground and identified one of the facilities as 'Imad 4,' which may have been used to store the Fadi rockets. The video, shared by Al Mayadeen, highlighted the secrecy and protection surrounding the facility, which is located deep underground and far from hostile intelligence capabilities. Following the rocket attacks, Hezbollah issued a statement describing the barrages as a response to the pager and walkie-talkie incidents, but did not mention the assassination of Ibrahim Aqil, head of Hezbollah's operations unit, or other commanders from the Radwan force. Early Sunday, around 6:30 a.m., the IDF reported 85 rockets were fired within a half hour, hitting communities from Kiryat Bialik to the Jezreel Valley, causing extensive damage and injuring several people. In total, over 115 rockets have been fired from Lebanon since midnight. A rocket struck a two-story residential building and several cars in Kiryat Bialik in one of the attacks, causing extensive damage. Three people were injured from shrapnel in the attack—a man in his seventies who was moderately wounded and another two who sustained light injuries, including a 16-year-old girl. Several others suffered from shock. Rocket fragments were found in Tsur Shalom and Moreshet, where a house yard was also hit. In response, the IDF launched a new wave of strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Home Front Command updated its guidelines beginning at 6:00 a.m., canceling classes from Haifa to the northern border. Meanwhile, alarms were sounded in communities east of the Sea of Galilee. A fire broke out near Moshav Ramot in the southern Golan Heights following a rocket strike, and one person was treated for shock. In the Arava region in southern Israel, an alarm was triggered by a suspected infiltrating drone which was intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjlgwv6pa	2024-09-22T02:31:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/Skg6R9XapC/Skg6R9XapC_37_126_579_326_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah rocket falls in Moshav Beit She'arim, kills 15 cows	One of Hezbollah's rocket attacks early Sunday morning, which Hezbollah said was aimed at a nearby IDF base, landed on a cow shed in a small northern community, killing 15 cows and critically wounding several more; 'We heard the giant boom, and when I stepped outside, I saw the damage' In a dramatic turn of events, one of the salvos targeting the Jezreel Valley, that Hezbollah said was aimed at the Ramat David base by Hezbollah, struck a cowshed in Moshav Beit She'arim. Moshe Cohen, the 78-year-old farmer, recounted the harrowing experience: 'At 4 a.m., we were awaken by a massive boom and found our cows in distress. The veterinarian is doing everything possible to save those severely injured. There's significant damage to the sheds and water systems, but it's a great miracle no one was hurt.' As four salvos rained down on the Jezreel Valley overnight, the moshav reported that a cowshed in Beit She'arim was struck, resulting in the death of 15 cows and damage to the structures. 'The main thing is that we are alive,' Moshe Cohen reflected on the impact to his family’s cowshed. 'I told my wife, 'Look what's happening, it's just a matter of days before it reaches us.' Then, at 4 a.m., we heard the giant boom, and when I stepped outside, I saw the damage.' Cohen, a second-generation moshav founder and a farmer for nearly 50 years, shared the grim toll: 'Fifteen cows were killed, and three are critically injured. The veterinarian is here trying to save them, but it's likely they will have to be put down. There is extensive damage to the sheds and water systems, and we have a lot of hard work ahead to fix everything.' Shuki Shor from Beit She'arim remarked: 'The explosion was barely 65 yards from the family home, and everyone was inside. It sounded close, and soon we realized it had landed right in our farmyard.' He speculated that the target was the nearby Ramat David air base and, indeed, Hezbollah claimed the salvos were directed at that base, where Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated last week that we are entering a 'new phase in the war.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy119cxpp0	2024-09-22T00:04:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/22/rkagVW6a0/rkagVW6a0_0_203_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The northern Israel air base in Hezbollah’s crosshairs	Hezbollah says overnight barrage targeted Ramat David Air Base, about 30 miles from Lebanese border, where Gallant announced ‘new phase’ on northern front just days earlier; this is how the IDF has been preparing for such an attack Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a rocket barrage overnight Sunday targeting the Ramat David Air Base in northern Israel with 'dozens of Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets,' saying it was in response to a series of Israeli strikes that the terrorist group alleges killed numerous civilians. The IDF, however, reported that only 10 rockets were fired in the salvo, most of which were intercepted. The chosen target, Ramat David Air Base, had hosted Defense Minister Yoav Gallant just days earlier. During his visit, Gallant declared the beginning of 'a new phase' in the northern conflict. The visit followed a series of explosions of Hezbollah communication devices attributed to Israel, killing over 20 of the group’s fighters and injuring hundreds more, according to foreign reports. 'The center of gravity is shifting northward with the reallocation of resources and forces,' Gallant announced. 'We are entering a new phase in this war. This is not Hamas; it is something different, and we must prepare accordingly.' In July, Hezbollah released drone footage showing Ramat David Air Base, which is located about 30 miles from the Lebanese border. According to the Lebanese terror group, the footage was taken the day before by its Hudhud drone, which has previously filmed in Haifa Bay and bases in the Golan Heights. In the nine-minute clip, Hezbollah identifies various facilities visible in the footage, including fuel tanks for aircraft, the headquarters of the 109th Squadron, an Iron Dome air defense platform, ammunition depots, the headquarters of the 157th Squadron, hangars and the headquarters of the 105th Squadron. The group also published a photo of the base commander's office, allegedly revealing his personal details and noting that he began his role in July 2022. Additional footage showed other warehouses and headquarters of the 101st and 160th Squadrons, as well as the technical area of the 193rd Squadron. The video also includes images purportedly taken on July 9, featuring Apache helicopters, fuel storage and Hercules aircraft. Bracing for impact The IDF has been preparing for potential attacks on its Ramat David Air Base since the late 2000s, anticipating a scenario in which Hezbollah would focus strikes on the runways, radar systems and underground bunkers at the Air Force's only northern base. The Air Force has repeatedly drilled for scenarios involving operational continuity, rapid infrastructure repairs, relocating squadrons to other bases and bolstering air defense. This preparation comes in response to the erosion of Israel’s air superiority in the Lebanese arena in recent years and the possibility that manned aircraft could be downed in a future war with Hezbollah. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the latest barrage of rockets, launched around 1:10 a.m. Sunday, saying it had fired 'dozens of Fadi-1 and Fadi-2 rockets' at the base in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Lebanon that it said killed civilians. This marks the first time the Iran-backed group has mentioned using these specific types of rockets in its statements. Sirens were activated in dozens of northern communities, from Kafr Manda to Afula, including areas that have not experienced alerts for a long time. Explosions were heard in Acre, Haifa and the Haifa Bay region, with interceptor missiles visible over Nazareth. About 30 minutes before the barrage, the IDF reported that it had struck some 110 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, including launchers and terror infrastructure. In total, the military said it hit 290 targets throughout the afternoon and evening, guided by Military Intelligence and Northern Command. 'The IDF continues to degrade Hezbollah's terror capabilities and military infrastructure,' the statement said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1xls76tc	2024-09-21T22:27:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/10/21/S1gIkgQ1UK/S1gIkgQ1UK_0_106_1024_577_0_small.jpg

I made it very clear how I don't feel safe on campus. Tulane University's response was to label 'f*** you, Jew' as political speech,' says Yasmeen Ohebsion, a student at Tulane University in New Orleans (one of the universities with the highest percentage of Jewish students in the U.S. – about a quarter of the students there are Jewish). 'So at Tulane University 'f*** you, Jew' is political speech but 'f*** you, gay' would probably lead to expulsion. 'F*** you, black;' forget about it. You're not going to have a career.

If you're Jewish, people can do whatever they want, including physically attacking you, and still, the university does nothing. 'It's watching my friends be beaten with a metal microphone and having all these bones and their faces broken. The ambulance comes, and before the ambulance can even move this Jewish student from the street into the car, there is a group of 10 maintenance people scrubbing the Jewish blood off of the street to make sure that there's no evidence, there are no pictures and I have the pictures of the blood. Same thing as when someone says 'f*** you, Jew' and they say 'here's a link to three sessions of free therapy. You go fix yourself.'' 'I hope you get gassed out in the basement of AEPi (a Jewish fraternity). P.S. What is your Auschwitz prison number?' Daniella Ludmir, a student at the University of Michigan, shows me a message she received. Signed: Adolf. 'I know that at MIT and also at Stanford, the school administrations paid for safe housing for Jewish students who were threatened and harassed to such an extent that their physical safety was at risk if they stayed in their dorms. They're putting Jews in separate housing to protect Jewish safety, but they're not stopping the bullies,' says MIT student Talya Kahn. '[The University of Michigan] president sent emails to the entire university right after October 7 saying standing up to terrorism should not be controversial at the University of Michigan. There was a protest at his home,' says Ludmir. 'Even though we received public support from our administration, and this is not something that's common at every university, Jewish students still feel unsafe to walk on campus because they see a giant banner all across the center of campus saying 'Long live the Intifada.' What are they doing to make us feel safe? Chloe Katz, a student at Columbia University, says she's been told that the sexual violence committed by Hamas terrorists against Israelis on October 7 was justified. 'I'm a helpline volunteer for sexual violence response at Columbia and I'm also part of all of these Israeli activist groups. And so when my group had the idea of publicizing the fact that these testimonies of sexual violence from October 7 and in captivity are being denied or pushed aside, I went to my boss in sexual violence response, asked her to collaborate on an event together and gave her our idea. They initially said 'yes, that's great,' And then they stopped responding to me. 'Instead, we did a silent protest. My friends and I joined arms in front of the library, put duct tape on our mouths and held up signs that said 'Hamas weaponizes sexual assault' and 'rape is not resistance.' They screamed at us, spat at us, threatened us. But we didn't budge.' 'I want to paint the picture for Israelis of what it's like to be a Jew on campus right now. It feels post-apocalyptic,' says Columbia student Eli Gelb. 'When you walk down the street next to Columbia, you see torn kidnapped posters. You see the pictures with swastikas drawn over them. Penises vandalizing the babies on the kidnapped poster. Every single spot is covered with stickers and posters for Palestine. 'Free Palestine,' 'Zionism is terrorism' and 'Zionism is Nazism.' 'When you walk onto campus, it is covered with people wearing keffiyehs, it is inescapable. You go onto campus during the encampment, they're shooting flares, they're starting fires, they're rioting and you see the heat in their eyes. And this isn't a small number. It's hundreds of people gathered every single day. 'There are specific nights when you walk around and it is anarchy. Zero public safety. The entire area where Jewish students live is smothered with adults running around, ripping the flags off of the backs of Jewish students, spitting at us, throwing liquids at us, and I was physically chased off of campus with the rabbi and told to go back to Poland. I was called 'Al-Qassam's next target.' But this is in the hundreds, and that's what I don't think they really understand. We're small but we're powerful. We're not going anywhere.' 'I've received a lot of death threats,' says Ohebsion. 'We wake up, we walk to campus and people scream at us 'murderer' or 'Zionist pig' or whatever slurs, and then you go to class and see people with keffiyehs everywhere you go. It's an everyday problem. You get to class and your partner won't work with you because you're a Zionist or you either have to worry about not mentioning Israel in your paper because you're scared to fail. These experiences impact your grades.' 'It's exhausting,' adds Ludmir. 'Everywhere you go, you see it. Even when you're in the silent room at the library where nobody can say anything, they then open their laptop and their laptop is covered in stickers about how 'Zionism is Nazism' and 'from the river to the sea' and and 'there is only one solution Intifada revolution.' I'm a neuroscience student; I want to learn biology and it's hard when you hear 'Intifada revolution' being chanted by hundreds of students inside university buildings.' Uncle murdered in Kibbutz Be'eri Yasmeen, Chloe, Talya, Daniella and Eli are part of a delegation of about 20 American Jewish students who recently visited Israel. They toured kibbutzim near the Gaza border, visited the Nova music festival site, met wounded soldiers in hospitals, heard stories of heroism and capped off their visit by meeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians. I met them on the final day of the trip, organized by Olami, which has been active on campuses in the U.S., Latin America and Europe since 2012. Despite having seen countless videos and read numerous reports on campus protests and rising antisemitism, hearing these firsthand accounts is chilling. They show me terrifying videos of masked mobs storming classrooms, riots, screenshots of threats they’ve received and more. I’ve always felt that antisemitism was like water to a fish—ever-present but less visible to me, growing up in Israel, where I felt like a fish in an aquarium, protected from the open sea's dangers. This group is made up of activists. Yasmeen Ohebsion launched an initiative of roundtables on antisemitism, organized a shipment of supplies for the displaced and initiated a petition from Jewish students sent to Congress. Two of her cousins are currently fighting in Gaza. Ludmir's uncle, Dr. Daniel Levy Ludmir, was murdered in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7. She, too, is a medical student, at the University of Michigan, and organized a war-awareness event attended by 1,000 people, with another 4,000 joining online. In response to her uncle’s death, she says she was met with hateful comments. Eli Gelb, from Columbia University, regularly stands proudly with an Israeli flag in front of pro-Palestinian protests, often enduring violence. Chloe Katz, also from Columbia, organizes rallies and educational events. Talya Kahan from MIT was born to a Jewish mother and a Muslim father but was raised and educated as Jewish, never doubting her Jewish identity. 'I am a Jew who knows where my land is and who my people are. I may not have family here, but I am indigenous to this land. This is my place. Read the Bible, man.' She founded the MIT-Israel Alliance and serves as its president. For me, Judaism is second nature. For them, it's a daily battle. They are all in their early twenties. Except for Kahn, they all have family in Israel, and most have visited many times, including through Birthright programs. I ask them how they perceive our emotional state during this visit, and I'm surprised by their answer. About a month ago, I met a friend who had just returned from living abroad, and he said we all look as if we’ve been run over by a bulldozer—worn out, tired, angry and impatient. But to this group from the U.S., we come across differently. 'My first thought in the morning is Israel and the last thing I think about before I go to sleep is Israel,' says Ohebsion. 'There's no real way to know how the people are doing until you come here to the Land of Israel and see it and feel it. I really pictured Israel as a much more fractured place after October 7 than it is. I think that I felt this incredible unity among Jewish people who care about this cause. 'It's been hard to go to the kibbutz, to hear people's stories, but it's also been reassuring to see that the shook (market) is still full of people. People are still going to pubs in Tel Aviv, sitting on the beach. And as Jewish people, that's a mitzvah.' 'When you see things like that, you understand that this land is beautiful. This group of people put their lives on hold and want to give back to this country. It feels like if I'm going to live here, I need to be part of this,' says Katz, who plans to make Aliyah next year. Kahn: 'Being in Israel is the first time since October 7 that I finally felt like I can finally take a breath and like feel comfortable and not have to worry that there's going to be some crazy rioters. Like when I turn the corner, they're yelling 'free Palestine' and 'bomb Tel Aviv' wearing keffiyehs. Even though I obviously didn't have the same October 7 experience as the people here, I feel so close with everybody, even the people I don't know. I feel very connected to everybody and we're all going through this together. Just having other people who understand, that you don't have to explain to them, it's a comforting feeling. Although the stuff that we're experiencing on campus is not at all the same level of danger that these people are going through. But we've all had our lives totally changed and turned over.' Apartheid wall They explain that they witnessed the rise of antisemitism on campuses long before October 7. 'A lot of it was in academia,' says Ohebsion. 'Professors use texts that are very antisemitic. Students set up a table, trying to explain why Israel is an apartheid state. People making little comments or posting things on social media. But there was one specific incident that triggered my movement when Kanye West went on that crazy rampage calling for 'death con 3 on Jewish people' (an apparent reference to the U.S. defense readiness condition scale known as DEFCON) and after that, a girl at my school who had a Jewish roommate wrote this article saying Kanye West was right about Jews and that Hitler should have finished the job. The Jews are Nazis. 'I heard from her roommate shortly after that who felt very unsafe and Tulane has very strict policies about speech. We asked why they weren't taking action and the response was hollow. They couldn't give us a reason, but they also didn't do anything about this. So that made me very angry. It made me feel like we aren't worthy of their protection.' 'We have also had plenty of antisemitism at Michigan before October 7,' says Ludmir. 'At least once a year, we would find swastikas either near Jewish buildings like Hillel, Chabad or near Jewish fraternities; buildings that have a Jewish affiliation. There was a big pro-Palestine crowd and community there years before I was a student there, they tried to pass BDS resolutions before I was a student there. 'On October 4, we had what they call their annual demonstration called 'Apartheid Wall' where they share stories of their martyrs and celebrate people who are members of internationally recognized terrorist groups. And they praise them and they talk about how amazing the work that they do for the liberation of Palestine. 'Since October 7, the proportion has changed. We used to have maybe one protest a month, now we have more than one a week. We saw celebrations of October 7 on campus the next day, before Israel had even fully regained control of the situation.' Kahn describes the 'Apartheid Wall,' a mobile exhibit that has been traveling between U.S. campuses since 2016—essentially a mini version of the West Bank separation barrier. There’s an argument that we need to distinguish between antisemitism and criticism of Israeli policy. After all, even in Israel, some oppose the occupation, and that's acceptable. 'One of the important things,' says Ludmir, 'is that it's hard to differentiate the two because it's not being critical of the Israeli government, it's rewriting Jewish history to erase any connection to Israel and completely delegitimizing the state, essentially saying that Israel should not exist at all.' 'I think that this is a very important point in America,' Kahn says. 'It's very ingrained in programming, called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or DEI. Part of that programming gives education about black history and anti-black racism, LGBTQ communities, everything including sizeism discrimination about being fat or skinny, ableism, discrimination about being disabled, and Jews are left out.' They show examples from other universities as well. True, it’s not happening at every university in the U.S.—but so what? These are elite institutions. If the mighty have succumbed how shall the weak emerge unscathed? 'I'm the graduate student president of the MIT Israel Alliance,' says Kahn, 'an organization I founded with a bunch of other students right after October 7 because we didn't really have an Israel organization. 'We did a poll of all the Jewish students in our club, and we have about 150-200 active students. Then we also have faculty, postdoctoral students, staff and alumni. We're about 425 people in total. We polled these students asking them a bunch of questions, among which were 'Have you changed your behavior in any way since October 7' and 70% of people said that they changed their behavior or changed how they spoke with non-Jewish people because they were afraid of antisemitic attacks. Putting a hat over your kippah, tucking in your tzitzit, not wearing your star of David necklace, not telling people that you're going to Shabbat on Friday night, just saying you're busy. That's crazy. 'MIT gives you harassment training. Everybody's required to do harassment training at the beginning of the semester so you can have ID access to the building. In this harassment training, it says that if you deadname somebody, when you call a trans person by their previous name, that is considered harassment. 'Fast forward to the congressional hearing, where my president, Sally Kornbluth, was asked 'Is calling for the genocide of Jews considered harassment,' and she didn't have a clear answer. It depends on the context. These groups are being treated differently than the Jewish groups. They're being treated like they don't have any of the rules apply to them, and so they act with impunity, they just do whatever they want because they know the administration isn't going to enforce the rules, so they interrupt classes, they bully people in front of the campus police, professors harassed Jewish students in class online. All of these things get reported.' Talya Kahn from MIT: 'These people are indoctrinating the next generation of American voters into hating Jews, Western values, democracy and supporting deglobalization, Intifada and pushing Sharia law into the West. It doesn't make any sense to me. It's very scary, especially in the wake of the upcoming elections, and we're going to see people be very hateful, very violent. I think we're all very scared for the future of America and especially America's relationship with Israel.' 'I have a very good friend who was in a writing class where the focus was on racism. She introduces herself and says she is part of the dual degree program with Tel Aviv University. After this, they break into pairs in order to discuss a reading on sexism in the 18th century and my friend's partner looks her in the eye and says 'I just want to make it clear that the rapes that occurred on October 7 are justified because Israel oppresses Palestinians.' 'The professor was right next to them and heard this happen and said nothing. The reason I know this story is because she told it to the dean and president of our school. The president looked at her and said that's 'abhorrent.' So she recognizes that this is horrible, but then what she presents in front of Congress a week later she says 'I think it's personally abhorrent' but they're not acting. It's all lip service.' 'In the last data collection that I did, 55% of Jewish students on Tulane's campus indicated that they felt physically unsafe or extremely unsafe going to school,' says Ohebsion. 'I've been fighting this battle since long before October 7 and I think that I could really feel the antisemitism under the surface and now people have an excuse to broadcast it and show it to the world. I've been saying that Israel is so important, and I've been advocating for Israel for so long and then October 7 happens and it's kind of 'I told you so.'' 'These people,' says Kahn, 'are indoctrinating the next generation of American voters into hating Jews, Western values, democracy and supporting deglobalization, Intifada and pushing Sharia law into the West. It doesn't make any sense to me. It's very scary, especially in the wake of the upcoming elections, and we're going to see people be very hateful, very violent. I think we're all very scared for the future of America and especially America's relationship with Israel.' We've heard and read numerous reports about what's happening on campuses. What aren't we being told? 'There's this narrative that Jews outside of Israel are hiding in their rooms, and when they go out, they're hiding their Judaism. There are people like this, as was conveyed by the statistics that they found, but it's also really important to know that there is a strong, loud, proud population of Jews who are making sure their voices are heard at every protest,' says Ludmir. Gelb, Kahn and Ohebsion concur. 'We're not people who cower in fear. We don't just break down and stop our lives,' Gelb adds. There's a hard core, no doubt, but it's small. At Tulane University, for example, there are 2,500 Jewish students—so many that it's nicknamed 'Jewlane'—making up about a quarter of the student body. However, an average protest draws only around 150 participants, and no more than 10 students are actively involved in organizing initiatives. The rest are either afraid or simply not interested. The percentages are not significantly different at other universities. Gelb and Katz say that it was easier to organize large demonstrations at first, but momentum is fading and participation is dwindling. 'Many students don’t join our protests because they don’t want to be filmed,' says Gelb, showing a video of masked protesters wearing keffiyehs filming the Jewish demonstrators—not exactly discreetly.' Have you ever considered giving up? 'No,' they say resolutely. 'I'm making Aliyah in a year,' says Katz. 'I didn't think that I would be an activist. I said, 'I'm leaving. If I can keep my head down, I can get out.' But that didn't even cross my mind after October 7. It's important for the people in the Diaspora to get involved and use that time wisely. Between Kfar Aza and Nova The delegation’s visit lasted five days. They visited the Gaza border region, the site of the Nova music festival massacre, hospitals and more. What impressed you the most? 'We went to Kfar Aza, Nova and Be'eri,' Gelb says. 'Most of us in America have been waiting for months to finally see it.' 'Personally, one of the things that really struck me,' says Ludmir, 'is that again we see Israelis going out and celebrating, living their lives.' They're not celebrating, they're repressing. 'Israelis are trying to continue their lives as much as they can and we almost forget that we're still at war.' Kahn was particularly impressed by a young man she met who, on the morning of October 7, dropped everything, took a gun and drove to the Gaza border region, rescuing 150 people from Nova. 'He didn't have to go but he went back for more. This is why keep fighting. We all have to be fighters. We all have to be strong,' she says. The delegation also met with President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, Diaspora Affairs Ministry Director-General Avi Cohen, Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Amichai Chikli and others. From the stories, it sounds like they were given the full treatment, just like the rest of us. The meeting with Netanyahu was recorded and posted online (incidentally, the next day, a petition was circulated at MIT calling for Kahn’s suspension due to the meeting). The prime minister was the last to enter the room, and everyone stood up. He was quick and concise, sharp and fluent—a real charmer. 'Where are you from?' he asked one of the participants, like in a performance. 'MIT,' she replied. 'Oh, what a pity,' he said. From what I gather, Netanyahu gave them the full show, which still seems to resonate with American Jews in their 20s. They even asked him for autographs. So, what did you think of our leadership? They say everyone was enthusiastic and very supportive. 'Most of the leaders we met with encouraged us in this fight against antisemitism and spoke about supporting and backing us,' says Katz. 'Something we talked about a lot was increasing direct access to communication by having students like us in the United States have a direct connection to Israelis.' 'I think Smotrich was very passionate,' says Ohebsion. They show me a video where everyone is seen singing Am Yisrael Chai. 'Netanyahu said to us that it's not only the government of Israel, it's the government of the Jewish people,' says Ludmir. 'After getting so little help from the administration of our schools, who are technically the ones who are supposed to protect us in our small environments, we find out that there's a government on the other side of the world that's actively fighting a war and he's saying to us that he's our government too, that he cares about this issue.' I broached the criticism of the government's handling of events leading up to, during and following the events of October 7. The group looks at me ill at ease. 'We don't agree with all of these people politically for sure,' says Kahn. 'But at this point, we have to remember that this is about global Jewish unity. These people don't care if you like Netanyahu or hate him or if you have nuanced opinions about whatever policy on the war. They don't care about that. They just care about is the State of Israel going to exist or is it going to be destroyed. We all went into this not even acknowledging that they are political figures. At the end of the day, our job was to share our personal stories of what actually happened and have a conversation about what we can do as a global Jewish community in order to fight this threat against all of us.' What are your expectations from the government or the State of Israel? 'I think nobody has a plan,' says Gelb. 'What we're here for is to get connected to the right people for advice or resources that can be shared, ideas exchanged, figure out the best way for us to help the mission.' 'Opening the lines of communication,' Kahn says. 'Over the summer, something like 3,000 college students in Michigan who are anti-Israel had a big event in order to train these kids how to be even more aggressive on campuses and we know that in the fall, especially leading up to the elections where we already know there's going to be so much divisiveness and polarization, they're going to ride this wave of hate and make it even stronger with this anti-Israel propaganda, sentiment and aggression. We need to have people to communicate with, We really want to bring Israeli soldiers or survivors of Nova to campuses to help us.' 'This trip was able to connect us to each other,' says Katz. 'I had never met Yasmine or Talya before. I only knew the activists at Columbia. So we're already connected and we're strong, a network of Jewish activists. Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, they're already national, they have that connection. So it's time for us to do that. 'I understand that they are also the Israeli government and so we're not the focus, but we just want to be on the radar and what I was very impressed by was noticing that we were indeed on the radar and they did not dismiss us the way that we've been dismissed by our administration and by seeing a lack of action.' From the stories you’ve shared, it seems to me that this isn’t just a matter of public relations. The issue runs much deeper. 'I tend to agree', says Katz. 'It's not an educational issue. If you prove it's not genocide, for example, you don't change their minds. They also have a policy of non-engagement, so they won't speak with somebody. They don't look at pro-Israel people, they act like you're invisible.' 'Hasbara is not a silver bullet,' says Gelb. 'In America, the feeling on the ground is that nobody has the solution. In Israel, they say you have to control the conflict. You cannot solve it, you cannot win it. You just need to manage it. So hasbara is one piece of the puzzle and numbers is another.' What do you need? 'We need people to stand with us.' If this is a numbers game, we’re in serious trouble. 'That’s how it’s always been throughout our history.' 'And we’re still here,' says Katz. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byd4cfhar	2024-09-21T17:21:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/13/yk13960461/yk13960461_0_54_1186_668_0_small.jpg

Gazans warm Lebanese from war on social media	New trend sees Gaza residents talking to Lebanese amid ongoing tensions on northern border and warning them of war's destructive outcomes As tensions between Israel and Hezbollah increase a new trend on social media sees Gazans turning to Lebanese residents on video and explaining what they should do in case an all-out war breaks in the region, as happened in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attack. Gazans who chose to create these instructional videos are addressing a situation where the displaced might have no certainty about when they'll return to their homes if those homes even remain standing. Some of the videos include advice and 'do's and don'ts' during war while others try to convey the emotions, experiences and severe consequences of the war. For example, Gaza-based chef Hala al-Akhsham filmed a video offering advice in the event of total war: 'Prepare a bag, put money and gold in it, along with all your personal documents (ID cards, licenses, academic certificates, and birth certificates). Keep the bag by the door and make sure someone is responsible for grabbing it immediately in an emergency.' Speaking from her own experience after being displaced multiple times during the war, she added, 'Don’t forget that winter is coming, so pack two tracksuits for each child in their school bags along with your personal hygiene products.' In another video posted on TikTok by a Gazan named Wasim, he shared a message from his tent located in the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, saying, 'Don’t fight. War only brings destruction and sets you back decades. Don’t let war destroy you.' Another displaced Gazan, Mohamed al-Majaydeh, who moved to Deir al-Balah, spoke about the impact of war. 'War is death and humiliation. We’re living like the dead. May God protect Lebanon from war and may this nightmare end.' On the other hand, different types of videos were also seen, such as one posted by Palestinian blogger Mohamed Fayyad in which he filmed himself in a tent in Al-Mawasi addressing the Lebanese with sarcasm. 'I’m calling on the Lebanese — there’s a chance you’ll soon be relocated to Al-Mawasi, be careful.' Many other videos have also spread on social media in recent days, carrying messages urging the Lebanese to pressure Hezbollah not to enter the war which could lead to the displacement of many local residents. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hynhf22p0	2024-09-21T14:00:40-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/HyIZjwn6R/HyIZjwn6R_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IDF says it has been striking southern Lebanons 'extensively'	The IDF said on Saturday it had in the past hour been 'striking extensively' in southern Lebanon after detecting plans by Hezbollah to strike Israeli communities.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skppmn2ac	2024-09-21T14:00:09-07:00	
Tense 24 hours': IDF strikes Hezbollah in Lebanon as tensions at...	As estimations in Israel about a Hezbollah retaliatory attack increase both sides are teetering on the edge of open war; Home Front Command updates guidelines from Hadera northward The IDF executed a series of airstrikes late Saturday across southern Lebanon with reports within the country saying at least 80 targets were hit aimed at least 400 of Hezbollah’s munition launchers. The terror group’s weapons caches were also targeted, with explosions and smoke seen across the country. Meanwhile, the IDF Home Front Command has updated its guidelines to all Israeli communities located from Hadera northward, including Haifa and Safed, ordering municipalities to limit gatherings and stay close to safe rooms when possible amid fears of Hezbollah attacking as soon as Sunday. Against this background, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday is holding a situation assessment alongside Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and other officials and ministers including IDF Chief of Staff LTG Herzi Halevi. Israel is on high alert, as evidenced by a video released by the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Saturday showing Israeli Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar said forces are at 'the highest level of readiness.' Estimations in Jerusalem say Hezbollah will retaliate following the elimination of its senior commanders and hundreds of operatives in Lebanon as soon as Sunday. Israeli Air Force fighter jets eliminated thousands of Hezbollah munition launchers across southern Lebanon earlier on Saturday, strengthening officials’ estimations a major attack is set to take place against Israel. Security sources estimate that an attack may take place within the next 24 hours, warning that 'we're entering a tense 24 hours.' IDF Home Front Command guidelines in the north are also expected to change on Saturday. 'The changes are relevant for the following areas: the Lower Galilee, the Upper Galilee, the Haifa Bay, the Central Galilee, and some of the communities in the southern Golan Heights (Emek Hayarden) in accordance with the situational assessment,' the IDF Spokesperson's Unit said in a statement. The new guidelines prompted northern cities so far untouched by Hezbollah fire or IDF guidelines to change their instruction to residents including Haifa and Acre. Haifa will hold schools in limited frontal learning 'that will allow students to reach a safe room within one minute.' Other schools and classes will be taught remotely according to the municipality. Acre on the other hand has instructed schools to be shut down for the next 24 hours and will be moving to remote learning exclusively. 'We prefer to take severe measures and not to risk students,' the municipality said in a statement. The guidelines also include communities such as Mateh Asher, Kiryat Ata, Kiryat Motzkin, Nesher and the Kinneret Cities Association who decided to limit studies in schools for the foreseeable period. The coming days are expected to significantly shape the trajectory of the conflict with Hezbollah and determine its potential expansion to an all-out war. Israel believes Hezbollah will escalate the scope of its attacks in the next 24 hours and could possibly use even harsher measures following so. On the other hand, the IDF has taken a different approach in the north in recent days. Israel has been eliminating Hezbollah’s short- and medium-range rocket launchers in its waves of strikes. These strikes aim to diminish Hezbollah's ability to retaliate against Israel but also serve as an opportunity to degrade the terror group’s overall operational capacity. Israel has developed an impressive intelligence capability against Hezbollah since the Second Lebanon War in 2006. Billions of shekels have been invested in these capabilities and Israel is now reaping the benefits.

Iran gave Russia missiles but no launchers, sources say	European and U.S. officials say reason behind lack of equipment raises questions about when and if the weapons will be operational Iran did not include mobile launchers with the close-range ballistic missiles that Washington last week accused Tehran of delivering to Russia for use against Ukraine, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. The sources - a European diplomat, a European intelligence official and a U.S. official - said it was not clear why Iran did not supply launchers with the Fath-360 missiles, raising questions about when and if the weapons will be operational. The U.S. official, who like the other sources spoke on condition of anonymity, said Iran had not delivered the launchers at the time of the U.S. announcement about Iran's delivery of the weapons. The European intelligence official said without elaborating that they did not expect Iran to provide launchers. Reuters first reported Iran's plan to send the missiles to Russia. Two experts told Reuters there could be several reasons why the launchers were not sent. One is that Russia may plan to modify trucks to carry the missiles, as Iran has done. Another is that by withholding the launchers, Iran is allowing space for new talks with Western powers on easing tensions. The Russian defense ministry declined to comment. The U.S. National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the Pentagon declined to comment. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tehran denies providing Moscow with the missiles or with thousands of drones that Kyiv and Western officials have said Russia uses against military targets and to destroy civilian infrastructure, including Ukraine’s electrical grid. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sept. 10 that Iran had delivered the Fath-360s to Russia and would 'likely use them within weeks in Ukraine.' The missile would pose an additional challenge for Ukraine, which is constantly adapting its air defenses to innovations by Russian forces. Iran's semi-official Fars news agency says the missile travels at four times the speed of sound when approaching targets. Blinken said the missiles threatened European security and would be fired against short-range targets, allowing Russia to reserve more of its extensive arsenal for targets beyond the front lines. The Fath-360 has a range of up to 75 miles (121 km). The United States, Germany, Britain and France imposed new sanctions on Iran, and the EU said the bloc was considering fresh measures targeting Iran's aviation sector. The Kremlin at that time declined to confirm its receipt of the missiles but acknowledged that its cooperation with Iran included 'the most sensitive areas.' Blinken did not say how many Fath-360s Iran supplied to Russia or when they were sent. Reuters determined through shipping data that a Russian freighter sanctioned by Washington, the Port Olya-3, made voyages between Iran’s Caspian Sea port of Amirabad and the Russian port of Olya several times between May and Sept. 12. Fabian Hinz, an expert on Iranian missiles with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said he could not confirm that Tehran withheld the launchers. Ballistic missiles require specifically designed launchers in order to be fired. According to Hinz, one reason Iran didn't send launchers may be that the civilian trucks that Iran modified to launch these and other missiles are not robust enough to operate in rough terrain during Ukraine's harsh winter. Iran modifies trucks made by Mercedes and other companies and turns them into easily disguised missile launchers, he said. That suggests, he continued, that Russia could modify its own military-grade vehicles. 'A commercial, off-the-shelf Mercedes truck is just not that off-road capable,' he said David Albright, a former UN nuclear inspector who heads the Institute for Science and International Security, also could not say whether Iran delivered the launchers. But he noted that Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and other Iranian officials will be meeting with European officials on the sidelines of next week’s UN General Assembly in New York to test the potential for diplomacy on Tehran’s nuclear program, regional tensions and other disputes. 'It could be that they (Iran) are holding back the launchers to provide a little space for these talks,' he said. 'One can imagine that if there are Iranian missiles raining down (on Ukraine) there would be condemnation at the General Assembly.' But he was skeptical of any progress, saying he doubted Iran would make the necessary compromises. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1rj00jh60	2024-09-21T13:31:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/06/ryBjTCunC/ryBjTCunC_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IDF reports eliminated terrorists holding six slain hostages	Military confirms two Hamas terrorists who held six hostages in Gaza were eliminated by forces based on gathered DNA evidence from scene IDF Spokesperson RADM Daniel Hagari reported on Saturday that forces have eliminated two Hamas terrorists who held the six hostages murdered in captivity in Gaza — Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Uri Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov — in a tunnel near Rafah. 'This evening, we updated the families of Hersh, Eden, Ori, Alex, Almog, and Carmel, may their memories be a blessing, that we eliminated two terrorists who had held them hostage in a tunnel in the Rafah area,' Hagari said. 'The day after the hostages were murdered, troops from the 162nd Division identified two terrorists emerging from an underground tunnel shaft in the Tel al-Sultan area and eliminated them during an encounter. After investigating the findings from the tunnel and equipment on the terrorists, we found DNA evidence and several items belonging to the terrorists we eliminated,' he added. 'Based on the findings and the information available to us, these terrorists that were eliminated were the same terrorists who were in the tunnel where the bodies of the six hostages were discovered. The findings show they were there when they were murdered and we are investigating their involvement in the murder. 'Should we obtain further information, we will first update the families and then the public. We will pursue and reach everyone responsible for this heinous murder, and we will not stop until we reach them all,' Hagari noted. Liel Avraham, Uri Danino’s partner, said, 'We had no doubt that the IDF would hold the murderers accountable. This closure doesn’t bring satisfaction or comfort. They were supposed to come back alive. Their elimination is a moral and obvious duty.' The bodies of the six were found on August 31. According to the IDF investigation, Hamas lookouts noticed soldiers approaching the tunnel and ordered the terrorists to murder the six hostages a day or two before their deaths. The terrorists shot the hostages at close range. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjvuv9htc	2024-09-21T12:15:55-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/BJPtSY3T0/BJPtSY3T0_314_303_1050_591_0_small.jpg

IDF prepares for Hezbollah retaliation as soon as Sunday	Military leadership says Israel entering 'tense 24 hours' after estimations Hezbollah will attack Israel with significant force following eliminations of senior commanders; Home Front Command updates guidelines including in Haifa Israel is on high alert, as evidenced by a video released by the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Saturday showing Israeli Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar said forces are at 'the highest level of readiness.' Estimations in Jerusalem say Hezbollah will retaliate following the elimination of its senior commanders and hundreds of operatives in Lebanon as soon as Sunday. Israeli Air Force fighter jets eliminated thousands of Hezbollah munition launchers across southern Lebanon earlier on Saturday, strengthening officials’ estimations a major attack is set to take place against Israel. Security sources estimate that an attack may take place within the next 24 hours, warning that 'we're entering a tense 24 hours.' IDF Home Front Command guidelines in the north are also expected to change on Saturday. 'The changes are relevant for the following areas: the Lower Galilee, the Upper Galilee, the Haifa Bay, the Central Galilee, and some of the communities in the southern Golan Heights (Emek Hayarden) in accordance with the situational assessment,' the IDF Spokesperson's Unit said in a statement. The coming days are expected to significantly shape the trajectory of the conflict with Hezbollah and determine its potential expansion to an all-out war. Israel believes Hezbollah will escalate the scope of its attacks in the next 24 hours and could possibly use even harsher measures following so. On the other hand, the IDF has taken a different approach in the north in recent days. Israel has been eliminating Hezbollah’s short- and medium-range rocket launchers in its waves of strikes. These strikes aim to diminish Hezbollah's ability to retaliate against Israel but also serve as an opportunity to degrade the terror group’s overall operational capacity. Israel has developed an impressive intelligence capability against Hezbollah since the Second Lebanon War in 2006. Billions of shekels have been invested in these capabilities and Israel is now reaping the benefits. The northern front has been recently prioritized over progress in Gaza due to the more significant threat posed by Hezbollah. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjn2zt260	2024-09-21T10:48:49-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/ByZOdaunaR/ByZOdaunaR_0_524_486_274_0_small.jpg

Admiration' and 'anxiety': U.S. officials' shocked response to p...	While U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan commended pager attack attributed to Israel, other White House officials fear escalation behind U.S.'s back could launch all-out war in the Middle East The world and specifically the U.S. were impressed with Israel’s intelligence capabilities after the pager detonations in Lebanon and Syria attributed to it injured hundreds of Hezbollah terrorists and senior Radwan Force operatives in precise airstrikes. However, these developments reignited worries about an all-out war taking place in the Middle East. While the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the eliminations in Beirut were a 'good result', others in U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration think otherwise. Researcher Lina Khatib told the New York Times that the last week marked the end of '18 years of mutual deterrence,' between Israel and Hezbollah, during which both sides refrained from actions that could lead to war. She noted that this balance has now been replaced by 'a new phase of unilateral Israeli dominance.' According to the Washington Post, Israel didn’t inform the U.S. in advance about the attack involving the pagers and walkie-talkies attributed to it. 'Privately,' it was reported, 'some of them [U.S. officials] had expressed a range of responses, from 'awestruck admiration' that Israel’s could pull off such an ‘ingenious plan,' to 'anxiety' that the brazen operation risks provoking a wide regional war.' Reuters reported that Hezbollah began distributing the pagers to its members starting in 2022, continuing until just days ago. At least one device exploded while still in the mailbox of the terrorist to whom it was addressed. Each device contained 'up to 3 grams' of explosives which Hezbollah failed to detect for months, despite testing the devices upon their arrival. As part of its inspections, Hezbollah even passed the devices through airport security to ensure they didn’t trigger explosive alerts. However, a security source told Reuters that 'it's very hard to detect it through any means. Even with any device or scanner.' Former CIA officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who served in counterterrorism roles in the Middle East, told the Washington Post the operation was ' the most impressive kinetic operation I can recall in my career. Israeli intelligence is living in [Hasan] Nasrallah’s brain.' A senior Biden administration official noted that while the White House was impressed by the Israeli operation, it still doesn't fully understand Israel’s broader strategy in Lebanon. According to the Washington Post, some expressed frustration that 'Israel acted against the backdrop of months of painstaking U.S. efforts to secure a cease-fire in Gaza, which would have also led to the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and humanitarian aid to the Strip.' The Washington Post added that American officials 'expressed frustration,' the U.S. and its allies had worked to reduce tensions in Lebanon for nearly a year before the operation. They pointed out that, up until now, Hezbollah’s attacks on Israel, though deadly, had been 'sporadic.' Now, the conflict could escalate into a broader war, according to the officials. ' The U.S. will have to decide how much they want to do to help Israel, and I don’t know what the answer to that is,' an American advisor told the Washington Post. 'They’ll likely continue to supply Israel with whatever it needs to defend itself, but there are serious voices in the administration who wonder, ‘Israel did this to themselves — why should we help them?' he added. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who praised Ibrahim Aqil’s elimination in Lebanon, also warned of an 'acute risk of escalation' on the Israel-Lebanon border. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hksloon60	2024-09-21T10:14:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/S1elXw26R/S1elXw26R_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

'Following the sirens that sounded throughout the past day in the areas of the Upper Galilee, Golan Heights and Safed area, approximately 90 projectile launches were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory,' the military said in a statement. The IDF added that 'the IAF struck thousands of launcher barrels that were ready for immediate use to fire toward Israeli territory. Additionally, IDF artillery struck a number of areas in southern Lebanon. The IDF will continue operating to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah's capabilities and terror infrastructure.' In addition, the military said Israeli Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar held a situation assessment with senior commanders following development across the northern border. 'We continue to keep the Air Force at the highest level of readiness especially in defense, and it has been going on for a while,' Maj. Gen. Bar said during the briefing.

IDF reveals names of Radwan commanders killed in Beirut strikes	Military publishes names of senior Hezbollah military chiefs following series of strikes aiming to weaken terror group; these are the senior figures still alive and active The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Saturday released the names of senior commanders of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force who were eliminated on Friday following airstrikes in Beirut’s Dahieh neighborhood. According to the military, Ibrahim Aqil, head of operations and commander of the Radwan Force is the most senior figure eliminated in the latest series of strikes. 'As well as Aqil, 15 other Hezbollah terrorists were eliminated in the strike, including senior commanders in the Radwan Force chain of command,' the IDF said in a statement on Saturday. 'Among the terrorists eliminated, was Abu Hassan Samir, who served as the head of the Radwan Force training unit. He held various positions within the terrorist organization and was commander of the Radwan Force for a decade until early 2024. 'He was one of the planners and leaders of the 'Conquer the Galilee' attack plan and was involved in advancing Hezbollah's entrenchment in southern Lebanon while attempting to improve the organization's ground combat capabilities. Over the years, and during the first months of the war, he planned and executed numerous shooting attacks and infiltrations into Israeli territory,' the statement added. According to the IDF, other senior Hezbollah commanders killed in the strikes included: Samer Abdul-Halim Halawi, commander of the coastal area. Abbas Sami Maslamani, commander of the Qana area. Abdullah Abbas Hajazi, commander of the Ramim ridge area. Muhammed Ahmad Reda, commander of the Al-Khiam area. Hassan Hussein Madi, commander of the Mount Dov area. 'These commanders had been leading and planning the Radwan Force's attack and infiltration plan into Israeli territory for years, to be executed when given the order,' the military said. The IDF also confirmed that two other senior Hezbollah members, Hassan Yussef Abad Alssatar and Hussein Ahmad Dahraj, were eliminated in the operation. Alssatar was responsible for Radwan Force operations and advanced all the force's munitions operations while Dahraj acted as the Radwan Force’s chief of staff and was involved in the transfer of weapons and the terror group’s strength-building. 'Aqil and the commanders eliminated in the strike were responsible for planning, advancing, and executing hundreds of terrorist operations against Israel, including the planning of Hezbollah's murderous scheme to raid the communities of the Galilee,' the military said. Other of Hezbollah’s military officials remain alive, however. These include: Ali Karaki – A commander on the level of Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil, both of whom were assassinated. Karaki is responsible for Hezbollah's military operations in southern Lebanon, overseeing the terror group's geographical units in the area. Muhammad Haydar – Haydar was previously a member of the Lebanese parliament on behalf of Hezbollah. According to Lebanese outlet Al-Akhbar he managed the organization's networks outside Lebanon. Talal Hamiyah – Leads the terror group’s Unit 910, responsible for conducting Hezbollah's 'foreign operations' through cells around the world. This unit is in charge of planning, coordinating, and executing attacks outside Lebanon, particularly against Western targets. The U.S. designated Hamiyah as a wanted terrorist in 2012. Haytham Ali Tabatabai – A high-ranking, mysterious figure within Hezbollah. He was designated an international terrorist by the U.S. in 2016. According to reports, he’s a central military leader in Hezbollah and commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen. Abu Ali Rida – Commander of Hezbollah’s Badr Unit which oversees the region north of the Litani River up to the city of Sidon in Lebanon. Rida is the only remaining regional Hezbollah commander in the country’s south. Another senior military figure is Khuder Yusef Nader who commands Hezbollah’s Unit 900, which serves as Hezbollah’s secret police. Other high-ranking officials, both in Hezbollah's military and political leadership, also play a role in the organization's military decision-making. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk11fksh60	2024-09-21T07:07:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/BJrp5B2pC/BJrp5B2pC_0_0_1600_900_0_small.jpg

Palestinian woman with a false ID discovered working in elementar...	A concerned mother called the police upon seeing an unidentified woman working in sanitation in an elementary school in central Israel; Upon examination, it was discovered her ID was forged and she was carrying a large knife, prompting officers to congratulate the mother for her alertness in a very delicate situation Orly (a pseudonym) was on her balcony on Wednesday, overlooking the yard of the Menachem Begin Elementary School in the town of Hod Hasharon, where her daughter is in first grade. She noticed one of the cleaning staff holding a long knife and peeling fruit, which raised her suspicions. After making several calls, including to the police, it was revealed that the worker was a resident of Qalqilya pretending to be from Jerusalem. 'I happened to be at home today, sitting on my balcony that overlooks the school,' Orly explains. 'I'm very anxious. When my daughter needs to go to the bathroom, I ask someone to accompany her because the workers roam freely among the students. There are Arab cleaning workers, and when I saw one of them with a really large knife, I thought it was inappropriate in a school setting.' Concerned for the students, she called the parents' committee, but they did not take her concerns seriously. 'I called the school and told them it didn't make sense for the children to be on break while she was walking around with a knife. They told me it was being handled.' She then contacted the police: 'They arrived quickly, approached the worker, and she became very upset, acting out in front of the children and hitting herself on the head. I saw them shouting at her because of her behavior, and the officer handcuffed her hands and feet and took her away.' She added, 'Later, the officer called me and said, 'Thank you very much, you saved several children. She was an infiltrator pretending, and no one checked her. She lives in Qalqilya.' There was panic at the school; they didn't understand where it came from. The children were very frightened, and the principal called to thank me for preventing a serious incident.' The police stated, 'A resident of Qalqilya was arrested on suspicion of impersonating a Jerusalem resident and working in cleaning at a school in Hod Hasharon. Officers arrived at the school this morning following a report about a suspicious cleaning worker. Station officers found that she was a resident of Qalqilya working without the appropriate permits, pretending to be from Jerusalem. The worker was taken to the station, and it will be decided if her detention will be extended based on the investigation's needs.' Hod Hasharon Mayor Amir Kochavi stated: 'Earlier today, following a resident's inquiry, sanitation workers at Begin School were interviewed. The investigation revealed that one worker's ID card was forged and that she is actually a resident of Qalqilya. Our preliminary inquiry indicates that she started yesterday as a replacement worker under the cleaning contractor. It seems there were several procedural violations, including the contractor not identifying the forged ID and failing to submit the worker for a check with the municipal security department as required. 'The municipality will conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine whether this was negligence or fraud and will act accordingly. The procedures for working with various contractors serving the municipality will be clarified, and surprise checks will be increased. We will continue coordinating with the police to ensure this deviation is addressed and to prevent it from recurring.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkyyh42tr	2024-09-21T05:18:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/By6Kd3dTA/By6Kd3dTA_0_119_960_541_0_small.jpg

UK overhauls tourist entry rules	Beginning January 8, anyone who wishes to visit the United Kingdom would have to register ahead of time in a specialized digital system and pay £50 per person; 'Digitization allows for a seamless experience for the millions crossing the border annually,' says senior official Beginning January 8, 2025, tourists from around the globe, including those from Israel, will need to complete a pre-entry application via a new electronic system to enter the United Kingdom. This requirement involves a fee of £10, roughly 50 shekels per person. The new system, known as the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA), will replace the existing procedure. As stated on the UK government's website, 'Anyone wishing to visit the UK – except British and Irish citizens – must register in advance,' with comprehensive guidance available online. The ETA will be valid for two years, permitting multiple entries into the UK and stays of up to six months per visit. Travelers are encouraged to submit their application at least 72 hours prior to their intended departure. Registration can be completed using the UK ETA app, which is available for both Android and Apple devices. Seema Malhotra, the UK's Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, remarked that 'digitization allows for a seamless experience for the millions crossing the border annually, including visitors we welcome to the UK, who are expected to contribute over £32 billion to our tourism economy this year.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rknthmnpa	2024-09-21T03:19:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2020/01/26/9745195/9745195_1_53_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Israel declares skies over Hadera northward as restricted airspac...	Given the swarms of Hezbollah UAV, rocket attacks and Israel's recent string of assassinations against their senior officers, Israel has decided to effectively shut down the skies from the city of Hadera all the way to the Lebanese border After a tumultuous week on the northern front, starting Saturday and lasting a full day, the skies from Hadera (A city about 30 miles north of Tel Aviv) northward were declared as restricted airspace. Head of air intelligence at the Civil Aviation Authority announced that 'due to security tensions, all infrastructures in the domestic space are closed to all types of aircraft' to facilitate Air Force operations. Ynet analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, interprets this airspace closure as yet another signal to Hezbollah: 'We are aware of your plans.' Facing the drone swarms from the Shiite terrorist organization, Israel's main defense lies in its F-35 jets, equipped with superior radar, and the F-16s for closer encounters. The closure of the airspace from Hadera northward suggests Hezbollah has not yet broken the rules nor decided to aim its launches toward the center of the country. Alternatively, this move might be intended to ensure flight safety due to fears of missiles targeting the northern region up to Hadera. The last similar announcement was made on June 19, though with more limited restrictions and airspace closure duration. Back then, it followed a day after Hezbollah released extraordinary footage from a drone dubbed 'Hudhud'—Hebrew for Hoopoe—that recorded nine and a half minutes of missile ships at Haifa port, surrounding neighborhoods, the 'BIG' shopping complex, a Rafael factory, and even tracked a moving vehicle. The organization's secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, threatened post-footage release to expand his organization's attack range within Israeli territory. 'We have long hours of footage of Haifa, what comes after Haifa, and after-after Haifa,' he declared. The activities permitted today in the northern airspace include air evacuation, police, and aerial firefighting; Haifa CTR; transport route (CVFR) along the coast to and from Haifa; international flights to and from Haifa. Additionally, the Megiddo airfield remains closed to activity, except for commercial flights that need to take off southward, subject to approval upon coordination. On Friday, IDF eliminated in Beirut the head of Hezbollah's operations system, Ibrahim Aqil, and along with him, the top of the operations system and the command chain of the Radwan Force, the organization's elite unit, were also neutralized. Less than a day later, newspapers across the Arab world, some serving as the mouthpiece of the Shiite terrorist organization, painted a grim picture with a clear message: Israel has 'exceeded the boundaries' previously set, and Hezbollah will respond with 'new and unexpected methods.' The death toll from the attack has risen to 31. On Tuesday, thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured in a beeper explosion, followed by hundreds more the next day in a walkie-talkie explosion. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared that Israel is at the brink of a 'new phase in the war,' and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi re-approved attack plans—as the north, amid high tension, braces for Hezbollah's retaliation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjsigfhpc	2024-09-21T02:37:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/16/rkl7FnC2cC/rkl7FnC2cC_405_147_1596_899_0_small.jpg
Israel and the Philippines, strategic interests and common values	October 7 Hamas attack have deepened Philippines-Israel ties, including Filipino President Marcos siding with Israel from the jump; Cooperation expands in defense, agriculture, and technology, despite Philippines' diverse internal opinions and ongoing regional security concerns with China When, on October 7, 2023, Hamas broke across the Israeli border to carry out massacres and kidnappings, Angelyn Aguirre, a 32-year-old Filipino caregiver, remained by side by side with the elderly woman she took care of in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, Nira Ronen, with whom she tried unsuccessfully to hide in the vault of the house, before they were both killed by the terrorists. Aguirre, who had been married for just a year and had returned to Israel to work just a few days before the attack, is among 4 Filipino citizens who were killed by Hamas on October 7; two others were kidnapped and taken to Gaza, only to be released in November. There are about 30,000 Filipino workers living in Israel, mainly employed as caregivers and in the hotel sector. When, on August 9, the Israeli Embassy in the Philippines celebrated the 67th anniversary of relations between the two countries by planting trees in the courtyard of San Francisco High School in Quezon City, 4 trees were dedicated to each one of the victims. Since that tragic day, current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has strongly sided with Israel, unambiguously condemning Hamas. The relationship between Manila and Jerusalem is also dictated by common interests in the defense sector; The Philippine Air Force has recently purchased long-range patrol aircrafts from the Israeli company Elbit Systems, due to recent tensions with China in the South China Sea. While Israel Shipyards Industries recently sold two patrol ships equipped with missile launchers to the Philippine Navy. In order to better understand how relations between the two countries have evolved, we spoke with Filipino entrepreneur and economist Andrew James Masigan, a columnist for The Philippine Star daily newspaper and an advisor to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI). What were the relations between the Philippines and Israel before October 7? 'Relations have always been good. Since the Philippines is, besides East Timor, the only predominantly Catholic nation in Asia, we have always felt that we have a connection with the Jewish people. In the 1930s, under the leadership of then-President Manuel Quezon, our country welcomed about 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing Europe, when no other Asian country was willing to do so. Some of their descendants still live here. And when, in 1947, the Plan for the Partition of Palestine was put to a vote at the United Nations, the Philippines voted in favor of the birth of a Jewish State. The rest, as they say, is history; since 1957 we have had excellent diplomatic relations with Israel, which over time have turned into a real friendship.' How are Filipino politicians and public opinion aligned regarding the ongoing war? 'First of all, it is necessary to make a clarification; Since Israel is a geographically distant country, some sectors of the Filipino society are not really aware of the situation. Besides that, the Philippines is the only country in Southeast Asia to have openly declared its support for Israel. Not only politicians, but also society as a whole stands with Israel, and does not cultivate any feelings of hatred or anti-Jewish prejudice. 'Personally, I can testify to this solidarity with Israel also through my own experience; I have written several articles on the Israeli reaction after October 7 for the Philippine Star newspaper, one of the most widely read in the country, and every day I receive hundreds of emails from readers. Out of a hundred comments on my articles about Israel, I would say that only 4 or 5 are pro-Palestinian, while all the others are generally pro-Israel.' The Philippines is home to an important Muslim minority, particularly on the Mindanao island. How are they aligned on the subject compared to the Catholic majority? 'The Philippine archipelago is mainly composed of three main regions: the island of Luzon in the north, the Visayas Islands in the center, and Mindanao in the south. If Luzon and Visayas are predominantly Christian, in Mindanao the Muslim component is very present. And it is in Muslim areas that pro-Palestine demonstrations have taken place. But even there, it is not that much if compared to what can be seen in neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, where anti-Jewish hatred and pro-Palestinian positions are evident. In the Philippines, Muslims are just 6% of the population, few compared to the 200 million Muslims in Indonesia, most of whom are lined up against Israel.' In an analysis published in May on the MEMRI website, you argued that the Philippines is trying to oppose Chinese expansionism in the Pacific Ocean. How much does this factor impact military cooperation with Israel? 'The Philippines has military cooperation agreements only with a small number of countries. Israel opened its own military exchange office in Manila in 2020, and has expanded its diplomatic network; in addition to the Embassy in Manila, it has also opened two consulates in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. 'Israel has been a major supplier of arms and ammunition to us for a long time. In the last period, due to the Chinese threat, relations have strengthened; the Israeli company Elbit Systems has provided us with patrol aircrafts, but apart from that Israel provides us with guns, bullets, military suits and helmets. In addition, we also cooperate with them in military training.' In addition to defense and the armed forces, in what other areas do you have a fruitful collaboration? 'We have many programs for technology exchanges, the most profitable of which is in the agricultural sector: every year, we send between 300 and 400 Filipinos to Israel to study their innovations in agriculture and bring them here. In addition, there are several active joint ventures, whereby Filipino companies cooperate with Israeli companies in the agricultural sector. 'To give an example, thanks to the use of Israeli technologies, Metro Pacific Agro Ventures Inc., one of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines, is building what will be the largest dairy in the country and in all of Asia. It will be used to produce 6 million liters of milk per year, and the opening is scheduled for November. They have also invested one billion Philippine pesos (about 65.5 million shekels) to build a greenhouse where they can cultivate 1,600 tons of vegetables a year. 'Apart from agriculture, there are fruitful collaborations between Israel and the Philippines also in the IT sector, for the development of start-ups and new technologies. Overall, we have very good relations with Israel, although there are still areas for improvement.' What can be improved? 'Trade is not consistent for now, and even tourism between the two countries has not yet reached significant levels. Although, it must be said that negotiations are currently underway to implement tourist travel so that the Philippine Airlines can make direct flights to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Negotiations had stopped after 7 October, but have since resumed. 'In any case, when one of the two countries needs help, the other is there: to give an example, Mashav, the international agency for cooperation and development of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gives the Philippines the status of priority nation, the highest one. For this reason, there is cooperation in various areas between the two countries, for example when natural disasters occur: in these cases, Israel always sends us food aid, blood donations, professional doctors. And even during the Covid-19 pandemic, Israel allowed us to vaccinate tens of thousands of our compatriots.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkjjwz3pc	2024-09-21T01:51:49-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/22/BygcIuqzMT/BygcIuqzMT_0_169_558_315_0_small.jpg

A closer look on the 6 top Hezbollah commanders killed by Israel	Since the Gaza conflict began, IDF has eliminated six top Hezbollah operatives, including Fuad Shukr in Beirut; These strategic strikes have targeted key figures responsible for military operations and have significantly disrupted Hezbollah’s leadership and operational capabilities Since the onset of the Gaza conflict, IDF have successfully targeted numerous high-ranking members of Hezbollah, marking significant blows to the militant organization's capabilities. Over the past week, Israeli forces has employed advanced tactics including the detonation of beepers and communication devices across Lebanon. According to Hezbollah's official statements, 496 operatives have been killed so far, including several key leaders who served pivotal roles within the organization and linked it to the Shiite-Iranian axis. In a recent attack in Beirut, Ahmad Mahmoud Wahbi, a senior commander, along with Ibrahim Aqil, who led Hezbollah’s operations since 2004, were eliminated. Aqil, involved in various military initiatives like sabotage and air defense, was designated a terrorist by the U.S. in 2015 due to his involvement in global attacks. Known as the 'Commander of the Great Jihad,' Aqil was a potential successor to Hezbollah's Chief of Staff, Fuad Shukr, who was also killed earlier. Ahmad Mahmoud Wahbi, who bore the title 'The Martyr Commander,' was responsible for leading military operations against Israel and managed the central training unit for the Radwan Force. His elimination follows those of three other senior Hezbollah figures earlier in the conflict. The aforementioned Fuad Shukr, another high-profile target, was killed in the Dahiya district of Beirut. Known as 'Hezbollah's Chief of Staff,' he was integral to the strategic planning and execution of operations against Israel. His legacy includes orchestrating attacks against Israeli forces in the 1990s and involvement in the 2000 abduction of Israeli soldiers' remains. Among other notable eliminations is Muhammad Naama Nasser, additionally known as Hajj Abu Naama, who commanded the Aziz Unit in southern Lebanon. Nasser, who had a rank equivalent to brigadier general, was killed in a drone strike in July. His counterpart, Sami Taleb Abdallah, commander of Hezbollah's Nasr Unit, was similarly eliminated in June. Both were key figures in conducting terror operations against Israel. Earlier this year, Wissam Tuwail, reported to be a senior member of the elite Radwan Force, was killed in a drone strike. Tuwail played a central role in directing military operations in southern Lebanon and was considered a significant loss for Hezbollah. To date, at least six senior Hezbollah operatives have been eliminated since the conflict began, with two targeted in Beirut's Dahiya district and four others across various operations in Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjlq90oac	2024-09-20T22:56:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/BJB2xHoTR/BJB2xHoTR_0_5_853_481_0_small.jpg

IAF kills Aqil with F-35 fighter jet and four missiles two storie...	Hezbollah remains silent after the assassination of the head of the operations array while rescues are still underway; 'No matter how much Israel escalates, the support for Gaza will remain' Hours after the attack in the Dahieh district in Beirut, where, according to the IDF, the head of Hezbollah's operations array, Ibrahim Aqil, was assassinated with about 10 other Radwan Force commanders. The Lebanese Interior Minister ordered a blockade around the building that was attacked and collapsed to facilitate the rescue efforts of the injured and the dead. According to the IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, Aqil and the Hezbollah commanders gathered underground under residential buildings. According to the IDF, the attack was carried out by F-35 fighter jets, which launched missiles at the building. The Al-Jazeera network reported that four missiles were fired at the location of the Radwan Force meeting, two stories underground. More than 20 people took part in the meeting and Al-Jazeera quoted a Lebanese security source who said several members of the Radwan Force came out injured. According to the Lebanese MTV news network, the families of three senior Radwan Force operatives were informed that more bodies are expected to be uncovered, increasing the death toll. According to the figures published in Lebanon, at least 14 people were killed in the attack, and another 66 were injured, including nine who were critically injured. Footage of the attack shows heavy damage to the targeted structure and to dozens of adjacent cars. Parked cars were overturned, and windows were shattered. According to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen network, dozens of shops were also damaged in the attack. An eyewitness who spoke to the New York Times said that he did not hear the sound of a missile coming at all before the attack: 'It was more like an earthquake. Our building shook for a bit.' Other residents reported chaos, and one of them, Mortada Smaoui, testified that when he arrived at the scene he found a building completely destroyed and a car overturned on its side. He said that he tried to help a woman who was looking for her child, but the rescue forces demanded that he leave: 'The building was destroyed completely, I am shaking.' The attack in Dahieh was the third one carried out by the Air Force since the beginning of the war. In the first attack, senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was eliminated, and in the second, Fuad Shukr, known in Israel as Hezbollah's chief of staff. The Iranian embassy in Lebanon condemned the attack and said that the 'Israeli madness has crossed all borders.' According to the IDF, Aqil and the commanders who were eliminated were among the architects of the 'plan to occupy the Galilee', in the Shiite terrorist organization's plan to raid Israel, occupy the Galilee settlements, and murder innocent civilians, similar to the massacre carried out by Hamas on October 7. At the same time, the Qatari Al-Araby Al-Jadeed quoted a Hezbollah parliamentary source who said: 'The attack in Dahieh follows Israel's extermination war that Israel is waging in the region. No matter how much Israel escalates the operations, the Lebanese front will remain open to support Gaza. The reckoning will come, and the retribution will be just, time will tell. Every Israeli violation will be answered accordingly.' A diplomatic source, whose identity was not reported, told the Saudi Al-Hadath network that 'the assassination of Aqil carries a political and military message according to which Hezbollah's escalation will be met with an escalation in Dahieh.' Netanyahu urges France to pressure Hezbollah Meanwhile, in the diplomatic aspect, Several countries attempt to avoid escalation into an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Friday with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron accused Israel of pushing the region into war, and Netanyahu responded that instead of pressuring Israel, it's time for France to increase the pressure on Hezbollah. A French diplomat said that it is clear there are differences of opinion between the two sides going forward. France called on all parties in the region to exercise maximum restraint to close the negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza and to facilitate a diplomatic settlement on Israel's northern border. He added that recent security developments in Lebanon have further increased the likelihood of war, while convinced that a diplomatic path still exists. Last year, to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the White House announced a $7 million reward for information on Aqil, who was one of the masterminds of the attack that killed 63 people. Alongside Aqil, Imad Mughniyeh, a former Hezbollah military chief who was killed in a strike attributed to Israel, was also considered responsible for the attack. Aqil was also involved in the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 U.S. service members. In addition, he oversaw the abduction of American and German hostages in Lebanon and was considered a potential successor to Hezbollah’s military leadership long before Shukr’s assassination, also in Dahieh. Aqil survived several assassination attempts, including one in February 2000 when Israeli Apache helicopters fired missiles at his car, leaving him lightly wounded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ij9hip0	2024-09-20T14:03:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/S1E5cEjp0/S1E5cEjp0_0_0_853_481_0_small.jpg

Air Force on high alert: 'We are the most prepared we have ever b...	Tel Nof's 106th Squadron shares its recent operations in Yemen and Lebanon, beaming with pride but cautious as not to become arrogant: 'We're as modest as they come' The waiting is nerve-racking. Incidents along the northern border are becoming ever more frequent. Our enemies to the east are threatening us with missiles. To the south, maritime movement in the Red Sea to Eilat has been blocked. It’s clear to everyone that escalation is on the way. Anyone who might feel they’ve been here before is no kid. Try telling the youngsters about the anticipation of the summer of 1967, which ended with Israel dealing a crushing blow to the Arab armies in a war that went on for just six days. It sounds to them like an Arabian Nights tale. That's understandable when all they have known is a 300-day war that’s very far from ending anytime soon. Israel is constantly revisiting its past. We’re at the Tel Nof IAF base that could well be a target for Iran and Hezbollah. We used to add mystery by saying it was 'somewhere in central Israel' but now Waze can take you up to the main gate. Everyone serving at this huge base has been on high alert for the past week. The wait in 1967 went on for two months. A month after the IAF shot down half a dozen Syrian MiG fighter jets over the Sea of Galilee in April 1967, Nasser closed the Red Sea on us. He'd advanced his troops deep into Sinai and Israel was panic-struck. Tel Aviv children dug trenches along Allenby Street by the Carmel Market. Teenagers in Ashkelon filled sandbags and piled them up in the neighbors’ yards. The wait for the great war that everyone feared was possibly harder than the war itself that broke out June 5. The waiting period ended with a surprise blow to the Arab armies and air forces. Mirage and Skyhawk fighter jets took off to attack Egyptian airfields from Tel Nof. But that’s all in the past. Today, the pilots sit and wait in the 'villa,' which is a house that looks like the newer homes on a kibbutz or moshav. The yard is well kept with greenery and ornamental rocks, a wooden pergola over a deck balcony, and electric blinds shading the living room. This is where the aircrews are on standby. There are three rooms with beds arranged like in a hotel, a fully equipped kitchen with soda and espresso machines, a huge TV screen, and a new Sony PlayStation. We found a deck of cards and a pile of gambling chips on the coffee table – evidence of a heated poker game while waiting for the long-expected attack. As of Thursday, the war hasn’t yet broken out and fear is at an all-time high. Foreign airlines have suspended their flights to Israel and thousands of Israelis are stranded overseas, desperately searching for a spot on one of the Israeli airlines, who are exploiting the situation, charging exorbitant prices. The streets are empty as people prefer staying at home with the children and the safe room close. You should have seen Tel Aviv earlier in the week. The city was almost as deserted as during the COVID lockdown. But there’s a huge discrepancy between the fears and pressure conveyed on TV news programs and what happens in the 106th F15 squadron crew. Just two weeks ago, Hezbollah released a nine-minute aerial video of Ramat David airbase. The Shiite drone circled over the base, filming the squadron’s headquarters, aircraft hangers, runways, and even the commander’s office with great quality. We can reasonably assume that all the IAF bases are targets for Hezbollah and Iran. When you have a threat and a state of vigilance, response time should be incredibly fast. This is why deputy squadron commander Maj. N. is walking around in a G-suit over his flight overalls. He has pipes coming out just beneath his waist, to be connected to an air pipe in the plane to avert pressure on the blood vessels at dizzyingly high speeds and altitude and maneuvering during flight. He has a cloth cap that he wears under his helmet dangling on his hip. He’s ready for immediate deployment and if a siren sounds at the squadron, he’s in the plane in minutes. 'But let’s not talk about us IAF crew,' says N. 'The plane is ready for immediate takeoff. I just need to connect the parachute, and the plane can also land in the water and float if we need to eject. But right now, the plane’s looking good, fueled and armed. I just switch it on and take off. ' 'I don’t want to talk about our level of vigilance. It changes according to intelligence and estimates. The transition from one level to the next is a matter of minutes. There’s a level where you’re in the air in minutes. There’s an immediate level that involves sitting in the cockpit with the engine turned off waiting for deployment. And then, the highest level where you’re in the cockpit with engine on, and the plane ready for takeoff and you’re in the air in ten seconds. You’re looking at preparations for a war that may be just around the corner. I’m not walking around like this for nothing.' The squadron holds two F15 models – a single seater, and a double seater. They’re not as new and sophisticated as the F35 but with a takeoff speed of 254 meters per second, and a maximum flight range of 3,459 km per second, this C model has nothing to be ashamed of. 'This plane, by definition, is for interception. It’s what we call ‘air superiority’,' says the deputy squadron commander. 'But unfortunately, we have no one to fight in the air, at least not for now.' He looks genuinely disappointed that there’s not a decent air force in the region. Perhaps reports this week of an Iranian order of state-of-the-art Sukhoi planes from the Russians signals the creation of a worthy competitor. 'But it doesn’t mean we have no air-to-air missions before that. Look at the Iranian attack on April 14. The squadron has a good number of interceptions to its name on that night, both UAVs and cruise missiles.' How many did you take down? 'I can’t say. I can only say that I was in one of the interception jets and it was a crazy scene. I was at 20 thousand feet, it was pitch dark and the sky was full of SSMs (Surface-to-Surface Missiles). I could see their fire trails. They have one heck of a rocket engine. I also saw fire trails of Arrow missiles fired at the SSMs, taking off at a crazy speed, and the interceptions above me. The challenge is locating the cruise missile moving toward us, an inclusive target as it travels at around 300 knots - the speed of a commercial plane. You need to make sure it’s the enemy.' 'And if you think that’s where it ends, you’ve no idea. It’s just the beginning. Once you’ve exposed it, you have to decide whether or not to take it down, whether to fire from close or long range, above or below, from in front of it or behind, and every such decision impacts armament and maneuvering and the angle toward the target - and I need to make all these decisions in a second, a second-and-a-half tops.' 'And we took down a good number of UAVs and cruise missiles. It’s been four months since then, in which time we’ve been working non-stop. Last week, I was on a mission in South Lebanon. We took out a Hezbollah cell in one of the villages. Oh, and we also made it to Yemen. That alone was crazy.' Speaking of Yemen, meet navigator Maj. R. His appearance is deceptive, like that of a mortgage bank clerk. But he’s an expert in driving 'television missiles' directly to target. 'It’s nice that you want to talk about Yemen when we’re on full alert for an incident with Hezbollah in Lebanon and a possible attack from Iran or one of its proxies, or all of them together. Yes, I was in Yemen. Visibility was okay for half the way there. I saw the Straits of Tiran. But then, there was horrible haze and it ruins the whole sexy part of the story.' The IDF is considering a possible attack on Iran, having attacked Yemen. N. explains that there’s no room for malfunctions during the flight. 'Imagine you’re on a long flight to the United States, and just before reaching the ocean, there’s a malfunction in the plane. You veer 20° right and you can land at London’s Heathrow Airport. If you have a malfunction while you’re flying to attack Yemen, or some other target at a similar distance, where are you going to land? Sudan? Saudi Arabia?' 'And after flying for hours, you then have to bring yourself to a fantastic level of concentration to realize the reason you came all this way - taking the armaments and hitting them right on target. Flying all that way and then hitting next to the target, just isn’t good enough.' 'Think of ten seconds refining everything you’ve learned and practiced,' says navigator R. 'This is your story as a combat soldier– these ten seconds. Making an alpha (hitting the target) at the first strike. In real life, we’re used to correcting ourselves, doing better next time, like shooting hoops, and if it’s no good, you rebound and try again. In an attack like this, like the one we carried out at Hudeidah Port in Yemen, there is no second time, no rebound. My pilot released a missile and I directed him there. You’re not dreaming at a time like this. You’re not hallucinating, you’re not thinking about anything. You’re 100% driving the missile to its target. You don’t let anything distract you. How did you feel when you hit the target? 'Hell, I’m over Yemen and I now need to get back home’. Getting home is part of the mission.' You don’t hear the drums of war here. We spent a few good hours at Tel Nof and we barely saw three F15s land. 'Barely' as one of them did a quick flight over the base to make sure everything was in order, so that doesn’t really count. We climbed the control tower where we found female reservist Capt. N. who, in civilian life, is an air traffic controller at Ben Gurion Airport. She had two soldiers assisting her. N. was holding binoculars watching a plane approaching from the east for landing. 'Watching to see that the plane’s wheels really pulled out when it’s ready to land is extra confirmation' she explained and, over the walkie-talkie, told the pilot '33 X left authorized to land.' There was a ceramic vest lying on a chair in the control tower, a reminder of threats from outside. But N. refused to show us fear. 'Our focus needs to be operating the airfield, taking off and landing planes, focusing only on that, not on threats and fears.' Major B., the technical officer, also isn’t thinking about fears and threats. That’s what he has his wife for. She’s currently on maternity leave with two-month-old little Adam. 'We live in the family barracks on base and my wife is very much aware of what’s going on. She has a bag packed and she needs 15 minutes to get out of here. That’s how long it takes her to fold up the stroller, get it along with the bag and the baby into the car, and push on the gas pedal. I trust our warning system to give enough time to prepare accordingly.' We were sitting in an office in one of the hangers. Outside was a plane called 'Ayelet Hashachar,' tail number 970, ready for battle, packed with bombs and missiles. 'Look at it' he says, nodding his head toward the plane. 'What a wonderful machine. Look how the heavy hail sits on it.' Heavy hail? 'JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition), a bomb weighing a ton. It has a fantastic carrying capacity. I can put on three detachable fuel canisters if it’s a long-distance mission. It can carry a great deal of ammunition for both attack and interception – bombs or missiles of all kinds. 'Ayelet Hashachar,' for example, is armed with both missiles and heavy hail. 'I can tell you the vigilance here is at the highest level. This includes preparing the planes and the threats against us. Everyone here knows where the nearest safe room is. We all know that, even if they drop missiles here, planes will still have to take off and everyone knows how to conduct missions and prepare planes for attack under fire. There will be functional continuity, at a pace faster than now that we’re not under fire.' 'Planes are ready for takeoff within a very short time after landing – if there are no malfunctions. This means checking oil, refueling, rearming, putting air pressure in the tires, and running electrical voltage to test the cockpit systems. Whatever the mission: Gaza, Beirut, Iran, or Yemen, we run to every plane as if Judgement Day has come.' There’s something about visiting a base like Tel Nof that gives the feeling that Israel isn’t yet completely lost. Three army bases have been broken into by rabble in the past two weeks. A few dozen Haredim broke into the Tel Hashomer recruitment offices. They were climbing the fences and the police wasn’t there to stop them. Moreover, criminals broke into the Sde Teiman base, with right-wing MKs and a government minister egging them on. The mob then went on to break into the Biet Lid base. The Air Force is our national security’s backbone. Our enemies have long known this. If a base or, God forbid, two are attacked, we would have a knife to our neck. I looked at how serious and professional those serving here at Tel Nof are, and couldn’t help but think this is the same army as at Beit Lid, Tel Nof, and Tel Hashomer. And if the mob broke in there, could it happen here too? Then you sit with technical officer B. from Netanya and N. the navigator from Efrat as they both proudly talked about what they do and their awe of the great responsibility placed upon them. N. glances at Ayelet Hashachar ready for take-off and casually says 'It can be over Lebanon in minutes.' They sit around in standby rooms, briefing and memorizing flight paths and flights to targets and the dangers awaiting them en route. 'What we’ll encounter at every point,' says N. 'It might be a shoulder-held missile or missile batteries. Not just in Lebanon – in Iran too and anywhere we might need to go. Look at this plane. It’s an amazing tractor with the most cutting-edge technology, totally state of the art. It’s a beast that can carry bombs to every corner of the Middle East. We proved it a month ago in the attack in Yemen. Anyone who needed to understand, understood our capabilities. ' That smells a bit smug. Aren’t we being a bit too arrogant? 'We’re as modest as they come. Our enemies may strike us, but don’t worry about us. We’re ready. Whatever their attack looks like, we’ll be able to deal with it and address it. We’re the readiest we’ve ever been.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1m6f7saa	2024-09-20T10:59:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/08/rJlX8eNf9A/rJlX8eNf9A_2_0_1919_1080_0_small.jpg
Gallant: 'We'll pursue Hezbollah even in Dahieh'	Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Friday that Israel will continue to hunt down Hezbollah operatives, even in the terrorist group’s main base of operations in Beirut’s Dahieh district. 'Even in Beirut’s Dahieh, we will continue to pursue our enemies to protect our citizens,' Gallant said after a security assessment with the IDF chief of staff and senior military officials following what he described as the elimination of Hezbollah’s 'operational leadership.' 'The series of operations in this new phase will continue until we achieve our goal: the safe return of northern residents to their homes.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj8q6qst0	2024-09-20T10:17:29-07:00	
Hezbollah blasts worsen displacement crisis along Israel-Lebanon ...	Explosions targeting Hezbollah devices have killed dozens and worsened the displacement crisis, with thousands of Israelis and Lebanese remaining in temporary shelters amid ongoing border tensions At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured, many seriously, after communication devices used by Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the latest round of blasts yesterday, walkie-talkies exploded, killing 20 and injuring at least 450 people, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Despite not admitting this publicly, Israel is considered to be behind this accident, and for this reason, a possible retaliation from Hezbollah may occur. After almost a year of crossfire between Israel and the Shia militia, which deeply affected both countries and their citizens, this time seems inevitable an open war front. 'No one saw this coming. There are many things that we don’t know about. This proves that we are not alone and that the IDF is everywhere to protect us. It was a surprise for everyone, but it was indeed incredible,' commented Mark Lagunov, manager of the Golan Brewery in Katzrin. Nadia, a resident of Katzrin, had a different opinion: 'If what happened is true and Israel is behind it, well, this is terrible news. War is not a good thing, and I stand against these methods that generate further fear and chaos.' In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, Jewish communities both in the southern and northern parts of the country were evacuated (or self-evacuated) from their homes for safety reasons, reaching almost 250,000 people. As of June 2024, about 90,000 Israelis remained internally displaced from the north, according to data provided by the UN. Additionally, according to the UN, 95,000 residents have been evacuated from southern Lebanon, and over 90 civilians were targeted by IDF strikes. Throughout the months, both the northern part of Israel and the southern part of Lebanon became 'buffer zones' and ghost towns, profoundly impacting the lives of people who used to inhabit those areas. In Israel, the government decided to financially help those families affected by the conflict and offered temporary accommodation in hotels within the country. Almost a year has passed, and thousands of families still find themselves trapped in hotels away from their homes. The Caesar Premiere Hotel in Tiberias is an example of this phenomenon, hosting more than 400 families internally displaced from the northern border. 'Most of the people that we are hosting come from Kiryat Shmona and nearby kibbutzim. Despite being in a difficult situation, we are trying to sustain them in any way possible by providing food and emotional support to make them feel at home,' affirmed Eran Ohayon, manager of the Caesar Premiere Hotel in Tiberias. 'In case of a possible retaliation that may affect the area of Tiberias, we have bunkers that can host all the guests. Moreover, the government financially sustains each family and us as facilities, which is important for not leaving anyone behind,' he added. Talking with families staying at the hotel, the common feeling is collective tiredness. Everyone shared the same fears about the future and hoped to return home soon. 'I don’t complain about the hotel and the services offered, but we have been here for almost a year. It is inhumane what is happening to us. We just want to return home. Me and other members of my kibbutz founded the place, and being away is painful,' said Yehuda, who was displaced from Kibbutz Bar Am close to the border with Lebanon. 'How long can you stay away from your home? After a week of enjoying the hotel's services, you want to return to your comfort zone and your place. It is not manageable to carry on like this', stated Yanai Shlomi, coming from a kibbutz in the south and visiting his relative Yehuda, who has been living in the hotel for 11 months.

Everything is on the table,' Israeli official says as Beirut str...	Official vows to 'keep hitting Hezbollah until war’s objective achieved' and northern residents return home safely as terror group expected to retaliate; White House insists war not inevitable, pushes for diplomatic resolution An Israeli official said Friday that the strike in Beirut targeting Hezbollah head of operations Ibrahim Aqil signals a 'new phase in the war.' The official said that Israel will continue to target Hezbollah and is prepared for a response. 'Everything is on the table,' the source added. Israel assesses that Hezbollah will not overlook the strike and the reported assassination of Aqil. 'There are no red lines in this new phase,' another official said. 'We will keep hitting Hezbollah until the war’s objective is achieved: the safe return of northern residents to their homes. We understand the potential costs.' Lebanese media reported that at least three people were killed and several others were injured in the attack on the Dahieh district. The IDF confirmed that Aqil, Hezbollah’s head of operations, was targeted in the strike. A Hezbollah source told AFP that Aqil was killed. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying that it 'proves once again that the Israeli enemy disregards humanitarian and moral considerations.' The U.S. quickly denied any involvement or prior knowledge of the Israeli strike, reiterating its stance that war is not inevitable and that diplomacy remains the best path to de-escalation. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby emphasized that the U.S. is doing everything possible to prevent a regional war. Ibrahim Aqil, the target of the strike, was a senior member of Hezbollah’s Jihad Council and served as the group’s head of operations. Designated a terrorist by the U.S. in 2015, he was linked to numerous global terror attacks, including Hezbollah’s military operations in Syria. Last year, the White House offered a $7 million reward for information on Aqil, one of the masterminds behind the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that killed 63 people. He was also involved in the attack on a U.S. Marine Corps base later that year, which killed 241 military personnel. Aqil was seen as a potential successor to Hezbollah’s military chief Fuad Shukr, who was assassinated in July in Beirut. Aqil had survived several assassination attempts, including one in 2000 when Israeli helicopters fired missiles at his car, leaving him slightly injured. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhmowot0	2024-09-20T09:41:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/rJ2Jb7oaA/rJ2Jb7oaA_0_0_3000_1682_0_small.jpg
IDF confirms Hezbollah head of operations Ibrahim Aqil eliminated...	Key architect of Hezbollah’s plan to invade northern Israel assassinated in Israeli strike on building in Beirut’s Dahieh; army says strike also took out other senior members of terror group's operations unit The IDF confirmed on Friday that it eliminated Ibrahim Aqil, Hezbollah’s head of operations, in a strike in Beirut, along with senior members of the group’s operations unit and the leadership of its elite Radwan Force. Lebanese reports said at least nine people were killed and 59 wounded in the attack, eight of them critically. Prior to the IDF’s announcement, Lebanese officials confirmed to foreign news agencies that Aqil was among the dead. Reuters reported that, according to a local security source, the strike occurred during a meeting Aqil held with members of the Radwan Force. The IDF said that Aqil and the commanders killed were key architects of the 'Operation to Conquer the Galilee,' a plan for Hezbollah to invade Israeli territory and capture northern communities in a future war. Aqil had served as Hezbollah’s operations chief since 2004, overseeing attacks involving explosives, anti-tank missiles and other military operations. Aqil began his career with Hezbollah in the 1980s in its Islamic Jihad wing, responsible for carrying out attacks outside Lebanon, targeting international civilians and organizations. He also commanded the Radwan Force, Hezbollah’s elite unit, and was reportedly involved in the 2019 anti-tank missile attack on the Avivim military post, the 2023 bomb attack at the Megiddo junction and recent attempts by Hezbollah fighters to infiltrate Israeli territory during the war to kill civilians and soldiers. 'The IDF will continue to target Hezbollah’s capabilities and take action in all arenas to ensure the security of Israel’s citizens,' the military said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjapsms60	2024-09-20T09:20:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/HJRctgj6A/HJRctgj6A_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Ibrahim Aqil: Elusive Hezbollah mastermind and one of America's m...	Terror group's operations chief, reportedly target of Israeli strike in Beirut, designated terrorist by US in 2015, with $7 million reward for information on him The target of Friday afternoon's strike in Beirut’s Dahieh district was reportedly Ibrahim Aqil, the head of Hezbollah’s operations, according to local reports. Aqil is a senior member of the group’s Jihad Council and was previously responsible for its military activities. The United States designated Aqil a terrorist in 2015, linking him to numerous attacks worldwide and military operations in Syria. In 2019, the U.S. added him to the sanctions list again, freezing any assets under American jurisdiction and banning U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with him. The same list included Hezbollah’s military chief Fuad Shukr, who was assassinated in July, and senior member Mohammed Haidar. Last year, to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the White House announced a $7 million reward for information on Aqil, who was one of the masterminds of the attack that killed 63 people. Alongside Aqil, Imad Mughniyeh, a former Hezbollah military chief who was killed in a strike attributed to Israel, was also considered responsible for the attack. Aqil was also involved in the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 U.S. service members. In addition, he oversaw the abduction of American and German hostages in Lebanon and was considered a potential successor to Hezbollah’s military leadership long before Shukr’s assassination, also in Dahieh. Aqil survived several assassination attempts, including one in February 2000 when Israeli Apache helicopters fired missiles at his car, leaving him lightly wounded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkz5rzot0	2024-09-20T08:19:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/04/18/SkBMfN2M2/SkBMfN2M2_0_0_679_383_0_small.jpg

IDF spokesperson says the military's target was a senior Hezbollah official in the Dahiyeh neighborhood in Beirut Lebanon media says 5 children killed and extensive damage caused in F-35 attack The IDF said on Saturday afternoon that its aircraft attacked two buildings in Beirut's Dahieh neighborhood, a Hezbollah stronghold. The military said it carried out a targeted strike. Lebanese media claimed five children were killed and extensive damage caused in the F-35 strike. Lebanese media was first to report the strike on the city's southern sector, a primarily Shiite part of the capital and where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has established the group's headquarters and powerbase. The IDF said there was no change announced to the instructions to Israeli by the Home Front Command Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he would be postponing his plans to travel to the U.S. early next week to address the UN General Assembly.

Lebanese receive threatening messages attributed to Israeli hack	You are a supporter of Hezbollah so you will be rewarded with a meeting with him in Hell,' the message reads; Saudi channel quotes expert saying electric cars can detonate next causing greater harm Lebanese media has reported that citizens of the country received threatening and disconcerting messages on their phones in recent days. One screenshot seen by the media outlets read 'We see you are a supporter of [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nassrallah so you will be rewarded with a meeting with him in Hell.' Other messages kept on screenshots included claims that the senders were Jewish Israelis who hate their country and government and want to assist in its destruction. 'IO have many ties and capabilities that no one can doubt,' the message read. It is unclear who was behind the messages that were written in unclear Arabic. One Lebanese television channel claimed they were sent from an Israeli messaging app that disseminates clips and recordings without revealing the senders. The Lebanese reports of the messages came after Israelis received messages on their phones calling them to enter shelters immediately and warning of a massive Hezbollah attack. The Home Front Command denied it had issued any warnings to civilians and the messages were considered a likely cyberattack. Meanwhile, the Saudi Al Arabiya media outlet quoted an expert who said electric cars could also be breached and detonated, as the communication devices had been, but would cause much greater damage and harm. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syw85kopr	2024-09-20T05:33:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/rJborpaqaC/rJborpaqaC_0_152_961_540_0_small.jpg
Owner of Bulgarian company selling pagers to Hezbollah is missing...	Indian-borne Rinson Jose, founder of Norta Global involved in the sale of devices to the Lebanese terror group, is unreachable after leaving on a 'pre-planned' trip on the day pagers detonated The Indian-borne businessman who founded a Bulgarian company implicated in the coordinated detonation of Hezbollah communication devices has disappeared after 'inadvertently' assisting Israel in the plot, the Daily Mail said on Saturday. A report by the Hungarian news outlet Telex claimed the devices alleged to have been sold by the BAC company in Hungary, were imported to Lebanon from Bulgaria by a company named Norta Global Ltd., based in Sofia and owned by a Norwegian national. Bulgaria's National Security Agency has since launched an investigation, saying that no approval was found for relevant sales and that the only known transaction involved 1.6 million euros being transferred to Hungary. Norta Global founder Rinson Jose, who resides in Oslo, was said to have gone on a pre-planned trip on Tuesday but his employers at Norwegian media conglomerate NHST, have been unable to reach him since,' the paper said. Oslo police launched an investigation. 'Blinds were drawn today at his flat in Mortensrud, an upmarket suburb on the outskirts of Oslo. The grass was overgrown, and neighbors claimed to have not seen him for several months,' the Daily Mail reported. 'His profile on Founders Nation, a site connecting entrepreneurs with Israeli start-ups described him as an entrepreneur-minded business developer looking for a co-founder or like-minded people to start a venture.'

While one man suffered mild injuries, the attack caused damage and several brush fires to ignited. Lebanon's Hezbollah-affiliated al-Manar channel, said the strike was in response to Israel's 'false claims' that it struck some 1,000 rocket launchers in Lebanon since Friday. The outlet said the rockets were aimed at Israeli military bases. esidents of northern Israel were told by the Home Front Command earlier that they were no longer instructed to remain near shelters after they were warned late on Friday to do so. The IDF conducted strikes on Hezbollah targets overnight in dozens of sorties in response to Hezbollah attacks including a barrage of some 50 Iranian falaq missiles at the border communities. Israel's security cabinet will meet later on Saturday to discuss the ongoing cross border violence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjod4r5p0	2024-09-20T04:05:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/rkFoRp5pA/rkFoRp5pA_0_307_961_540_0_small.jpg

Meet Hezbollah's unit tasked with enlisting operatives in Israel	Shin Bet says thwarted Iranian and Hezbollah efforts to enlist operatives, and carry out attacks, since the start of the war; says unit 133 is behind IED detonating inside Israel, assassination attempts on former defense minister and others and smuggling of arms Since the start of the war, Shin Bet revealed eight attempts by Iran and Hezbollah to enlist operatives in Israel that would carry out attacks. On Thursday, an Israeli businessman was indicted on charges that he had been tapped by Iranian intelligence operatives to assassinate senior Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, and to carry out missions inside the country. Security officials also say there is direct contact between Israeli crime gangs and terrorists, which Iran has used to entice people with promises of financial rewards and a supply of weapons. Hezbollah's unit 133 is tasked with conscripting operatives in Israel. It replaced unit 1800, whose notorious commander, Khalil Kharev, successfully enlisted Palestinians to construct a terror infrastructure and carry out attacks. Unit 133 had taken over that mission and was given a wider birth to operate not only in Israel but around the world, mostly in Europe as well as in Egypt and Jordan. According to Arab reports, under the current commander of unit 133 operatives is working with Lebanese drug smugglers to bring explosives into Israel and the West Bank with the help of crime gangs in South Lebanon. Conscripts undergo military and security training, learn how to raise funds, prepare cover stories and conduct surveillance. They often meet handlers from the unit in Syria and Lebanon but also in Europe in other parts of the world. The security officials in Israel believe Hezbollah's unit 133 was behind the plot to assassinate former defense minister Moshe Ya'alon last year using an explosive device planted on his daily jogging route in Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park and the explosive device that severely wounded one man at the Megiddo intersection in the north in March 2023. The Alma Research and Education Center which specializes in security challenges on Israel's northern border said unit 133's mission is to bolster terror infrastructure inside Israel by among other means, using smuggling routes to insert weapons for its operators with the collaboration of Lebanese crime families. Researchers believe Kharev is still heavily involved in the unit's work and uses his connections to the local criminals, to the unit's ends. He is also thought to be at the head of Hezbollah's efforts to train Shiite militias in Iraq and Yemen. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj00ytp9ta	2024-09-20T03:42:40-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/SkpjdrKT0/SkpjdrKT0_0_0_853_480_0_small.jpg

US believes Gaza ceasefire deal unlikely in Biden's term, reports	Pentagon spokesperson says she does not believe the deal is falling apart but unnamed sources claim Israeli demands to control Philadelphi Corridor and Hamas demands on prisoner releases, remain obstacles to progress U.S. officials now believe that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza is unlikely before President Joe Biden leaves office in January, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The newspaper cited top-level officials in the White House, State Department and Pentagon without naming them. Those bodies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'I can tell you that we do not believe that deal is falling apart,' Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters on Thursday before the report was published. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said two weeks ago that 90% of a ceasefire deal had been agreed upon. The United States and mediators Qatar and Egypt have for months attempted to secure a ceasefire but have failed to bring Israel and Hamas to a final agreement. Two obstacles have been especially difficult: Israel's demand to keep forces in the Philadelphi corridor between Gaza and Egypt and the specifics of an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The United States has said a Gaza ceasefire deal could lower tensions across the Middle East amid fears the conflict could widen. Biden laid out a three-phase ceasefire proposal on May 31 that he said at the time Israel agreed to. As the talks hit obstacles, officials have for weeks said a new proposal would soon be presented. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hknk625ta	2024-09-20T02:25:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/03/r100ONcoN0/r100ONcoN0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Coordinated pager blasts were 15- years in the making, report	American intelligence sources say plan involves shell companies, multiple layers of intelligence officers and assets fronting legitimate companies, adding CIA rejected similar-style operations for fear of injury to innocent bystanders American intelligence officials said the operation to detonate thousand of communication devices used by Hezbollah in Lebanon was at least 15 years in the making, ABC News reported late on Friday. 'Planning for the attack involved shell companies, with multiple layers of Israeli intelligence officers and their assets fronting a legitimate company that produced the pagers,' the network said, adding that at least some of those involved were unaware of who they were really working for. ABC's sources said 30 to 60 grams of explosives were inserted into the pagers along with an electronic trigger. One source said similar attacks were also considered by the CIA but rejected because of the high risk to innocent bystanders. According to reports in Lebanon, over 3,000 Hezbollah operatives were wounded when the pagers exploded and 450 more were hurt in the second wave of the attack a day later, when hand radio devices also exploded. Officially Hezbollah confirmed 37 fatalities in total but Israeli officials estimated the death toll to be much higher. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byb00whcp0	2024-09-20T01:35:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/rJ9N3ePTA/rJ9N3ePTA_0_0_809_456_0_small.jpg

Trump says if he loses the elections it will be the fault of Jews	Republican presidential hopeful said in a Kamala Harris administration Israel would be obliterated, describing how rockets would rain on the country and terrorists would go door to door massacring and raping innocent civilians 'I'm here tonight to deliver an urgent warning to Jewish Americans and to friends of Israel all around the world, ' Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump said on Friday adding that evangelical Christians who support Israel love it more than Jewish people in New York, sometimes. 'If we continue down this path for four more years with Kamala, Israel will be faced not only with an attack but with total annihilation.' Trump spoke to the Israeli American Council in Washington wearing a yellow tie to symbolize his support for the hostages held in Gaza. He invited rescued hostage Andrei Kozlov to the stage honoring his bravery. 'You have a big protector in me. You don't have a protector on the other side,' he said. ''Anybody who's Jewish and loves being Jewish and loves Israel, is a fool if they vote for a Democrat… You should have your head examined.' He said in a Kamala administration Iran would obtain nuclear weapons. He went on to describe a future where rockets would rain down on Israel, terrorists would go door to door massacring and raping innocent civilians and Tel Aviv and Jerusalem would become unlivable. He said Israel must win its war on terror but win it fast. Trump said Kamala Harris has repeatedly demanded a cease-fire, to save Hamas and had said she would consider imposing an arms embargo on Israel. Trump complained that only 29% of Jews supported him in the 2020 elections, which he lost to Bide, despite 'giving' Israel the Golan Heights, the Abraham Accord and the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital along with billions and billions of dollars. He claimed polls now show he has 40% support of American Jews, but 60% remaining percent still support the Democrats, whom he called the enemy. 'You didn't treat yourselves well,' he told the Jewish crowd. 'I wasn't treated properly by the voters who happen to be Jewish,' he said. 'If I don't win these elections, the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.' Trump said his administration would 'stop the spread of toxic antisemitism that's spreading here,' but only if voters reject Harris. 'November 5 2024 will be the most important day in the history of Israel and the history of the United States he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkk00f59pa	2024-09-19T23:58:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/BkeisbUq6C/BkeisbUq6C_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Dubious character, would've conned the Iranians': New details on...	Moti Maman, indicted of being recruited by Iran to carry out assassinations against Israeli officials, had criminal connections with acquaintances saying he always seemed shady Moti Maman, 72, an Israeli businessman based in Turkey who was indicted Thursday of being recruited by Iranian intelligence, lived in Ashkelon after leaving from northern Israel’s Bustan Hagalil 10 years ago. A., a local resident, told Ynet the man 'always seemed like a dubious character.' Another resident of Bustan HaGalil shared, 'He has a plot in the area, but hasn't lived there for years. He’s told a lot of people here that he’s a Mossad agent and a graduate of the IDF’s intelligence Unit 8200. We always laughed about it because those weren’t the kind of people we'd see him hanging out with.' A source familiar with the criminal world said, 'Moti isn’t a well-known businessman.' According to him, 'he was involved in shady dealings with criminals in Nahariya. He did a lot of business with Arabs and I think that’s how the Iranians got to him because they realized they could exploit him since he’s quite naïve and isn’t deeply familiar with the criminal world.' 'Even if he agreed to carry out the operation, I think he would’ve taken the money from the Iranians and then disappeared. I know he’s done that with other businesses he went to in Africa — he didn’t pay back his debts to those he did business with there,' he added. On the other hand, D. from Bustan HaGalil described him as a good person. 'He lived in Romania for a while; a woman there conned him and took all his money. He was left with nothing. Overall, he’s really a good guy — he’s never done anything to harm others.' After his divorce, Maman moved to Ashkelon. Many of Maman's neighbors told Ynet they have known him for years and always knew he was involved in criminal activities but refuse to provide information because they fear for their personal safety. Maman left Bustan HaGalil nearly a decade ago, and the residents were shocked by the reports about their former neighbor and the severity of the allegations against him. One of Maman’s sons serves in an IDF combat unit. His ex-wife, son and daughter still live in the northern Israeli town and are considered good neighbors. It’s unclear whether they’ve maintained contact with him in recent years. 'His family is strong and well-established, and we’ll stand by them and support them if necessary. We’re convinced they have no connection to this,' residents of Bustan HaGalil said. Maman owned a shawarma stand in Nahariya for a short while, which he allegedly bought from a criminal a decade ago. The police suspected at the time that he was running a front from the criminals and refused to grant a business license for the eatery. A city resident said that Maman was 'a people person.' According to him, 'he was one of those friendly guys, making friends with everyone. He always had friends hanging out at his place. I don’t believe he would’ve actually done it; in my opinion, he would’ve conned the Iranians.' Maman is accused of contacting a foreign agent after being recruited by Iran to promote, among other things, the assassination of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. 'I don't know what would have happened if they had given me a million dollars and what I would have done. We're only human,' the defendant said during his interrogation, referring to the financial advance he requested from the Iranian agents he met with — which wasn’t paid to him — leading to his refusal of the proposal. During his court hearing, Maman couldn't stop smiling. It was also revealed on Thursday that the prosecution filed an indictment against Maman at the Be'er Sheva District Court, accusing him of offenses against national security, including contacting a foreign agent and entering an enemy state without permission. According to the indictment, Maman engaged in discussions on Iranian soil with local agents operating on behalf of the Islamic Republic's intelligence services. He entered Iran twice and discussed the possibility of carrying out terror operations within Israel during meetings with Iranian agents. After the defendant explained to the Iranian agents that the high level of security around senior officials made it impossible to harm them, other options for carrying out terror and espionage operations by the defendant were discussed including harming former prime minister Naftali Bennett or Israeli mayors. 'What might have happened if the advance he demanded had been paid worries the prosecution, but it will settle for referring to the defendant’s own words,' the request to remand Maman until the end of legal proceedings against him read. This referred to his statement during the interrogation where he admitted he didn't know what he would have done if his handlers had given him the monetary sum he requested. The prosecution also mentioned that during the discussions about terror operations against Israel, 'the transfer of funds, the delivery of photographic information to Iranian sources documenting crowded places in Israel and even the establishment of assassination cells in Russia and the U.S. by the defendant were considered, aimed at murdering opponents of the Iranian regime.' Maman, who acted out of financial greed, requested a financial advance from Iran before carrying out any action for the regime, which is why his meetings didn’t result in any concrete terror operations. According to the prosecution, Maman confessed to the charges during 14 Shin Bet interrogations and four additional police interrogations. 'Throughout these interrogations, he revealed the extent of his crime to the investigators and consistently stood by his confession, enriching it with facts and details,' the prosecution’s statement said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hypu11g96r	2024-09-19T22:33:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/HybP111DYT0/HybP111DYT0_268_313_753_424_0_small.jpg
Hezbollah targets north after Israel strikes 1,000 launchers	Residents of the north told instructions to remain near shelters are lifted; over 70 air force strikes on Lebanon mark most in one day since the war began; U.S. official believe a ground incursion is not imminent Residents of the northern border communities in the Upper Galilee woke up to sirens on Friday after a relatively quiet night. They were told by the Home Front Command that instructions to remain near shelters, given to them late last night, were lifted. The IDF said the air force attacked some 1,000 of Hezbollah's rocket launchers and other targets based on intelligence information. Lebanese media reported Israel carried out over 70 strikes on Lebanon, making the most in one day since the war began. Officials in the Biden administration told the Wall Street Journal that despite the deployment of Israel's elite fighting 98th division to the north, they did not believe that an Israeli ground offensive was imminent because IDF reserves had not been called up. They said weeks would be needed to prepare for the movement of forces across the border, adding that Israel could choose a limited operation that would begin sooner but would not involve a more significant military maneuver. The U.S. and its European allies urgently called for calm and a diplomatic solution to the crisis although Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech on Friday that his terror group would not stop the attacks on Israel until the war in Gaza ends. Nasrallah spoke in a televised address for the first time since the coordinated explosions of thousands of his group's communication devices earlier in the week, attributed to Israel. He said the operation which dealt a severe blow to his organization, could be seen as a declaration of war and was a massacre and genocide. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Friday that the Israeli attacks on Lebanon would increase after the government added to its objectives in the war that began in the wake of the Hamas massacre on October 7, the safe return of residents evacuated from the north to their homes. The IDF urged civilians in the north to remain outside areas used by the military to conduct drills. In a statement the military said in no uncertain terms that entering restricted areas could come at the cost of lives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkldjo96r	2024-09-19T22:24:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/r1XWQ01156C/r1XWQ01156C_0_0_1600_900_0_small.jpg

Russia's Kadyrov accuses musk of 'remotely disabling' his cybertr...	That's not a nice thing for Elon Musk to do. He gives expensive gifts from the bottom of his heart and then remotely switches them off,' Chechen leader says Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful leader of Russia's Chechen Republic, accused Elon Musk on Thursday of disabling a Tesla Cybertruck that he claimed to have received from the billionaire last month. Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya with an iron fist for over 17 years, shared a video in August of him driving around in the electric vehicle with what appeared to be a machine gun mounted on its roof. Kadyrov said he received the vehicle from Musk, a claim that the Tesla owner called a lie on his social media platform X. 'Now, recently, Musk remotely disabled the Cybertruck,' said Kadyrov in a post on his Telegram account. 'That's not a nice thing for Elon Musk to do. He gives expensive gifts from the bottom of his heart and then remotely switches them off,' he said. The Cybertruck is an electric pick-up truck that was first unveiled by US carmaker Tesla in 2019 before going into production last year. Kadyrov claimed in his social media post that the vehicle he received was used in combat and sent to Ukraine, where it 'performed admirably'. The son of a former rebel warlord, Kadyrov is now one of Putin's most vociferous backers and has long referred to himself as the president's 'footsoldier'. The 47-year-old Chechen leader says he has deployed thousands of troops to help the Kremlin with its Ukraine offensive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syvzpm9pr	2024-09-19T15:00:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/18/SJcO1HyjR/SJcO1HyjR_0_0_634_357_0_small.jpg

After Hezbollah chief insinuates explosion of communication devices across Lebanon could be considered an 'act of war', defense minister makes clear Israel's actions to change the situation in the north will continue Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday said Israel’s 'course of action will continue,' after Hezbollah leader General Hassan Nasrallah’s speech in which he said the detonation of communication devices in Lebanon the terror group attributed to Israel 'could be considered a declaration of war.' Israel has not claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks. Gallant held consultations on the various possibilities for continuing the campaign against Hezbollah on the northern border with IDF Chief of Staff LTG Herzi Halevi, senior military officials, Shin Bet and Mossad officials. 'In recent days, we’ve been holding a series of important discussions. This is a new stage in the war, one that presents significant opportunities, but also substantial risks,' Gallant said. 'Hezbollah is feeling pressured and our sequence of military actions will continue. Our goal is to return northern residents to their homes safely. Hezbollah will pay a growing price as time goes on. At the same time, we’ll continue our efforts to bring the hostages home and dismantle Hamas in Gaza.' 'We were dealt a massive blow,' Nasrallah said in his first comments since the coordinated detonation of pagers and walkie-talkies used by the terror group in Lebanon, calling it 'genocide.' However, he said that the fighting would not stop until the war in Gaza ended. 'Even a full-scale war won’t lead to the return of the northern residents,' he said addressing his words to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Gallant. Nasrallah also threatened that Hezbollah would have a 'historic opportunity' if Israel initiated a ground operation in Lebanon, recalling the past guerrilla operations against IDF forces in the buffer zone from which Israel withdrew in 2000. In his speech, Nasrallah promised a 'proper,' punishment but didn’t elaborate. 'it’ll come from somewhere either expected or unexpected.' Israel was preparing for a harsh response and is shifting its focus in the war to the northern front, with a commitment to achieving the war’s goals of returning the northern residents to their homes — after 11 months of fighting. Jerusalem was also concerned about possible Iranian involvement — as its ambassador to Lebanon was seriously injured in the pager attack. Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Hossein Salami declared that he informed Nasrallah that Israel would face 'a crushing response from the axis of resistance.' Just before Nasrallah began his speech, the IDF announced it had launched a wave of strikes in Lebanon. 'The IDF is currently striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon to degrade Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure,' an IDF statement read 15 minutes before the speech began. Reports indicated bombings across southern Lebanese villages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjb9zk9ac	2024-09-19T13:53:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/r1C2F6tpA/r1C2F6tpA_548_190_658_371_0_small.jpg
Company implicated in pager strike uses fake CEO photo on website	Neighbors on the quiet street and nondescript building are upset at the unwanted publicity they are subjected to after their address was identified as the office of the BAC company that marketed the Taiwanese Gold Apollo pagers purchased by Hezbollah The photo of Italian-Hungarian Christina Arcidiacono Barsony, the woman identified as CEO of the BAC company, implicated in the coordinated pager explosions in Lebanon, and who disappeared off the face of the earth, is not who she was claimed to be. 'I know the woman from the photos, and I’ve heard there’s been trouble at the apartment where she lives in Budapest. I know her well. That’s not Christina,' a neibor of the company's offices said. The Hungarian company BAC, which the Taiwanese brand 'Gold Apollo' claims produced the pager that exploded in Lebanon, operated in a discreet, ideal location for secretive activities. The building from which BAC operated—allegedly used by Mossad for the pager operation, according to foreign reports—is tucked away on a side street in a quiet neighborhood, not far from a highway. The area consists of single-family homes with gardens, alongside office buildings and an industrial zone, including a garage. The BAC office is located near house number 33. 'I’ve had my business here for 12 years,' said the owner of the garage, who declined to give his name. 'In all that time, this office building was always full of companies. They’d come for a few months or a year and then leave. We never saw or heard anyone.' He, like many other neighbors, appeared uneasy, baffled by the sudden attention. The office building itself is an unremarkable two-story cream-colored structure, surrounded by a black iron fence with brown-tiled roof decorations between the gates. A parking lot on the right holds four bins for waste sorting, while a driveway on the left leads to an underground garage. Four steps lead up to the entrance, where a large white mailbox bears the names of two companies, next to an intercom with four buttons. The second button from the top reads 'Claudia.' At 10:30 am, a couple stepped out onto the second-floor balcony of house number 33, chain-smoking cigarettes. 'I just want them to leave us alone,' the woman said. 'Yesterday morning, we had a quiet, normal life, and now the whole world wants to know who we are. It’s crazy, absolutely insane. We’re terrified. Our home and address are exposed to everyone, and for something like this? Today it’s journalists, but who knows who’ll come next week. We’ve never seen anyone from BAC—just a secretary who showed up occasionally, but we don’t know who she worked for. We just want to be left in peace.' One day, you live in a forgotten corner where no one cares, and the next, you’re on the front pages worldwide. 'It’s crazy and frightening. We’re scared,' she added, lighting a new cigarette with the previous one, her hands trembling. An elderly couple from a nearby house got into their red Dacia and left for shopping. 'There’s never been even a hint of noise here,' the man said in German before quickly disappearing down the street. The story of the pagers and communication devices that exploded on Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon is turning into a thriller even John le Carré couldn’t have dreamed up. Christina herself, and her background, are shrouded in inconsistencies and suspicions. The places she claimed to have worked don’t exist, and their websites are nowhere to be found. She personally denied any connection to the production of pagers in a statement to NBC, also refuting the claim by the Taiwanese 'Gold Apollo' brand that she had received permission only to use their trademark, while all manufacturing and design were handled by her company. Before BAC’s website went offline, according to the German newspaper Bild, the company had also offered a jewelry line for sale, called 'Nelkhael,' after the 21st angel from a list of 72 angels in Kabbalah. Meanwhile, the Hungarian site Telex reported that the pagers were actually sold to Hezbollah by a Bulgarian company named 'Global NORTA Ltd.' Telex further reported that Global NORTA, based in Sofia, Bulgaria, was responsible for manufacturing and exporting the pagers to Lebanon, while BAC merely served as a broker. This was supported by a Hungarian government spokesperson, who claimed the devices never physically passed through Hungarian territory. However, this statement should be taken with caution: if it is revealed that devices intended for terrorist groups were produced on Hungarian soil, it would constitute a serious violation of European Union laws. The report added that BAC was merely a shell company facilitating the deal between Taiwan and Bulgaria, while 'Global NORTA Ltd.' handled the import of the devices from Taiwan and their shipment to Lebanon. Global NORTA, founded in April 2022, just a month before BAC, is owned by a Norwegian citizen. The address listed for the Bulgarian company is also home to 196 other registered businesses. 'I informed the tech company where I work as a project manager in the 11th district that I won’t be coming in. I have a six-month-old daughter. We lived very quiet lives, and now our address is everywhere, 'the neighbor at number 33 said. 'My instinct is to be afraid of any grieving family member who lost someone in these explosions and might come here. I know they probably understand this address is nothing, but I’m thinking rationally here—and there’s no rationale in this.' 'I’m not angry at Israel,' he added. 'What do I care about Israel? If it weren’t for this house, I wouldn’t even know about the whole thing. I like to run and spend time with my family. How does this concern me? I took my kids to school and took public transportation to work. Then my wife called me and said I should probably come home. I asked why, and she said something happened—that the phones downstairs wouldn’t stop ringing.' What truly astonished the neighbor, he said, 'was the government’s statement denying any involvement. But what amazes me even more is that no one has raided the offices, collected documents, or seized computers. There’s no investigation. Hungary isn’t even trying to figure out what happened with these offices.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byiifg56c	2024-09-19T13:35:12-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/BJuusg00aA/BJuusg00aA_0_0_1280_623_0_small.jpg

Mohamed Al Fayed, former Harrods boss, accused of multiple rapes	A year after his death BBC releases an investigative report in which over 20 women accuse Al Fayed of sexual assault, five alleging rape claiming he would promote attractive women to work in his office and then assault them Five women claimed Mohamed Al Fayed, the former owner of Harrods, had raped them while they were employed at Harrods, London's luxury department store, a BBC investigative report said. BBC gathered testimony from more than 20 former female employees, many of whom claim the billionaire sexually assaulted or raped them. Al Fayed, who passed away last year at 94, was alleged to have committed these crimes during his ownership of Harrods. The documentary and podcast, Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods, revealed evidence suggesting that not only did Harrods fail to intervene but had helped cover up the abuse. The store’s current owners expressed their shock and condemnation over the allegations, apologizing to the victims and acknowledging that they had been failed. 'The spider’s web of corruption and abuse in this company was unbelievable and very dark,' said barrister Bruce Drummond, who represents several of the women. Since the initial report, more former Harrods employees have come forward, saying they were also assaulted by Al Fayed. Allegations of rape across multiple cities The incidents reportedly took place in locations including London, Paris, St. Tropez, and Abu Dhabi. One woman said Al Fayed raped her in his Park Lane apartment. 'I made it obvious that I didn't want that to happen. I did not give consent. I just wanted it to be over,' she said. Another woman, who said she was a teenager at the time, claimed Al Fayed raped her at the same Mayfair address. 'Mohamed Al Fayed was a monster, a sexual predator with no moral compass whatsoever,' she said, adding that Harrods staff were treated as his 'playthings.' Fayed, whose son Dodi died in a car crash with Princess Diana in 1997, faced claims of sexual assault during his lifetime. However, the scale and severity of the recent allegations are unprecedented. Harrods' toxic culture Several women describe a toxic environment at Harrods when it was owned by Al Fayed. Sophia, who worked as his personal assistant from 1988 to 1991, said he attempted to rape her more than once. 'That makes me angry; people shouldn’t remember him as pleasant. That’s not how he was,' she said. Former staff members told the BBC that Al Fayed regularly scouted the sales floors, selecting attractive young female assistants to be promoted to work in his offices where many of the alleged assaults took place. Other claims were of assault in his London apartment, or during overseas trips to properties like the Ritz Hotel in Paris, which he also owned. 'We watched each other walk through that door thinking, ‘You poor girl, it's you today,’' said Alice, a former employee, recalling the fear and helplessness that surrounded the abuse. Assaults in Paris and beyond Rachel, who worked as Al Fayed’s assistant in the 1990s, said he raped her at his Park Lane apartment. 'I remember feeling his body on me, the weight of him, and just hearing him make these noises,' she said. 'He raped me.' Sophia said she felt trapped in her job. 'I couldn’t leave. I didn’t have a family home to go back to. I had to pay rent,' she said. Gemma, who worked as one of Al Fayed’s assistants from 2007 to 2009, described a terrifying ordeal during a work trip to his Villa Windsor property in Paris. She said he raped her there, then instructed her to wash herself with Dettol. 'He wanted me to erase any trace of him being near me,' she said. Eight other women told the BBC they were sexually assaulted at Al Fayed’s Paris properties. and five described the attacks as attempted rape. An open secret Tony Leeming, a Harrods department manager from 1994 to 2004, said the abuse of women wasn’t a secret. 'It wasn’t even a secret on the shop floor. Anyone who says they didn’t know is lying,' he said. Several former Harrods security staff backed these claims, revealing that they were aware of Al Fayed’s inappropriate behavior toward young female employees. They also disclosed that some women underwent invasive sexual health checks, the results of which were sent to Al Fayed. A culture of fear pervaded the store, with many employees believing their phones were tapped and that they were being filmed. Eamon Coyle, former deputy director of security, confirmed that part of his role was listening to recorded calls. 'He [Al Fayed] bugged everybody he wanted to bug,' Coyle said. Attempts to expose the abuse Al Fayed faced scrutiny during his lifetime. A 1995 Vanity Fair article alleged racism, staff surveillance, and sexual misconduct. Fayed dropped a subsequent libel lawsuit, provided any further evidence of his misconduct would be locked away. Other media outlets, including ITV’s The Big Story and Channel 4’s Dispatches, also aired serious allegations against him. Despite these reports, it is only now—after Al Fayed’s death—that many women feel able to speak publicly about rape and attempted rape. Several of them had been bound by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), which were used to suppress allegations in exchange for settlements. Legal claims and settlements In July 2023, Harrods’ current owners began settling civil claims brought by women who alleged that they were sexually assaulted while working at the store. Harrods has pledged to settle the claims quickly and without requiring NDAs. The barristers representing the women argue that Harrods was responsible for creating an unsafe working environment. 'Any place of work has a duty to ensure the safety of its employees. Without question, the company failed these ladies,' Drummond said. 'They enabled it.' Gemma, who was among those to sign an NDA after she was raped, said she hopes speaking out now will help others heal. 'I’ve spent so many years being quiet, not speaking up,' she said. 'I hope talking about it now helps.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1juw6fac	2024-09-19T11:26:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/09/23/BJcoHg97K/BJcoHg97K_0_15_1508_849_0_small.jpg
Air Force strikes 30 launchers loaded with 150 rockets aimed at I...	Jets fly over the Beqaa Valley and break the sound barrier over Beirut during Nasrallah's speech; IDF says it also struck Hezbollah structures and weapons storage facilities in South Lebanon Air Force jets struck 30 Hezbollah launchers ready to fire 150 rockets toward Israel, the IDF said on Thursday evening. The military said the strikes were made based on intelligence information adding that military structures and weapons storage facilities in several areas in South Lebanon were also hit. The military earlier announced it was striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon to degrade the terror group's capabilities and infrastructure. The IDF has rarely revealed its attacks while they were still underway. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization has turned southern Lebanon into a combat zone. For decades, Hezbollah has weaponized civilian homes, dug tunnels beneath them, and used civilians as human shields,' the IDF said. Leading up to and during a televised speech of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, his first since the coordinated explosions over two days, of his group's communication devices, Lebanese media outlets reported Israeli jets flying over the Beqaa Valley and over Beirut's southern sector, both Hezbollah strongholds. The planes flying over the Lebanese capital broke the sound barrier making loud noise that was heard throughout the city as residents watched Nasrallah speak. Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel's north along the border and in the Golan Heights, throughout the afternoon after anti-tank missile fire earlier in the day, resulted in the killing of two IDF servicemen and the wounding of at least one other. Power outages were reported in the coastal Israeli city of Nahariya after a power line was hit in the afternoon attack. The military also said earlier that the IDF Chief of Staff had approved the battle plans for an offensive on Lebanon and was prepared for the government to give the go-ahead. Also, earlier the IDF said its forces had thwarted a Hezbollah terror attack on the border on Monday. 'IDF soldiers conducting operations on the northern border identified two Hezbollah terrorists planting explosive devices on the border with Lebanon. The soldiers directed artillery and an aircraft which struck and eliminated the terrorists as they attempted to conduct the attack in the area of the 'Tziporen' post,' the military said in a statement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjmrwjqta	2024-09-19T11:12:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/rJKoZAY6C/rJKoZAY6C_0_728_961_540_0_small.jpg

I grabbed it by the head, but it wouldn't release me' Thai woman...	Snake attacks a woman in her kitchen coiling itself around her body and holding her captive for hours before a neighbor calls police and the struggle to release her begins A 64-year-old woman was preparing to do her evening dishes at her home outside Bangkok when she felt a sharp pain in her thigh and looked down to see a huge python taking hold of her. 'I was about to scoop some water and when I sat down it bit me immediately, Arom Arunroj told Thailand's Thairath newspaper. 'When I looked I saw the snake wrapping around me.' The four-to-five-meter-long (13-to-16-foot-long) python coiled itself around her torso, squeezing her down to the floor of her kitchen. 'I grabbed it by the head, but it wouldn't release me,' she said. 'It only tightened.' Pythons are non-venomous constrictors, which kill their prey by gradually squeezing the breath out of it. Propped up against her kitchen door, she cried for help but it wasn't until a neighbor happened to be walking by about an hour and a half later and heard her screams that authorities were called. Responding police officer Anusorn Wongmalee told The Associated Press on Thursday that when he arrived the woman was still leaning against her door, looking exhausted and pale, with the snake coiled around her. Police and animal control officers used a crowbar to hit the snake on the head until it released its grip and slithered away before it could be captured. In all, Arom spent about two hours on Tuesday night in the clutches of the python before being freed. She was treated for several bites but appeared to be otherwise unharmed in videos of her talking to Thai media shortly after the incident. Encounters with snakes are not uncommon in Thailand, and last year 26 people were killed by venomous snake bites, according to government statistics. A total of 12,000 people were treated for venomous bites by snakes and other animals 2023. The reticulated python is the largest snake found in Thailand and usually ranges in size from 1.5 meters to 6.5 meters (5 to 21 feet), weighing up to about 75 kilograms (165 pounds). They have been found as big as 10 meters (33 feet) long and 130 kilograms (287 pounds). Smaller pythons feed on small mammals such as rats, but larger snakes switch to prey such as pigs, deer and even domestic dogs and cats. Attacks on humans are not common, though do happen occasionally. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk116sckpc	2024-09-19T10:32:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/BkgFp0tTC/BkgFp0tTC_0_134_459_259_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah chief calls the coordinated explosions a declaration of war, a massacre and a genocide that broke all rules; during his speech Israeli jets reported flying low over Beirut Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech on Thursday that the coordinated attack attributed to Israel was the most severe and unprecedented blow in the history of the conflict. 'This is a declaration of war,' he said. 'We know the enemy has technological superiority especially supported by the U.S. and the West. We bet on Jihad, attrition. We've won many times before.' מזכ'ל חיזבאללה חסן נסראללה התגרה בנאומו בישראל ואמר כי 'ההצעה של אלוף פיקוד הצפון להקים חגורת אבטחה בדרום לבנון היא מטופשת. אנחנו מקווים שהם יישמו אותה אנחנו רואים בכך הזדמנות היסטורית שיהיו לה השפעות גדולות על הקרב. הם מוזמנים. זו הזדמנות היסטורית שאנחנו מחכים לה.אם האויב יקים רצועת ביטחון עליו לדעת שהיא תהפוך למלכודת, בוץ, למארב. הוא יעמוד בפני חשבון קשה'. הוא הוסיף: 'המתקפות בשלישי ורביעי ייענו בעונש הולם. אנחנו בשלב הכי רגיש במערכה'. During the terror group's leader's televised speech, the first he has made since the coordinated explosions of Hezbollah's communication devices on Tuesday and Wednesday, Lebanese media reported Israeli fighter jets flying over Beirut, breaking the sound barrier. Earlier media outlets reported jets over the Beqaa Valley and areas in the South. Nasrallah said Israel broke all rules in the coordinated explosions of the group's communications devices on Tuesday and Wednesday. He said the Israelis did not care if the pagers were among civilians, claiming dozens were killed including women and children and thousands wounded. 'This is an act of terror, a massacre, a genocide,' he said. The terrorist leader also thanked Lebanon's government, Iran and health officials for their actions in the wake of the explosions. He said Israel had intended to kill thousands in its coordinated attack on the terror group's communication devices but had failed. He also claimed that the pagers and communication devices that detonated, were not used by senior members of the Iran-backed group. 'The enemy tried to destroy Hezbollah's command structure and hurt its leaders and cause chaos in our organization but that has not happened. We are prepared for all eventualities,' he said Nasrallah said Israel had admitted to losing its north and that forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant to find a solution after Israel's first historic defeat that is testimony to the effectiveness of Hezbollah's attacks. 'Israel has been trying from day one to stop the Lebanese support for Gaza,' he said adding the conflict on the border is an important player in the Palestinian resistance's efforts to end the attacks in Gaza. 'The Lebanese front would not stop until Israeli aggression in Gaza ends,' he said. Nasrallah addressed Netanyahu and Gallant directly in his speech and said they will not be able to return the residents of Israel's north to their homes unless they end the war in Gaza and the West Bank.

Muslim Americans moving to Jill Stein in potential blow to Kamala...	Polling shows Vice President trails behind Jewish Green Party candidate and Republican Donald Trump in state home to large Muslim community angered over Biden policy on Gaza war Arab-American and Muslim voters angry at U.S. support for Israel's offensive in Gaza are shunning Democrat Kamala Harris in the presidential race to back third-party candidate Jill Stein in numbers that could deny Harris victories in battleground states that will decide the Nov. 5 election. A Council on American-Islamic Relations poll released this month showed that in Michigan, home to a large Arab American community, 40% of Muslim voters backed the Green Party's Stein. Republican candidate Donald Trump got 18% with Harris, who is President Joe Biden's vice president, trailing at 12%. Stein also leads Harris among Muslims in Arizona and Wisconsin, battleground states with sizable Muslim populations where Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by slim margins. Harris was the leading pick of Muslim voters in Georgia and Pennsylvania, while Trump prevailed in Nevada with 27%, just ahead of Harris' 26%, according to the CAIR poll of 1,155 Muslim voters nationwide. All are battleground states that have swung on narrow margins in recent elections. Biden won the 2020 Muslim vote, credited in some exit polls with more than 80% of their support, but Muslim backing of Democrats has fallen sharply since Israel's nearly year-long action in Gaza. About 3.5 million Americans reported being of Middle Eastern descent in the 2020 U.S. Census, the first year such data was recorded. Although they make up about 1% of the total U.S. population of 335 million, their voters may prove crucial in a race that opinion polls show to be close. On Tuesday, Harris called for an end to the Israel-Gaza war and the return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. She also said Israel must not reoccupy the Palestinian enclave and backed a two-state solution. But at closed-door meetings in Michigan and elsewhere, Harris campaign officials have rebuffed appeals to halt or limit U.S. arms shipments to Israel, community leaders say. 'Decades of community organizing and civic engagement and mobilizing have not manifested into any benefit,' said Faye Nemer, founder of the Michigan-based MENA American Chamber of Commerce to promote U.S. trade with the Middle East. 'We're part of the fabric of this country, but our concerns are not taken into consideration,' she said. Stein is aggressively campaigning on Gaza, while Trump representatives are meeting with Muslim groups and promising a swifter peace than Harris can deliver. The Harris campaign declined to comment on the shifting dynamics; officials tasked with Muslim outreach were not available for interviews. Stein's 2016 run ended with just over 1% of the popular vote, but some Democrats blamed her and the Green Party for taking votes away from Democrat Hillary Clinton. Pollsters give Stein no chance of winning in 2024. But her support for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, for an immediate U.S. arms embargo on Israel and for student movements to force universities to divest from weapons investments have made her a star in pro-Palestinian circles. Her running mate Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is Muslim. This month Stein spoke at ArabCon in Dearborn, Michigan, an annual gathering of Arab Americans and was featured on the cover of The Arab American News under the headline 'The Choice 2024.' Last week in an interview with The Breakfast Club, a New York radio program, she said, 'Every vote cast for our campaign is a vote against genocide,' a charge that Israel denies. Trump team campaigns for Arab American votes At the same time, the Trump team has hosted dozens of in-person and virtual events with Arab Americans and Muslims in Michigan and Arizona, said Richard Grenell, Trump's former acting Director of National Intelligence. 'Arab American leaders in Detroit know this is their moment to send a powerful message to the Democrat party that they shouldn't be taken for granted,' Grenell said. Trump has said he would secure more Arab-Israeli peace deals. The Trump outreach and Stein's appeal could translate into numbers that might threaten Harris. The Green Party is on most state ballots, including all battleground states that could decide the election, except for Georgia and Nevada, where the party is suing to be included. Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by just thousands of votes in some states, thanks in part to the support of Arab and Muslim voters in states where they are concentrated, including Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes in 2020, but Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton there by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016. The state is home to overlapping groups of more than 200,000 registered voters who are Muslim and 300,000 who report ancestry from the Middle East and North Africa. In Philadelphia, which has a large Black Muslim population, activists have joined a national 'Abandon Harris' campaign. They helped organize protests during her debate with Trump last week. Philadelphia CAIR co-chair Rabiul Chowdhury said, 'We have options. If Trump pledges to end the war and bring home all hostages, it's game over for Harris.' Trump has said the war would never have erupted if he were president. It's unclear how he would end it. Trump is a firm supporter of Israel. In Georgia, where Biden won in 2020 by 11,779 votes, activists are rallying 12,000 voters to commit to withhold votes from Harris unless the Biden administration acts by Oct. 10 to halt all arms shipments to Israel, demands a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the West Bank, and pledges to uphold a U.S. law that imposes an arms embargo on nations engaged in war crimes. Thousands have already signed similar pledges in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. U.S. Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, said he worries about the impact the Gaza war will have in November. He said not only Arab Americans and Muslims, but a much broader group of younger voters and others are also upset. 'You can't unring a bell,' he said, adding Harris still had 'the space and grace' to shift gears, but time was running out. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk3k8jypr	2024-09-19T06:58:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/Hk0PnYFTR/Hk0PnYFTR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah pager blasts traced to shadowy Bulgarian firm	After Taiwan and Hungary, attention now turns to Bulgaria, where local media identify Norte Global as company behind sale of pagers to Hezbollah; firm’s official website offers little information, with no contact details or company specifics available The Taiwanese manufacturer of the pagers that exploded across Lebanon this week has shifted blame to a Hungarian company, while new details have emerged linking the devices to a mysterious firm in Bulgaria. As Hezbollah grapples with the aftermath of Wednesday’s walkie-talkie explosions, the focus now turns to how the pagers, which detonated on Tuesday in Lebanon and Syria, reached the group. The pagers in question, AR-924 models from Taiwan's Gold Apollo, were allegedly sold by BAC Consulting KFT, a company based in Budapest. However, BAC CEO Cristina Arcidiacono-Barsony, asserted that the firm was 'only an intermediary.' A report by the Hungarian news outlet Telex claims the devices were imported to Lebanon from Bulgaria by a company named Norta Global Ltd., based in Sofia and owned by a Norwegian national. Norta Global’s website offers little information, lacking contact details and listing no personnel. The company's purported manager, identified as Rinsan Hawes, has no digital footprint. On Wednesday, Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs said that the pagers were not manufactured in Hungary. 'Authorities have established that the company in question is a trading intermediary with no manufacturing site in Hungary. The devices were never in the country,' Kovacs said. According to sources cited by Telex, BAC’s CEO was involved with the Bulgarian company. Despite BAC holding the contract with Gold Apollo, it was reportedly Norta Global that managed the deal, importing the pagers from Taiwan and arranging their sale to Hezbollah. Bulgaria's National Security Agency has since launched an investigation, saying that no approval was found for relevant sales and that the only known transaction involved 1.6 million euros being transferred to Hungary. Thousands of pagers were delivered to Hezbollah as part of an effort to establish a secure communication system. Distribution accelerated after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah urged members to avoid cellphones, calling them agents of Israel, and endorsed pagers as a safer alternative. Meanwhile, the walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday were purchased around the same time as the pagers in April. Icom Inc., the Japanese manufacturer of the handheld radios that reportedly exploded in Lebanon, said it discontinued those models a decade ago. The company is investigating, and on Thursday confirmed that its IC-V82 devices were exported to the Middle East between 2004 and 2014. Shock in Lebanon The unprecedented attacks, which Hezbollah has attributed to Israel, have sent shockwaves through the Lebanese population. 'People are panicking and trying to get rid of their wireless devices,' reported the Saudi Al Hadath network, quoting Iranian sources who noted that the walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday are also widely used in Iran. According to the New York Times, the walkie-talkies were larger and heavier than the pagers that exploded the day before, and the resulting fires were more intense due to the greater amount of explosives used. Meanwhile, as U.S. officials continue to push for a diplomatic solution to prevent further escalation, Ibrahim al-Amin, editor of Hezbollah’s Al Akhbar newspaper, published an editorial titled 'The War of Annihilation, Lebanese Edition — Israel Wants to Eliminate Hezbollah.' He wrote that Israel seems to be preparing for a new phase of conflict with Hezbollah, targeting the group’s human and military capabilities, making talk of an all-out war increasingly realistic. 'If the enemy has decided to carry out operations against more than 10,000 people, military personnel, and civilians, in command centers, outposts, or homes, then it has decided that we are in a war without rules,' al-Amin concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rycmgfkaa	2024-09-19T06:05:30-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/SyIOeuYa0/SyIOeuYa0_253_57_959_540_0_small.jpg

Explosive toll: Hezbollah deaths mount from south to the north in...	Terror group reports 37 killed across Lebanon following series of mysterious explosions; dead range from 16 to 54 years old, mostly from south; Nasrallah set to speak Thursday; Israel believes true toll much higher The list of Hezbollah’s fatalities in the last two days is remarkably diverse, with 37 operatives killed in communication device explosions all across Lebanon. The list includes operatives from various regions, such as the Bekaa Valley, the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahieh in Beirut, multiple locations in southern Lebanon and the Akkar region in the north. The youngest victim named is Abdel Moneim Jamal Abdel Moneim, a 16-year-old originally from Aitroun, who lived in southern Lebanon’s Kawthariyat al-Raz. The oldest was Hassan Adel Jaber, born in 1970, from Beni Hayyan in southern Lebanon. All the deceased were referred to in Hezbollah’s official statements as 'martyrs on the path to Jerusalem,' a term the group has used for its fighters since the war began. None were given titles indicating senior roles in the organization. The exact circumstances of their deaths remain unclear, as Hezbollah did not disclose whether they were killed in the pager and walkie-talkie explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday, or in recent targeted Israeli strikes. Lebanese media reports on Wednesday evening indicated additional Israeli strikes near the border following the communication device explosions. Since the start of the conflict, Hezbollah has reported a total of 477 fatalities. Israeli estimates suggest that the official death toll reported by Hezbollah is significantly lower than the reality, with likely dozens more killed. The elite Radwan force is believed to have suffered substantial losses, including senior command members, over the course of the war and in the past two days’ explosions. At least 450 have been wounded in the walkie-talkie explosions, adding to over 3,000 Hezbollah fighters injured in the pager blasts. Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah is expected to deliver his first public address since the explosions Thursday afternoon. The 37 Hezbollah members who have been named since Tuesday are as follows: Yousef Madi Alwa, born 1986, from Bekaa; Hassan Ahmed Mohammed, born 1992, from Habushit in Akkar; Najib Abdul-Hussein Alaa Al-Din, born 1991, from Majdal Selm, South Lebanon; Hassan Mohammad Yassin, born 1986, from Majdal Selm; Hussein Ali Alaa Al-Din, born 1989, from Majdal Selim; Hussein Ahmad Mentesh, born 1994, from Kfar Sir, South Lebanon; Mohammed Zakaria Abbas, born 1986, from Jiyyeh, Mount Lebanon; Abbas Bilal Mon'em, born 1996, from Sohmor, West Bekaa; Mohammed Mahdi Ali Ammar, born 1985, from Dahieh, Beirut; Hussein Ayoub Faqih, born 1988, from Burj Shemali, South Lebanon; Abbas Fadl Yassin, born 1993, from Zuqaq Al-Blat, Beirut; Mahdi Abbas Samhat, born 1995, from Al-Tayri, South Lebanon; Ali Muhammad Shalabi, born 1993, from Kfar Melki, South Lebanon; Ali Muhammad Tarhini, born 2001, from Ebba, South Lebanon; Ibrahim Abdul Karim Zain al-Din, born 1995, from Safad El Battikh, South Lebanon; Abdel Moneim Jamal Abdel Moneim, born 2008, from Aitroun, living in Kawthariyat al-Raz, South Lebanon; Fadl Abbas Bazzi, born 1991, from Bint Jbeil, South Lebanon; Mohammad Hussein Al-Arab, born 1979, from Flaoueh, Bekaa; Hafez Hussein Ali Melhem, born 1976, from Qabrikha, South Lebanon; Ali Hassani Zuaitar, born 1999, from Baalbek, Bekaa; Ahmad Ali Lamaa', born 1982, from Aadchit, South Lebanon; Ali Fawaz Al-Hajj Hassan, born 1991, from Shaath, Bekaa; Jawad Yasser Abu Khalil, born 2005, from Kawthariyat al-Raz, South Lebanon; Mohammed Hassan Kourani, born 1982, from Yater, South Lebanon; Ali Ahmad Haidar, born 1986, from Kfar Dan, Bekaa; Muhammad Ali Alama, born 1983, from Adloun, South Lebanon; Ali Hussein Hammoud, born 1991, from Toulin, South Lebanon; Abbas Hassan Saif Al-Din, born 1987, from Halbata, Bekaa; Hassan Adel Jaber, born 1970, from Bani Hayyan, South Lebanon; Salim Abbas Shehadi, born 1974, from Maaroub, South Lebanon; Ahmed Ali Hassan, born 1998, from Aitroun, South Lebanon; Ali Mohammed Suleiman Samhat, born 1994, from Ainatha, South Lebanon; Nathir Yousef Noun, born 1971, from Bekaa; Fadlallah Shehadeh Msheik, born 1970, from Bekaa; Hussein Ali Amhaz, born 1971, from Bekaa; Bassam Hussein Ftouni, born 1975, from Khirbet Selm, South Lebanon and Jaafar Ahmad al-Hussein, born 1989, from Bekaa. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1y7tff60	2024-09-19T05:41:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/Bkiljctp0/Bkiljctp0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Jihadist attacks in Mali leave over 70 dead, security sources say	Jihadist attacks on Tuesday targeting a gendarmerie school and the military airport in Bamako, the capital of Mali, resulted in over 70 deaths and 200 injuries, marking one of the deadliest tolls in recent years for the security forces. A security source reported 77 dead and 255 injured, while an authenticated official confidential document indicated around 100 deaths, naming 81 victims. The daily newspaper Le Soir de Bamako reported on its front page that 'the funerals of about fifty gendarmerie cadets' would be held this Thursday. The Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (GSIM or JNIM, according to its Arabic acronym), which claimed responsibility for the operation, stated through its communication channels that a few dozen of its fighters had inflicted hundreds of casualties in the opposing camp, including among members of the Russian Wagner group, an ally of the Bamako military regime. The group said its fighters were later killed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjm2uktta	2024-09-19T04:21:30-07:00

Veteran CIA officer who drugged and sexually assaulted dozens of ...	Brian Jeffrey Raymond's victims described being deceived by a man who appeared kind, educated and part of an agency 'that is supposed to protect the world from evil' A longtime CIA officer who drugged, photographed and sexually assaulted more than two dozen women in postings around the world was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison Wednesday after an emotional hearing in which victims described being deceived by a man who appeared kind, educated and part of an agency 'that is supposed to protect the world from evil.' Brian Jeffrey Raymond, with a graying beard and orange prison jumpsuit, sat dejectedly as he heard his punishment for one of the most egregious misconduct cases in the CIA’s history. It was chronicled in his own library of more than 500 images that showed him in some cases straddling and groping his nude, unconscious victims. 'It’s safe to say he’s a sexual predator,' U.S. Senior Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in imposing the full sentence prosecutors had requested. 'You are going to have a period of time to think about this.' Prosecutors say the 48-year-old Raymond’s assaults date to 2006 and tracked his career in Mexico, Peru and other countries, all following a similar pattern: He would lure women he met on Tinder and other dating apps to his government-leased apartment and drug them while serving wine and snacks. Once they were unconscious, he spent hours posing their naked bodies before photographing and assaulting them. He opened their eyelids at times and stuck his fingers in their mouths. One by one, about a dozen of Raymond’s victims who were identified only by numbers in court recounted how the longtime spy upended their lives. Some said they only learned what happened after the FBI showed them the photos of being assaulted while unconscious. 'My body looks like a corpse on his bed,' one victim said of the photos. 'Now I have these nightmares of seeing myself dead.' One described suffering a nervous breakdown. Another spoke of a recurring trance that caused her to run red lights while driving. Many told how their confidence and trust in others had been shattered forever. 'I hope he is haunted by the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life,' said one of the women, who like others stared Raymond down as they walked away from the podium. Reading from a statement, Raymond told the judge that he has spent countless hours contemplating his 'downward spiral.' 'It betrayed everything I stand for and I know no apology will ever be enough,' he said. 'There are no words to describe how sorry I am. That’s not who I am and yet it’s who I became.' Raymond’s sentencing comes amid a reckoning on sexual misconduct at the CIA. The Associated Press reported last week that another veteran CIA officer faces state charges in Virginia for allegedly reaching up a co-worker’s skirt and forcibly kissing her during a drunken party in the office. Still another former CIA employee — an officer trainee — is scheduled to face a jury trial next month on charges he assaulted a woman with a scarf in a stairwell at the agency’s Langley, Virginia, headquarters. That case emboldened some two dozen women to come forward to authorities and Congress with accounts of their own of sexual assaults, unwanted touching and what they contend are the CIA’s efforts to silence them. And yet the full extent of sexual misconduct at the CIA remains a classified secret in the name of national security, including a recent 648-page internal watchdog report that found systemic shortcomings in the agency’s handling of such complaints. 'The classified nature of the activities allowed the agency to hide a lot of things,' said Liza Mundy, author of 'Sisterhood: The Secret History of Women at the CIA.' The male-dominated agency, she said, has long been a refuge for egregious sexual misconduct. 'For decades, men at the top had free rein.' CIA has publicly condemned Raymond’s crimes and implemented sweeping reforms intended to keep women safe, streamline claims and more quickly discipline offenders. 'There is absolutely no excuse for Mr. Raymond’s reprehensible, appalling behavior,' the agency said Wednesday. 'As this case shows, we are committed to engaging with law enforcement.' But a veil of secrecy still surrounds the Raymond case nearly four years after his arrest. Even after Raymond pleaded guilty late last year, prosecutors have tiptoed around the exact nature of his work and declined to disclose a complete list of the countries where he assaulted women. Still, they offered an unbridled account of Raymond’s conduct, describing him as a 'serial offender' whose assaults increased over time and become 'almost frenetic' during his final CIA posting in Mexico City, where he was discovered in 2020 after a naked woman screamed for help from his apartment balcony. U.S. officials scoured Raymond’s electronic devices and began identifying the victims he had listed by name and physical characteristics, all of whom described experiencing some form of memory loss during their time with him. One victim said Raymond seemed like a 'perfect gentleman' when they met in Mexico in 2020, recalling only that they kissed. Unbeknownst to the woman, after she blacked out, he took 35 videos and close-up photos of her breasts and genitals. 'The defendant’s manipulation often resulted in women blaming themselves for losing consciousness, feeling ashamed, and apologizing to the defendant,' prosecutors wrote in a court filing. 'He was more than willing to gaslight the women, often suggesting that the women drank too much and that, despite their instincts to the contrary, nothing had happened.' Raymond, a San Diego native and former White House intern who is fluent in Spanish and Mandarin, ultimately pleaded guilty to four of 25 federal counts including sexual abuse, coercion and transportation of obscene material. As part of his sentence, the judge ordered him to pay $10,000 to each of his 28 victims. Raymond’s attorneys had sought leniency, contending his 'quasi-military' work at the CIA in the years following 9/11 became a breeding ground for the emotional callousness and 'objectification of other people' that enabled his years of preying upon women. 'While he was working tirelessly at his government job, he ignored his own need for help, and over time he began to isolate himself, detach himself from human feelings and become emotionally numb,' defense attorney Howard Katzoff wrote in a court filing. 'He was an invaluable government worker, but it took its toll on him and sent him down a dark path.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by3rxky6r	2024-09-19T04:04:46-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/SyJJQUtpC/SyJJQUtpC_0_250_1194_673_0_small.jpg

Cyberattack sends Israelis rushing for cover with fake emergency ...	IDF clarifies not source of error-riddled messages falsely attributed to Home Front Command; more menacing messages follow, including one allegedly from 'Nasrallah,' reading, 'Say goodbye to your loved ones' Many Israelis received alarming SMS messages on Wednesday night urging them to immediately enter protected areas, in what appears to be a cyberattack impersonating the Home Front Command. The messages, which follow recent pager and walkie-talkie explosions in Lebanon, have been confirmed by the IDF as fraudulent. The messages were sent from 'OREFAlert,' mimicking the Hebrew name for the Home Front Command, Pikud HaOref. The message, riddled with spelling errors, warned: 'Emergency alert, you must immediately enter a protected area,' and included a malicious link. 'I received such a message. It seems fake. Maybe Hezbollah?' one reader wrote in an email to Ynet. Others speculated it could be a phishing attempt, a virus or an Iranian cyberattack. The IDF confirmed that the Home Front Command did not send the messages and said the incident is under investigation. 'There is currently no change in the Home Front Command’s instructions,' the army said. Later that night, additional threatening messages were received by Israelis. One, purportedly from 'SyHaNasrala,' read: 'Say goodbye to your loved ones; but don’t worry. You will embrace them in hell in a few hours.' Another message, written in English from 'NEMA,' read, 'If you want to live, leave. If you want to stay, go to hell,' also including a malicious link. A text message from 'CyberIL' claimed, 'Hackers have full access to your devices. Return to factory settings,' with another link that appeared to be harmful. Authorities are urging the public not to click on any suspicious links and to report any such messages to the relevant authorities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syg1zntp0	2024-09-19T02:33:12-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/BJNm5yFpR/BJNm5yFpR_37_291_835_471_0_small.jpg

Meanwhile, fear gripped Lebanon amid speculation about the next potential target: 'Maybe lighters will explode tomorrow? If you want to light a cigarette, it might blow up in your hands.' The unprecedented attacks, which Hezbollah has attributed to Israel, have sent shockwaves through the Lebanese population. 'People are panicking and trying to get rid of their wireless devices,' reported the Saudi Al Hadath network, citing Iranian sources who noted that the walkie-talkies that exploded on Wednesday are also widely used in Iran. According to the New York Times, the walkie-talkies were larger and heavier than the pagers that exploded the day before, and the resulting fires were more intense due to the greater amount of explosives used. Although there were fewer walkie-talkies in circulation than pagers, Wednesday’s attack left 450 injured and 20 dead, compared to over 2,700 injured and 13 dead on Tuesday. 'I saw something you only see in the movies,' Hussein Awada, 54, told the Times, recalling how a man attempting to clear a path for ambulances in Beirut was gravely injured when the walkie-talkie in his hand exploded. 'It took seconds. It just blew up in his hands. Maybe lighters will explode tomorrow?' The Times editorial board remarked that while the attacks demonstrate 'tactical strength,' the long-term strategy remains unclear. Media outlets around the world have made these attacks their top story: the New York Post headlined 'Beep Beep Boom'; the Daily Mail ran with 'Tech War Spreads'; and CNN’s main headline read, 'Hezbollah Walkie-Talkies Explode Across Lebanon.' Firsthand accounts of the pager explosions were published in the Guardian. 'I didn’t understand what was happening. My first thought was that it was a terrorist attack,' said Ali, a 22-year-old trader. 'People started throwing their phones away in fear, thinking they would explode. I saw a man whose face was cut in half. His eyes were popping out, and blood was everywhere.' Outside a Beirut hospital, a doctor described a patient who lost consciousness from severe burns and lacerations to his face, neck and lips, 'as if he had been hit by a rocket.' The Lebanese daily An-Nahar reported similar scenes in hospitals across the country. Dr. Elias Jarade, a member of parliament and an ophthalmologist at the Beirut Ophthalmology Center, said some of the injured lost their sight, with surgeries lasting up to five hours. Dr. Elias Warak, another ophthalmology expert, described the incident as a 'real nightmare,' noting that most of the injured were in their 20s, suggesting many were Hezbollah operatives. The paper called the attacks a 'tragedy that has shaken the country and the world.' Dr. Elias Warak, an expert in ophthalmology, described the incident as a 'real nightmare' and said that most of the injured were in their 20s, which suggests that the great majority of them are Hezbollah operatives. The newspaper says that the evidence reflects 'the tragedy that shocked the country and the world.' How the attacks in Lebanon played out, step by step: Sunday, 12:50 p.m.: After more than 11 months of fighting in northern Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declares at a Security Cabinet meeting that 'the current situation cannot continue. We need to shift the balance of power on our northern border. We will do everything necessary to ensure the safe return of our residents. I am committed to this, the government is committed to this and we will settle for nothing less.' Monday, 7:30 a.m.: Following a conversation between Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Gallant issues a statement conveying Israel’s firm stance. 'The possibility of an agreement on the north is passing and the direction is clear,' Austin reportedly said. Meanwhile, Netanyahu is considering replacing Gallant with New Hope Party head Gideon Sa’ar. Monday, 6:00 p.m.: Gallant meets with White House special Middle East envoy Amos Hochstein and tells him that 'he only way to bring northern residents back to their homes is through military action. Netanyahu delivered a similar message to Hochstein an hour later: 'Our residents cannot return without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north.' Tuesday, 6:00 a.m.: Nearly a year after hostilities began and tens of thousands of residents were displaced, the Security Cabinet updates the war objectives to include a new goal: the safe return of citizens to their homes in the north. Tuesday, 1:30 p.m.: The Shin Bet announces it had foiled a Hezbollah plot to assassinate a former senior security official using a Claymore anti-personnel mine, which was set to detonate in the coming days. The announcement also revealed that an explosion in Yarkon Park last September, on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, was an attempted Hezbollah attack targeting former IDF chief of staff and defense minister Moshe Ya’alon. Sources suggest that the timing of this announcement was intended to bolster international support for strikes against Hezbollah. Tuesday, 3:30 p.m.: Thousands of pagers held by Hezbollah operatives explode simultaneously in Lebanon and Syria. According to official reports, 12 people were killed and 2,750 injured in Lebanon. An unverified report claimed 19 Iranian Revolutionary Guards were killed and 131 wounded in Syria. Israeli officials believe the actual death toll among Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon is significantly higher, with major damage inflicted on the Radwan force. The pagers, identified as AR-924 models from Taiwanese company Gold Apollo, were traced to Budpest-based BAC Consulting KFT. BAC’s CEO denied involvement, saying they were merely an intermediary, and the company’s website subsequently went offline. Reports suggest the attack was hastily executed by Israel after Hezbollah operatives suspected something was amiss with the pagers. Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.: Hundreds of handheld radios explode across Lebanon, with additional reports of explosions in home solar systems and fingerprint scanners. The Lebanese health ministry updated the death toll to 20, with 450 injured. The walkie-talkies were reportedly delivered to Hezbollah operatives at the same time around April as the pagers. Wednesday, 9:00 p.m.: Prime Minister Netanyahu’s motorcade was seen near Mossad headquarters shortly after he issued a statement saying, 'I have promised to bring our northern residents back home safely, and that is exactly what we will do.' Earlier, Gallant announced from Ramat David Airbase that 'we are at the beginning of a new phase in the war,' while the IDF chief of staff conducted a situation assessment at Northern Command, stating, 'We still have many capabilities.' Thursday: Officials will decide whether to convene the Security Cabinet or limit discussions to security consultations. The Cabinet has reportedly authorized Netanyahu and Gallant to decide on the next steps in Lebanon. Additionally, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah is expected to deliver his first public address since the attacks at 2 p.m. UTC Thursday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzloeta0	2024-09-19T02:12:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/Bydoo2d60/Bydoo2d60_0_120_608_343_0_small.jpg
Israeli businessman indicted in Iranian plot to assassinate Israe...	Suspect in his 70s charged with working with Iranian intelligence; he was smuggled into Iran twice and paid to target senior Israeli officials, including Gallant and Netanyahu; he reportedly sought $1 million advance An Israeli businessman based in Turkey was indicted Thursday on serious security charges, accused of being recruited by Iranian intelligence. Prosecutors say he was smuggled into Iran twice and demanded a $1 million payment in advance for various missions, including plotting to assassinate top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The Shin Bet and Israel Police revealed that the suspect, a Jewish man in his 70s, was arrested in August in a joint anti-terror operation by the Shin Bet and the Israel Police’s Lahav 433 serious crimes unit on suspicion of committing security offenses on behalf of the Iranian regime. The investigation revealed that while living in Turkey, the suspect maintained business and social ties with Turkish and Iranian contacts. In April, through the mediation of two Turkish nationals, identified as Andrey Farouk Aslan and Junayd Aslan, he agreed to meet a wealthy businessman in Iran named Eddy to discuss potential business ventures. The suspect traveled to the Turkish city of Samandağ, near the Syrian border, where he met with two representatives sent by Eddy, who was unable to leave Iran. They held a phone conversation with Eddy during the meeting. According to the investigation, the suspect returned to Turkey in May and met again with Andrey, Junayd and Eddy’s representatives. When it became clear that Eddy still couldn’t leave Iran, the Israeli businessman was smuggled by car across a land border near the city of Van in eastern Turkey into Iran, where he met with Eddy and another individual named Khwaja, who was introduced as an operative for the Iranian security apparatus. Assassinating top officials and threatening collaborators in Israel The suspect met with the group at Eddy's home in Iran, where he was introduced as an Israeli citizen. During the meeting, he was asked to carry out various missions in Israel on behalf of the Iranian regime. These included transferring money or a weapon to a designated location, photographing crowded areas and sending the images to Iranian agents and threatening Israeli citizens working for the regime who had failed to complete their assigned tasks. The suspect asked for time to consider the proposal before agreeing. Last month, the suspect reportedly re-entered Iran, again being smuggled through a border crossing while concealed in a truck. During his stay at Eddy’s house, he met with additional Iranian intelligence officials who asked him to carry out terror attacks in Israel, including potential assassination attempts against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. They also asked him to explore the possibility of assassinating former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, purportedly in retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July—a killing attributed to Israel. The suspect demanded a $1 million advance payment before committing to any action. The following day, he held another meeting with Iranian intelligence officials, during which they reiterated their assassination proposal and discussed other potential activities. These included depositing funds at locations in Israel, identifying Russian and U.S. officials for potential operations against Iranian regime opponents in Europe and the United States and attempting to recruit a Mossad agent as a double agent. The suspect again requested the advance payment, but the Iranian agents refused, saying they would contact him later. Before leaving Iran, he received €5,000 from Eddy and an Iranian intelligence representative for his participation in the meetings. A senior Shin Bet official described the case as a 'grave incident' that highlights Iran’s persistent efforts to recruit Israeli citizens to carry out terrorist activities in Israel. 'Our assessment is that Iranian intelligence will continue its attempts to recruit operatives in Israel for intelligence gathering and terrorism, even reaching out to criminal elements to achieve their goals,' the official said. 'While Israel is at war on multiple fronts, an Israeli citizen traveled to an enemy country twice, met with Iranian intelligence agents and expressed willingness to commit serious acts of terrorism on Israeli soil,' the official added. 'His actions have aided Iran and its intelligence agencies in their campaign against Israel.' 'We are only human' Prosecutors expressed concern over what might have happened if the defendant had received the requested advance payment. During the investigation, the Israeli businessman reportedly said, 'I don’t know what I would have done if they had given me $1 million; we are only human.' In its request to remand the defendant until the end of the proceedings, the prosecution noted that during his meetings with Iranian agents, after he informed them that assassinating high-level officials was impractical due to their security measures, additional terrorist and espionage operations were discussed, including the possibility of assassinating Bennett or certain mayors. According to the indictment, the defendant confessed to the Shin Bet to the charges against him. 'His testimony is coherent, detailed and accurately reflects the nature, background, circumstances and execution of the alleged offenses, with precise chronological and geographical data,' the prosecution said. The confession was given over the course of 14 Shin Bet interrogations and four additional police interrogations, the indictment noted. 'Throughout these investigations, he revealed more details about his actions and consistently stood by his confession, enriching it with further facts and information,' the indictment said. 'We have just received the indictment and the request for detention until the end of the proceedings, We have not yet reviewed the investigation material, so it is difficult to address the specifics of the case at this stage,' the defendant’s attorney, Eyal Bessraglick, said. 'It is important to note that this is a person who has significantly assisted Israel’s security services and whose children serve in the security forces. He made a lapse in judgment in the context of his business dealings. It is notable that the indictment does not include other charges. My client has cooperated fully with the authorities and continues to do so.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcwrhy6r	2024-09-19T01:19:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/SkpjdrKT0/SkpjdrKT0_0_8_853_481_0_small.jpg
German FM: 'Warned all parties against escalation in Middle East'	Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced that 'we have warned all parties against an escalation in the Middle East,' following explosions of Hezbollah operatives' radios in Lebanon. She added: 'For months we and our partners have been holding discussions and working to promote stability in the region.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ykplkta	2024-09-19T00:50:52-07:00	
After explosive pager attacks, Hezbollah missile strike injures 8...	Wounded taken to northern hospitals for treatment; IDF responds with artillery fire aimed at sources of attack; Hezbollah, which had vowed retaliation for mysterious explosions in Lebanon, claims responsibility for missile launch Eight people were injured Thursday morning when an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon struck the Upper Galilee. The wounded were evacuated to hospitals in northern Israel, with one person listed in serious condition, one in moderate condition and the others sustaining minor injuries. The IDF responded with artillery fire targeting the sources of the attack. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the missile strike. The incident occurred amid rising tensions following a series of mysterious explosions in Lebanon over the past two days, which have been attributed to Israel and have resulted in thousands of casualties, including Hezbollah operatives. In response to these attacks, Hezbollah has threatened retaliation. Overnight, Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck Hezbollah military sites in several southern Lebanese towns, including Chihine, Taybeh, Blida, Meiss al-Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela, according to the IDF. Additionally, aircraft targeted a Hezbollah weapons depot in Khiam. According to a New York Times report, Israeli intelligence identified an opportunity to act against Hezbollah following a speech by the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in February. In his remarks, Nasrallah warned his followers about the dangers of using mobile phones, urging them to replace them with pagers. 'The phone in your hands, in the hands of your wife and children, is the agent,' Nasrallah said. 'Bury it, put it in an iron box and lock it away.' The report noted that Nasrallah’s directive to expand the use of pagers ultimately backfired seven months later, leading to the devastating explosions. Even before Nasrallah’s speech, Israeli intelligence had begun implementing a plan to establish a fake international pager company. According to three intelligence sources, the Hungarian pager company that manufactured the devices that exploded earlier this week was set up by Israel. At least two other companies were also created to disguise the fact that the pagers were produced by Israeli intelligence officers. Budapest-based BAC Consulting KFT provided legitimate pager services to other clients, manufacturing devices without explosives. However, the pagers intended for Hezbollah operatives were produced separately, with PETN explosives concealed inside their batteries. These devices were shipped to Lebanon starting in 2022, though initially in small quantities. After Nasrallah’s speech, production ramped up quickly. In addition to banning the use of cellphones during Hezbollah meetings, he also ordered that sensitive information should never be transmitted via mobile phones, according to intelligence officials who spoke to the Times. Hezbollah officers were required to carry pagers at all times, and in the event of war, pagers were to be used to direct fighters. American intelligence officials said that over the summer, thousands of pagers were shipped to Lebanon and distributed among Hezbollah officers and their allies. While Hezbollah viewed them as a 'defensive' tool, Israeli intelligence saw them as 'buttons' that could be pressed at any moment. That moment appeared to arrive earlier this week. Meanwhile, as U.S. officials continue to push for a diplomatic solution to prevent further escalation, Ibrahim al-Amin, editor of Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper, published an editorial titled 'The War of Annihilation, Lebanese Edition — Israel Wants to Eliminate Hezbollah.' He wrote that Israel seems to be preparing for a new phase of conflict with Hezbollah, targeting the group’s human and military capabilities, making talk of an all-out war increasingly realistic. 'If the enemy has decided to carry out operations against more than 10,000 people, military personnel and civilians, in command centers, outposts or homes, then it has decided that we are in a no-holds-barred war,' al-Amin concluded. 'Ironclad' American support Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday following the explosions in Lebanon, which have been attributed to Israel by foreign media. The Pentagon said that the U.S. was not involved in the operations and that Israel had provided information about the incidents through intelligence channels. According to the Pentagon, Gallant and Austin 'reviewed regional security developments' during their call. Austin reiterated the United States’ 'ironclad' support for Israel in the face of threats from Iran, Hezbollah and Tehran’s regional allies. Austin emphasized the U.S. commitment to deterring Israel’s adversaries and efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region. He also underscored Washington’s preference for a cease-fire agreement in Gaza that would secure the return of hostages and a 'lasting diplomatic solution to the Israel-Lebanon border conflict that would allow civilians on both sides to return to their homes.' Iran also responded to the explosions in Lebanon, which injured its ambassador to the country, Mojtaba Amani. Tehran said that it 'reserves the right under international law to take necessary measures to respond to the attack on its delegation.' Additionally, Iran called on UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council to 'condemn Israel’s terrorist act and heinous crime against the Iranian delegation in Lebanon and Lebanese sovereignty.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjltkufpa	2024-09-19T00:37:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/SyW3ph0060/SyW3ph0060_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US says Iran emailed stolen Trump campaign material to Biden camp	Intelligence agencies say malicious cyber activity 'latest example of Iran's multi-pronged approach to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process' Iranian hackers sent emails containing stolen material from Republican former President Donald Trump's campaign to people involved in Democratic President Joe Biden's then re-election campaign, part of an alleged broader effort by Tehran to influence the U.S. election, U.S. agencies said on Wednesday. 'Furthermore, Iranian malicious cyber actors have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump's campaign to U.S. media organizations,' the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. 'This malicious cyber activity is the latest example of Iran's multi-pronged approach ... to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process,' the agencies said. They added that there is currently no information indicating those recipients replied. They did not provide further details on the nature of the stolen material. In August, the United States accused Iran of launching cyber operations against the campaigns of both U.S. presidential candidates and targeting the American public with influence operations aimed at fanning political discord. Iran has denied interfering in U.S. affairs. On Wednesday, its permanent mission to the United Nations in New York said the latest U.S. allegations were 'fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible.' It added: 'Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election.' Malicious cyber actors sent unsolicited emails to individuals in Biden's campaign in late June and early July that contained a text excerpt from stolen material from the Republican presidential candidate's campaign, the agencies said. Biden dropped out of the presidential race on July 21 and was replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate. Polls show Trump and Harris are in a tight race. In a statement, the Trump campaign said Harris and Biden should disclose whether they used the hacked material 'to hurt' Trump. The former president later said in a rally on Wednesday night that Iran hacked into his campaign to help Democrats, calling it foreign election interference. 'We're not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign,' a Harris campaign spokesperson said after the statement by U.S. agencies. 'A few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt.' Tehran also says Washington has interfered in its affairs over decades ranging from a 1953 coup of a prime minister to the 2020 killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1jc9vkt0	2024-09-18T22:55:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/28/S1om80oIC/S1om80oIC_0_0_1310_738_0_small.jpg

First female soldier to die in Gaza is one of many war heroines	Female courage seen in current war: Major E. rescued hostages and crashed on the Philadelphi Corridor; Staff Sergeant Agam Naim was killed in Rafah and Sergeant Gaia Tzubari was shot while treating wounded soldiers in Shijaiyah Paramedic Staff Sergeant Agam Naim, who fell in Rafah on Tuesday, was the first female soldier to be killed in this current war since the IDF began its incursion into Gaza. For the past six months, she served in the Gaza Strip alongside the 52nd Battalion's Armored Corps, and was due to begin her leave soon. Like her, dozens of female paramedics risk their lives in the war to save the lives of others, and so do a myriad of other women in countless roles. The female medical soldiers like Naim take a crucial part in the fighting. They evacuate the wounded and provide medical treatment under fire, standing side by side with the male soldiers even in tragic events. Sergeant Gaia Tzubari, the first female soldier to be seriously injured since the IDF entered Gaza, who also lit a beacon on the last Independence Day, served as a paramedic in Gaza. She gave medical treatment to soldiers who were hit by an anti-tank missile in Shijaiyah and was shot: 'Even if I had known this would happen, I would have gone in again,' she said. 'We are being prepared for exactly this moment: treating the wounded under fire. If there is a wounded person, you go to help him, even though it's scary and your heart is pounding. Your mind is on autopilot and you run without thinking twice,' she added. On October 7, women fought and worked to save lives. Lt. Col. Yarden Shukrun, commander of the Shahar Battalion in the Rescue and Training Division, left her home in Ofakim on that Saturday morning and fought the terrorists. In an interview with Ynet, she said: 'We woke up from the sirens. I hugged my children tightly in the bomb shelter, and received an initial update about terrorists at the Home Front Command base. I took my weapon and a soldier from the battalion who lives next to us, and we ran to the base.' She added that the two joined the forces that fought the terrorists who were entrenched in the base, and after they were all eliminated, she joined other female officers from the battalion under her command. They returned to Ofakim, where they rescued residents who were besieged in their homes. 'For 72 hours we rescued people. Some of them are actually my neighbors. We made a heroic effort as a battalion together with cadets from the 1st Brigade. I was bursting with pride,' she said. Shukrun was the first female battalion commander to participate in combat, and thus actually made history. 'I don't know what will happen to the female combat soldier status in Israel the day after the war, I don't think about it either. I want to be the best rescue soldier there is. If we stick to the task, there seems to be no gap. I never felt like there was something I was told 'you can't do' only because I'm a woman. We can also operate deep in Lebanon if they have to,' she said. 'A great privilege to take part in combat' Lt. Col. Or Ben Yehuda, commander of the mixed male and female Caracal Battalion, fought on the morning of October 7 against dozens of terrorists who occupied the Sufa outpost. At Ynet's annual women's conference, held about six months ago, she said: 'Every day I feel like a winner when I see female soldiers push boundaries. People don't believe me that they load the shells by themselves and activate the system. I say to both my men and women, we had a great privilege to take part in the fighting.' The Iron Swords War has proven to be a turning point for women in the IDF, especially for female combat soldiers. From the War of Independence in 1948 until this past year, they were not given the opportunity to take such a significant part in fighting in enemy territory. Along with the achievements of female soldiers, there are also fallen heroines who died protecting Israel and its people: the female reconnaissance soldiers who warned of the upcoming attack and those who were killed in their base on October 7; the female Armored Corps soldiers who repelled terrorists in the Eshkol Region during the massacre; the late Captain Nimri who was killed on base while protecting her soldiers in Nahal Oz; and Major E. who rescued hostages in Gaza and was injured in last week's helicopter crash in the Philadelphi Corridor. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjtml2oar	2024-09-18T21:55:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/Hkpa8iOT0/Hkpa8iOT0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Hamas releases psychological terror video, threatening more suici...	Hamas posts video of its suicide bomber who blew himself up in Tel Aviv in August, and says that the IDF's continued operation in the West Bank against Palestinian terrorist insurgence 'will double the bill of revenge', as fear of escalation during holidays grows Hamas released an unusual video on Wednesday evening that presented clips from attacks in Israel in the early 2000s and the reading of the will of Jafar Muna, the terrorist who carried out the attack in Tel Aviv at the end of August. 'Every day that passes, when in the background there is aggression against our people in Gaza, will double the bill of revenge. The only thing in exchange will be blood,' he said. The attack in Tel Aviv, in which a bystander was moderately injured, has not yet been classified as a suicide bombing. However, in the psychological terror video released on Wednesday, the terrorist was recorded saying 'I am the fighter from the Al-Qassem Battalion, the living martyr with the help of Allah, Jafar Muna. You (Israel) have lit a fire that will not be extinguished until we remove you from our land with the help of Allah, we have prepared attacks for you. The fire you lit is going to burn you, your settlers, and your army.' At the time, Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed joint responsibility for the attack, but the defense establishment investigated whether there was another party that sent the terrorist. In a statement issued a day after the explosion, the commander of the Israel Police Tel Aviv District said: 'This is not a person who is in our systems or appears in our databases, and the explosive was probably created in the West Bank. It is estimated that the terrorist was supposed to arrive at a certain place, and probably noticed the synagogue. He decided to stop for a moment to prime the explosive, but apparently clicked on something else and activated it.' Since the outbreak of the war, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been trying to set the West Bank ablaze and, together with Iran, he is pouring a lot of money and weapons into the region. So far, Hamas has not succeeded in dragging the Palestinians into a conflict with Israel and succeeded in creating wide-scale riots and clashes with IDF forces. The Shin Bet already noticed the trend of explosive device attacks, which mostly originate in the West Bank, and warned the phenomenon is gaining traction thanks to the dual-use of materials such as fertilizer. Suicide attacks, which haven't been used in years, will be an escalation in the war against terrorism. They require recruitment, infrastructure and preparation, raising concerns that Israel is headed to a third intifada. At the beginning of this month, the defense establishment estimated that although the situation is not hte same as it was in 2002, Israel fears the return of suicide bombings in the heart of Israel, especially before the holidays. Following increased alerts, the Central Command launched its latest operation in the West Bank, focusing on the refugee camps in northern Samaria, Jenin, Tulkarm, Nur al-Shams, and other areas. So far, about 70 terrorists have been killed during the operation, and dozens have been arrested. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzpr60060	2024-09-18T21:35:39-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/08/22/SJ3rdLNoC/SJ3rdLNoC_0_63_590_333_0_small.jpg

DM Gallant speaks with US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin	Against the backdrop of the explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon, Defense Minister Yoav Galant spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Pentagon said overnight between Wednesday and Thursday, adding that the two 'reviewed regional security developments'. According to the Pentagon statement, Austin expressed to Gallant the U.S.'s 'unwavering' support for Israel in the face of threats from Iran, Hezbollah and Tehran's other regional partners. Austin also emphasized the commitment of the U.S. to deter Israel's enemies and to continue efforts to reduce tensions throughout the region. He also emphasized that the U.S. prefers to reach a cease-fire agreement in Gaza that would return the hostages, as well as 'a lasting diplomatic solution to the conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border that would allow citizens from both sides to return to their homes.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skf11fxf6r	2024-09-18T21:04:23-07:00	
Hezbollah hides numbers killed in attacks, Radwan force loses muc...	Lebanon reports 26 killed over two days of pager and walkie talkie explosions, but estimates are that the pager attack alone killed dozens of Hezbollah members and maybe more, while elite Radwan force commanders were decimated According to the official updates from Lebanon, 12 people were killed when thousands of pagers exploded on Tuesday and 20 in the walkie-talkie blasts on Wednesday, but in Israel officials believe that the announced dead and injured from the pager explosions is significantly lower than reality. It is estimated that there are many dozens of dead, if not more. Significant damage was inflicted on Hezbollah's special operation forces unit Radwan force, which lost large parts of its command structure. At least 450 were injured in the explosion of the hand-held walkie talkie radios throughout Lebanon, and these join the more than 3,000 Hezbollah operatives who were injured by the pager blasts. Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah is expected to give a speech on Thursday, in his first public remarks since the series of explosions in Lebanon. U.S. officials publicly expressed anger at not receiving an update on the operation to blow up the pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon that could lead to war while conducting diplomatic efforts for a settlement. But three sources familiar with the matter told CNN that Israeli officials had informed the United States of the intention to carry out an operation in Lebanon - including in the conversation this week between Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and his counterpart Lloyd Austin - but did not provide additional details about that operation. 'The fact that no details were given about the operation meant that the United States was left in the dark until the reports of the explosions shortly after,' a source said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on his way from Washington to Cairo when the stunned American diplomats watched live on their television screens on the plane the news from Lebanon of the operation that was reportedly a joint operation by the Mossad and the IDF. At the press conference in Egypt, Blinken said that the United States 'did not know and was not involved in these incidents.' Another U.S. source said that the Americans also sent a similar message to Iran, asking Tehran not to lead an escalation. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon was injured in the explosion of one of the pagers. According to the Lebanese MTV network, he was transferred from Beirut to Tehran to complete treatment in Iran. On the same plane were about 90 other wounded people who were flown to Iran to receive treatment, along with their families. The White House also said its officials were not involved in the explosions. 'We believe that there is a diplomatic way to solve the Lebanon issue. It is too early to know how the radio explosions will affect the cease-fire deal,' according to the White House, which stressed that 'it is still too early to know what effect the events will have on the high level of tension between Israel and Hezbollah at the border.' Sources privy to the details said that if Israel is indeed behind the series of explosions, it is beginning to realize the goal of returning the residents of the north to their homes. A source said that 'It is clear that this is not how a military campaign with Lebanon will look and it will require an exchange of rockets and missiles from both sides, but Israel - if it is the one that acted - has already had an effect' though it may not avert war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj00fvautc	2024-09-18T15:01:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/ryik9XPpR/ryik9XPpR_0_347_2500_1407_0_small.jpg

Donald Trump says he will 'probably' meet Zelensky next week	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would 'probably' meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will be in the U.S. next week to address a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Russia's war in his country. 'Probably, yes,' Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about whether he will meet the Ukrainian leader. Trump did not provide further details. Zelensky said in August he wanted to present a peace plan to Biden, Harris and Trump. While Trump and Zelensky talked over the phone in July, they have not talked in person since Trump's 2017-2021 term. Trump has consistently described U.S. aid to its eastern European ally as a waste of money and has declined to say he wants Ukraine to win.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj9t9pdtc	2024-09-18T14:48:42-07:00	
Shin Bet tried to legitimize pager attack by disclosing planned H...	Shin Bet discloses Hezbollah's attempt on former Israeli security official hours before pager explosions; UN condemns the attack but doesn't identify a culprit; Israel neither confirms not denies attack Less than two hours before the pagers exploded across Lebanon, the Shin Bet allowed the publication of a report that it had thwarted a Hezbollah attack against former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon in Yarkon Park in September 2023. 'This was supposed to give international legitimacy in the face of the accusations,' sources said. Even after more than 11 months of fighting in the north and launching thousands of rockets and hundreds of drones, Israel needed international legitimacy to allegedly carry out what is attributed to it in Lebanon. Thousands of Hezbollah operatives were injured and some were killed in two days of communication device explosions. Less than two hours before the pagers exploded in Lebanon and Syria on Tuesday afternoon, the Shin Bet disclosed that Hezbollah planned to assassinate former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon with an IED in Yarkon Park in Tel Aviv in September 2023. The Shin Bet lifted the gag order to supposedly justify retaliation against the terror organization and its affiliates. Since Hezbollah escalated its aggression, Israel has bolstered security around officials, embassies abroad and national symbols. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk called the pager explosion attack a violation of human rights and called for those responsible to be prosecuted. Petra De Sutter, the deputy prime minister of Belgium, condemned Israel and said: 'I strongly condemn the massive terror attack in Lebanon and Syria, which injured thousands of people. A brutal escalation of violence. Silence is not an option. An international investigation is called for. The bloodshed must end.' Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association(EJA), attacked her and said that calling the pager operation a terrorist attack is upside down and that she has completely lost her moral compass. The possibility of expanding the campaign in the north is reflected in a series of senior officials' throughout this week. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the cabinet meeting that 'the existing situation in the north cannot continue. This requires a change in the balance of power on our northern border. We will do everything necessary to return our residents safely to their homes. I am committed to this, the government is committed to this and we will not settle for anything less.' On Monday, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that a possible settlement in the north was fleeting, while Netanyahu was discussing Gallant's replacement with former Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar. On the same day, Netanyahu met with Amos Hochstein, the American envoy for Lebanon and emphasized that it will be impossible to return our residents home without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north. The following night, almost a year after the fighting began which led to the mass evacuation of tens of thousands of residents, the government added a new goal to the war: the safe return of the citizens to their homes in the north. On the next day, Hezbollah's pagers began exploding in Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjtpzs0060	2024-09-18T14:10:35-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/H1z5QWPT0/H1z5QWPT0_0_561_1279_720_0_small.jpg
Pager manufacturer BAC goes dark after Lebanon explosions, CEO de...	BAC, registered in Hungary’s corporate registry in 2022, presents itself as a consultancy firm, and the woman listed as its CEO claims she’s merely a 'broker'; the listed company address points to a private residence, and the website – filled with generic images and vague project descriptions – has since been taken down The Taiwanese company Gold Apollo claims that BAC, the firm allegedly responsible for manufacturing the pagers that exploded in Lebanon on Tuesday, has gone underground. Attempts to contact BAC's offices were unsuccessful, and the one time phone contact was made, the company representative declined to comment and immediately hung up. Shortly afterward, BAC's official website went offline. However, Cristiana Arcidiacono-Barsony, listed on the site as BAC’s CEO, denied any involvement in the affair during a call with an Italian news outlet. 'I don’t make pagers. I’m just a broker. I think you’ve got the wrong person,' she said, before cutting the call short. The address listed on BAC's website led to what appeared to be a private residence in Budapest. On Wednesday, a simple A4 paper sign appeared on the door, listing companies operating in the building, including BAC Consulting. According to Hungarian reports, BAC was registered in 2022, and its 49-year-old CEO has a background in physics, with degrees from prestigious London institutions. She also worked with the European Union, UNESCO, and the UN’s education arm. While BAC's website notes its involvement in telecommunications, there is no mention of specific devices or pagers. BAC's name surfaced after Gold Apollo President Hsu Ching-Kuang held a press conference to distance his company from the explosions. 'This product is not ours,' Hsu told reporters at the company's headquarters in New Taipei City, explaining that the AR-924 pagers were manufactured and sold by BAC. 'We only provide the brand name for approval; we have no involvement in the design or production,' Gold Apollo said in a statement. Initially, Hsu refused to disclose BAC’s location, but it later emerged that the company operates out of Budapest, Hungary. He further revealed that the agreement between Gold Apollo and BAC has been in place for three years, and that BAC was responsible for manufacturing the pagers that exploded. When pressed for additional details, Hsu declined to provide the terms of the agreement with BAC, but hinted at past payment issues, stating, 'The payments were very strange,' and noting that they had been routed through the Middle East. BAC's website, which features generic images and text, describes Bressoni-Arcidiacono as an expert in consultancy services across several fields, including environmental, development, and international relations. However, there is little detail on the company's specific projects or clients. The site claims the European Union is a client, though the attached descriptions are vague, consisting of general marketing language. Another project refers to BAC’s involvement in developing technology and a 'business bridge' in Asia, but again, without specifics or named clients. A European delegation is also listed as a client, but the project page is similarly sparse, filled with clichéd management and marketing slogans. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk00of300ar	2024-09-18T13:59:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/rkqVQ11da0/rkqVQ11da0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Wolt messenger delivers baby instead of pizza	Ilan Buaron was on his way to deliver a pizza in Ramat Gan when he got a message from MDA about a women in the middle of giving birth in her home two blocks away; Buaron, a Magen David Adom volunteer went to help; The pizza didn't make it, but the baby is safe When Wolt messenger Ilan Buaron, 22, started his shift Tuesday night he had no idea what kind of delivery task would be waiting for him during it.Buaron, who in addition to his work as a Wolt courier has also been volunteering for Magen David Adom in recent years, picked up a delivery of pizza from a restaurant in Ramat Gan at 2:00 a.m., put it in a box and started riding his moped to the address of the order. The delivery should have ended like hundreds of other deliveries he has made in the past, but shortly after Buaron collected the pizza, he received a message on his cellphone from MDA about a woman from Ramat Gan, who was in the middle of giving birth in her home in the city. Buaron quickly realized that the address of the woman who giving birth was two blocks away from him and he did not hesitate: He immediately changed his route and drove, together with the pizza, to the woman's home. Within a few minutes he arrived at the scene and located the woman, surrounded by her husband and mother, in an advanced stage of labor. He began to assist her in giving birth. For Buaron, it was the first time he was in an active labor situation, and he successfully delivered the couple's son. During the event, Buaron also managed to send a message to Wolt's service center and inform them that the pizza he collected would probably not reach its destination. 'I received a notification of an active birth on the way to the delivery address, I stopped here and helped the woman deliver her baby and I'm going to stay here a little longer,' he wrote. And what happened to the pizza? A new pizza was delivered to the hungry customers, and the pizza he carried on his moped was eaten by the ambulance crew that arrived on the scene. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylqdjupc	2024-09-18T12:40:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/S1gTE5OTA/S1gTE5OTA_0_544_772_435_0_small.jpg

Communities bordering West Bank warn they are vulnerable to attac...	Funds to bolster security promised by the government have not been delivered and a local mayor says his residents are at risk as Palestinians breach the partition wall easily, most looking for work; After troops locate a West Bank tunnel being built, fears grow Leaders of a municipal council bordering the partition wall separating the West Bank from Israel warned again on Wednesday of a real security risk to its residents, after the government failed to transfer funds needed to bolster security in the area. The government voted to allocate 100 million shekels to increasing security along the border wall, but the funds have not been delivered. 'I'm certain that a minute after a terror attack here, the money will make its way,' Ilan Sadeh, head of the Menashe Regional Council said. 'Why can't the government live up to its commitments before an attack?' Since the Hamas massacre in the south on October 7, residents bordering the West Bank have warned that they could fall victim to a similar attack. Communities have come under fire from West Bank terrorists who have been shooting into their homes and, in some cases, trying to launch rockets targeting their communities. Menachem Greenberg, head of security for the council, said it would take no more than seconds to reach homes of Israelis once the border is breached. Palestinians regularly climb over the border wall into Israel, to find work, mostly undisturbed by security forces. 'It is a matter of decision for anyone coming over the wall, whether to seek work to launch an attack,' he said. Greenberg said more should be done to stop Palestinians from entering Israel illegally. 'We want to see more troops on either side of the border,' he said. Greenberg praised the work of the IDF brigades that have been conducting anti-terrorism raids on West Bank cities bordering Israel but said that was not enough. Troops found a tunnel in the early stages of construction in the West Bank town of Tulkarm last week increasing the concerns of residents on the Israeli side of the fence that terror groups would attempt to infiltrate into their communities. The lessons of October 7 were learned on both sides of the partition wall, Sadeh said, adding that the massacre has changed things and that, although efforts to protect his residents have been made, they were not enough. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjrcge00ac	2024-09-18T12:06:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/11/ryZK8JvkpR/ryZK8JvkpR_39_94_440_248_0_small.jpg

Harrison Hipp, who was wearing a kipa under a hat, was attacked while walking down the street; He landed in the hospital with a concussion and cerebral hemorrhage; 'I’m real messed up... and for what? ... just because I’m Jewish? It’s ridiculous' A Jew man was the victim of a severe attack in Oklahoma by a man who called him a 'dirty Jew.' The victim was taken to the hospital suffering from bruises and a cerebral hemorrhage. The apparent antisemitic incident happened in Norman, Oklahoma when Harrison Hipp and his girlfriend passed by a pizza shop. A stranger approached Hipp and askedif he could try on his cowboy hat for a moment. 'I said, ‘No, this is my hat, you know, sorry,’ and I was polite about it,' Hipp told local media. According to him, at this point the man and his friends became aggressive. 'I take off the hat and yarmulke and I start running and then he chases me and he says, ‘I’m going to get you, you dirty Jew.’ and I’m like panicking at this point because I know I’m going to get jumped,' said Hipp. He added that the attackers stole his hat and kippa and slammed his head against the concrete multiple times. The woman who was with him tried to prevent the attack. 'I start trying to pull the original guy off of him and then I get thrown off of him and then a guy, grabs my arms and is like holding my arms, so I can’t do anything,' said Emily Rodriguez, Hipp’s girlfriend. Hipp said the attackers left him bleeding in the street. According to him, his next memory was when he woke up in the hospital. He now has a long road to recovery, having been diagnosed with a concussion and brain bleed. 'I’m real messed up, I can’t go to work, I can’t function and for what? You know, I don’t know, just because I’m Jewish? It’s ridiculous,' said Hipp. The victim believes that this is a hate crime and that he was attacked because he is Jewish. 'Everybody that attacked me called me a dirty Jew, so I would like them all to be charged with hate crime,' said Hipp. Officers from the Norman Police Department met Hipp at the hospital. The police said that so far no arrests have been made, though a possible suspect has been identified and all facts including allegations of a possible hate crime are part of the ongoing investigation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkll25u6r	2024-09-18T11:46:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/17/HJHplIDpR/HJHplIDpR_0_9_974_549_0_small.jpg

Gallant says 'new phase in war' as Netanyahu vows to return north...	Comments come hours after the explosions of Hezbollah-distributed walkie talkies in Lebanon, which killed at least nine people and injured at least 300 Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that Israel 'is on the verge of a new phase in the war. This is not Hamas — we’re dealing with something different, and we need to prepare accordingly.' At the same time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi discussed the movement of the war to the north. The comments of the three leaders came hours after the explosions of Hezbollah-distributed walkie talkies in Lebanon, which killed at least nine people and injured at least 300, and a day after thousands were injured in the explosion of Hezbollah-distributed pagers. During a visit to the Ramat David Air Force, Gallant addressed the escalating tensions on the northern border with Lebanon. Without directly referencing the recent explosion of beepers and communication devices, he said, 'The center of gravity is moving north. We are diverting forces, resources, and energy toward the north. We are entering a new phase of the war – one that demands courage, determination, and perseverance.' ''We have not forgotten the hostages and we have not forgotten our tasks in the south. This is our duty and we are performing it at the same time. This operation involves all branches, and the mission is clear and simple: to bring the residents of northern communities back to their homes in safety,' Gallant emphasized. He highlighted the IDF's successes, saying, 'When you look at the current situation, the IDF is achieving excellent results, working in tandem with the Shin Bet, Mossad, and all relevant bodies. The outcomes are highly impressive. There is full coordination across the system, and unity in pursuing our goals between the prime minister, the chief of staff, the head of the Shin Bet, the head of Mossad, and myself. Everything is dedicated to one objective: bringing the residents of the north back home.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a short message on Wednesday evening: 'I already said - we will return the residents of the north safely to their homes. And that's exactly what we'll do.' Shortly after his announcement, the prime minister's motorcade was spotted near Mossad headquarte IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Herzi Halevi, held a simultaneous situational assessment in the Northern Command with the members of the General Staff Forum, and confirmed the attack and defense plans for the northern arena. 'We are very determined to create the security conditions that will return the residents to their homes, to the communities, with a high level of security, and we are ready to do all that is required to bring about these things. Throughout the war for almost a year, we have been fighting in Gaza with two main goals, as well as others - dismantling Hamas and returning the hostages. We have achieved a lot, and we still have further forward to go,' he said. 'We still have many capabilities that we have not yet activated. We saw some of these things here, and it seems to me that the readiness is good and we are preparing these plans going forward. The rule is that every time we work on a certain stage, the next two stages are already ready to advance. At each stage, the price for Hezbollah must be high.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1svmcoar	2024-09-18T11:04:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/Hy5O5dOpR/Hy5O5dOpR_0_99_1280_720_0_small.jpg
These are stories of the soldiers killed in Rafah	Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff was doing everything to bring the hostages back; Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri did everything he could to transfer to a combat unit; Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon was wounded by shrapnel, and after two days, he went back to the fight; paramedic Staff Sgt. Agam Naim is the first woman soldier killed in Gaza Since the war began on October 7, 713 IDF soldiers have been during the Gaza operation; four of them –Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff, 23, from Moreshet, Staff Sgt. Agam Naim, 20, from Mishmarot, Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri, 21, from Yoshevia, and Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon, 21, from Elazar – died Tuesday when a building exploded in Rafah in southern Gaza. As part of the 401st Armored Brigade operation, soldiers were conducting searches for weapons in a building in the Tel Sultan neighborhood. For reasons still under investigation, a deadly explosion occurred. A helicopter evacuated the wounded, including five soldiers in serious condition and two others in moderate condition, to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva. Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff was the deputy company commander in the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade. He had taken over the role from Lt. Yaron Eliezer Chitiz, 23, of Ra’anana, who was killed in December during a battle in northern Gaza. Daniel’s father, Shlomo Toaff, an executive at Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, told Army Radio that'Daniel had been in Gaza since day one. He never complained. When we asked, ‘Is everything okay?’ he’d just say, ‘Yes, Dad, everything’s fine.’' 'Pure-hearted children who gave everything for Israel' Shlomo shared how Daniel, an avid mountain biker, had studied at a religious high school in Sde Yaakov and spent two years at the Bnei David pre-military academy before joining the IDF. 'He was supposed to attend a company commander course in three months, and we had hoped we would finally have peace. Well, now we have peace,' Shlomo said, noting that one of his other sons serves in the reserves and his daughter is an intelligence officer. 'We deeply believe in doing everything for the people of Israel, and Daniel gave everything,' Shlomo said. 'Last night, we went to a café, came home, and my wife, Orit, went to her sports class. I stayed home. At 8:30 p.m., there was a knock on the door, and I opened it to see three good people standing there. I knew something had happened.' He recalled videos Daniel had sent of his unit in action, saying: 'If there's anything that gives hope to the people of Israel, it's these incredible children.' Staff Sgt. Agam Naim, a paramedic in the 52nd Battalion of the Iron Tracks Formation (401st Armored Brigade), was the first female soldier killed in the ground offensive in Gaza. Her cousin, Yaron, eulogized her: 'You promised you’d take care of yourself, but you always reminded us that if it wasn’t you, there would be no one to do your job, no one to protect and care for the soldiers. You were my hero, a true hero.' Agam’s aunt, Mariel, added: 'She spent the last six months in Gaza. Her father is a bereaved brother, so he worried even more. She didn’t have to go, but she insisted. She was the most beautiful, joyful, talented person. She volunteered with Magen David Adom, spent a year in service working with post-hospitalized youth. Last weekend, she was sick and stayed home. Her commander told her she didn’t need to return, but she went back to Gaza anyway.' Agam’s mother, Dorit, had written about her daughter’s complex service in recent months, sharing how proud they were when Agam was selected for the paramedic course. 'She finished the course with honors and was immediately attached to the Armored Corps,' Dorit wrote. 'Two days later, she was already in Gaza with the engineering corps. We stopped breathing; our lives changed. I discovered anxiety attacks I hadn’t known before.' In a later post, Dorit described her reaction to hearing of other casualties in the war: 'Agam called me and said, ‘Mom, do you see? It could happen anywhere.’ Yes, it feels like losing control, like being stuck in a tunnel with no end. Just last week, she treated severely wounded soldiers. What kind of child will I get back at the end of this war?' Staff Sgt. Amit Bakri was a combat operative in the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade. His sister, Noa, shared: 'He enlisted in the Military Police as an investigator. But when the war broke out, he couldn’t stay in that role. Despite his medical profile, he did everything he could to transfer to a combat unit. Amit was unstoppable when he set his mind to something.' Noa recalled that, just last week, Amit was home when he was called back to Gaza. 'He’d been injured three weeks ago by an anti-tank missile, but even after being treated at Soroka Medical Center, he returned to his unit immediately. He said, ‘There’s no way my team stays there while I’m here.’ He was all-in for the war.' Amit had spoken to his family after being allowed to use his phone. 'He wasn’t too worried about himself, but he mentioned the anti-tank missile incident was scary.' Noa added, 'He was supposed to come home in two weeks.' Staff Sgt. Dotan Shimon, also a combat operative in the Shaked Battalion of the Givati Brigade, lost his sister Nofar, 17, in a car accident in 2013. His brother Guy, the only surviving son in the family, said: 'Dotan was the most perfect person you could imagine. He had a radiant smile, and was incredibly handsome, with a heart of gold. He was the best brother anyone could ask for.' Guy recounted Dotan’s journey in the IDF, where he had completed a course for commander trainees. 'His company commander wanted him to stay on, so he was assigned as a team leader. He’d been in Gaza for over a month when he was lightly wounded by shrapnel a few weeks ago. But after two days, he went back to the fight.' Guy said the family never considered that Dotan might not come home. 'There was concern, but we had become accustomed to the situation. It wasn’t like the beginning of the war. I believe our parents worried more, but I felt safer. Now, I’m the only son left for my parents.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qnj00utc	2024-09-18T10:46:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/ByKec6vpA/ByKec6vpA_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Officials in Israel informed the U.S. ahead of time of the intention to carry out the operation in Lebanon on Tuesday, in which hundreds of beepers were detonated throughout the country, without providing details of the plan, CNN reported citing three sources familiar with the details. According to them, the Israeli update included a statement from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was sent to US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday morning. The sources added that the U.S. did not know anything about what was being planned until reports of hundreds of explosions began to emerge throughout Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryb7pfoaa	2024-09-18T10:27:13-07:00

Germany has stopped approving war weapons exports to Israel	Germany has put a hold on new exports of weapons of war to Israel while it deals with legal challenges, according to a Reuters analysis of data and a source close to the Economy Ministry. Last year, Germany approved arms exports to Israel worth 326.5 million euros ($363.5 million), including military equipment and war weapons, a 10-fold increase from 2022, according to data from the Economy Ministry, which approves export licenses. However approvals have dropped this year, with only 14.5 million euros' worth granted from January to Aug. 21, according to data provided by the Economy Ministry in response to a parliamentary question. Of this, the 'weapons of war' category accounted for only 32,449 euros. A source close to the ministry cited a senior government official as saying it had stopped work on approving export licenses for arms to Israel pending a resolution of legal cases arguing that such exports from Germany breached humanitarian law. The government has said no weapons of war have been exported under any license issued since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, apart from spares for long-term contracts, the source added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjnrhy006a	2024-09-18T10:23:46-07:00

Jewish US Senator Bernie Sanders bids to halt some weapons sales ...	U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday he would file legislation seeking to block the sale of offensive U.S. weapons to Israel, citing the toll on civilians of Israel's campaign against Hamas. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he intended to file Joint Resolutions of Disapproval next week. The U.S. Arms Export Control Act gives Congress the right to stop a major foreign weapons sale by passing a resolution of disapproval. 'Providing more offensive weapons to continue this disastrous war would violate U.S. and international law,' Sanders said in a statement. President Joe Biden has faced calls from his fellow Democrats throughout Israel's campaign in Gaza to press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to ease the devastating humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave. In his announcement, Sanders noted that the Biden administration last month approved arms sales to Israel totaling more than $20 billion that included systems tied to tens of thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza. He said exporting such weapons would violate human rights provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and Arms Export Control Act.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdgjk006a	2024-09-18T10:18:35-07:00

UN approves proposal for arms embargo on Israel	Palestinian proposal, which calls, among other things, to 'return the Palestinians to their land' and to enforce sanctions on senior Israeli officials, was passed by a large majority in the UN General Assembly, while 43 countries abstained. Ambassador Danon: 'Voting in favor of this resolution adds fuel for further violence' The UN General Assembly on Wednesday evening approved a Palestinian proposal that requires Israel to implement the decisions of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which calls, among other things, for the end of the Israeli presence 'in the Occupied Palestinian Territory' within six months, the withdrawal of the IDF from there, the cessation of 'settlements' and 'the return of the Palestinians to their land.' The proposal also includes a call to countries not to legally recognize Israel's presence 'in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,' in addition to enforcing sanctions on senior Israeli officials, end the transfer of weapons to Israel if it is suspected that they will be used in those territories, and avoiding the establishment of diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. Some 124 countries supported the proposal, 14 opposed and 43 abstained. Along with Israel, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Fiji, Hungary, Malawi, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tonga, Tuvalu and the United States also opposed the proposal. Among those that abstained were Germany, Ukraine, Great Britain, Canada, India and 38 other countries. Greece, Cyprus and France surprised - and disappointed - when they voted in favor of the resolution. The vote means that monitoring and control mechanisms of the UN will be established to implement the decision of the court in The Hague regarding the withdrawal of Israel from the territories. The decision will harm Israel's image in the world and will give fuel to organizations and countries to pass their own resolutions against Israel. The call for an arms embargo and the imposition of sanctions against Israel could work to convince countries to act on this decision and stop arms sales to the country. Greece's ambassador to the UN, Evangelos C.Sekeris, said after the vote that 'Israel has a right to security and self-defense. The current decision does not concern the need to hold direct negotiations on the two-state solution. However, Greece decided to support the vote. This is due to its broad support for international law and the International Court of Justice, which must be defended even if there are differences of opinion. We call for a political process to advance the two-state solution.' A political official said in response that 'Greece and Cyprus have disappointed badly. We will demand clarifications.' The vote of the two countries in support of the proposal came as a surprise, especially since Israel supplies weapons to Greece and Cyprus. British Ambassador Barbara Woodward said that 'Britain abstained from today's proposal. Britain did so because the decision does not provide sufficient clarity to advance the common goal of peace based on a two-state solution to be achieved through negotiations. We are committed to the rule of law and respect the court and call on the countries to unite behind the renewed efforts toward an agreed solution in accordance with international law.' She added that 'Israel needs to end its presence in the territories as quickly as possible and create the conditions for the establishment of a free Palestine alongside a safe and free Israel - while recognizing the security and self-determination needs of each side. The unification of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza must also be brought about according to the 1967 borders We condemn the settlers' violence in the West Bank to pressure Palestinian communities to leave their land, and call on Israel to prosecute those responsible.' Before the vote, the diplomatic community held an event of solidarity with the families of hostages, and the ambassador of South Sudan attacked the ambassador of Norway and representatives of other countries: 'You should be ashamed of yourselves. To sit in front of the families of hostages on the day you vote against Israel at the UN.' He called on the representatives to leave the event and 'Run' to call their prime ministers, 'beg them to change their vote,' he said. 'Each country has a vote, and the world is watching us,' Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the General Assembly on Tuesday. 'Please stand on the right side of history. With international law. With freedom. With peace.' He also called on the UN and the member states to implement their responsibilities under international law. In his speech, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, attacked what he called the hypocrisy and bias of the United Nations against Israel, which since the October 7 massacre passed two resolutions in the General Assembly that ignored Hamas and its responsibility for the events of that day. 'Anyone who supports this circus is a collaborator. Anyone who votes in favor of this proposal fuels further violence. This show is an insult to the victims of the massacre, it is an insult to the hostages,' he said. In his speech, Danon presented a photo of the tunnel where the six murdered hostages were held, showing their blood spilled on the floor: 'Eden, Hirsh, Alex, Carmel Uri and Almog. These are their names. Six innocent Israelis were murdered in cold blood after months of suffering in the tunnels. Imagine how you would feel if it was your child, your partner or your friend. Would you be silent even then? I tell you clearly: Jewish blood is not worthless. The days when Jewish blood was spilled without any response are over.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj11ja00da0	2024-09-18T09:45:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/ryxkrWdda0/ryxkrWdda0_0_421_961_540_0_small.jpg

The pager operation's goal was 'deterrence' of Hezbollah	Security officials postpone music show following pager operation in Lebanon: 'Never in any country have they hit so many terrorists in a minute, deterrence is stronger' Security officials on Wednesday said that 'The strategic purpose was deterrence' - referring to the pager operation in Lebanon, resulting in thousands of wounded Hezbollah operatives, which is attributed to Israel. According to a source, 'Never, and in any country, have so many terrorists been hit in one minute. This is about 4,000 targeted assassinations. If we wanted to kill them, we could, but deterrence is stronger.' According to the sources, 'this is not the last move and there will be more.' and, in fact, on Wednesday afternoon, over 100 people were injured when walkie talkies exploded across Lebanon. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed for offensive operations in the north, and a security source has said he did so despite opposition from the IDF and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's reservations. On Saturday night, Netanyahu convened an emergency discussion due to operational circumstances. Foreign sources reported that Hezbollah began to suspect the beepers and therefore there was an urgent need for execution. The Prime Minister's Office denied reports concerning the recent discussions. At the same time, the IDF instructed the Mateh Asher Regional Council to postpone popular Israeli sinter Hanan Ben Ari's concert that was scheduled for Thursday at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot's amphitheater with an audience of 4,300 people. Following the escalation, President Isaac Herzog hosted Prime Minister Netanyahu for an unusual briefing. Following the pager blasts in Lebanon, the IDF is on high alert. The 98th Division, considered one of the elite IDF units which includes the commando and the paratrooper unit, left the Gaza Strip and went up to the northern border. Their shift may hint at the expansion of war against Hezbollah. Moving the 98th Division to the north and leaving the 162nd Division and the 252nd Division proved that the IDF is shifting its focus from Gaza to Lebanon. Since Tuesday, the Chief of Staff has been conducting a continuous situation assessment concerning what is happening in the north, and so far the IDF has not issued new guidelines. Lebanese residents were shocked by the explosions of the pagers. AFP quoted a man from Dahiyeh in Beirut who said he has never seen a person walking down the street and explode. A Lebanese engineer who lives in the U.S. and is visiting Beirut, said he was not surprised by what happened because 'wars are dirty.' He added that the war of attrition between Israel and Hezbollah would take time. Abu Jawad Hamda, a resident of Beirut, promised that there would be a response from Hezbollah. 'We will respond, we need to teach them a lesson they won't forget because these people won't stop,' he said. Meanwhile, new details regarding the operation are beginning to surface. A Taiwanese company allegedly sold thousands of pagers to the terror organization but deny making any adjustments to the product. The Taiwanese company said that the AR-924 type device is manufactured and sold by a Hungary-based company called BAC. The president of the Taiwanese company, 'Gold Apollo,' noted that there were problems with the company's payments in the past. He said they came through the Middle East. Taiwan's Economy Minister said the pager manufacturer claimed they must have undergone 'adjustments' after they were shipped. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sknikpd6r	2024-09-18T08:56:44-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/SJcRgwupA/SJcRgwupA_1_418_900_507_0_small.jpg

A day after thousands of pagers exploded, hand-held radios used by Hezbollah blow up across Lebanon; The walkie talkies were purchased by Hezbollah around the same time as the pagers A day after the unprecedented operation in which thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon, explosions again are heard in Beirut and in other areas across Lebanon. According to reports from Lebanon, late on Wednesday afternoon hand-held radios or walkie-talkies exploded in several areas of Beirut and southern and eastern Lebanon. At least 14 people were killed and 450 were reported injured in the explosions of the devices, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Many of the injured were hit in the stomach and hands. According to the reports, there are casualties in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, and in Saida in southern Lebanon and Baalbeck in eastern Lebanon. The explosions occurred in many houses, as well as in vehicles, according to local reports. A security official told the Reuters news agency that the hand-held radios that exploded Wednesday are different from the pagers that exploded on Tuesday. The radios were purchased by Hezbollah about five months ago, around the same time as the pagers, a security source told Reuters. Al Jazeera reported that the devices that exploded were the icom f82 model. A security official told CNN that according to the initial tests, there were between 15 and 20 explosions in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, and a similar number in southern Lebanon. According to him, the walkie-talkies were less used than the pagers that exploded Tuesday. The Lebanese National News Agency reported that solar energy systems exploded in several houses in southern Lebanon, at the same time as the explosion of the walkie talkies in large areas of the country. According to Sky News in Arabic, the explosions happened at the same time as the funeral of the son of Hezbollah parliament member, Ali Amar, in Dahiyeh; footage taken at the funeral show panic at the moment of the explosion. Sources told the Voice of the Capitol news website, which is affiliated with the Syrian opposition, that 'high frequency waves were sent that caused equipment and broadcasting stations to explode.' The Voice of the Capital also reported that the Syrian regime also called on all security forces and military units to turn off wireless devices, disconnect switchboards and use wired communication. Top Hezbollah official Hashem Safeiddine on Wednesday afternoon said that the group is entering a 'new phase' in the conflict with Israel and that 'punishment is certainly coming.' Also on Wednesday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the pager blasts targeting Hezbollah indicate 'a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon and everything must be done to avoid that escalation.' 'Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation,' he told reporters. Sky News correspondent Alex Crawford was at a funeral in Beirut for four people killed in Tuesday's attacks. She described the 'small sound of something popping' when the explosions occured. 'We came out to try and found out what the sound was and people were running. People were covered in blood,' she says. 'There was blood on a car.' She also reported that Hezbollah operatives collected the devices of funeral-goers and took the batteries out of them >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rymn1wda0	2024-09-18T07:19:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/18/r1ZoKkDupC/r1ZoKkDupC_181_5_935_526_0_small.jpg

Finland's president defends decisions to buy Israeli arms, not re...	Finland's President Alexander Stubb defended his country's decision to buy arms from Israel despite the war in Gaza, saying it had no link to Finland's unwillingness to recognize an independent Palestinian state at the present time. Finland is acquiring a ground based, high altitude, missile defense system called David's Sling from Israel. Helsinki considers the system a high priority for its own defense due to neighboring Russia's ongoing missile attacks on civilian and military targets in Ukraine. Stubb, who took office in March, has defined his and Finland's new foreign policy stance as 'values-based realism,' which he has said was about 'achieving things in the world as it is,' instead of 'promoting only the world how I want to see it.' In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Stubb said the time was not right to recognize a Palestinian state, even though its Nordic neighbors, Sweden, Iceland, and most recently Norway, have done so.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rja2s8opa	2024-09-18T06:31:07-07:00
