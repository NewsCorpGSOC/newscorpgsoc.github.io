Heavy price: 200 terrorists to be released, including convicted m...	Unlike the first phase, which primarily involved the release of women and minors, the second phase will see convicted murderers freed, many of whom will be deported Following the second phase of the hostage deal, and after Hamas released the names of hostages to be set free on Saturday, Israel preparing to free 200 terrorists, including 120 serving life sentences. The names of the prisoners to be released on Saturday have not yet been disclosed, but they are included in the 736 names Israel officially published. Unlike the release on Sunday, which primarily involved women and minors, this time, as mentioned, life-term prisoners convicted of murdering Israelis in terror attacks will also be freed, and many of them will be deported. The Israel Prison Service (IPS) has received the list of prisoners scheduled for release and stated that it is preparing both operationally and logistically for the process. Meanwhile, IPS Chief Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi held another situation assessment.

Upon arrival, they will be identified by Red Cross representatives and wait until the hostages arrive on Israeli soil. According to the IPS, once approval is given by the relevant political authorities, the prisoners will be transported by the Red Cross from Ofer prison to release points in the West Bank, and by Nakhshon and Metzada units, the IPS elite units, to the Kerem Shalom crossing point. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjvbkfw00kl	2025-01-24T22:38:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/S16wU55P1x/S16wU55P1x_0_28_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Hamas airs 'war film' showcasing leadership and October 7 plannin...	In a bid to assert dominance in Gaza, Al Jazeera airs report featuring footage of slain Hamas leaders, interview with Gaza Brigade Commander and leaked 'operational document' allegedly issued 2 days before October 7 attack In a bid to assert its dominance in Gaza after over 15 months of war, Hamas released new footage and interviews over the weekend, aired as part of Al Jazeera’s investigative program The Tip of the Iceberg. The broadcast featured images of slain Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, alongside a previously unseen interview with Gaza City Brigade Commander Az al-Din Haddad. The footage included what Hamas claimed to be Deif in a command room prior to October 7, saying, 'We can change history,' though his face remained obscured. Sinwar was also purportedly shown in Rafah on the day of the attack, disguised and armed. The program ended with a still labeled 'top secret,' showing Deif’s image—hinting he might still be alive despite Israeli claims of his elimination. A document reportedly authored by Deif, labeled the 'Operational Plan for October 7,' detailed attack logistics, including the specific launch time: 6:30 a.m. The broadcast also highlighted surveillance of Israeli border zones and footage of Hamas operatives inside an IDF Namer armored vehicle. Haddad, in an interview, claimed that Israel would 'have no choice but to yield to our demands' during negotiations, which include halting the war, withdrawing from Gaza, releasing Palestinian prisoners, lifting the blockade and rebuilding the enclave. He alleged that Hamas strategically misled Israel by feigning compliance with perceived easing measures while keeping the timing of their assault restricted to a select few.

Eyal Eshel, whose daughter Roni fell at Nahal Oz during the October 7 attacks, posted the so-called operational document and condemned Israeli leadership for failing to act on apparent warning signs. 'This note, part typed, part handwritten, circulated in more than half of Gaza,' he wrote. 'How is it that Hamas knew everything about us, yet our leadership and intelligence knew nothing?' Eshel recalled his last conversation with his daughter before the attack: 'She told me, ‘Dad, they know everything about us.’ I put my hand on her shoulder and said we have a strong army; nothing will happen. Three days later, everything exploded, and Roni was gone.' He directly criticized Israeli officials, including IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and other top commanders, for what he described as catastrophic failures. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy002bzg00yx	2025-01-24T22:36:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/24/HkAnBK11Okg/HkAnBK11Okg_218_0_869_489_0_small.jpg

Hamas has recruited over 10,000 new operatives since October 7, r...	Despite losing 20,000 fighters during the war, terror group recruits 10,000-15,000 new operatives, most of whom lack military training; US and Israeli officials emphasize ongoing challenges posed by Hamas while noting limitations in weaponry and operational capabilities Hamas has recruited between 10,000 and 15,000 new operatives since the outbreak of the war on October 7, 2023, Reuters reported on Friday, citing two congressional sources briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies in recent weeks. According to Israeli intelligence estimates, Hamas has lost approximately 20,000 of its fighters during the war. Despite the organization's extensive recruitment efforts, the congressional sources noted that most recruits are young and lack sufficient military training, serving primarily in basic security roles. 'Although numbers are high, this is not a force with significant operational capabilities,' one of the sources told Reuters. On Sunday, a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas came into effect after 15 months of fighting that began with the deadly surprise attack by the terrorist organization. Since the cease-fire began, Hamas has started rebuilding basic services in Gaza and implementing new security measures, while also dealing with the widespread destruction caused during the war. 'Every time Israel completes its military operations and withdraws, Hamas terrorists manage to regroup—because there is nothing to fill the void,' former U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month. According to him, Hamas has managed to recruit nearly as many fighters as it has lost, which could lead to 'persistent insurgency and ongoing warfare.' Last July, Hamas spokesman Abu Ubaida claimed that the organization had succeeded in recruiting 'thousands of new fighters.' Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon responded to Blinken's remarks on Wednesday, saying, 'While Hamas is indeed recruiting young people, without weapons and training infrastructure, they do not pose an immediate threat.' He added, 'Yes, these young people can be incited against Israel, but cannot become effective terrorists because they cannot be equipped with weapons or rockets.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, said in his farewell speech this week that despite the severe blow dealt to Hamas, 'the organization has not been completely destroyed, even though most of its commanders have been killed. IDF will continue its efforts to dismantle its infrastructure.' Collecting accurate data on Hamas remains a significant challenge for intelligence agencies due to the lack of direct access to Gaza and the organization’s dynamic recruitment methods. However, U.S. intelligence estimates indicate that prior to the start of the fighting, Hamas had between 20,000 and 25,000 fighters. Nonetheless, Israel emphasizes that the organization suffers from severe shortages in weaponry and training facilities, which makes it difficult to transform new recruits into 'effective fighters.' Incoming U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said last Sunday, 'Hamas will never govern Gaza. That is completely unacceptable,' adding, 'If Hamas reneges on the hostage deal, the U.S. will support Israel in whatever it needs to do.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1delzguyl	2025-01-24T22:07:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/06/S1eS4ck1Jx/S1eS4ck1Jx_0_0_3000_2067_0_small.jpg

The Palestinian Prisoners' Information Office claimed there is a 'mistake' in several names of terrorists scheduled to be released today as part of the second phase of the deal. 'After reviewing the list of prisoners planned for release today in the first stage of the deal, we found an error in several names. We are monitoring the issue together with the mediators,' they said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkea3wfoyg	2025-01-24T22:04:36-08:00	
Four hostages expected to return in hours	Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev and Liri Albag, 4 of 5 to be transfer from Hamas to Red Cross and then to Israeli custody; parents will reunite with them at border before being taken to hospital Four of the five female IDF observers abducted from Nahal Oz on October 7 are expected to be released Saturday as part of the ongoing hostage exchange deal. The women—Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev and Liri Albag—are anticipated to cross the border from Gaza as early as the early afternoon, unlike the first phase of the exchange. Al Jazeera reported Saturday morning an International Committee of the Red Cross convoy had already departed Gaza for the Kerem Shalom crossing. However, it remains unclear if these vehicles are en route to the designated handover point. An Israeli security official said the military estimates that preparations for the hostages' release in Gaza will begin within hours. The IDF released a statement confirming readiness for the hostages’ return: 'The IDF, led by the Personnel Directorate and the Medical Corps, has completed preparations for the second phase of receiving hostages from Gaza. Initial reception centers have been established to provide medical care and personal support. Afterward, the returning hostages will be transported to hospitals to reunite with their families.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The release is part of the second phase of the hostage exchange deal, following the release earlier this week of Emily Damari, Doron Steinbacher and Romi Gonen. The four are expected to be handed over to the Red Cross before being transferred to Israeli forces. Unlike the previous release, Saturday's transfer may occur as early as midday. At the border reception point, the freed hostages will meet IDF officers, medical personnel, psychologists and mental health professionals. Families of the hostages, including fathers who were not allowed at the previous reception, will greet them at the border. After reuniting with their families, the hostages will be flown to Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva for medical evaluations. Hospitals in Ashkelon and Be’er Sheva are also on standby for urgent cases. The Health Ministry has prepared a protocol for treating returning hostages, which includes physical examinations, psychological care and documentation of their captivity. Priority will be given to female medical staff for examining the returning women. Security concerns remain, with officials wary that Hamas may alter the agreed-upon list of released hostages as part of its psychological warfare tactics. Families of the observers and those of Arbel Yehoud, who was expected but excluded from this phase, have been briefed on this possibility. Public gatherings are planned to mark the hostages' return, including a viewing event at the Hostages' Square starting at 10 a.m. and a solidarity rally at 8 p.m. However, 90 hostages remain captive in Gaza, including Shiri Bibas and her two young children, whose fate remains uncertain. In exchange for the four hostages, Israel will release 200 Palestinian prisoners, including 120 serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. Unlike earlier releases primarily involving women and minors, this group includes high-profile inmates, many of whom will be deported. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skhzpwgdkx	2025-01-24T21:57:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/24/SJVboObukl/SJVboObukl_196_0_2665_1500_0_small.jpg

Operation Good Neighbor: Israel's humanitarian mission during Syr...	In every moment, I knew I could be shot at,' says Lt. Col. (res.) Eyal Dror, head of the Good Neighbor initiative that operated in Syria between 2016 and 2018 in which Israel risked much, saved thousands of Syrians—and gained significantly in return; 'I met with rebel leaders, and they worked for our security,' adds Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, who commanded the Northern Command during the civil war 'We transferred a nine-year-old girl with Type 1 diabetes for treatment in an Israeli hospital back in 2016. One day, I met her and I was talking to her mother waiting for the doctor when the girl asked me, ‘How do you draw an Israeli flag?’ I explained. She asked for a marker and a sheet of paper and started drawing a Star of David. It wasn’t working out for her. She started getting annoyed and disappointed. It took her nine tries. At the top, she wrote ‘Wiam ❤️ Abu Yaakov,’ the name by which the Syrians knew me. This sums up the whole ‘Good Neighbor’ story: A girl from an enemy state, dedicating a drawing to an Israeli officer who saved her life.' This quote is from Lt. Col. (res.) Eyal Dror, who headed the ‘Good Neighbor’ unit during the Syrian civil war. The December 8 overthrow of the Assad regime was indeed a stunning and unexpected ending to the 13-year civil Syria. Israel, however, had prepared for this moment years ago. The popular uprising against Assad kicked off in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring sweeping Middle East dictatorships. By 2015, Assad had lost control of most of his country’s territory, and it looked like his days were numbered. Israel prepared accordingly. With the help of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, Assad restored most of the territory he’d lost, pushing the rebels back to north-west Syria’s Idlib region, from where last month’s large-scale attack was launched. More than half a million people have been killed in this war and millions of Syrians became refugees either in their own country or beyond its borders. Israel, for its part, quickly adapted to the new situation unfolding - with a border on whose other side some 250,000 people live every day in a combined state of chaos, danger, distress and uncertainty. But alongside the new threats posed were also new opportunities, including the potential for rare cooperation with the civilians across the border. The aim of 'Operation Influence,' as it was branded by Lt. Col. (res.) Dror was to provide humanitarian aid in the recipients’ darkest hour - and also to try to make them realize the extent to which their perception of Israel was wrong. 'Cynics may say we’ve exploited their suffering,' says Dror, 'but we’ve chosen to invest resources and risk lives for humanitarian aid. I knew they may well shoot me at any moment.' It was named 'Operation Good Neighbor.' As the civil war waned, however Assad, who had regained control of Syria, was looking like the great victor. Now, with his fall, our Syrian neighbor’s identity is, once again, changing before our very eyes. Although there’s no war going on in Syria right now, the nature of the emerging regime and the extent to which rebel leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa (Abu Mohammad al-Julani) has truly changed is, as yet, uncertain. Meanwhile, as Israel has taken control of the Syrian Hermon and the buffer zone, it would appear that the seeds planted back during Operation Good Neighbor, are still apparent on the ground. Syrians generally avoid confrontation with Israeli forces and have even been collaborating with them and requesting to be annexed to Israel. According to foreign reports, Israel’s relationship with the Syrians was conducted along two axes, civilian and intelligence. 'I took on the role of commanding the Northern Command four months into the Syrian revolt,' says Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, now Chairman of The Democrats party. 'What was guiding us then, was the fear that the rebels would invade Israel.' Only a month earlier, in May 2011, dozens of Syrians broke across into the Golan and were heading to Majdal Shams. In this incident, at least four Syrians were killed and dozens were wounded. 'Our approach was that of fear and concern of further incursions,' says Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Golan. 'So, we also reinforced the barrier, but I understood that cooperating with the rebels would better protect us. In this situation of ever-increasing chaos, the most important thing was having good relations with rebel militias east of our shared border. Militias who collaborated with us, whose operational activities we can trust so that we can be present in the field. They essentially acted in the interests of Israel’s security.' These militia didn’t act out of Zionist sentiment. 'Through a series of meetings held along the fence at my initiative, we understood that what they most needed was medical care,' says Golan. 'They did have further needs - mainly food, clothing, and fuel for winter - but medical care was the most urgent. I tried advancing the idea with then Chief of Staff Benny Gant and was told no. In the end, we found ourselves facing a clear choice: One night, they simply placed six stretchers at the border. Then, 36th Division Commander Tamir Hayman called asking me what to do. I decided, not exactly with the Chief of Staff’s approval, to bring them in and send them to Ziv Hospital, and that’s what we did.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Contrary to Golan’s version of events, Gantz’s people say that Chief of Staff Gantz approved evacuating the wounded. 'At first, due to opposition from the political echelon, Gantz personally approved admitting selected wounded - until he managed to convince the political echelon on the matter' they stated. 'Later, in consultations headed by then Chief Medical Officer Brig. Gen. Itzik Kreis, Chief of Staff Gantz approved setting up a field hospital. The ‘Good Neighbor’ unit was later set up.' Either way, what started as a pilot program, Golan says, resulted in the IDF treating more than 4,000 wounded Syrians over five years. The vast majority were wounded in the civil war, some extremely seriously. A smaller number showed up with other problems, such as childbirth complications. This is how the Syrians took off. According to reports, this was accompanied by intensive intelligence gathering, primarily by the Military Intelligence Directorate’s HUMINT Unit 504, responsible for obtaining human intelligence. Golan says that collaboration with the rebels has been very fruitful. 'It helped us understand that not everyone is Al-Nusra Front and Al Qaeda. They’re not all Muslim extremists to be feared, but rather quite the opposite' he says. 'Most of the groups along the borders were Syrian Sunnis simply wanting to be rid of the violent and coercive Alawite rule and were so fighting the regime. In these years, they cleansed the border of all extremist elements, be it Hezbollah trying to infiltrate or extremist Sunni Islamic elements. They guarded the border alongside, not instead of, Israel, and did an impressive job. As the Assad regime suffered blow after blow, Israel needed to cooperate with the new forces in Syria to continue its intelligence activities. As mentioned, the rebels provided Israel with a great deal of intelligence regarding what was going on inside Syria, in chaos at the time. These good relations led to Israel expanding its humanitarian aid, until it became somewhat of an institution with the 2016 founding of the Good Neighbor unit. With its establishment, Lt. Col. (res.) Dror was appointed to command the unit, effectively creating a separation between the humanitarian aid and intelligence axes. Dror 'borrowed' the new position from the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) responsible for activities with the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This was due to the nature of the COGAT role, which involved contact with civilians, international organizations, government ministries, etc. 'At the end of the day, dealing with the civilian world is a profession unto itself,' says Dror. You need to be able to map out needs and adapt to each international organization according to its capabilities and requirements. So, someone from COGAT was chosen to head this unit and the job was precisely mapping the Syrian side, replete with its pressures and constraints.' When you think about it, the IDF set up an HMO of sorts for the civilians across the border. Dror tells us that an Israeli doctor, along with his Syrian counterparts, professionally broke down what’s known as 'Medical Care.' So, children with chronic illnesses were taken to the hospital and a ‘doctors’ visit’ of sorts was set up for specialist treatment. As it soon became apparent that women giving birth needed help, they were hooked up with international organizations that helped set up a special maternity hospital in the area. As family medicine was noticeably lacking, the IDF brought in an international organization to set up a field clinic where Dror says at least 7,000 Syrians were treated on an ongoing basis, and remote contact was made. 'It’s not direct Israeli-Syrian contact, CT,' he says, 'but for the Syrians, it’s clear who’s bringing them the treatment.' The project treating children with chronic illnesses was the broadest. Approximately 1,400 children aged one month through to 15 were treated, usually accompanied by a family member. 'At the end of the day, these are simple people,' says Dror. 'Some are illiterate. Their lives are hard even without the war. In rural Quneitra, the standard of living is very low.' He says that lifesaving treatment was provided to 4,500 men, women,n and children, alongside the 7,000 treated in the field hospital, and that 1,000 babies were born in the field hospital. Alon (assumed name) was a young Military Police soldier stationed for a month in 2017 at Nahariya’s Galilee Medical Center to protect the Syrian wounded coming into Israel. 'I was still on the course. I’d been in the army for around three months' he says. 'We were posted to an underground hospital ward. We were in civilian clothing with guns, and our job wasn’t necessarily to safeguard the environment from them but rather to protect them. We were instructed to protect them from the Druse, as some of them had fought in Syria and there was fear of retaliation. One day, as I was accompanying an injured patient in a wheelchair to surgery, suddenly a huge Druse guy started talking to him in Arabic. Before we understood what was going on, he pounced on him, knocked him off the wheelchair onto the floor, and started beating and punching him. We managed to separate them.' He says that most of the wounded were men. 'They explained to us that some of them would simply show up at the Israeli border and lie down, and IDF soldiers would bring them i,n,' he says. 'Many were severely wounded. Some had lost limbs. Others had been blinded. They all declared that they’d been fighting against the Assad regime, but we had no way of knowing whether that was true and we occasionally interrogated them.' He says that most of the wounded were nice and tried talking to the soldiers, but that the language barrier made this hard. 'Some did learn a little Hebrew and they mainly said thankyou and expressed their appreciation for our saving them,' he says. 'They got the kind of medical treatment they could only dream of. Some, when told they’d recovered and could be released, burst into tears, not wanting to go back, begging to stay.' 'I had 12-hour shifts,' he says. 'I’d sit at an empty nurses’ station and would accompany patients from place to place. It could be for treatment, tests, surgery, or going out for a cigarette. Think about it, I was following 20 Syrians going out of the hospital for a smoke.' What do you most remember about that month? 'I was once called in to receive wounded. We waited in the parking lot for the ambulance, and a couple from Syria who had stepped on a landmine showed up. The husband had improvised a makeshift wooden leg brace with screws for himself. His wife was heavily pregnant and had lost her legs, but she gave birth to a healthy baby in Israel. I’ve always wondered what happened to her and what they did with the baby. I wonder whether they received Israeli citizenship.' With Assad’s renewed control of the area in 2018, the Good Neighbor unit’s activity came to an end, despite the situation in border communities not improving much. 'The Assad regime has restored these communities over the past six years,' says Lt. Col. Dror. True, an Al-Rafid villager can make it to Damascus, which he couldn’t during the war, but this doesn’t mean he’ll receive services there. The area is poor and weak and the people there remember Good Neighbor and how they received help from Israel. We also have indications for this. We see it today. The big question is: What about the future? The situation today is fundamentally different as there’s no war there.' Golan is certain that activity back then affords Israel credit points in Syria even today. 'On an irregular basis, once every two or three weeks, I’d meet rebel leaders and visit the Syrian wounded in hospitals,' says Golan. 'Many told us, ‘We thought you were the devil, and here, you’re saving our lives’. When we add up all the activity, the contribution to Israel’s state security is enormous' Golan says, 'Another important thing, somewhat eroded in the current war, is that we did the human, ethical right thing. We saved lives. We provided humanitarian aid. When you work correctly, at the end of the day, it also strengthens Israel’s security – and certainly Israel’s standing in international and regional arenas.' Dror says that there are '1,001 scenarios' for the future of relations. 'There’s no doubt in my mind that we’ve sown seeds that will yield fruit. I said this before Assad fell. I’m hearing this from Syrians overseas. The discourse regarding Israel is optimistic and they remember. The Lt. Col. (res.) tells us that, while addressing a synagogue in Canada, he suddenly heard shouting in Arabic. He turned around and saw a man running toward him, who later turned out to be Syrian. 'He said that he had to co, me,' says Dror. 'He’d fled Syrian in 2015 and said that he’d read about what we were doing on the border, and just couldn’t come to hug me. He was a Muslim in a Jewish synagogue in Canada, simply sitting there listening to my talk. This was the moment I said to myself, ‘We’ve done something here’.' There was another instance in 2018 when Syria downed an Israeli F-16, and a Syrian contacted Dror to ask him how the soldier who had been hit was doing. 'Good Neighbor still affects a 17-year-old boy for whom we implanted a prosthetic limb seven years ago', says the reservist officer. 'That’s not the kind of thing you forget so quickly.' Nonetheless, he says that more patience is needed. 'I don’t know whether it prevented firing at our forces. There are lots more questions. Both sides, have to decide. The infrastructure exists. So does the professional know-how. Right now, it’s not a war border. In the past, we operated at night time, under heavy security, knowing that ISIS could attack us. This is the scenario we envisaged. The situation’s different now. I’m sure that if both we and they decide to move forward, we could do it on a gentle learning curve, and get it up and running in a short time.' Syria, however, is not the only sector in which Israel has been operating on the civilian front. On October 7, the illusion of success in the Gaza Strip was shattered. This, inevitably also raised questions about the situation in other sectors, including Syria, as well as a great deal of skepticism as to whether reaching out a helping hand would, indeed, bring about stability and security. 'The facts are that humanitarian efforts that also served for the defense were successful during Good Neighbor,' says Dror. 'I can’t say what lies ahead. We all learned a lesson in modesty and humility on October 7.' That said, Dror says that Gaza and the West Bank are fundamentally different from Syria and, although we mustn’t just stick with what we know, this is a tool that’s right to utilize. 'Whenever I’d go down to the border during Good Neighbor and, in every interaction with the population, I’d factor in that the day may come that some guy might take advantage of the situation and turn it on me,' he says. 'There’s no contradiction between the two and you have to manage by the situation assessment, consideration thinking critically, constantly checking yourself.' Golan says, 'In real life, nothing’s certain. It’s not like if the economic situation improves, you suddenly get more security. At the end of the day, it all rests on a tapestry of relationships, interests, trust, and worldviews. The overwhelming majority of people with whom we came into contact weren’t Islamic extremists, so the conversation was more on a personal and security level and less ideological. We yielded enormous security gains and, and the end of the day, ethically, we did the right thing. Amid what’s going on now, in Gaza and in general, that’s important to remember.' 'In the Gaza Strip too, not all Gazans are radical Hamasniks and nor are all Palestinians in the West Bank,k,' says Golan, as mentioned, now The Democrats party leader. 'I think we need to be very wary of these dark areas. We should learn from our history and not implement an all-encompassing approach to Syria the Palestinians or any foreign entity on our borders. At the end of the day, these approaches don’t bring about security for Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjovnkb00ye	2025-01-24T12:34:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/ryii11vtHyl/ryii11vtHyl_0_0_1280_719_0_small.jpg

Agam Berger's IDF lookout friends to be released, but she remains...	Agam Berger is one of five female soldiers abducted from the Nahal Oz military post, and despite her friends being released, she remains in captivity and likely be part of the third phase of the agreement While her friends are set to be released on Saturday, Agam Berger, 20, will remain in captivity in Gaza and is expected to be part of the next phase of the agreement, likely next Saturday. Agam is one of five female soldiers abducted from the Nahal Oz military post who remain in Hamas captivity. Four of them are slated for release in the second phase of the deal. Two other soldiers from the post—Noa Marciano, who was killed at Shifa Hospital and later recovered by the IDF, and Ori Megidish, who was rescued alive—highlight the grave toll of the October 7 terror attack. Agam’s path to becoming a lookout soldier was unexpected. 'She wanted to be a basic training commander,' said her mother, Meirav. 'But she decided that if this was her role, she’d do her best.' Initially stationed at Kerem Shalom, Agam was reassigned to Nahal Oz just a week before her training course ended. 'She asked me, ‘Mom, is this a good thing? Why now?’ I told her some things are beyond our control,' Meirav recounted. At the end of the course, Meirav sent her daughter a voice message wishing her well, ending with, 'Wherever you are, this is your purpose.' Two days later, as those words still resonated, Agam was abducted. On the morning of October 7, as Hamas attacked, Agam left her phone in her room while fleeing to a shelter. She borrowed a phone from her friend Shirat Yam Amar who was killed on October 7, to call her sister Bar. In her first call, Agam reassured her parents she was safe in a secure area.

Agam had secretly passed her family's phone number along, enabling the call. 'She told us she was hungry, prayed often, refused to light a fire on Shabbat, and stayed calm despite everything.' Meirav added that the family’s faith deepened this past year, inspired by Agam’s steadfastness in captivity. 'Many have heard of her incredible bravery—how she refused to violate Shabbat, even in captivity.

They are to be freed after 476 days in Hamas captivity. The four female IDF lookouts were kidnapped from the Nahal Oz military post during the October 7 terror attack. Hamas sent the list of hostages to be released around 4:00 p.m., but it differed from the one Israel expected, with Arbel Yehud not included, despite the fact that civilians were supposed to be released before the female soldiers. Hours later, an Israeli official announced that Israel had decided to accept the list to avoid derailing the agreement. However, Israel made it clear to the mediators that this constituted a violation of the agreement, which was unacceptable. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel is preparing for the possibility of an earlier release than the originally scheduled 4:00 p.m. time, possibly as early as the morning or between 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. The message from Qatar to the Israeli negotiating team indicated that Hamas faced a technical difficulty in reaching Arbel Yehud, who was supposed to be released on Saturday but was not on the list. According to a Gaza-based source close to Hamas, Yehud is held by a Salafi group. In light of this, Israel decided not to break off the deal and to agree to this phase, despite concerns that Hamas might not be telling the full truth. 'We learned from the previous deal not to break the agreement, especially since the violation wasn't major,' the source said. Despite accepting Hamas's list, Israel remains concerned that the list may change as part of Hamas's psychological warfare tactics. Families of the female soldiers on the list have been informed of this possibility, and updates have also been provided to the families of IDF lookout Agam Berger and Arbel Yehud. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r18q00vzoye	2025-01-24T10:27:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/24/HkvOhXZOJe/HkvOhXZOJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Cant defeat terror with defense': West Bank OP commanders say	Deputy commander of elite Duvdevan unit shares about fighting the terror cell in Jenin, how it recruits teens, and how prisoner release celebrations will be prevented Since the signing of the hostage deal and the cease-fire agreements in both the north and south, the West Bank has emerged as the IDF’s primary front. This shift is no coincidence, as just two days ago, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi visited the area to oversee the Central Command's operations. Since the launch of Operation 'Iron Wall' on Tuesday, Israeli forces have eliminated over ten terrorists and arrested some 20 suspects. One of the busiest units in the West Bank is the elite Duvdevan unit, which has also been involved in operations in Gaza and Lebanon. Speaking with Maj. M., the unit’s deputy commander, sheds light on the current mission in Jenin and the elimination of two key perpetrators of a deadly terror attack in Funduq. 'We had been tracking this cell for a long time, waiting for the right moment to close the circle,' Maj. M. said. 'It was a bold and highly complex operation in a challenging area. We waited for them to make a mistake, and then we acted decisively.' How long did it take to neutralize them? 'The entire operation, from start to finish, lasted just a couple of minutes. The final stages took no more than one or two minutes. The area was filled with explosive devices, so precision was key. When other methods failed to force them out, we advanced engineering tools to collapse the house. We began by calling out to them, deploying drones, and allowing family members to persuade them to surrender. When all else failed, we escalated.' Did they exit through the main entrance? 'Yes, they barricaded themselves inside the house, and we determined that advancing heavy engineering equipment was the only remaining option. During the operation, a soldier behind an armored vehicle was lightly injured. The gunfight lasted mere seconds, and the terrorists were killed just outside their doorway. They realized they were walking into an ambush. Their bodies were found with magazines for both short and long-range weapons. I’m glad we settled the score with two of the three leaders of this cell. It sends a clear message.' How Iron Wall differs from previous operations Maj. M. described the operation as more organized and informed than similar missions earlier in the year. 'The ‘Summer Camps’ operation in August was one of the first major missions since the Second Intifada’s Operation Defensive Shield. Commanders and soldiers are now more experienced. While the tactics remain largely the same, we execute them with greater precision and coordination.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: So far, the IDF has neutralized three terrorists in the operation. Maj. M. highlighted that the primary motivation for the terrorists is ideology, making it a long-term challenge. 'As long as their beliefs don’t change, this will continue. However, these operations show civilians that supporting terrorism doesn’t pay off. We’ve seen residents cursing the terrorists, similar to how Gazans have turned against Hamas.' With an estimated 100-200 armed terrorists operating in the region, how do they continue to survive? 'Our mission is like mowing the grass. After ‘Summer Camps,’ we saw that when you’re not present and active, the threat slowly regrows. These operations are crucial to prevent another October 7 scenario in the West Bank. Offensive action is the only way to defeat terrorism—you can’t win by playing defense.' Maj. M. addressed criticism surrounding an operation where the unit used a vehicle marked as an ambulance. 'While I can’t comment on the specifics, I can say our unit commander is one of the most capable and ethical leaders I’ve worked with. Every decision is made after careful consideration and thorough analysis.' A Broader perspective from the field Lt. Col. (Res.) A., who oversees operations in the Menashe Brigade, provided additional context on the evolving situation in Jenin. He noted the challenges posed by terrorist rehabilitation during a 21-day absence by Israeli forces, allowing the terrorists to regroup. 'Terrorist cells in Jenin have seen a significant escalation. We’ve located hundreds of explosive devices and weapons, and over 400 terrorists have been apprehended. While the state may view this as a secondary front, for us, it’s a central battleground.' The commander highlighted a shift in terrorist tactics, including support from surrounding villages and refugee camps. However, he emphasized the ongoing IDF efforts to systematically dismantle the terrorist infrastructure, saying, 'We are operating with a larger force, going house-to-house, not just based on intelligence. While we may not reach every house, the goal is to thoroughly sweep the camp and surrounding areas.' Regarding the upcoming release of prisoners, including Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent figure in Jenin, Lt. Col. A. expressed confidence in maintaining control. 'They won’t be able to celebrate in the streets of Jenin. There might be gatherings in private homes, but there will be no public processions or displays of arms because they know we’re here, and they fear us.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by7gh8zoye	2025-01-24T09:19:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/24/ryNkL5fb00ke/ryNkL5fb00ke_1_167_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu submitted a request to the Jerusalem District Court where he is on criminal trial for corruption, to reduce the number of days he would testify next week, after he was allowed to delay his testimony for his operation and recovery. His defense attorney Amid Haddad wrote in the request that Netanyahu's physicians said he must avoid any activity lasting for more than three hours without rest in the coming week and also avoid traveling a long distance, sitting or standing for extended periods.

Israel says delaying withdrawal from Lebanon amid violations of d...	In statement PMO says Lebanon army not deployed to the south to enforce Hezbollah's removal north of the Litani, says gradual withdrawal of troops in cooperation with U.S. The Prime Minister's office (PMO) announced Friday that the IDF withdrawal from Lebanon would be delayed. The military was supposed to complete its pullout of troops by Sunday, 60 days after the cease-fire agreement in the war with Hezbollah was signed. 'The agreement was articulated with the understanding that the process may take more than 60 days,' the PMO said. 'It is conditioned on the Lebanese army is deployed in South and effectively enforcing the terms of the deal, as Hezbollah withdraws its forces north of the Litani River. According to the PMO, since that has not yet been fully enforced by Lebanon, Israel will continue a gradual l its commitments under the deal, and while Hezbollah forces would be pushed out of the region, north of the LItani River. Since that has not been fully enforced by Lebanon, the gradual withdrawal of troops would continue in full cooperation with the United states.' The cabinet decided on Thursday that it would react forcefully to Hezbollah's violation of the cease-fire agreement, but the ministers do not believe this would put the deal at risk. Although the Shi'ite terror group accused Israel of violations and speakers for the group warned that the war could resume, it only once used military force in response to the IDF's fire. Leaders in the opposition also urged a delay in the IDF withdrawal, citing the danger to the residents of the north if the cease-fire terms are not fully implemented. 'The IDF must continue and increase its actions in the face of even the slightest Hezbollah violation of the deal. We must insist that the resident of the north would never again be under threat,' former defense minister Benny Gantz said.

Paula White on Trump’s Second Term: ‘God Is Moving in America’	The reverend said, 'there is a return and a hunger for God. God is moving in America, and He is not done with America' Rev. Paula White has been reappointed to serve as U.S. President Donald Trump’s lead faith advisor, overseeing a portfolio that manages all matters of faith in the White House. On Tuesday night, she delivered a keynote address at the Israel Allies Caucus kickoff event held in the Capitol. Speaking to an audience of more than 100 people, White emphasized that faith is not only the single most unifying element among diverse individuals, but it also provides value at scale to societies. She added that faith-based diplomacy is essential for the future of America, Israel, and the world. White also highlighted the importance of politics, saying, 'Politics matter because policy matters, and policies matter because people matter.' 'There is such great hope, because God is moving,' White told ILTV News. 'We saw that. I tell people, when you watch mainstream media, as President Trump says, ‘fake news,’ and you actually see, you're on the ground. We had thousands and thousands of pastors that we went to throughout this country. I went with my husband on tour to Pennsylvania three times, Wisconsin—we were all over grassroots. And you see, there is a return and a hunger for God. God is moving in America, and He is not done with America, and that's exciting.'

Under her leadership, 10,000 faith leaders passed through the White House in just four years—not only to attend events or celebrations but to sit at the table and help the president and his advisors craft policy. Those faith leaders were instrumental in several historic achievements, including moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizing the Golan Heights as sovereign Israeli territory. Now, White told ILTV that the next four years under President Trump’s leadership promise even greater impact. 'As he continues to say—not only the golden era of America, which it is—but it's going to impact the world. We see that with the hostages,' White said. 'We see that from the moment he won as president-elect, now president, even before he’d taken the oath, how much transition and change he began to bring.

Israel awaits Hamas names, information on hostages	Terror group to deliver names of next four women to be freed Saturday and a report on the condition of 26 others; Israel could face cruel dilemas if Hamas returns to psychological terror tactics Hamas is expected on Friday to deliver the names of the four hostages to be released in the afternoon on Saturday, according to terms of the agreement, along with another list detailing the condition of all 26 remaining hostages to be freed in the first phase of the cease-fire deal. Israeli officials believe eight of them are no longer alive. But after the list is revealed, Israel could find that the information provided by the terror group contradicts that of the evaluation of the intelligence agencies and would have to quickly attempt to verify the facts or deduct that Hamas is continuing its psychological terror tactics. If Israel learns that Arbel Yahud, a civilian expected to be among those freedon Saturday is not on the list Israel would again face the need to respond. In the first hostage release in November 2023, Hamas used manipulations, during the pause in the fighting, to avoid releasing mothers and their children and even claimed it was not holding any live women. A senior official told Ynet that the dilemma decision makers faced at the time, was cruel. In addition to the 29-year-old Yahud, Hamas may also release Shiri Bibas, although the terror group claimed in 2023, that she and her two small boys, Kfir and Ariel, were dead. Israel never confirmed that claim. Other names that could be included among the released are Liri Albag, Naama Levi, Agam Berger, Daniel Gilboa and Karina Ariev the IDF soldiers whow were abducted from the Nahal Oz base where they had served as lookouts. The families of hostages said that they are besieged by worry that the hostage exchange agreement would not be fully executed. On Friday, Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod, an IDF soldier was among the abducted warned that continuing the war after the completion of the first phase of the deal, would be a death sentence for the rest of the hostages. 'No one should be left behind,' she said. 'Even now, there are those in the government who are doing everything the can to thwart the second phase of the deal by effecting public perception. We must ensure that that phase too is fulfilled. We will not rest until every last hostage is home.' Ella Ben Ami, who was released in the 2023 exchange and whose father Ohad is expected to be freed in the first phase also called for the full implementation of the deal. 'I am filled with anxiety that the agreement that would bring my father back, may not return all of the hostages,' she said. 'It must not be stopped.

Hamas is trying to rebuild and run Gaza, making peace difficult	The Islamist organization has resumed building rockets in underground tunnels and is financing itself through the selling of humanitarian aid; despite heavy losses since October 7, 2023 the terrorist organization remains extensive in numbers, arms, and commitment to fighting As a new cease-fire takes hold in Gaza, Hamas fighters, who normally dress as civilians during combat, have seized the opportunity to wear their uniforms and parade through the streets in a show of force. The images shared online of Hamas brandishing weapons atop trucks and surrounded by civilian supporters, cheering them on amid the ruins, make clear that despite heavy losses since October 7, 2023and the elimination of Hamas leaders, the terrorist organization remains extensive in numbers, arms, and commitment to fighting. For now, however, they may focus on rebuilding their ability to fight while trying to continue controlling Gaza. While the first phase of the cease-fire deal is still in its early days, many experts are questioning the sustainability of the situation, given the possibility of Hamas remaining entrenched in Gaza, and doubting the possibility of rebuilding the razed area. According to Yoni Ben-Menachem, a senior Middle East analyst for the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, 'Israel dismantled 24 military battalions in the Gaza Strip, killing between 20,000 to 25,000 of Hamas’s military wing operatives' over the last year and almost four months. However, he added, during the last three months, while Israel was also fighting Hezbollah on its northern border, the army 'eased the pressure on Hamas with many troops transferred to southern Lebanon. This shift gave Hamas the opportunity to rebuild, and just last month Hamas recruited 4,000 new terrorists to replenish their ranks using money generated from selling humanitarian aid that enters Gaza,' according to Ben-Menachem. The returning Palestinians are but a 'drop in the bucket' he added, cautioning that 'Hamas is rebuilding, and it’s possible they’ll try to maintain control of Gaza. With the cease-fire, Hamas can do whatever it wants, and it has survived militarily,' Ben-Menachem said. Israeli security estimates suggest that Hamas still has around 25,000 armed terrorists in Gaza, and it is the increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza that is enabling them. 'As of yesterday, 600 trucks carrying aid are entering Gaza daily – a significant increase. Hamas will exploit this aid by selling it and using the money to recruit more terrorists,' added Ben-Menachem. Professor Eyal Zisser, vice-rector of Tel Aviv University and an expert in Middle Eastern studies and security, said that he believes this situation only exists because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government failed to plan a 'day after' strategy for Gaza. 'If Hamas continues to exist, achieving peace will be very difficult. But the real question isn’t whether Hamas will survive – it’s whether there is an alternative to Hamas. Unfortunately, the current Israeli government doesn’t seem interested in planning for the ‘day after,’ and this plays into Hamas’ hands,' he said. For Yohanan Tzoreff, a senior researcher at the Institute of National and Security Studies in Tel Aviv, this cease-fire deal could be very short-lived. 'Israel is currently in the first stage of this agreement, and both sides are committed to continuing negotiations for a second stage. The problem will become very sensitive during the second stage because Hamas is asking for the war to end, while Israel is demanding the dismantling of Hamas’ military power by either leaving Gaza or putting down their weapons,' he said, adding that 'from Israel’s perspective, there is no way weapons can remain in Gaza, especially after October 7.' There are ways to stop or at least delay Hamas’ rebuilding efforts. Zisser underscored the critical role of international cooperation in containing Hamas. 'If Israel and Egypt can coordinate and control the Philadelphi Corridor, preventing smuggling tunnels and weapons transfers, it could significantly delay Hamas’ rebuilding efforts,' he explained. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Other actors potentially involved in building a sustainable 'day after' for Gaza also hold great sway in this process, according to Tzoreff. He noted the potential role of global and regional actors in shaping Gaza’s future, including the United States and Gulf countries. 'The Gulf states and even Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas are unwilling to engage in Gaza’s reconstruction unless Hamas dismantles its military power,' he said. Abbas’ criticism of Hamas has grown louder in recent months. He has already indicated that the PA would not return to Gaza unless Hamas dismantles its military power. Furthermore, in a show of disapproval, he publicly asked whether freeing 1,000 Palestinian prisoners justifies the deaths of over 50,000 people in Gaza, revealing a broader anti-Hamas sentiment within the PA.

Senior UN official curses Netanyahu in social media post: 'F*** h...	UN health envoy Dr. Tlaleng Mofokeng curses at Netanyahu following the delay of the implementation of the Gaza cease-fire against the backdrop of her pro-Hamas agenda South African Dr. Tlalang Mofokeng, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, often uses crude language on social media including profanity, curses and racist slurs. After a series of unbridled statements, this week the senior UN official broke a record when she cursed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a tweet on X: 'F*** him.' Mofokeng's blunt tweet was posted in response to an Israeli statement on Sunday, which reported that Prime Minister Netanyahu had ordered the cease-fire in Gaza to be postponed by a few hours due to Hamas' violations. Mofokeng's ugly tweet was later deleted. Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Office in Geneva, demanded that she be condemned. A day later, when UN Watch Director-General Hillel Neuer called on the UN to take action against her for violating the code of conduct, Mofokeng responded on X with a series of tweets with racist insults, calling Neuer, a Jew, 'human scum' and an 'evil white man.' Neuer's tweet against Mofokeng received 600,000 views. Mofokeng works closely with Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, who has been previously denounced for antisemitism. Beyond her foul language, Mofokeng has previously spoken out in favor of Hamas and against Israel. In various tweets, she claimed that Hamas are not terrorists, and even called for imposing sanctions on Israel and severing all diplomatic ties with it. Mofokeng's use of slurs and profanity is not new. In 2021, she clapped back at a Twitter user who challenged her and in 2024, she wrote rude responses to a commenter. On other occasions, she cursed journalists and critics in particularly blunt language. International organizations, including UN Watch, are now calling on the UN to launch an investigation into Mofokeng for violating the code of conduct that requires its representatives to speak in respectful language and maintain political objectivity. Mofokeng's language and behavior harm the status of the UN and public trust in the organization,' said Neuer. Mofokeng later tried to defend her discourse, saying that she was expressing herself in this way out of personal pain and anger at the human suffering she sees in her role. 'The loss of life and devastation in Gaza is heartbreaking and deeply personal for those of us engaged in human rights work. I am in touch with victims of the violence everyday and grieve deeply for those detained & killed and the destruction of the health infrastructure in Gaza,' tweeted the senior UN official. 'The tone of my communications online and offline are influenced by this pain and grief. In this critical juncture, between heartache and hope, I remain committed to fostering thoughtful and respectful dialogue, particularly on matters as urgent and sensitive as human rights.'

No life, no hope: Gaza prepares for mass return of displaced resi...	In parallel with the second wave of the release of the kidnapped women on Saturday, the IDF will begin withdrawing from the Netzarim Corridor and allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to the northern Gaza Strip; There, destruction and devastation await Taking over the Netzarim Corridor was one of Israel's significant strategic achievements in the war, but as part of the hostage deal with Hamas the IDF is expected to withdraw on Saturday from the western part of the corridor that bisects the Gaza Strip in its center, thereby enabling the mass return of Palestinian refugees to the northern Strip. In Gaza City, tent camps are already being prepared for the refugees who will return to the ruined city, and the desperation there is evident everywhere. 'Life is very difficult – there's no life, no hope,' Wael Jundiya, one of several who set up a tent complex in an open area of ​​the city, surrounded by ruined buildings, told Reuters. He prepared a tent for his children, who are now staying in the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone on the coast in southern Gaza, the area where hundreds of thousands of refugees have gathered in the past year. An now, a large part of them are expected to return to the north. Wael is worried that the conditions in the tent will be too difficult and crowded for his family. 'Is this the tent that we dreamed of? he asks sarcastically. 'Really, is this adequate space?' 'The tent barely fits two people, and I have eight family members. Each of my children has 5, 6, 7 family members. I used to have a five-story house, it was completely lost, and now after being homeless and suffering for a year and a half, I will live in a tent, with neighbors who hear our voices, and my house exposed to them? Is this the life we ​​dreamed of?' he added. He demanded that the reconstruction of the Strip be 'accelerated.' 'This is not a place to live, this is not a place fit for humans.' He estimates that the entire complex he and his friends are currently building will only have room for up to 200 people, but '1.5 million people will return from the south, where will they go?' Another Palestinian woman who spoke to Reuters there, Safa Dado, also expressed great frustration: 'Our families will return from the south to their blessed land in Gaza City, but they will not find their homes, because they were destroyed by the Zionist occupation. They will find tents that were erected to provide the most basic needs.' She added that 'our people will suffer – they have already suffered from the destruction, the bombings and the fear caused by the occupation, and now they will suffer from tragic displacement and tents. The tents will not protect from the cold now or the heat in the summer. This is not a livable situation, but this is what we have now.' An estimated 2.1 million people now live in the Gaza Strip (a decrease of about 160,000 from the figure before the war began), and the vast majority of them were displaced from their homes at the beginning of the war – while those who fled from the north to the south have not been allowed to return until now via the Netzarim Corridor, a route that the IDF has turned into a real territory with permanent outposts over the past few months. Now, according to the agreement, the IDF is required to gradually withdraw from the route. On Saturday, in parallel with the implementation of the second phase of the deal in which four hostage women (one civilian and three female IDF observers) will be released in exchange for dozens of terrorists, the IDF will be required to withdraw from the a-Rashid coastal road east of the Salah a-Din road, and dismantle the military installations in the area. Hamas power and rule: 'We will rebuild every house that is not completely destroyed' This will begin the return of the displaced Palestinians northward via the same road that crosses the Strip along its length near the Gaza coast. The agreement stipulates that there will be no security checks on those walking – but only on vehicles moving north, checks that will be carried out by a private American company that will cooperate with an Egyptian company. The U.S. company will send about 100 armed security personnel, most of whom are Americans and some of whom speak Arabic. The security personnel will be from elite units or former CIA personnel. On the 22nd day of the agreement, the withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor is scheduled to continue and the forces are required to leave the Salah ad-Din Road as well, and dismantle the military installations in this area. In a statement released Thursday by Hamas ahead of the return of the displaced to the north, it emphasized that it will begin on Saturday after the release of the kidnapped women is completed; Israel expects that the civilian Arbel Yehoud will be one of them. In its statement, Hamas emphasized that refugees returning to the north are not allowed to carry weapons, but no one would be surprised if the terrorist organization tried to violate the terms of the agreement and transfer weapons to the north through covert means. Hamas, which has been trying to demonstrate its power and governmental capabilities since the ceasefire began on Sunday , including deploying armed police in various areas of the Gaza Strip, is now also trying to present itself as working to help the refugees, and announced that it will help set up tents for those returning to the north. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters Thursday that the terror organization is in talks with several Arab countries and 'international parties' about helping the refugees return, including providing tents. Abu Zuhri promised that Hamas would immediately begin rebuilding homes that were not completely destroyed. 'We are going to invest all our capabilities to help our people. Municipalities have plans in place to welcome the families returning to the north, including setting up tents for them,' he said. There is not a single house standing: 'The smell of dead bodies in the streets' Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim claimed Thursday that the expected return of the refugees is an expression of Israel's apparent 'failure' in the war, and its attempt, he said, 'to uproot the Palestinian people from their lands.' In an interview with the Palestinian news agency Shehab, he added: 'The steadfastness and courage of the Palestinian people in Gaza have thwarted Israel's plan to uproot the Palestinian people from their lands. The demands of our people are clear, and they are the right to establish an independent state on the liberated lands. No force will destroy our march toward freedom and independence.' Since the cease-fire began, crowds of refugees already in the north have returned to their neighborhoods – and are shocked by the extensive destruction. In Jabaliya, some are now living right in the rubble, trying to warm themselves on freezing nights around bonfires. 'They are talking about a truce, a cease-fire, and the delivery of aid. It has been three days since we came back, and we cannot find water to drink. We cannot find covers to keep our children warm. We depend on bonfires all night. We wish to have some firewood for the bonfire, we use plastic, which causes diseases,' said Mohammed Badr, a father of 10. His wife, Umm Nidal, said she was still in shock at the destruction in Jabaliya. 'There is nothing left, you cannot walk in the streets. Houses collapsed on top of each other. You get lost, you don’t know if this is your home or not,' she said. 'The smell of dead bodies, and the martyrs are in the streets.' At the same time, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, relatively unusual footage was released Thursday of a gunfight between armed men – whose identities are reportedly unclear – around a humanitarian aid truck that had gotten stuck. According to Reuters, the battle lasted about 10 minutes. In the Rafah area, the Hamas government also claimed Thursday that two Palestinians were killed by Israeli tank fire, and the IDF said that the claims were being investigated. As part of the deal, Israel allowed a surge in the volume of humanitarian aid flowing into the Gaza Strip – and although according to the agreement the number is supposed to be 600 trucks a day, on Wednesday, according to reports, 897 trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, as part of its attempts to demonstrate its governing capabilities in the Gaza Strip, and thus claim victory over Israel, which promised to destroy the terrorist organization, Hamas also promises to help secure the aid convoys and prevent their looting. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We want to prevent any kind of security vacuum,' said Ismail al-Thawbata, director of the Hamas government's communications office in the Gaza Strip. He claimed that about 700 Hamas police officers would help protect the aid convoys, and that since the cease-fire began, not a single truck had been looted - in contrast to the numerous cases of looting and robbery by gangs during the war. A UN spokesman confirmed to Reuters that, as of Tuesday, no cases of looting of aid trucks had been reported. Al-Thawbata also claimed that, although Israel has eliminated many Hamas operatives throughout the war, it still employs about 18,000 workers 'who provide services to civilians on a daily basis,' as he put it. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjce6qxokx	2025-01-23T13:40:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/23/rybhzkxuyx/rybhzkxuyx_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Trump to appoint Mideast envoy Witkoff to handle the Iran portfol...	Before reactivating 'maximum pressure' campaign against the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, Trump plans to examine whether he can reach a diplomatic settlement with Iran, the Financial Times reports; Trump: 'It would be nice if the Iranian issue could be resolved, without Israel attacking military facilities on its territory' U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to appoint his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff , as responsible for handling Washington's diplomacy with Iran, the British Financial Times reported on Thursday. Sources familiar with the details claimed that the move indicates that Trump is willing to consider a diplomatic solution before increasing pressure on the Islamic Republic. A former senior Israeli official told the newspaper that 'I don't see the administration using force at the beginning of their term before at least trying to exhaust other means. This does not fit with the approach that war started with Biden and he's going to end them.' Meanwhile, on Thursday Trump said while signing more executive orders that 'it would be nice if the Iranian issue could be resolved, without Israel attacking military facilities on its territory.' Witkoff, who played a crucial role in reaching agreements on the hostage deal and cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, is expected to head the team that will handle the U.S. response to the Iranian nuclear program, as part of Trump's promise to 'stop the wars' in the Middle East, according to the sources. In his first term, Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement with Iran in 2018, imposing severe sanctions on the Islamic Republic, warning that if it fought Washington and worked to obtain nuclear weapons, 'that would be the official end of Iran.' After the November election, during the period between administrations, Trump’s team outlined plans to relaunch the 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran, whether through new sanctions or toughening existing measures. However, Trump and his aides have expressed a desire in early meetings to leave room for avoiding a full-scale confrontation with Iran, and several administration officials have told foreign diplomats and their counterparts that they expect Witkoff to lead efforts to see if a diplomatic settlement can be reached with Iran. However, Witkoff's main focus is expected to continue to be the implementation of the Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal. At the same time as speculation has risen about Witkoff, Trump appointed Morgan Ortagus, State Department spokeswoman in his first term, as Witkoff's deputy. Ortagus previously served in the Middle East and is familiar with the region. U.S. officials say that Trump's approach toward Tehran, and Witkoff's powers, have not yet been clarified, but several of the new president's appointments hold positions that negotiations with Iran should be considered, and have also expressed doubts about attacking its nuclear facilities. Among the new appointments are Michael DiMino, a senior Trump administration official in the Pentagon on Middle East issues, who previously served in the CIA, and who has expressed support for implementing a restrained policy toward Tehran. Elbridge Colby, Trump's nominee for undersecretary of defense for policy, has also warned against any military action against Iran. The two stand against more hawkish elements in the new administration, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said in his Senate confirmation hearing that he would support 'any arrangement that allows us to have safety and stability in the region but one in which we’re clear-eyed.' White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said that 'we have no announcements to share at this time,' when asked about the new administration's approach toward Iran. At the same time, Western sources believe that Iran is in its weakest position in decades, after the destruction of the Hamas terror army in the Gaza Strip and the severe blow that the IDF inflicted on Hezbollah in Lebanon. Added to these is Israel's extensive air attack on Iran, which resulted in the destruction of most of its air defense systems. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Iran, for its part, has also signaled that it is open to negotiations, although analysts estimate that any dialogue with the Islamic Republic will be difficult for it and for Trump. Iran’s vice-president for strategic affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif recently said at the Davos forum that he hopes Trump will be 'more serious, more focused, and more realistic' with Iran. He noted that the sanctions have imposed a heavy economic burden on Iranian citizens and its government, but refused to admit that his country has a hand in the terrorist activities of organizations such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen. 'We have never had 'proxies,'' he claimed. At the same time, the Saudi Al-Hadath TV channel reported that the Iranian foreign minister said that the Islamic Republic is 'ready for negotiations with Washington.' Witkoff's appointment as Iran special envoy has sparked opposition from some of his opponents in Congress and in Washington in general, who worry he will be too quick to drop pressure on Iran in trying to achieve a possible deal. 'He’s already lifting pressure on Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, and in the process abandoning American hostages and endangering Israel,' said a senior Republican Congressional staffer. 'He keeps saying he knows what Trump wants, but he doesn’t understand what Trump believes.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skkt7medje	2025-01-23T11:46:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/11/ry6eo1xv1x/ry6eo1xv1x_1_314_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Palestinian-supporting reporter ambushes IDF general in London	A British pro-Palestinian journalist accosted the IDF Operations Chief, Major General Oded Basiuk, who arrived in London to discuss cease-fire; Meanwhile, anti-Israel Hind Rajab Foundation files another complaint in Central Europe against IDF reservist who served in Gaza A pro-Palestinian journalist in London accosted the head of the IDF Operations Department, Major General Oded Basiuk, at the entrance to a research institute building in the city. 'Are you a war criminal?' Basiuk was asked on Wednesday. He seemed surprised by the encounter, but did not answer and entered the building. Basiuk reportedly was accompanied by Brigadier General Elad Goren, the head of the humanitarian-civilian effort in Gaza, and other officers. The journalist who accosted Basiuk reported that the Israeli delegation arrived in Britain to review the cease-fire efforts with the local army, and to discuss what would happen if it collapsed. 'General Basiuk, what did you discuss at the Ministry of Defense? Are you worried that you will be investigated by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for war crimes?' journalist Alex Morris also asked. After the Israeli delegation entered, Morris tried to follow it into the building and was pushed back by the guard. In a video he posted, he reported that 'I photographed Israeli General Oded Basiuk, who was the head of the operations in Gaza as part of Israel's brutal genocide in the last 15 months in Gaza. He entered the RUSI building in Whitehall, London.' The foundation that 'hunted' soldiers Meanwhile, in recent days, the anti-Israel Hind Rajab Foundation, which is behind a global campaign against IDF soldiers, which is behind an attempted legal battle against IDF soldiers, has filed another complaint in Central Europe against another reservist who served in combat engineering in the Gaza Strip. D., 35, a Tel Aviv resident against whom the complaint was filed, told Ynet 'I think they are focusing on images of combat engineering soldiers because it is easiest to get caught up in this. In engineering work, you see the destruction of houses which are terrorist infrastructures. Every house we have destroyed is a terror house, which we have intelligence for.' The Hind Rajab Foundation, an offshoot of the pro-Palestinian March 30 movement, was established by two Lebanese nationals, Dyab Abou Jahjah and Karim Hassoun, now residing in Belgium. Named after a six-year-old Palestinian girl allegedly killed in Gaza by the IDF on January 29, 2024, the organization claims to focus on bringing justice to Palestinians. D. said that no one in the IDF or the Defense Ministry has contacted him. 'Yesterday, reporters and friends sent me messages and I understood the problem I was in. Six months ago, I saw photos of me that were distributed on antisemitic websites. This is the state forsaking IDF soldiers, ignoring obvious things. It does not make sense that reporters and friends get information before our security agencies,' he said. According to him, 'Another point is the diplomatic problem. If I am arrested abroad, it is true that it will be unpleasant for me, but the entire State of Israel is in trouble. With proper work, this too could have been easily avoided. Again, the State of Israel thinks that if you ignore a problem, it will disappear. It will not disappear. There is a complex issue here that needs to be addressed. What mother would want to send her son to be a combat soldier if she knows that he is exposed to lawsuits? He has no protection. This can hurt you if you are traveling, or if you want to work for an international company. The first thing that will come up about you on the internet is that you took part in genocide.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'On a personal level, I am afraid,' added D. 'I returned to Israel a few days ago. I don't know what would have happened if this had been filed before I returned, I might have been arrested in a foreign country.

UK teenager jailed for minimum of 52 years for 'harrowing' Southp...	A British teenager who killed three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event was jailed for at least 52 years on Thursday, for an attack Prime Minister Keir Starmer called one of the most harrowing moments in Britain's history. Axel Rudakubana, 18, admitted killing the girls and stabbing 10 others last July in the northern English town of Southport, an atrocity that shocked Britain and was followed by days of nationwide rioting. Prosecutor Deanna Heer told Liverpool Crown Court that Rudakubana was obsessed with violence and genocide, and two of his victims suffered such terrible injuries they were 'difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature.' Judge Julian Goose said Rudakubana should serve a minimum of 52 years. He said he could not impose a full life sentence as Rudakubana was 17 when the attack took place but he was unlikely ever to be released.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rygqt11x00je	2025-01-23T09:42:10-08:00

Just days after American tycoon Elon Musk caused a stir when he made a gesture reminiscent of a Nazi salute, the prime minister stood by him. 'Elon is a great friend of Israel,' Netanyahu wrote on the X platform, owned by the billionaire who is close to President Trump Three days after Elon Musk made a gesture that was reminiscent of a Nazi salute and caused a stir, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is addressing it for the first time, and expressing support for Elon Musk . 'Elon Musk is being falsely smeared,' Netanyahu wrote in a tweet on the X platform, owned by Musk, who is close to U.S. President Donald Trump and is considered one of his senior advisers. About 20 minutes later, Musk retweeted Netanyahu's comment and added 'Thank you.' The prime minister wrote that 'Elon is a great friend of Israel. He visited Israel after the October 7 massacre in which Hamas terrorists committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. He has since repeatedly and forcefully supported Israel’s right to defend itself against genocidal terrorists and regimes who seek to annihilate the one and only Jewish state. I thank him for this.'

Many were shocked by the disturbing 'gesture' and accused Musk of fascism and antisemitism, with some even claiming that 'now the real Musk is starting to emerge.' On the other hand, Musk's supporters, now joined by Netanyahu, offered a host of arguments in his defense, ranging from 'he actually intended to do the Roman handshake' to 'he is diagnosed with Asperger's and was unable to control his emotions.' Others suggested that this was simply an innocent gesture stemming from excitement and related to the last sentence that Musk said in his speech: 'My heart goes out to you.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ebjegukx	2025-01-23T08:46:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/SyxYKJHnwkx/SyxYKJHnwkx_0_46_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Jerusalem and Moscow are working together to release three hostages who are not included in Phase 1 of the release deal; One of them, she noted in an interview with a local news website, is Maxim Herkin, whose daughter and mother hold Russian citizenship; The names of the other two hostages were not given Israel's ambassador to Moscow, Simona Halperin, revealed Thursday in an interview with the Russian news website RBC that Israel and Russia are working together to release three Russia-connected hostages being held in the Gaza Strip who are not included in Phase 1 of the deal. She noted that one of them is the kidnapped Maxim Herkin, a 36-year-old native of the Donbas region from Tirat Carmel, who does not hold Russian citizenship, but his daughter was born and lives in the Russia. After Herkin was kidnapped, his mother also received Russian citizenship. The names of the two other kidnapped people whom Moscow and Jerusalem, according to the ambassador, are working to free were not disclosed. 'We really hope that the Russian side can help with this. I truly believe that if the Russian side demands it persistently enough, it will be able to facilitate the release of these three hostages,' Halperin emphasized. The ambassador noted that Sasha Trupanov, a Russian national whose name is included in Phase 1 of the deal, is expected to be released at this stage, not thanks to Russian efforts, but due to the fact that he was injured during his kidnapping on October 7. Since the morning of the massacre, several videos and signs of life have been received from Trupanov -who is being held by Islamic Jihad, the last of which was in November. According to the ambassador, his inclusion in the humanitarian deal was discussed at the beginning of the negotiations with Hamas and the other terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip.

Kidnapped Israeli Elizabeth Tsurkov is alive in Iraq and efforts ...	Iraqi's foreign minister announced that the government in Baghdad is working to release the researcher, who was kidnapped two years ago by a pro-Iranian militia; New push comes with Israel increasing efforts to free her in the background, and optimism in the shadow of Trump's return to the White House and the hostage deal with Hamas Elizabeth Tsurkov, the Israeli researcher who was kidnapped in Iraq almost two years ago, is alive and the Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al Sudani, is working to free her, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein told the American news website Axios Thursday. Tsurkov, 36, an Israeli national with Russian citizenship who was living in the United States during her Princeton University doctoral studies, was abducted on March 26, 2023, in Baghdad while conducting research. Authorities believe she is held by Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian militia, though the group denies involvement. The Iraqi foreign minister's comments come about two weeks after a senior Israeli official told the Washington Post that Israel had recently stepped up efforts to free Tsurkov . He said that Israel's allies are also involved in these efforts, and the issue was even raised at a meeting of special envoys for hostage affairs in Jerusalem this week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Israeli official said that the envoys came from the U.S., Britain, Germany, Austria and Canada, and met with members of the Tsurkov family. Israel asked them to use their embassies in Baghdad to put pressure on the Iraqi government to seek a way to begin negotiations. Since Israel and Iraq do not have diplomatic relations, the government official said that he hopes that other countries will assist in the efforts. 'Many countries have embassies and relations with Iraq,' he said. The senior Israeli official who spoke to The Washington Post added that, after months of covert efforts, Israel now believes that 'changes in the region' have created an opportunity to act publicly for Tsurkov's release. Alongside the strategic blow suffered by Iran and its proxies during the war, another major change that has sparked optimism is the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House, and the deadline Trump set has already helped reach the hostage deal with Hamas and its actual implementation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjn0xkxuke	2025-01-23T07:13:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/06/rkkLYCXFh/rkkLYCXFh_0_210_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

ICC prosecutor seeks arrest warrants for two Taliban leaders in A...	The International Criminal Court prosecutor said on Thursday he had applied for arrest warrants for two Taliban leaders in Afghanistan including supreme spiritual leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, accusing them of the persecution of women and girls. A statement issued by the office of chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said investigators found reasonable grounds to believe that Akhundzada and Abdul Hakim Haqqani, who has served as chief justice since 2021, 'bear criminal responsibility for the crime against humanity of persecution on gender grounds.' They are 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women...and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women,' the statement said. Persecution has taken place across Afghanistan from at least Aug. 15, 2021 - the day that Taliban forces captured the capital Kabul - to the present day, the prosecutor said. Since the Islamist group returned to power in 2021 it has clamped down on women's rights, including limits to schooling, work and general independence in daily life. There was no immediate comment by Taliban leaders on the prosecutor's statement, which was welcomed by groups defending women's rights. It will now be up to a three-judge panel at the ICC to rule on the prosecution request, which has no set deadline. Such procedures take an average of three months. It was the first time ICC prosecutors have publicly sought warrants in their investigation into potential war crimes in Afghanistan, which dates back to 2007 and once included alleged crimes by the U.S. military there. PERSECUTION OF GIRLS Khan said his office was demonstrating its commitment to pursuing accountability for gender-based crimes and that the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic sharia law could not be a justification for human rights abuses or crimes. 'Afghan women and girls as well as the LGBTQI+ community are facing an unprecedented, unconscionable and ongoing persecution by the Taliban. Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable,' the prosecutor said. Zalmai Nishat, founder of the UK-based charity Mosaic Afghanistan, said if ICC warrants were issued it may have little impact on Akhundzada, who rarely travels outside Afghanistan. 'But in terms of international reputation of the Taliban, this basically means a complete erosion of their international legitimacy, if they had any,' he said. COURT IN CRISIS Khan's move came amid an existential crisis at the court, opened in The Hague in 2002 to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing new economic sanctions against it for issuing an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged crimes in Gaza. Moscow struck back at the ICC for its 2023 warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin by issuing a warrant of its own for Khan. Despite the recent string of high-profile arrest warrants, courtrooms in The Hague are virtually empty and Khan is under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct in the workplace, which he denies. The ICC has no police force and relies on its 125 member states to make arrests. But several European member states have expressed doubts about detaining Netanyahu and this week Italy arrested an ICC suspect, but failed to hand him over.

Military sets up checkpoints to prevent drive-by shootings; security officials warn disruption of traffic cannot last long and would eventually raise tensions, provoke further violence West Bank traffic was delayed in massive traffic jams caused by IDF roadblocks and checkpoints set up to bolster security ahead of the release of terrorists from Israeli prisons on Saturday, as part of the cease-fire agreement in Gaza. The move aims to minimize the risk of drive-by shooting attacks on roads shared by Israelis and Palestinians but has resulted mounting frustration among Palestinian residents. 'I left work at noon and didn’t arrive home until 8 p.m. There’s no explanation—just an attempt to make life harder for innocent Palestinians,' Ahmad, a resident of Nablus said. Ahmad also added that he has stopped going to work due to the gridlock. 'These traffic jams have become living spaces. People pray, eat, and wait outside their cars until the roads clear.' Ahmad noted that the impact has been particularly hard on women. 'There are no bathrooms, and they are left with no choice but to endure the humiliation.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Said Issa, a resident of Yatta near Hebron, shared a similar experience: 'I was stuck from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. for no apparent reason. When I finally passed, no one even checked my car. It’s absurd—what should be a five-minute trip takes hours.' The situation has disrupted daily life and business. Taxi driver Omar Burayni, who operates the Ramallah-Nablus route, said ridership has plummeted. 'There used to be 200 taxis a day; now, it’s barely 40. Everyone is waiting for this nightmare to end.' Security concerns and rising tensions The checkpoints coincide with the first phase of a hostage exchange deal but were implemented earlier to counter the threat of shooting attacks from passing vehicles. The IDF, the Shin Bet, and the Border Police have held situational assessments with Central Command Chief Maj. Gen. Avi Blot to prevent armed demonstrations during the prisoner release, which could provoke further violence. Seven additional battalions have been deployed to reinforce the region. Initially, the West Bank was considered a secondary front in the ongoing conflict, and security forces succeeded in preventing widespread unrest despite Hamas' efforts to incite violence. However, with most fronts now under ceasefire and the IDF focused on operations in Jenin, attention has returned to the West Bank. Palestinian sources report that major checkpoints causing gridlock are located near Ramallah, Qalqilya, Nablus, the Jordan Valley, and Tubas. According to the Palestinian Authority’s Committee Against the Separation Wall and Settlements, the number of Israeli checkpoints and gates in the West Bank has risen to 898 since the start of the war. While the measures aim to enhance security, some Israeli defense officials acknowledge the risk of prolonged unrest.

Security officials warn against delaying IDF withdrawal from Leba...	Some in political circles say Netanyahu may try to slow walk to delay pullback amid pressure from far-right Finance Minister; the officials say it would be devastating to the extraordinary military achievements in the war Senior security officials warned on Thursday that a delay of the IDF withdrawal from Lebanon would be devastating. According to the cease-fire agreement negotiated to end the war with Hezbollah, that stipulated that the terror group must be kept north of the Litani River, IDF troops must leave South Lebanon on Sunday, 60 days after the agreement came into effect. 'The IDF is effectively enforcing the deal,' the officials said. 'IF we don't show the Americans and the Lebanese that we are complying with the terms of the agreement, we are putting our outstanding military achievements at risk,' the officials said amid their concerns that Hezbollah will rebuild its strength if Israel does will not stay true to its commitments to Lebanon. Some in political circles believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to slow walk or delay the military withdrawal, because of among other things, pressure from his far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich. The security officials pointed to the presence of American's in Lebanon as one of the clear advantages in the deal, that could be in danger. 'The current American administration could reexamine its position there, if the deal collapses. The fact that they are there, provides a high level of certainty for stability,' they said. 'There is today, an extraordinary and historic potential, the best since the 1980s, to reduce the terrorist forces including Hezbollah and achieve calm. There is Saudi and American will to rebuild there and a new president whom Israel may be able to work with,' the said warning that chance must not be lost. They claimed the IDF would continue to enforce the terms of the deal and initiate attacks over any violation from Hezbollah. According to the cease-fire agreement, only Lebanon's army forces will be allowed to bare arms or use military force in South Lebanon, as of Sunday. They must work to dismantle any military or terror infrastructure built by Hezbollah in the areas south of the Litani. According to Arab media reports, the Lebanon Army was trying to deploy to the South according to UN resolution 1701 but were coming across Israeli forces in some areas. In one report, a Lebanon army force was surprised to encounter three IDF tanks in the South Lebanon village of Talusa and delayed its deployment there. Lebanese troops completed preparations to deploy elsewhere in the area and were preventing the return of villages from areas where IDF troops had not left. Lebanon's former prime minister Njib Mikati said earlier this week that in a meeting of the international Cessation of Hostilities Implementation Mechanism, the committee that oversees the compliance with the cease-fire deal, the American chairman Major General Jasper Jeffers told him that the Israeli withdrawal might be delayed by a number of days.

Among those expected to return to Israel are Arbel Yehud and three female lookout soldiers. The IDF is preparing for Zubeidi’s release, given his symbolic status in Jenin, and will maintain intelligence surveillance over his activities. Officials have issued a clear warning: if Zubeidi or any other released prisoners engage in terrorism or possess weapons, they will be targeted. Zubeidi was arrested in 2019 for involvement in multiple shooting attacks near Beit El. In September 2021, he made headlines after escaping from Gilboa Prison with five other Islamic Jihad inmates. He was recaptured five days later and sentenced to five years in prison. Zubeidi has previously spent extensive time in Israeli custody. As part of the broader effort to address terrorist activities, the IDF launched Operation 'Iron Wall' in Jenin earlier this week. Unlike previous operations, this mission aims to dismantle the city's entrenched terror infrastructure.

US security firm readies to inspect Gazans returning to north ami...	Hostage and cease-fire deal stipulates displaced Gazans returning north by foot would not be inspected while all traffic will be held for searches in efforts to prevent terrorists and weapons from moving into the area Representatives from U.S. security company tasked with conducting security inspections on the Netzarim Corridor to prevent the return of terrorists and weapons in vehicles to northern Gaza have arrived in Israel in recent days. Preparations for the company’s first inspection pilot, scheduled for Sunday, are underway. The company employs about 100 armed personnel, mainly Americans, including some Arabic speakers. Many are veterans of elite units or former CIA operatives. Under the cease-fire agreement in Gaza, the IDF is required to withdraw from the coastal Al-Rashid Road eastward to Salah al-Din Road by Saturday, the seventh day of the agreement, and dismantle its military installations in the area. The move will allow displaced Palestinians to return northward. The agreement stipulates that inspections will apply only to vehicles heading north, conducted by the private security firm, while pedestrians won’t be inspected. By the 22nd day of the agreement, the IDF is expected to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor, vacate Salah al-Din Road and dismantle additional military installations in the area. Vehicle inspections will take place at a designated inspection facility secured by an Egyptian security company. Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) will oversee the entry of the American team and coordinate their operations in Gaza. A multinational commission has been established to manage and oversee the safe passage of vehicles, facilitating the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza. It includes Safe Reach Solution (SRS), a strategic planning and logistics firm; UG Solutions, a recognized global provider of integrated security solutions and the Egyptian security and inspection company. A statement from the consortium stressed its neutrality, commitment to high professional standards and role in supporting the cease-fire agreement while promoting long-term stability in Gaza. Funding for the consortium and involved companies does not come from Israel but is managed by the deal’s mediators — Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. Qatar is believed to provide the majority of the funding. As part of the agreement, the IDF will withdraw from populated areas while maintaining control over a 700-meter buffer zone along the border with Gaza, within Gazan territory.

Afghan migrant behind fatal stabbing attack kiling a child and a ...	Chancellor Olaf Scholz expresses outrage at the attack and calls it an 'act of terror' as looming elections could mean support for far-right AfD party A 28-year-old Afghan migrant was behind the fatal stabbing attack in Germany on Wednesday, killing a toddler and a man in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria. The attacker targeted a group of children in a park midday, resulting in the deaths of a 2-year-old Moroccan boy and a 41-year-old German man who tried to intervene. A Syrian girl and two adults were injured and hospitalized. German authorities arrested the assailant after a 12-minute chase. The motive remains unclear, but German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the attack 'an unbelievable act of terror.' The attacker, an asylum seeker slated for deportation, had evaded bureaucratic processes. He had previously been brought before authorities three times for violent assaults, referred for psychiatric evaluation and released. Arriving in Germany in late 2022, he applied for asylum in early 2023. His request was denied, but authorities closed his case after he claimed he would leave voluntarily — a promise that wasn’t enforced. He continued living in refugee housing. A search of his room revealed no signs of religious radicalization but medications indicated mental health issues. The incident deals a significant blow to Germany's centrist parties, just a month before federal elections, as voter support increasingly shifts toward the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Immigration is expected to dominate campaign discussions amid rising violence linked to migrants. A series of knife attacks by Syrian and Afghan migrants has already prompted the German government to decide on deporting offenders to their home countries. Three weeks ago, a Syrian migrant stabbed two men in Berlin’s Charlottenburg neighborhood, leaving one critically injured. Chancellor Scholz expressed frustration after the Aschaffenburg attack, saying: 'I am sick of seeing such acts of violence occurring in our country every few weeks, by perpetrators who have actually come here to find protection here. Tolerance shouldn’t be mistaken for weakness in such cases. Authorities must explain why this attacker was still in Germany. Talking isn’t enough — we need action.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Peter Neumann, an expert on Islamic terrorism and radicalization, posted on his X account, writing: 'In my opinion, the horrific attack in Aschaffenburg is the result of a broken system that keeps large numbers of young men in refugee shelters for years. This leads to radicalization, violent crime and mental health issues. No one benefits — not society, nor asylum seekers who genuinely need help.' He added, 'Society and politics face a choice: either we commit to integrating migrants with greater effort, as we’ve said we can, or we acknowledge that we can’t and change the system. Either way, this cannot continue.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syoq2u1u1x	2025-01-23T01:17:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/23/SJgLDVPkuyx/SJgLDVPkuyx_336_550_2522_1420_0_small.jpg
Nukhba exhibit' sows confusion and terror in Kfar Saba	Police dismantle installation showing puppets dressed in Hamas terrorists' grabs placed in a pickup truck after worried locals informed forces Police forces on Thursday launched an investigation after a display featuring dolls resembling Hamas’ Nukhba terrorists on a pickup truck was set up in Kfar Saba. Residents passing by Tel Hai Street near the Kfar Saba municipal building were alarmed by the sight of the pickup truck and the 'terrorists' inside, prompting some to call the police. The display was dismantled and the circumstances behind the incident are being examined. Right-wing activist Ayelet Lash, a resident of the West Bank, posted a photo of the display on X (formerly Twitter), writing: 'This morning in Kfar Saba – a display showing a glimpse of what will happen if the State of Israel doesn’t quickly conquer Jenin, expel its terrorists and establish Jewish settlements there. No operation, no halfway measures. All-out war or the girls of Kfar Saba will be dragged to Jenin.'

Despite IDF warning of rocket strike, Nova party not shut down, n...	Protecting intelligence sources prioritized over indications of possible rocket attack, cross border incursions and fire on gas rig; only minor steps taken, according to new details in miliary probes of Oct. 7 failings On the night before the October 7 Hamas massacre, an IDF intelligence unit collected signs of preparation for rocket fire on Israel. The unit also observed unusual activity of the Hamas aerial force that could indicate a transition of the terror group, to emergency mode. Those indications, especially the possible rocket fire and others gathered, were discussed in IDF consultations in the following hours but did not bring about a decision to raise the alarm over a possible Hamas assault or to any significant steps being taken. This information was included in documents reviewed by senior government and security officials and presented in their arguments for the resignation of Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. Contrary to earlier reporting, the IDF not only estimated that Hamas was preparing for a military exercise or to defend against a possible Israeli attack but had seriously considered the possibility that the terror group was about to launch an assault on Israel. Despite that, the IDF decided on a limited number of actions. Amid calming indications and a wide consensus across the military and intelligence, the IDF opted to avoid exposing sensitive intelligence sources rather than preparedness. These revelations expose a central and dramatic aspect of that night. A participant in recent consultations on the matter defined them 'a nuclear bomb.' Since the massacre, other indications that the intelligence had, came to light including the use of Israeli SIM cards and the deployment of emergency assets in the Strip, used during the 2021 conflict two years earlier. But the preparation to launch a rocket attack, 'were a worrying sign on its own, and more so when it is added to other concerning indications.' The military is continuing its review and inquiries into the failings on that night. A person present in conversations about those inquiring said an senior officer had asked why there were no steps taken to prepare for a rocket attack, including moving the thousands of people from the Nova music festival grounds near the border where there were not enough shelters to protect against a rocket and mortar strike? There is also a question of whether instructions that were given, such as launching an intelligence flight over Gaza, were carried out? At 2 am, the Air Force duty command center was notified about the unusual activity in the Hamas aerial units. At the same time more indications of preparations for a rocket strike were received. All of that information was discussed in a call that Yaron Finkelman, the chief of the Southern Command held with other senior officers, Shin Bet representatives and a representative of the Air Force. Their evaluation written in simple terms read 'unusual activity was identified.' Finkelman said there were three possibilities, the third being an assault. IDF prioritizes protecting intelligence sources As Ynet reported last Novermber, Finkelman gave a serious of orders but all were to be carried out while protecting sources and were to prevent Hamas from realizing Israel was aware of its unusual activities and to avoid 'miscalculations.' An official close to the government said the Southern Command was aware of the Nova festival and had given the organizers the license for it. 'If the information, not about the assault but about possible rocket fire, not meet the standard to stop the party, what would have?' 'Protecting sources was prioritized,' said a senior officer, to explain the gap between the general consensus that there was low probability of an assault and the indications in the report. 'If someone would have thought that there was really a danger, preventing it would have been prioritized over any of the intelligence sources and that is why a limited group was involved in the discussions.' Missing from them were the chief of military intelligence and the Commander of the Air Force. Summary of the Southern Command's consultations was delivered to Chief of IDF operations General Oded Basyuk who conducted a number of telephone calls. 'After consulting the deputy head of Shin Bet, commander of the Southern Command, operations commander and intelligence research department chief, there are three possible scenarios,' he wrote. 'A Hamas drill, increased preparedness to defend against an Israeli attack, preparations for an operation against Israel in the coming hours including incursion from the sea or a strike on the gas rig, breeching the border, abduction, shooting attack, rocket attack and an incursion from the air.' He ordered a number of actions including a review of Israel's aerial defenses around the gas rig but although he understood that there was a risk of a rocket strike, abduction or 'an unusual terror attack, the conclusion was that there must be careful preparation to protect sensitive sources and coordinate actions with military intelligence.' (Later review showed that the Intelligence forces' operational brigade was not tapped about the possible deployment of forces along the border in the overnight hours and there is an ongoing debate about the responsibility for that.) Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The chief of staff who held consultations with Basyuk and Finkelman at 4 am, ordered an aerial intelligence flight and said that if Hamas was conducting a drill, this would be an opportunity to gather information.

His office summoned some senior commanders for 8.30 am. The IDF said in response to this report that the details in it are not from the official IDF probe. 'The IDF will complete its inquiries into the Oct. 7 massacre in the coming weeks and will present their findings to the public.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syyu6fkd1g	2025-01-23T00:55:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/14/r1lrBOLqqC/r1lrBOLqqC_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

Local authorities bring Layal Alekhtiar in for questioning before releasing on bail; military court judge says she remains under investigation Layal Alekhtiar, a Lebanese journalist and presenter for the Saudi TV network Al Arabiya landed in hot water in October 2023 after her interview with IDF spokesperson in Arabic Col. Avichay Adraee. During the interview, Alekhtiar referred to Adraee as 'the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces' and 'Mr. Adraee,' sparking a media campaign against her led by Hezbollah supporters. The Lebanese military prosecution subsequently filed a legal case against her, alleging a violation of Lebanon's anti-Israel boycott law. On Wednesday, Alekhtiar, who had been abroad during the intervening period, arrived at Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut and was taken directly to the military court for questioning. According to a Lebanese report, her return to Beirut aimed to resolve her legal status. Alekhtiar was released on bail of 50 million Lebanese pounds (approximately $558), with Judge Fadi Sawan saying she remains under investigation. Alekhtiar, a prominent presenter known for her opposition to Hezbollah, has faced significant criticism over the years. Following the 2023 interview and subsequent controversy, she took to the social media platform X, calling the situation a 'political persecution and judicial oppression.' She stressed, 'This has nothing to do with truth or justice. I’m not afraid because I’m Lebanese until Judgment Day – until my last breath. You will not touch my freedom, my dignity or my beliefs, no matter what you do.' Al Arabiya also condemned the attacks on the journalist, expressed support for her and said that Alekhtiar sought to cover all sides professionally. 'At Al Arabiya, we stress that what Alekhtiar has faced is an attack on journalism, its values and the pursuit of balanced and professional news coverage,' the network said.

As Trump begins second term, his youngest son moves into the spot...	At 18, Barron Trump receives public attention with intelligence, wit, and reserved charm. Fluent in two languages and raised in privilege, he remains a mystery as his father begins a second term as President of the United States For nearly a decade, the Trump family has occupied a curious corner of Israeli pop culture. While some may still fondly remember Donald Trump’s cameo in Home Alone 2, his family—particularly his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka—has become a regular feature in gossip columns. But now, the spotlight shifts to Barron Trump, the youngest of Donald’s five children, who recently turned 18. Barron has long kept a low profile compared to his older siblings, Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany. But his story is no less intriguing. Back in 2005, just six months after their wedding, Melania and Donald learned they were expecting. Melania vividly remembers breaking the news to her husband: 'He came home, and I told him he was going to be a father. At first, he needed time to process it—it was a real surprise—but he was very happy.' Donald, for his part, admitted he wasn’t entirely caught off guard. 'I expected we’d have kids, but I was surprised by how quickly it happened.' He was born in March of 2006. Donald, however, chose not to be present at the birth, explaining he thought Melania would be more comfortable without him there. Melania later shared that the delivery, which lasted eight hours, was 'very easy.' Donald also selected the name Barron, claiming he’d always liked it but hadn’t had the chance to use it with his other children. Melania initially resisted but ultimately agreed. As Barron grew, his education reflected his privileged upbringing. He attended elite schools, including Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School in Manhattan. Even after his father became president in 2017, Barron stayed in New York to finish his schooling. During his final year, in classic Trump fashion, Barron treated his entire class to a tour of the White House, complete with Secret Service agents and a personal meeting with his father. In May 2017, Barron moved to the prestigious Episcopal School in Maryland, where tuition set his father back $40,000 a year. More recently, after Donald’s presidency, Barron transferred to Oxbridge Academy in Palm Beach. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Fluent in both English and Slovene, Barron has led a relatively private life, thanks to his mother’s protective efforts. 'Barron is a shy, reserved boy,' shared a family insider. 'Melania is a very hands-on mother, focusing all her attention on Barron and her family.' Fast forward to this week’s inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States, where Barron once again caught public attention. While Melania’s wide-brimmed hat—blocking Donald from kissing her cheek—stirred social media memes, Barron’s sharp, tailored look sparked curiosity. Nathan Pearce, CEO of Pearce Bespoke, shared insights about working with Barron on his suit for the event. 'He’s incredibly intelligent; it’s fascinating to talk to him,' Pearce told Women’s Wear Daily. 'He’s sharp, mature, and knowledgeable about history.' Pearce continued: 'He’s funny, approachable, and warm—those words define him. He’s incredibly nice but also sharp and witty. Put him in a room of business heavyweights, and he’ll hold his own. He’s smart and has a dry sense of humor.' As Donald embarks on his second term, the world will be watching. Maybe this time, Barron’s humor and intellect will step out of the shadows to reveal the man behind the name. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rynl3tcpjx	2025-01-22T20:11:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/S1NGBmCDkl/S1NGBmCDkl_0_0_1024_683_0_small.jpg
Trump designates Yemen's Houthis as a 'foreign terrorist organiza...	White House says Trump directs USAID to end ties to entities assisting the houthis 'while turning a blind eye toward their terrorism and abuses' U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday re-designated Yemen's Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, as a 'foreign terrorist organization', the White House said. The move will impose harsher economic penalties than the Biden administration had applied on the group. The the Iranian poxies were resonsible for 300 missile and drone attacks on Israel, attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and against U.S. warships defending the critical maritime chokepoint, since the Hamas October 7 massacre. Earlier on Wednesday, the group released the crew of the Galaxy Leader commercial ship more than a year after they seized their Bahamas-flagged vessel off the Yemeni coast, after signaling in recent days that they were scaling back attacks in the Red Sea following the multi-phase cease fire deal between Israel and Hamas. 'The Houthis' activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade,' the White House said in a statement. 'The President will direct USAID to end its relationship with entities that have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis's terrorism and abuses,' the White House said. The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, have carried out more than 100 attacks on ships plying the Red Sea since November 2023, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians over the war against Hamas in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers. The attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa for more than a year. The group has targeted the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which are joined by the narrow Bab al-Mandab strait, a chokepoint between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. military sought to intercept Houthi attacks to safeguard commercial traffic and waged periodic strikes to degrade Houthi military capabilities. But it did not target the group's leadership. At the start of his presidential term in 2021, Joe Biden had dropped Trump's terrorist designations to address humanitarian concerns inside Yemen. Confronted with the Red Sea attacks, Biden last year designated the group as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' organization. But his administration held off on applying the harsher FTO designation. British charity Oxfam said the move would worsen the suffering of Yemeni civilians, disrupting vital imports of food, medicine, and fuel. 'The Trump administration is aware of these consequences but chose to move forward anyway, and will bear responsibility for the hunger and disease that will follow,' Oxfam America's director of peace and security, Scott Paul, said in a statement. David Schenker, who was assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the first Trump administration, said Trump's move on Wednesday was an obvious, early step to respond to what he described as one of Iran's leading proxy forces in the Middle East. 'While the redesignation likely won't have a positive impact on the group's behavior, the measure suggests the new administration is not looking to induce (or cajole) the Iranians to negotiations through blandishment,' Schenker told Reuters.

Beit Hanoun Battalion chief Hussein Fayyad filmed Wednesday speaking at a Gaza funeral; IDF announced he was killed in Jabaliya tunnel in May, admits intelligence 'not sufficiently accurate'; terror group calls it blow to Israeli intelligence Israeli military and intelligence agencies are reassessing their previous claim that Hussein Fayyad, commander of Hamas’ Beit Hanoun Battalion, was killed during a May operation in Gaza after he seemed to reappear on Wednesday. Fayyad, presumed dead following an Israeli strike on a tunnel in Jabalyia, appeared at a funeral in northern Gaza, delivering a speech about Gaza’s 'victory' over Israel in the war. His appearance, documented in video footage, has sparked controversy, with both Hamas officials and analysts confirming the footage was taken after the cease-fire.

'Following a reevaluation, it appears the intelligence upon which the IDF and Shin Bet relied was not sufficiently accurate,' the statement read. Fayyad’s reemergence caught even Hamas by surprise. A relative of a senior al-Qassam Brigades commander killed in 2009 called Fayyad’s appearance 'an unexpected blow to the enemy’s intelligence.' Gazan analyst Saeed Ziyad referred to Fayyad as a 'leader with seven lives,' highlighting his survival despite multiple Israeli assassination attempts. In May, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari announced Fayyad's supposed death, crediting 98th Division combat units and Air Force special forces for eliminating the commander in a Jabaliya tunnel. Fayyad was accused of directing numerous anti-tank missile operations and mortar fire on Israeli border communities during the war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyelmy100je	2025-01-22T12:35:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/HJxEwEjRDJg/HJxEwEjRDJg_199_219_869_490_0_small.jpg
What’s the next step?': Report exposes Hamas' lack of strategy a...	Turkish outlet reveals Hamas leaders celebrated Oct. 7 attack during meeting in Istanbul, drawing silence and sharp questions from Turkish intelligence; report blasts Hamas over Gaza devastation and handing Netanyahu grounds for massive retaliation Members of Hamas' political bureau met with Turkish intelligence officials on October 7, 2023, the same day Hamas launched a devastating attack on Israel, killing over 1,200 people, Turkish news outlet 10HABER reported on Tuesday. The report includes rare, pointed criticism of Hamas, accusing it of causing catastrophic consequences for Gaza while failing to prepare for the aftermath. 'What victory are you celebrating? You brutally murdered 1,200 Israelis and handed Netanyahu the excuse to kill 46,000 people,' the report read. According to the article, the Hamas delegation arrived at the headquarters of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT) in Istanbul on the morning of October 7. As news of the assault on Israel unfolded, members of the Hamas delegation reportedly shouted 'Allahu Akbar' and celebrated, unaware of the full scale of the massacre. Turkish officials present at the meeting were said to have remained silent as the delegation expressed their elation. Turkish officials question Hamas' strategy The report noted that while Hamas representatives exulted, MIT officials maintained silence. A senior Turkish intelligence officer reportedly asked the Hamas delegates: 'You’ve carried out an extraordinary, unexpected operation. But what’s the next step? Have you thought about that? You’ve gone 1-0 against Israel, but this won’t just end at 1-1. Do you have a second phase or a plan to follow this?' The Hamas delegation, the article claims, did not respond to these questions. The Turkish official persisted: 'Understand that Israel won’t leave the score at 1-1. It won’t end at 2-1, 3-1, or even 4-1. We know Netanyahu and Israel. They’ll take it to 10-1, or even 12-1. Do you have a strategy for what comes next?' The article states that Turkish intelligence officials concluded Hamas’ delegation had no awareness of the massacre’s scope and had not planned for the aftermath. The MIT’s message to Hamas during the meeting was reportedly clear: 'Do not place too much trust in Iran.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The article’s author offered an unflinching critique of Hamas, accusing the organization of causing immense suffering in Gaza. He revealed that he had been aware of the meeting’s details for some time but decided to publish them now. 'I watched for minutes as masked men in Gaza celebrated and raised their hands in victory. I stared in disbelief,' he wrote. 'I kept shouting internally, ‘My friends, what victory is this?’' Addressing Hamas directly, the author added: 'Don’t you see the devastation behind you? What victory is this? Do you never look at the balance sheet? Forty-six thousand people are dead. More than 100,000 are injured, many of whom will live with those injuries—amputated hands and legs—for the rest of their lives. Over a million people have been displaced from their homes. Ninety percent of Gaza’s homes and workplaces are in ruins. Schools and hospitals have been flattened. Electricity is gone. You’ve lost all your regional allies. Your leadership has disappeared. Hezbollah, your closest supporter, is not even on its knees—it’s flat on the ground.' The author continued: 'Israel has entered Lebanon. Tons of bombs fall daily on your allies in Yemen. Assad, the only leader who supported you militarily, has fled. His successors now say, ‘We won’t allow further actions against Israel from Syria.’ Your entire leadership team has been killed. Two, even three future generations have been destroyed. Yet you stand there making victory signs. What kind of victory is this? Can there ever be victory in such a war?' A condemnation of Hamas’ actions on October 7 The writer posed pointed questions about Hamas’ motivations: 'Friends, why did you carry out the bloody attack on October 7? Why did you brutally murder 1,200 people—young and old, men and women, including those enjoying a music festival? Why did you abduct hundreds, causing dozens to die underground? Why did you give a savage like Netanyahu the excuse to mercilessly kill 46,000 people? The war is over now. Let us be clear: the fingers that yesterday pointed at Israel will now point at Hamas.' He continued his condemnation: 'Tell me, did you gain anything from this ruthless campaign? What did you win? Global public opinion? The world didn’t support you; it supported the children, women, elderly, and innocent civilians who died. Don’t think for a moment that those protesting Netanyahu worldwide supported your barbaric attack, in which you killed 1,200 people and took hundreds of hostages. Now the bloodshed has stopped.' The article concluded with a stark warning for Hamas. 'Be sure that the fingers pointing at Netanyahu worldwide will now also turn on you because we now know that if Hamas’ irresponsible military wing doesn’t reform, the Palestinian people will never see happiness. Anyone seeking true peace in Gaza must now deliver the necessary message to these reckless individuals who make victory signs with their two open fingers. Netanyahu is a war criminal. But Hamas, you are not innocent either.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1p2mrcwjx	2025-01-22T12:09:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/HJXAnuAowkl/HJXAnuAowkl_0_145_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Israel expects to receive Friday names of 4 female hostages—1 civilian and 3 military observers—set for release Saturday as part of hostage deal; IDF reports threats to troops in Gaza, leading to elimination of Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist Israel is gearing up for the second phase of the first stage of the hostage exchange deal, with Hamas expected to deliver the names of four female hostages—one civilian and three military lookouts—on Friday. The exchange is set to occur Saturday afternoon, with the hostages transferred to the Red Cross and then to Israeli forces. Israel anticipates the release of civilian Arbel Yehoud as part of this stage. Hamas is also expected to provide a full list by Saturday detailing which of the 33 hostages are alive or deceased. Israeli estimates suggest at least 25 are alive. Following the release of three hostages earlier this week and four more anticipated Saturday, the remaining number of hostages is believed to be 18. The Israeli military reported continued activity against threats in Gaza despite the ongoing cease-fire. In the past 24 hours, IDF forces identified and neutralized armed suspects in southern Gaza, including Akram Ataf Farhan Zanon, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative. Masked suspects were also observed approaching Israeli positions, prompting warning shots. 'The IDF remains committed to the cease-fire agreement to secure the release of hostages while ensuring its readiness to counter immediate threats,' the military stated. Israel is preparing for the second stage of negotiations, officially set to begin on February 4 but already underway behind the scenes. Senior intelligence officials, including Mossad Director David Barnea and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, recently held discussions in Cairo with Egyptian counterparts. Topics included cease-fire mechanisms, security on the Philadelphi Corridor, and the management of the Rafah crossing. COGAT Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian also visited Egypt to discuss implementation details.

Reports suggest Witkoff played a critical role in convincing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to the initial deal. Witkoff said he would participate in monitoring efforts along the Gaza Strip and expressed optimism about advancing regional normalization efforts. Israel and Egypt are negotiating the reopening of the Rafah crossing, scheduled to resume operations 14 days after the third phase of hostage releases. Plans call for 12 non-Hamas Palestinian workers vetted by the Shin Bet to manage the crossing, with oversight from the international EUBAM mission. Movement through the crossing will be limited to individuals, with hundreds of Gazans allowed to seek medical treatment in Egypt under pre-approved lists. Netanyahu’s office emphasized stringent security measures, saying, 'No one will cross without prior approval and supervision by the IDF and Shin Bet.' Palestinian Authority involvement will be minimal, limited to stamping passports under international agreements. This arrangement will be reassessed after the first stage of the plan. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1j8rr0p1g	2025-01-22T11:42:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/SyapeARwJg/SyapeARwJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Shin Bet security blunders under the microscope after Tel Aviv te...	Moroccan-born US Green Card holder enters Israel despite being flagged at airport, only to carry out stabbing spree days later; incident exposes gaps in security protocols, prompting investigations into Shin Bet and border control failures Less than a day after the stabbing attack in Tel Aviv, new details have emerged about how the attacker, a 29-year-old Moroccan citizen with a U.S. Green Card, managed to enter Israel. These revelations raise serious concerns about what appears to be a major security lapse. Despite being flagged and initially denied entry by a border control officer at Ben Gurion Airport, the attacker was ultimately approved by Shin Bet after undergoing questioning and a security screening at the Israeli consulate in New York. The attacker, Kaddi Abdelaziz, carried out a stabbing spree in Tel Aviv's bustling Nahalat Binyamin area, crowded with nightlife-goers as usual. Five people were injured in the attack—one seriously, one moderately and three lightly. The attacker was neutralized by soldiers from the elite Sayeret Matkal unit, who responded to the screams of one of the victims, an American tourist. Surveillance footage captured Abdelaziz buying pizza on Allenby Street just moments before launching his attack, three days after arriving in Israel on January 18. Haim, owner of the pizzeria, recounted his encounter with the attacker: 'He bought two slices for himself, grabbed a drink, and left. Then he returned to bring back the plate—which Israelis never do—and was very polite. He said, 'Thanks,' and walked off. When he ordered the pizza, he spoke English with an Arabic accent. He had an Arab appearance but spoke English. My employee and I thought he seemed strange. This was at 8:30 PM, and just a few minutes later, the attack happened. When I heard the screams, I didn’t connect it at first. Later that night, I saw his picture on the news. It was exactly what he had been wearing—and how he looked. I was in shock. I immediately called my employee, and neither of us could believe it.' It soon became clear that a series of missteps had allowed him to enter the country. Upon his arrival in Israel on a connecting flight from Poland, a border control officer at Ben Gurion Airport grew suspicious and refused to approve his entry. Her concerns were based on his inability to provide a convincing answer about where he intended to stay during his visit and the fact that he was carrying little money. A police officer on the scene also noted his 'tense body language' as suspicious. The attacker was referred to Shin Bet for further questioning, but after their interrogation, they determined there were no security grounds to deny him entry. Shin Bet has since announced that the incident will be thoroughly investigated. 'Upon his entry into Israel, a security evaluation was conducted, including both questioning and additional checks, and it was determined there was no basis to deny his entry on security grounds. This case will be reviewed,' Shin Bet said. However, warning signs may have been apparent even earlier. Before flying to Israel, the attacker had visited the Israeli consulate in New York with his Moroccan passport to apply for a tourist visa. He made several visits to the consulate and was asked to provide various documents. According to sources familiar with the visa process, the purpose of the consular review was to ensure that he did not intend to settle in Israel illegally. At the request of the consulate, he provided documentation proving he was a successful Uber driver with a five-star rating and nearly 3,000 completed rides. He also showed bank statements reflecting a balance of over $10,000, demonstrating financial stability. Additionally, his possession of a U.S. Green Card suggested he intended to return to the United States to continue his naturalization process. As a Moroccan citizen, his visa application was forwarded to Shin Bet for review, following standard protocol. Shin Bet approved the application within two days—a notably quick response. Based on this approval, the consulate issued his visa. Sources familiar with the process maintain that there were no irregularities in the consulate’s handling of the case or in the conduct of the Foreign Ministry. Nevertheless, key questions remain unanswered—chief among them, whether anyone had reviewed his Facebook profile. A cursory glance at the page, which was deleted immediately after the attack and his identification, would have revealed posts that were overtly anti-Israel and supportive of Gaza. In the posts, the attacker accused Israel of 'starving northern Gaza' and claimed that 'half a million Gazans face death by starvation.' He shared a video praising Islam with the caption 'Free Palestine' and an image of Ibrahim al-Nabulsi, a terrorist killed in Nablus in 2022. Following the October 7 massacre, he posted, 'What is happening now may double the number of martyrs for Islam.' Security officials involved in the visa process argue that reviewing his Facebook page falls squarely under Shin Bet’s purview. Consular officials, they claim, are neither authorized nor trained to evaluate security threats or incitement on social media. 'The consulate has no authority over security matters. Their role is to assess whether the individual has a stable economic life to return to and does not intend to settle illegally. Security checks are the responsibility of Shin Bet,' said one official. Kaddi Abdelaziz lived in Brooklyn, and his U.S. ID indicated he was born in Morocco. In a Facebook post from September 14, 2022, he uploaded a photo of himself flying from New York, captioning it, 'Alhamdulillah.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another pressing question is why, despite the suspicions raised by the border control officer, the Shin Bet ultimately allowed his entry after the interrogation at Ben Gurion Airport. It is important to clarify that this was not a case of the Shin Bet overriding a border control decision to deny entry. Shin Bet is not authorized to approve entry—it can only recommend denial based on security concerns. In this instance, the border control officer flagged the individual for further review, and Shin Bet conducted its checks, concluding there were no grounds to deny his entry. The incident is now under investigation. Preventing entry to Israel requires concrete evidence or clear indications of malicious intent, neither of which were apparent in this case. A senior security official highlighted the challenges of screening the large number of foreign arrivals to Israel: 'Tens of thousands enter Israel each week, over a million annually. Of these, tens of thousands undergo detailed Shin Bet screenings, and hundreds are denied entry each year. Wartime protocols have tightened screenings significantly, leading to a rise in denials. These decisions often lead to legal appeals, and in rare cases, the decisions are overturned.' Former senior Shin Bet official Dvir Kariv acknowledged the agency’s limitations: 'Shin Bet is not infallible—it learns and investigates thoroughly, but mistakes do happen. While it prevents the majority of threats, it is not a machine with a 100% success rate.' Speaking about the interrogation at Ben Gurion Airport, he added, 'I’ve conducted hundreds, maybe thousands, of interrogations in my career. Only three times did I recommend denial based on a gut feeling that I was dealing with someone problematic. It’s possible the officer here simply misjudged this time.' Adv. Tomer Warsha, head of the Immigration Committee of the Israel Bar Association, criticized the handling of the case. 'This serious incident raises heavy questions about the performance of both border control and the Foreign Ministry. Despite clear signs of suspicion, the attacker was allowed entry with a Moroccan passport and a pre-issued visa. This was a case where denial should have been unequivocal, based on existing protocols,' he said. Shin Bet reiterated: 'Upon his entry into Israel, a security evaluation was conducted, including questioning and additional checks. It was determined there was no security basis to deny his entry. The case will be thoroughly investigated.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkv8nncvye	2025-01-22T11:12:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/SJAkfcTv1l/SJAkfcTv1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Jewish Americans, Israelis hope Trump will deliver peace to Israe...	Hebrew could be heard at several watch events and on the streets of Washington, DC; 'We need someone in power who can speak the language that terrorists understand' America, Israel and the Jewish people are 'back together again,' declared Josh Reinstein, president of the Israeli Allies Foundation. For Christians and Jews who have long prayed for the peace of Jerusalem, Reinstein says the moment has arrived to witness those prayers taking shape. Reinstein, who traveled from Mevaseret Zion near Jerusalem with his wife to attend President Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, radiated excitement on Monday as Trump was sworn in. Despite the bitter cold that numbed every exposed extremity of the tens of thousands gathered in Washington, DC—including visitors from sunny Israel—the atmosphere was electric. The chill in the air was no match for the warmth of hope and celebration. Tears of joy flowed freely, cheers erupted and elaborate watch parties buzzed with energy. At these gatherings, supporters praised Trump’s leadership and shared high hopes for a brighter future—not just for America but for Israel and the world. 'We always talk about how the best is yet to come for faith-based diplomacy and how it’s growing worldwide. But if you look at the cabinet coming in with the Trump administration, it’s the who’s who of faith-based diplomacy,' Reinstein told The Media Line. Reinstein highlighted prominent appointees, including Rev. Mike Huckabee, who is slated to become the U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee, who has publicly stated that the Palestinians had their chance at a state in Gaza and failed, advocates for Israel annexing Judea and Samaria. Another key figure that Reinstein noted is Peter Hegseth, the incoming U.S. secretary of defense. A committed Bible-believing Christian, Hegseth has unapologetically supported Israel’s military actions in Gaza. Other notable appointments include Marco Rubio, who was sworn in on Monday as secretary of state, and Elise Stefanik, who was widely recognized for her fight against antisemitism on college campuses. Stefanik was named the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on Tuesday. 'These are people who have been in our network for two decades, and now they are becoming the government of America,' Reinstein said. He and his team have already crafted an agenda for the new administration, though he was not ready to share the details. However, he hinted at initiatives Trump began implementing on Monday night, such as sanctioning the International Criminal Court and defunding UNRWA—again. 'We see this as the beginning of four years of incredible success and security, not just for the Middle East, but for the world,' Reinstein added. 'We’re excited to see all the different things that will happen.' Surprisingly, Hebrew could be heard at several watch events and on the streets of Washington, DC. Nicole Levine, from Herzliya, was dressed to the nines and smiling from ear to ear. 'We are extremely happy and relieved, especially with the situation in the Middle East now that the current administration is gone,' she told The Media Line. 'We need Trump. We need someone in power who can speak the language that terrorists understand.' Levine expressed that under the Biden administration, Israelis felt unable to sleep peacefully, constantly plagued by anxiety. She recalled how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a calculated risk in supporting Trump’s candidacy, both behind the scenes and publicly. Now, with the House, Senate and White House controlled by Republicans, she said, 'it cannot be a better time.' Several members of the Knesset, including MKs Ohad Tal and Simcha Rothman of the Religious Zionist Party, also came to Washington to meet with U.S. legislators, hoping to establish strong connections as the new administration took hold. Both Israeli leaders, outspoken critics of the recent hostage-for-ceasefire deal Trump pushed and celebrated during his inauguration, nonetheless expressed their support for the U.S. president. They were optimistic that Trump would help advance their Zionist agendas. Tal, who attended a Prayer Breakfast at Mar-a-Lago days before the inauguration, said he had voiced his opposition to the hostage deal during the event. However, after hearing insights from high-level Washington insiders, he suggested there might be more to Trump’s decision than meets the eye. 'We’re trying to be very optimistic, and we’re hoping to see more steps from this administration [against Hamas],' Tal told The Media Line. He emphasized Trump’s understanding of the critical distinctions between good and evil, particularly regarding Iran. 'In Tehran, they’re chanting every single day, ‘Death to Israel, death to America,’' Tal said. 'I think America and Israel will stand together in this struggle against Iran.' Shortly after Trump announced during his inauguration speech that he desired to be remembered as a peacemaker and unifier, Tal commented that the statement led to speculation that the president might reconsider a U.S.-led strike on Iran. 'We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end,' Trump said. 'And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.' Eliza Laganas, who recently moved to Florida from New York and describes herself as a 'political refugee,' told The Media Line: 'Donald Trump fought for our country and fought for us so we could take back our country. And as a Jew, it’s even more important because Trump’s protection and love for Israel and the Jewish people are the greatest gift that we could have right now.' Laganas asserted that the events of October 7 would never have occurred if Trump had been in office. She added confidently, 'The next four years, it’ll never happen again.' Her daughter, Jaymes Laganas, echoed her mother’s sentiments, explaining that she also voted for Trump to restore American conservative values. 'I couldn’t ask for a better president to protect women’s rights,' Jaymes Laganas said. 'I think that [Trump] is definitely a president that will protect us as women, keep men out of women’s sports, [and] keep men out of women’s bathrooms.' On Monday night, Trump signed 78 executive orders, swiftly undoing several policies from the Biden administration. These actions underscored his administration’s unwavering support for Israel. Among the orders, Trump revoked sanctions on Israelis living in Judea and Samaria, reinforcing U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the region. He reimposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court, paused U.S. foreign aid programs—such as those benefiting UNRWA, accused of ties to Hamas—for a 90-day review to ensure alignment with his administration’s policies, and authorized the deportation of visa holders involved in pro-Hamas protests, riots, fundraising, or other activities promoting hateful ideologies on U.S. campuses. These measures sent a clear signal: Trump’s administration intends to prioritize Israel’s security and strengthen its standing on the global stage. 'We’re going to see what we can do to make Israel secure, safe and prosperous together with America,' Reinstein concluded. 'Everyone knows that America and Israel are back together.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syor3pav1e	2025-01-22T11:04:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/SyAIhYhD1x/SyAIhYhD1x_0_58_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
If only it had come sooner': Aid trucks flood Gaza amid cease-fi...	UN reports hundreds of aid trucks entering Gaza daily since cease-fire began, with 897 trucks crossing into enclave on Tuesday alone The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs confirmed that 897 aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, marking the third day of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Humanitarian aid began flowing into Gaza on Sunday, immediately after the cease-fire took effect at 11:15 a.m. That day, 630 trucks entered the Palestinian enclave. The number increased to 925 on Monday and reached 897 on Tuesday. The UN reported these figures based on information from Israeli authorities, Arab nations involved in brokering the cease-fire—Egypt and Qatar—and the United States. Under the cease-fire agreement, Israel is obligated to facilitate increased aid deliveries to Gaza, allowing up to 600 trucks daily during the first six weeks of the truce. Among the daily shipments are 50 trucks carrying fuel. Additionally, half of the aid trucks are designated for Gaza's northern region, the focal point of intense Israeli operations in recent months. Data from the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) showed that in December, 2,892 aid trucks entered Gaza. Much of the aid remains on the Gazan side of the border with Israel, awaiting distribution by UN agencies.

IDF liaison to Palestinians meets with Egyptian officials in Cairo to advance Gaza truce, focusing on reopening Rafah crossing under international oversight, while Israel continues security checks on aid trucks Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, met with Egyptian officials in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss the implementation of the next stage of the hostage deal and the Gaza cease-fire. Topics included continued humanitarian aid deliveries and the future reopening of the Rafah crossing, as stipulated in the framework agreement. Israel has agreed to allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks daily into Gaza under international oversight and to facilitate Rafah’s reopening as part of efforts to extend the deal and secure further hostage releases. The Defense Ministry emphasized that every truck entering Gaza undergoes Israeli security checks. Regarding Rafah’s reopening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that Palestinians crossing through the terminal in the future would require security clearance from the IDF and Shin Bet. 'The crossing will be managed by Gazans unaffiliated with Hamas, vetted by Shin Bet, with oversight from the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM),' the statement added. Netanyahu and his Cabinet have ruled out official Palestinian Authority (PA) involvement at Rafah. Israeli security officials have been tasked with identifying Gazan administrators unaffiliated with both Hamas and the PA to manage the crossing alongside the international mission. The crossing, previously controlled by Hamas, was destroyed by the IDF during operations in Rafah at the start of the war. Israel has firmly rejected any Hamas or Hamas-linked presence on the Gazan side of the crossing. According to the Saudi daily Asharq Al-Awsat, Israeli intelligence chiefs Mossad Director David Barnea and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar held extended talks in Cairo this week with Egyptian counterparts, including intelligence chief Hassan Rashad. The discussions reportedly focused on the management of Rafah and security along the Philadelphi Corridor, which stretches along the Gaza-Egypt border. A source from the joint cease-fire monitoring committee told the newspaper that 'an agreement has been reached for the PA to manage the Palestinian side of Rafah, with international oversight by the UN.' However, no timeline for reopening the crossing has been finalized, and disagreements remain over security arrangements for the Philadelphi Corridor. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The talks, which began on Monday, continued into Tuesday morning. The Egyptian delegation included senior intelligence officials overseeing Palestinian affairs. 'The remaining issues are technical and logistical, and they will be resolved,' the source said. Rafah has been a key conduit for aid into Gaza but has been closed since its capture by Israeli forces earlier in the war. Meanwhile, the team of U.S. President Donald Trump, now in his second term, is accelerating talks to solidify the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, is expected to arrive in Israel in the coming days to advance discussions on the matter. Reports suggest Witkoff was instrumental in convincing Prime Minister Netanyahu to approve the initial hostage deal. The envoy said he would be part of what he described as an inspection team deployed in and along the Gaza Strip to ensure cease-fire compliance. In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff also said he believed all countries in the region could get 'on board' to normalize ties with Israel. Asked to identify specific countries, he singled out Qatar, saying the Gulf country was a critical player in reaching the Gaza cease-fire deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk8s2napje	2025-01-22T09:59:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/19/Hkgk7FFvVT/Hkgk7FFvVT_0_36_1564_881_0_small.jpg

IDF soldier symbolically invites fallen friend who saved his life...	Harel Saidov, severely injured in Khan Younis building collapse last March, rescued by Eliya Hilel, who noticed he was still breathing; Hilel killed in West Bank ramming attack 2 months later; ahead of his wedding, Saidov places invitation on his grave When Harel Saidov lay beneath the rubble of a building in Khan Younis, bleeding and covered in broken concrete and dust, everyone thought he was dead. The helicopter, loaded with wounded soldiers, was preparing to take off when his teammate, Eliya Hilel, noticed his faint breathing and shouted, 'He’s alive!' Doctors doubted Saidov would survive, but he defied the odds and returned to life. On Thursday, as Saidov stands under the wedding chuppah, guests will notice an inscription on the pristine fabric: 'In memory of Eliya Hilel, may God avenge his blood, Iyar 22, 5784.' On May 29, 2024, three months after saving Saidov’s life and sustaining injuries himself, Staff Sergeant Eliya Hilel was killed in a ramming attack in the West Bank. He had been planning to propose to his girlfriend, Hadas, and had even purchased a custom engagement ring, but he never got the chance. Before Hilel’s funeral, his mother gave the ring to Hadas. Two days after his death, one of Hadas’ friends received a marriage proposal. 'It was painful for her that Hadas never got to experience that moment,' says Hilel's mother, Hannah. 'She approached me and said, ‘I want to get married under a canopy in Eliya's memory.’ We raised the funds and designed the canopy together. I was there at the wedding, and it was incredibly moving.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Then, that same friend suggested offering the canopy to other couples who wanted to get married in Eliya’s honor,' Hannah continues. 'We posted about it on Facebook, and, thank God, our schedule is now full through April. Weddings are happening all over the country. Our pain is eternal, but there’s comfort in knowing that even though Eliya never had the chance to stand under a canopy, he is now a source of shelter for couples starting their lives together in Israel.' Wedding invitations at the gravesites It seemed almost inevitable that on the day of Harel Saidov’s wedding to his fiancée, Idan Rafaeli, the ceremony would take place beneath the canopy created in Hilel’s memory. Hilel’s parents, Dror and Hannah, will be honored guests. But Saidov didn’t stop there. This week, Saidov’s mother, also named Hannah, placed wedding invitations on Hilel’s grave at Mount Herzl Military Cemetery. 'We left invitations on the graves of all my friends who fell in the war—three at Mount Herzl, one in Rehovot, and one in Shlomi,' Saidov shares. 'Since I’m a cohen and not allowed to enter cemeteries, my parents took care of it.' During the same incident in which Saidov was wounded, three of his teammates were killed: Sergeant Dolev Malca, Sergeant Afik Tery and Sergeant Inon Itzhak. In his wedding speech, Saidov plans to say, 'Just as we break a glass under the canopy to remember the destruction of the Temple during the happiest moment of our lives, so too, I will remember my friends who made this moment possible.' As he recites their names, Hilel’s will be among them. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hynt3crwjl	2025-01-22T08:56:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/yk14232001/yk14232001_0_116_472_266_0_small.jpg

In May, the military announced that Fayyad, the commander of Hamas’ Beit Hanoun Battalion, had been eliminated. The IDF said that Fayyad was responsible for planning and executing multiple anti-tank missile operations targeting Israeli territory during the war, as well as for mortar fire directed at Israeli communities in Gaza's northern border region. The release of the footage has prompted speculation about whether Fayyad survived the strike or if reports of his death were inaccurate.

Settlers say police officer fired wantonly in West Bank clashes	One of four settlers injured in shooting accuses police officer of 'firing in all directions' during clash; his lawyer criticizes officer’s release to house arrest as 'troubling' A settler injured during violent clashes in the West Bank accused a police officer of reckless behavior after opening fire on a group of settlers during confrontations in the villages of Funduq and Jinsafut. The settler, one of four injured in the incident—two critically—spoke out Wednesday, describing the chaotic scene. 'There were about 40 of us. Suddenly, we started getting shot at from all directions,' he said. 'Then we realized it was a police officer, firing in all directions like he’d lost control of his weapon.' The settler, who suffered a gunshot wound to the jaw, added, 'Miraculously—thank God—I’m still here. I’m scheduled for surgery to remove the bullet. Thankfully, it didn’t hit any arteries.' The shooting occurred after settlers clashed with Palestinians in what became a flashpoint since a shooting attack there earlier this month that killed three Israelis: police officer Elad Winkelstein, 35, and civilians Rachel Cohen, 70, and Aliza Reiss, 73. Reports suggest the officer, who was reportedly pepper-sprayed during the confrontation, opened fire as tensions escalated. The officer has since been questioned by the Department for Internal Police Investigations and released on house arrest under restrictive conditions. The investigation is ongoing, but concerns about a potential cover-up are already being raised. Attorneys Nati Rom and Haim Bleicher, representing the wounded settlers, have demanded access to the officer’s body camera footage and police communication recordings. They are also calling for the officer’s arrest until the investigation is complete. 'It’s troubling that the officer was only placed on house arrest,' Adv. Rom said. 'We hope there won’t be any attempts to cover this up, as has happened before. This is a grave incident that demands an immediate and serious investigation.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Police confirmed Tuesday night that no arrests have been made in connection to the incident, revealing that both a police officer and a soldier were involved. Military Police have joined the investigation, and the officer is now under scrutiny for alleged unlawful discharge of a firearm. The officer has been placed on house arrest until Friday, barred from entering police facilities for eight days, and prohibited from contacting others involved in the incident. Witnesses reported a heated argument between the officer and settlers before the shooting. Accounts from the scene suggest the officer and soldier appeared shaken after the incident, with reports that the soldier also fired his weapon. Questions persist regarding the officer’s claim that shots were intended to create distance, as the victims sustained injuries to their upper bodies. Defense Minister Israel Katz addressed the incident at a meeting of Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, saying, 'I strongly condemn any violence or attacks against Palestinians, and I deeply regret the tragedy that resulted in injuries.' He called for accountability, emphasizing, 'Those who break the law must face criminal proceedings, not administrative orders. Settlers must be subject to the same laws as anyone else in Israel.' Katz also urged settler leaders to condemn violence in the region, amid rising tensions following clashes in nearby Palestinian villages. Investigations into both the shooting and the broader unrest are ongoing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjz00qfavkx	2025-01-22T08:18:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/S1ZOYEnDkl/S1ZOYEnDkl_0_415_961_541_0_small.jpg
Clock ticks down on IDF's Lebanon pullout, but job remains unfini...	IDF plans to withdraw from Lebanon next week, 60 days after cease-fire began, but delays likely; terror infrastructure remains widespread, and Lebanese army struggles to meet IDF demands; Israel requests 'additional time' to complete objectives Thousands of IDF soldiers are stationed along the Lebanon border, from Rosh Hanikra to Mount Dov, and within the Shiite villages of southern Lebanon. They are working tirelessly, day and night, to uncover and destroy weapons and extensive terrorist infrastructure left near Israel's northern frontier. These soldiers are on high alert, awaiting instructions from Israel’s political leadership regarding the continuation of operations in southern Lebanon next week. On Sunday, under a cease-fire agreement, all Israeli forces are expected to withdraw, leaving Lebanon. At that point, Israel will have to rely on promises from the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) to remove Hezbollah and to dismantle the 'hell zones' where IDF forces have operated for months to thwart Hezbollah's stated plans to seize the Galilee. However, the work in Lebanon is far from over. Even today, IDF troops uncovered and confiscated a large cache of weapons during operations conducted by the 810th Brigade’s Combat Team, under the command of the 210th Division. The forces recently raided the complex terrain of Lebanon's Mount Dov area. The IDF has requested additional time from Israel’s political leadership to address the seemingly endless terrorist infrastructure hidden in numerous villages and areas that Israeli forces have not yet reached. Tomorrow, Israel’s Security Cabinet is expected to discuss the extension of IDF operations in southern Lebanon and the implementation of the cease-fire agreement. Political considerations and US influence Israel's political leadership is also awaiting signals from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump regarding expectations for Israeli actions in Lebanon starting next week. In recent weeks, the IDF has intensified efforts to destroy terrorist infrastructure and confiscate thousands of weapons, including rockets, anti-tank missiles, explosives and firearms, from villages that were cleared and ostensibly secured. For instance, IDF forces withdrew from the village of Naqoura, adjacent to UNIFIL’s main headquarters, earlier this month. There, Israeli troops uncovered a fully operational attack outpost system constructed by Hezbollah right under UNIFIL's watch. Similar operations were completed in central Lebanon, in areas such as Tayr Harfa and Yaroun. Now, IDF activities are concentrated in the eastern sector. The process of withdrawing IDF troops and handing control over to the Lebanese Armed Forces has proven to be complex and prolonged, defying the expectations of the United Nations and the United States. It seems likely that Israel will be granted an extension to complete its efforts to 'cleanse' the region of terrorist infrastructure. The IDF has refrained from setting a definitive timeline for completing its mission, emphasizing the need to ensure the security of Israel’s northern residents. However, military officials estimate that approximately 30 additional days will be required. Despite recent claims by UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces of 'achievements' in destroying Hezbollah's weapons, they have struggled to fully address the IDF's demands to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. Sunday marks the expiration of the 60-day deadline set in the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah. Under the agreement, only Lebanese security forces are permitted to operate south of the Litani River, and they are obligated to dismantle all Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure in the area. According to the Alma Research and Education Center, which studies security challenges in northern Israel, the agreement's real test will be the LAF's ability to operate south of the Litani, where the IDF did not maneuver and significant terrorist infrastructure remains intact. Alma President Lt. Col. (res.) Sarit Zehavi said, 'The coming days will test whether Lebanon has truly changed. Although a president and prime minister were recently appointed without Hezbollah’s direct endorsement, the presence of Hezbollah in the government would make meaningful change unlikely.' Zehavi also noted that while Joseph Aoun’s election as president marks an improvement for Lebanon, it is unlikely to affect Hezbollah’s military operations. 'As LAF commander since 2017, he has not curbed Hezbollah’s actions. During that time, Hezbollah expanded its military capabilities and acted freely in southern Lebanon while the LAF did nothing.' Despite Hezbollah’s current challenges in rearming, particularly due to disrupted smuggling routes from Syria, Zehavi remains critical of the ceasefire agreement, arguing that it demands an Israeli withdrawal before the full implementation of UN Resolution 1701. She emphasized the lack of a clear deadline for removing Hezbollah from south of the Litani River. 'The global context offers some opportunities, as the Shiite axis is weakened, and there is an international push for transparency and adherence to agreements. However, the burden remains on the IDF to ensure that Hezbollah cannot rebuild,' Zehavi said. Local leaders in northern Israel echo her concerns, demanding that the IDF maintain its presence in southern Lebanon for at least another year to establish a 'security zone.' Moshe Davidovich, head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council and chairman of the Frontline Forum, stated, 'The residents of the north have lost faith in the security system. The IDF must stay in key positions, and every violation must be met with force. We cannot trust anyone but the IDF.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: David Azoulay, head of the Metula Local Council, expressed deep concern over the security situation as the deadline approaches. 'No one is speaking with us. The army declared victory, but no one can tell me what happens next or how security will be ensured.' Tensions in Lebanon Lebanese media outlets have extensively covered the impending deadline, with reports suggesting that the IDF continues operations in southern Lebanon, including house demolitions and drone strikes. For instance, Al-Akhbar, a Hezbollah-affiliated publication, reported an Israeli drone strike in Wadi Khansa in southern Lebanon this morning. Meanwhile, Hezbollah-aligned networks have been sharing images of IDF vehicles in Lebanese border villages. The LAF has reportedly encountered Israeli forces in areas such as Tallousa, where the presence of IDF tanks delayed their entry. Despite the challenges, Lebanese leaders, including newly elected President Joseph Aoun, insist that Israel must adhere to the withdrawal timeline outlined in the ceasefire agreement. Hezbollah has also issued warnings. Galeb Abu Zeinab, a member of Hezbollah’s political council, threatened, 'If Israel does not fully withdraw from all Lebanese territories by Sunday, Monday will be a different day.' Hezbollah Secretary-General Naeem Qassem added, 'Our patience is not unlimited. Israel should not test it.' The situation remains tense, with residents of southern Lebanon preparing to return to their villages, some vowing to do so forcefully if Israel does not withdraw. As the deadline looms, uncertainty persists and the region remains on edge. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjafjfcpkg	2025-01-22T07:20:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/S1AdjcrAD1x/S1AdjcrAD1x_0_136_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Iraq approves law amendment amid outcry over potential child marr...	Parliament approves amendment allowing marriage laws to be governed by Islamic frameworks, sparking fears of child marriages as young as nine Iraq's parliament announced Tuesday the passage of an amendment to the Personal Status Law, triggering a wave of criticism over fears it could facilitate child marriages. While the amendment maintains the legal marriage age at 18—or 15 with judicial approval—it grants Iraqis the choice between civil or religious frameworks, including Shiite and Sunni laws, for managing family matters such as marriage. Critics argue that this shift risks undermining safeguards, potentially enabling unregistered marriages and child unions under certain interpretations of Shiite Islamic law. Some lawmakers present at the vote alleged procedural flaws and vowed to appeal. 'This decision threatens women’s rights and violates international principles of equality,' independent lawmaker Mohammed Abd al-Amir Anouz told AFP, warning the law could sidestep existing protections for women and girls. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Human rights organizations have condemned the amendment. Human Rights Watch stated in August that it could 'have disastrous effects on women’s and girls’ rights, allowing marriages for girls as young as 9,' and criticized the amendment as a significant setback for equality under Iraqi law. Amnesty International echoed the warning in October, cautioning that unregistered child marriages could leave women and girls without protections in cases of divorce or inheritance. The backlash extended to social media, where users decried the law. One widely shared post featuring a blindfolded girl read, 'Approving the Personal Status Law legitimizes injustice.' Another post condemned the amendment for 'placing marriage agreements in the hands of clerics without any rights for women.' Supporters of the law argue that it ensures freedom of belief by allowing Iraqis to choose their preferred legal framework. However, critics remain alarmed over its potential implications, with some viewing the amendment as a 'devastating step backward' for the rights of Iraqi women and girls. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/symkdwaw1l	2025-01-22T06:33:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/rJeO00cUAv1l/rJeO00cUAv1l_0_60_735_414_0_small.jpg

Katz to begin selection process for next IDF chief of staff	After Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi announced his retirement, defense minister will begin interviewing candidates Sunday for next IDF chief; Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Maj. Gen. (res.) Tamir Yadai shortlisted Defense Minister Israel Katz announced Wednesday that he will begin the selection process for the next IDF chief of staff following Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi’s decision to retire. Starting Sunday, Katz will interview candidates for the position, including Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Maj. Gen. Tamir Yadai. 'I intend to conduct an orderly and swift process to allow the incoming chief of staff to prepare for the numerous security challenges Israel faces at this time,' Katz said. He emphasized his goal of choosing the most suitable candidate to lead the IDF during a challenging period, citing David Ben-Gurion’s famous statement that every Israeli mother should know her sons are in the hands of capable commanders. Zamir is widely considered a leading candidate due to his extensive experience, professionalism and firm stance against downsizing the IDF. A close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Zamir has gained support for his leadership during wartime and his handling of arms procurements from the United States during the war. These efforts included acquiring fighter jets, munitions and boosting domestic defense production. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zamir served in the IDF for 38 years, holding numerous senior combat and command roles. As deputy chief of staff from 2018 to 2021 under Aviv Kochavi, he oversaw the multiyear 'Momentum' plan and led military assistance to civilians during the COVID-19 pandemic and May 2021's Operation Guardian of the Walls. Despite being considered for the chief of staff position in 2018, Zamir lost to Halevi, partially due to limited General Staff experience at the time. Deputy Chief of Staff Amir Baram is also vying for the position. Known for his operational expertise, Baram served as Northern Command chief and grew within the Paratroopers Brigade alongside Halevi, though they have represented different General Staff factions. Despite his involvement during the October 7 Hamas attack, Baram has distanced himself from its failures, earning respect for his support of Halevi during the war’s aftermath. Maj. Gen. Tamir Yadai, another candidate, brings significant field and operational experience but faces stiff competition from Zamir and Baram. The new Chief of Staff will inherit an IDF recovering from the unprecedented challenges of the October 7 Hamas assault and preparing for evolving threats in Gaza, Lebanon, and the West Bank. As the decision looms, Katz is under pressure to select a leader who can restore public confidence and strengthen the military during a critical period. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry00wntapje	2025-01-22T06:02:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/HyDWWF0Pke/HyDWWF0Pke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Yemen's Houthis release crew of Galaxy Leader after more than a y...	Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis have released the crew of the Galaxy Leader more than a year after they seized the vessel off the coast of Yemen, Al Masirah TV reported on Wednesday. The crew were handed to Oman 'in coordination' with Hamas after a cease-fire deal in Gaza was brokered with Israel, Al Masirah TV, which is owned by the Houthis, said. The vessel's crew is made up of 25 nationals from Bulgaria, Ukraine, the Philippines, Mexico and Romania, the ship's owner Galaxy Maritime said. The vessel was chartered by Japan's Nippon Yusen The Bahamas-flagged car carrier was taken to the port of Hodeidah in the Houthi-controlled north of Yemen after being boarded by the group at sea on Nov. 19, 2023 after the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea area since the war in what they describe as a show of their solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire last week, suspending a 15-month-old war that has devastated the Gaza Strip and inflamed the Middle East.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkj1murpjl	2025-01-22T04:31:27-08:00

Abraham Shield Plan is roadmap for meeting the regional dynamics ...	A comprehensive strategy proposed by Israel’s Coalition for Regional Security aims to stabilize the Middle East through Saudi normalization, Palestinian separation and a united front against Iran As Israel’s war in Gaza appears to be reaching an end, Israeli thinkers are hard at work developing a strategy to meet the new regional dynamics that have resulted from the war. Marking his inauguration the day after the first release of Israeli hostages as part of the current cease-fire-hostage deal, the Coalition for Regional Security sent U.S. President Donald Trump its Abraham Shield Plan. This comprehensive strategy outlines a bold roadmap to stabilize the Middle East, neutralize regional threats, and secure lasting peace and prosperity for Israel and the region. The plan seeks to capitalize on the momentum generated by Israel’s military achievements and the unfolding hostage and cease-fire deal to reshape the region’s security framework, foster economic integration and establish a durable alliance between Israel and moderate Arab states. According to the coalition, this initiative is pivotal to uniting Israel with moderate Arab nations, forging an 'iron shield' against Iran and its proxies, and charting a new regional order that prioritizes stability and collaboration. The Coalition for Regional Security has urged bold U.S. leadership to ensure the success of the Abraham Shield Plan, highlighting the stakes of normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia while advancing a separation framework with the Palestinians. Brig. Gen. (res.) Udi Dekel, a founding partner of the coalition, described the plan as an opportunity to transform the Middle East. 'President Trump’s leadership is essential to realizing this vision and seizing this historic moment,' Dekel said. Polling data underscores strong public backing in Israel, with 72.5% of respondents supporting a U.S.-led initiative under Trump’s leadership to achieve hostage returns, Saudi normalization, and the formation of a regional coalition to counter Iran. Coalition’s vision for postwar stability The Coalition for Regional Security, established one year into the war, aims to chart a new path in the Middle East, rooted in the belief that Israel’s military successes must be translated into a comprehensive strategy for the 'day after' the conflict. The initiative, formed by five prominent Israeli figures – Dekel, Lianne Pollak-David, Koby Huberman, Moty Cristal, and Attila Somfalvi – focuses primarily on Israeli security, regional order and economic opportunities, with the goal of ensuring stability and long-term peace for the region. 'Our goal is to translate the unbelievable military achievements that Israel was able to obtain throughout this war into a future that provides a new regional order,' according to Pollak-David, one of the founders of the coalition and a former adviser in Israel’s National Security Council. Broad support for the coalition The coalition has already gained significant support from Israeli society, with over 100 senior figures backing its efforts. Pollak-David said that notable backers include former ministers, security experts, businesspeople, tech leaders, and diplomats. According to its leaders, the coalition’s ultimate goal is to create a stable environment that allows for lasting peace. 'This war is over, Gaza is in ruins, and Hamas as a fighting force is threadbare. It’s vital to have a plan for the ‘day after’ that brings peace in this area of the globe,' said Josh Hantman, former adviser to Israel’s Defense Ministry and a partner in the coalition. Normalization and separation plans As part of its plan to achieve security and stability, the coalition proposes pursuing normalization with Saudi Arabia and carrying out 'a gradual, responsible, secure path of separation from the Palestinians.' Pollak-David cited research showing that more than three-quarters of Israelis support peace with Saudi Arabia and around two-thirds support separation from the Palestinians. One of the plan’s conditions for separation from the Palestinians is that Hamas will not be represented in Palestinian political bodies. Pollak-David described Hamas in Gaza as 'almost completely eradicated,' but according to Hantman, there’s no guarantee that the group won’t see a resurgence. 'If we leave a vacuum, Hamas will simply return,' he said. Stabilizing Gaza through regional cooperation The Coalition for Regional Security plan proposes establishing a technocratic government in Gaza, aimed at providing essential services and overseeing reconstruction efforts. 'This government would be tasked with ensuring the smooth rebuilding of Gaza and the management of humanitarian aid, all while maintaining stability in the region,' Pollak-David explained. She outlined the role that Arab states could play in stabilizing Gaza. 'Egypt and Jordan will be useful to monitor security inside the strip through a police and security system,' she said, explaining that Israel’s military won’t remain in Gaza under their plan. Pollak-David also noted that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have both successfully led internal deradicalization efforts that could be relevant for Gaza’s future. The coalition hopes to harness those countries’ successes in rebuilding Gaza. Role of Arab nations in regional stability Danny Ayalon, former ambassador of Israel to the U.S. and a partner in the coalition, also underscored the importance of Arab nations in the region’s future. 'Moderate countries such as the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain must be involved in stabilizing the Palestinian situation and contributing to the regional economy,' he said. Economic opportunities: The Cotton Road initiative Beyond security and governance, the coalition also seeks to establish economic cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, which could further solidify regional stability. Cooperation, while largely behind the scenes, has already begun in various sectors, including technology and infrastructure investments. Ayalon described the vision of an economic corridor between Asia and Europe via Israel. This 'Cotton Road' would provide a strategic alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, enhancing trade and economic ties between the Gulf, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Europe, and the US (where goods would be shipped after arriving in Europe). For Israel, potential economic opportunities include sharing innovation and technology with other countries in the region. 'Israeli advancements in water tech, food tech, and agri-tech can enable immense cooperation with Arab partners in the region, especially in the Gulf,' Ayalon said. Ayalon’s own company, Silver Road Capital, is prepared to invest billions in Palestinian high-tech startups and other industries that could foster economic growth and regional partnerships. 'We are ready to introduce and push economic opportunities in the region, starting from the Palestinian territories, once stability is reached,' he explained. He also highlighted the potential for joint tourism initiatives, particularly in regions of Israel and the Palestinian territories rich in biblical and archaeological significance. Addressing settlements and long-term peace Settlements remain a sensitive issue, one that the coalition seeks to address pragmatically. Pollak-David acknowledged the challenges posed by Israeli settlements in the West Bank, particularly considering the broader regional context. 'The violence of the settlers has to end right now,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She said that a practical division of settlement blocks and illegal settlements must be discussed in future negotiations. Hantman described the issue of settlements as tied to final-status negotiations, which aren’t emphasized in the coalition’s plan. 'The coalition’s focus is on ensuring security and avoiding steps that undermine the overall stability,' he explained. By focusing on Israeli security, regional collaboration, and economic integration, the Coalition for Regional Security has set out to build a new regional order—one that could potentially reshape the region’s geopolitical landscape. Only time will tell whether the initiative will succeed.

Victory for Prince Harry as Murdoch papers admits wrongdoing by S...	Prince Harry settled his privacy claim against Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper group on Wednesday after the publisher admitted unlawful actions at its Sun tabloid for the first time, bringing the fiercely-contested legal battle to a dramatic end. In a stunning victory for Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles, News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, also admitted it had intruded into the private life of his late mother, Princess Diana. Harry's lawyer, David Sherborne, said the publisher had agreed to pay the prince substantial damages. A source familiar with the settlement said it involved an eight-figure sum. Harry had been suing NGN at the High Court in London, accusing its newspapers of unlawfully obtaining private information about him from 1996 until 2011. The trial to consider the royal's case, and a similar lawsuit from former senior British lawmaker Tom Watson, was due to start on Tuesday but following last-gasp talks, the two sides reached a settlement, with NGN saying there had been wrongdoing at The Sun, something it had denied for years.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hymwnuadyx	2025-01-22T02:23:15-08:00

Inbar Rosenfeld says former hostage wished to see her oldest friend and adds that her physical condition is fine despite her injuries, but he worries about her mental health Inbar Rosenfeld, 28, a childhood friend of former hostage Emily Damari, 28, who was released from Hamas captivity on Sunday alongside Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher, shared his experience meeting her at Sheba Medical Center. 'It was incredibly emotional. I needed someone to touch me with a stick to believe it was real,' Rosenfeld told Ynet. Rosenfeld, a resident of Kibbutz Kfar Aza and a lifelong friend of Emily, said that Emily's 'brother called me and said she wanted to see me. Emily is still Emily — that's her personality. But there are many things that have changed. You can see it in her eyes and body language. There’s a significant change, naturally. Still, her humor and joking — that’s who she is and it’s what kept her going.' Rosenfeld addressed Emily’s 471 days in Gaza, saying: 'She had some awareness, listened to a bit of radio and saw a little TV. She knew about her friends from Kfar Aza who were murdered but wasn’t fully informed. She was curious but only slightly connected to the outside.' Now the whole world knows that Emily lost two fingers due to terrorist gunfire on October 7. 'It seems everything's okay, though she has injuries to her leg and hand. But like all of us, we're wounded on the inside. Those things aren't visible — they need time to settle,' he said. Emily’s mother, Mandy, shared the first photo of her daughter without the bandages on her fingers tht she returned with from Gaza. 'Thank you to everyone in the UK and worldwide for the support campaign to bring Emily home,' she wrote on X. 'You’re amazing and we love you all. There are still 94 hostages who need us.' Emily, a British citizen, quickly became a symbol of resilience. Upon her release, she reportedly pushed one of the Hamas captors as she exited the vehicle at the Red Cross handover point. She also demonstrated her defiance in a phone call with her brother, showing him her amputated fingers.

IDF officer who lost his hand in Gaza was injured in Tel Aviv sta...	Captain A., who was injured in the war in Gaza and lost his right hand, went out in Tel Aviv with friends and intervened where a Moroccan national with a US Green Card, stabbed some of his friends Captain A., an armor officer who was injured in the war in Gaza and lost his right hand, was slightly injured on Tuesday night in the stabbing attack in Nahalat Binyamin in Tel Aviv. 'Today I am at the Tactical Command College, in a company commander course. I went out with my friends from the course to Nahalat Binyamin, and during the outing a terrorist came and tried to stab one of us. As soon as I noticed the incident, I tried to hit the terrorist and we chased him. I was injured and am currently being treated at Ichilov Medical Center with a minor hand injury, and I expect to return to the course tomorrow and continue as usual,' A. said on Tuesday. The IDF reported that A. acted to neutralize the terrorist at the scene, and was taken to Ichilov Hospital for treatment. The terrorist, Kaddi Abdelaziz, a 29-year-old Moroccan citizen, held an American Green Card and arrived in Israel only three days before the attack. When he entered Israel through Ben Gurion Airport, the border inspector thought he was suspicious and pulled him over for questioning. He was refused entry and transferred to the Shin Bet, but they eventually approved his entry. In Tuesday's attack, the terrorist stabbed five people in Tel Aviv. One was seriously injured, one moderately injured and three lightly injured. The terrorist was eliminated by soldiers passing by the area. Abdelaziz stabbed the victims during Nahalat Binyamin Street's bustling hours on a regular evening. He also stabbed an American tourist after stabbing four Israelis. Soldiers from the elite Shaldag unit, who heard the American tourist's screams, came down from their house, one of them in uniform and another in pajamas and neutralized the terrorist. 'We came down from the house, and saw him knocking a civilian to the floor. We shouted at him to stop and shot when he refused. We fired four bullets in total,' according to one. Bystanders who heard the gunshots of the terrorist being neutralized panicked, entered restaurants and hid under tables. The Shin Bet said that the terrorist's entry to Israel would be investigated. 'When the subject entered Israel, he underwent a security assessment that included his interrogation as well as additional tests. Finally, it was decided that there was no reason to prevent his entry into Israel. The case will be investigated,' the agency said. It was enough to look at his social media posts to understand that his entry could be problematic. The terrorist had previously shared posts in favor of Gaza, and against Israel. Among other things, he accused Israel of starving the northern Gaza Strip, and claimed that 'half a million Gazans are in danger of dying of hunger there.' He shared a video praising Islam with the caption 'free Palestine' and a picture of the terrorist Ibrahim Nablusi, who was eliminated in Nablus. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His American ID card states that he was born in Morocco, and on his Facebook page on September 14, 2022, he shared a picture of himself flying from there to New York - and wrote 'Alhamdulillah.' After the October 7 massacre, Abdelaziz published a post in which he wrote: 'What is happening now may be the reason for doubling the number of martyrs who are being tortured for Islam.' Shortly after Tuesday's attack his identity was published and the terrorist's Facebook was deleted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkoau4ad1e	2025-01-22T01:04:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/HkZicIFTwkx/HkZicIFTwkx_0_92_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Palestinian Authority reportedly to manage Gaza's Rafah crossing ...	Netanyahu publicly opposes the arrangement, but according to a source in the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, during the visit of the Mossad and Shin Bet heads in Cairo, an agreement was reached that has Palestinian Authority managing crossing on the Gaza side 'under international supervision'; There are still remaining disputes - and the question of withdrawing from Philadelphi Corridor: 'We want to return to the situation that existed before the war' Following the visit of Mossad head Dedi Barnea and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar to Egypt, the London-based Arabic language Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported that an agreement had been reached on the control mechanism at the Rafah Crossing, which the IDF took over in May. According to a source in the joint cease-fire monitoring team, the talks also dealt with security arrangements on the Philadelphi Corridor, and not just the issue of the Rafah Crossing on the Gaza side. 'The parties reached an agreement regarding the management of the crossing on the Palestinian side. It was agreed that it would be managed by the Palestinian Authority, under international supervision and monitoring by the UN,' claimed the same source, who spoke to the newspaper on condition of anonymity, noting that it had not yet been decided when the crossing would be returned to operation. In addition, according to the source, no agreement was reached regarding the Philadelphi Corridor. The Rafah Crossing served as a central hub for transferring aid to the Gaza Strip at the beginning of the war and has been closed since it was taken over by the IDF. The appendix to the cease-fire agreement, signed last week in Qatar, stated that Israel would now be required to work to reopen it, and that its forces would 'redeploy around' the crossing based on maps to be agreed upon between the parties, without specifying whether there would be an actual withdrawal from there. The maps themselves, which depict the IDF’s gradual withdrawal and redeployment of its forces during the cease-fire, have not yet been revealed. Netanyahu has previously opposed the possibility of Palestinian Authority representatives activating the crossing, and the appendix did not specify exactly how it would be activated. 'The crossing will be activated based on the discussions from August 2024 with Egypt,' the appendix stated, without elaborating. According to the Saudi report, the meetings that began in Cairo on Monday lasted until the early hours of Tuesday morning - and were attended by Barnea and Bar, as well as Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad, and a number of senior officials responsible for the Palestinian issue in Egyptian intelligence. 'The remaining disputes are technical and logistical and they will be resolved,' the source said. Regarding the Philadelphi Corridor, the report claims, Israel has proposed implementing partial withdrawals from the axis, but Egypt insists on a full withdrawal. 'Cairo wants to return to the situation that existed before the war,' the source noted. 'We also discussed in the meeting the possibility of changing the crossing agreement later. What has been determined now is temporary and concerns this stage only.' Meanwhile, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said that 'the responsibility to maintain the cease-fire in Gaza is the responsibility of all of us in the region.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel did not commit to a full withdrawal from the corridor in the first phase of the deal and cease-fire, but only to a 'reduction' of its presence. According to the appendix to the deal, the details of which were obtained last week, the withdrawal from there is supposed to begin only on the last day of the first phase, day 42, when the last hostages of 33 hostages will be released as part of that phase. However, since that agreement was signed, Israeli officials have insisted that there will be no actual withdrawal - and their statements cast doubt on the fact that the agreement stipulates that even if an agreement on Phase Two is not reached by the end of the first phase, the temporary cease-fire will continue as long as the negotiations continue - with the mediators, including the U.S., committed to guarantee this. Last week, Palestinian Authority officials claimed in a conversation with Ynet that President-elect Donald Trump asked Ramallah to control the Gaza Strip's crossings, and 'especially' the Rafah crossing, in coordination with Israel and Egypt. > annex	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rks8f4cdkg	2025-01-22T00:56:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/19/Hkgk7FFvVT/Hkgk7FFvVT_0_66_1564_881_0_small.jpg

Between fear and hope: Hostages' relatives talk about deal's seco...	Daniel, grandson of hostage Oded Lifshitz, and Alon, father of captive IDF soldier Tamir Nimrodi, talk with Ynet and express their faith in the new deal and frustration that it is taking place so late Following the release of the three first Israeli hostages as part of the second hostage deal with Hamas on Sunday, 30 additional captives are expected to be released throughout the deal’s first phase including Oded Lifshitz, abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. His grandson Daniel, in an interview with Ynet, described the tension and anxiety he and the rest of the family felt during his more than 15-month captivity and expected return. 'Every piece of information has us jumping from the chair. And as much as it was so hard, we've been waiting for that. So I receive it with a blessing and with love. It's much better than looking to the skies and praying or going to Doha and DC or the Knesset,' he said. When asked if his family is already preparing for Oded’s return as part of the deal, he said: 'We've been speaking about it on Friday dinner, but it's very difficult. We don't have a solution on how to prepare for receiving someone either for a festival or for a funeral. So for the moment we are not preparing, it's too hard.' 'Today is the day of new history, also the return of the body of Oron Shaul after more than 10 years and the three hostages that I've seen that Hamas already passed the list to the mediators and to Israel and hopefully, Arbel Yehud will be on the list and we will be able to have that closure and some more families will have closure, but it's unimaginable.' He also addressed the family’s frustration at the possibility that the deal could have taken place months ago. 'If I look back, I think so many things could have happened months ago, I think this phase to release the women, the elderly and the wounded should have been done after a week or two weeks with my grandmother. The world really failed us. This deal could have happened maybe in May or July.' 'We are really lucky that we got [President Donald] Trump because his election changed everything and the work [Mideast envoy Steve] Witkoff has done when he came here over both sides: Prime Minister Netanyahu and from the other side, suddenly the Qataris place much more pressure and from what I've heard, Witkoff and Al Thani, the Prime Minister of Qatar, were the main ones that let this deal happen,' he added. When asked how his grandmother Yocheved Lifshitz, who was released in the first hostage deal in November 2023, felt about the new deal, he said, 'I think she's surprised that this deal happened. She was very pessimistic. But now when it's starting, she will be so happy to see everyone come home and she's really waiting for the 97 hostages to come home. She will do a countdown until the last one. When the last one will be here, then she can move on mentally.' Alon Nimrodi, father of captive IDF soldier Tamir Nimrodi, also spoke with Ynet about the current deal and his hopes that his son will return to Israel in the deal’s second phase. 'I hope so, but as I said a few months ago, this will be a horrible agreement. And it's a horrible agreement because we didn't discuss all of the hostages. We needed to write all the 98, now 97 names of hostages to bring them back home,' he said. 'The second phase is horrible because we didn't start it nor the first phase. We don't know if there were any violations since the agreements were signed and we still don't know how we’ll proceed with the agreement. The second phase will take a longer time but we hold onto faith,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Alon also expressed his frustration over the fact that IDF soldiers taken hostage will remain imprisoned until the deal’s second phase. 'We are frustrated because my son and all the hostages were sent by the country, by the army to serve there and nobody cared about them. It's been 471 days and they were left behind even after the last Thai hostages returned home,' he said. 'It's a disaster, we can't handle it, it's terrible,' he added. 'I don't know how the government can sleep at night with those choices.' When asked what his message was to decision-makers and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he said: 'Bring them back all home now, make agreements, talk about the second phase right now. You must put all the names on the list and stop bullsh*tting us.' 'You must do it. You are talking about human beings.

Go to Gaza': Mall clerk hurls racist insults at Arab shoppers be...	Two Arab shoppers recount their attempts to return a coat to a mall store because it was the wrong size only to be denied and face racially charged comments A mother and daughter from the Arab city of Tayibe in central Israel experienced racist treatment on Monday from a saleswoman at a clothing store in a mall in the Sharon region. The saleswoman mocked and cursed at them during the incident. Following the event the store owner decided to fire the saleswoman, who was caught on video insulting the mother and her pregnant daughter, saying, 'You and your fetus are wh*res. Go to Gaza; maybe there’s a mall there.' The mother and daughter responded: 'You’ve crossed all lines. No saleswoman ever called us wh*re before.' 'A few days ago, we bought a coat from the store and wanted to return it because the size didn’t fit,' the mother told Ynet. 'The saleswoman told us, ‘I’ve closed the register and I can’t accept anything,’ even though there was still an hour and a half until closing time. 'I asked to speak to the manager and she called someone, then came back claiming: ‘You’ve worn the coat, and it has cigarette marks.’ We told her that wasn’t true, that we’re well-mannered and don’t deceive people,' she recounted. 'We’ve been shopping at this place for years. At that moment, I was shocked when the saleswoman said, ‘Why are you shouting?’ — even though I wasn’t shouting. She continued to curse at me and my daughter, calling us wh*res and saying, ‘Go to Gaza.’ Her words deeply hurt us.'

Trump's team said working on Phase 2 of Gaza cease-fire	They acknowledge that there may be difficulties in implementing the second phase of the deal, which is supposed to include a permanent cease-fire; Trump: 6 months ago, there were 11 more hostages alive U.S. President Donald Trump's new foreign policy team has already begun working on formulating the second phase of the cease-fire in Gaza, which should lead to the release of the rest of the hostages and a permanent cease-fire in the Strip. According to a report on the Politico website, Trump's people admitted that there may be difficulties on the way to the next phase - and blamed the previous administration of Joe Biden. 'What Biden left us with is the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end,' said one official involved in the negotiations. On Tuesday night, Trump was asked if he planned to travel to the Middle East, and said: 'We’re thinking about going to the Middle East — not yet. We have a thing called ‘the hostages are coming back’ going on right now. Some of them were badly hurt. You see this young woman with her hand that was shot . It was terrible. If I weren’t here, that they wouldn’t be back ever. They would all be dead. If it had been done a year earlier, if Biden had done it a year and a half, two years earlier, it wouldn't have happened.' 'October 7th was not supposed to happen. But through weakness, they let it happen. It's a disaster. JYou go back just six months, many of these young people were living, there were 11 more hostages alive,' Trump said. 'You know, young people don't die like that at 22-23, but now they're dying, And you wonder why they're dying; they're being killed, really killed, and they're just dying. But Biden couldn't make it end, and it was only when I set a deadline - they did it,' Trump continued. 'It's a very sad situation. It should never have happened.' According to Trump, what is happening in the Middle East would not have happened under him. 'Iran would have been poor, they had no money. There was no money for Hamas and there was no money for Hezbollah. October 7 would not have happened, but these are the cards that were dealt to me - and we're getting the hostages back - which would never have happened under Biden. They would never have come back, they just died slowly,' he said. According to the report, Trump's people plan to emphasize and prioritize efforts to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Those who will deal with this will be Trump's new Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and his national security adviser Mike Walz - who said last week that this is a priority for the new administration in Washington.

Negotiations on the second phase will not begin until the 16th day of the first phase, and in order to reach it, Hamas is demanding an end to the war and a complete withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza – while Israel will demand the end of Hamas rule and the exile of its leaders, and insists that it can return to fighting if the negotiations fail. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy00lxmrwyl	2025-01-21T22:17:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/HykysYnP1g/HykysYnP1g_0_27_800_451_0_small.jpg

Kaddi Abdelaziz in social media posts accused Israel of starving Gazans and shared images glorifying a terrorist; Despite failing to provide clear answers to border control officials at Ben Gurion Airport, Shin Bet approved his entry after further questioning; 3 days later he stabbed 5 people The terrorist who stabbed five people in Tel Aviv’s bustling Nachalat Binyamin area on Tuesday night has been identified as Kaddi Abdelaziz, a 29-year-old Moroccan man with a U.S. green card. He arrived in Israel just three days prior to the attack, and raised suspicions at Ben Gurion Airport. According to a border control officer, Abdelaziz could not provide a clear reason for his visit, failing to explain his purpose and say whom he was meetin or whether he intended to work in Israel. His evasive responses led to an immediate referral to the Shin Bet for further interrogation. Despite the concerns raised, security officials ultimately approved his entry. Interior Minister Moshe Arbel noted that border control officers from the Population and Immigration Authority identified Abdelaziz as a threat in real time and sought to prevent him from entering Israel. He was transferred to Shin Bet security officials for further questioning, who ultimately allowed him to enter Israel. 'I commend and appreciate the border control officers of the Population and Immigration Authority who identified in real time and sought to prevent the entry into Israel of the terrorist from the attack in Tel Aviv upon his arrival at Ben Gurion Airport on 18.1.25 and transferred him for questioning to security officials who unfortunately decided to allow his entry into Israel,' Arbel said. 'Unfortunately, security authorities decided otherwise. I urge Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar to investigate this grave incident and draw conclusions swiftly,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In response, the Shin Bet stated that Abdelaziz underwent a comprehensive security evaluation, including questioning and additional checks, before determining there was no sufficient basis to deny him entry on security grounds. 'The case is under review,' the agency added. Officials clarified that Shin Bet does not grant entry permits but only advises against entry when clear security threats are identified. Further investigations revealed that Abdelaziz had previously shared inflammatory posts on social media, including pro-Gaza and anti-Israel content. In one post, he accused Israel of starving civilians in northern Gaza and claimed that 'half a million Gazans are at risk of dying from hunger.' He also shared a video praising Islam accompanied by the slogan 'Free Palestine' and a photo of slain terrorist Ibrahim al-Nabulsi. Abdelaziz’s American documentation indicates he was born in Morocco. His Facebook activity suggests he traveled to New York in September 2022, where he posted, 'Alhamdulillah,' alongside a photo of himself. Following the October 7 Hamas terror attack, Abdelaziz shared a post referring to the events as a potential reason for 'doubling the number of martyrs for Islam.' Shortly after the attack and the release of his identity, Abdelaziz’s Facebook profile was deleted. The incident has sparked public debate over border security protocols and the handling of individuals flagged as potential threats, particularly during heightened tensions in the region. Faisal Marjani, a Moroccan citizen and the president and founder of the Moroccan Coexistence Association, condemned the attack, telling Ynet: 'I heard about the incident and it saddened me. The Moroccan Coexistence Association condemns the cowardly act of terrorism that harmed innocent citizens in Israel, and confirms its firm position rejecting any form of violence and terrorism. This despicable act reflects the escalation of incitement and hate speech led by several media outlets, led by Al-Jazeera, which continues to broadcast misleading discourse and spread hatred against Jews and Israelis. Terrorism, which does not recognize borders or religious affiliation, is a global state scourge that all forces must confront by all legal and moral means.' He added: 'The association confirms that this person of Moroccan origin who committed this heinous act represents only himself and his personal extremism, while the entire Moroccan people stand united against terrorism and extremism. The Moroccan Coexistence Association confirms that Morocco adopts a strict policy in dealing with all forms of violence and terrorism and is committed to applying the law firmly to anyone who dares to threaten the security and stability of societies. Moroccan law constitutes the first line of defense against all forms of extremism and hatred and constitutes a fundamental pillar in promoting values ​​of tolerance and coexistence between the various components of society.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkpwxipv1g	2025-01-21T14:01:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/SJAkfcTv1l/SJAkfcTv1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF must now withdraw from Lebanon: 6,000 Lebanese soldiers said ...	Under cease-fire agreement, the IDF must complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon by Sunday; Western diplomats report that the Lebanese Armed Forces have already carried out 100 operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure, noting, 'It’s likely some requests came from the IDF' Under the terms of the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the IDF is required to complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon and redeploy along the Israeli side of the Blue Line, the internationally recognized border, by Sunday, January 26. 'The deadline itself is not critical, but it’s important to create a sense of momentum, and we hope it can be maintained as the IDF continues its withdrawal,' a senior Western diplomat said. The diplomat noted that Israel has already withdrawn from two areas: Al-Khiam in December and Al-Naqoura in early January, following a meeting of the cease-fire enforcement mechanism and a visit by U.S. Special Envoy Amos Hochstein to Lebanon. 'We expect further Israeli withdrawals and a new deployment,' the diplomat added. The cease-fire enforcement mechanism is preparing a plan for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to redeploy in areas vacated by the IDF, including detailed timelines and locations. Since the cease-fire began, the LAF has deployed 6,000 soldiers in southern Lebanon, conducting over 100 operations to neutralize Hezbollah infrastructure, including the destruction of rocket launchers, buildings and other facilities. According to Western diplomats, about one-third of these operations were initiated by the LAF, with the remainder carried out at the request of the U.S.-led enforcement mechanism. It is believed that some of these requests originated from Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Diplomats emphasized that the withdrawal process requires political commitment from both sides. 'The IDF is acting based on decisions from Israel’s political leadership. We believe they understand what needs to be done, but it’s difficult to predict how it will unfold,' one diplomat said. 'The LAF must continue dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure, while the IDF needs to facilitate the LAF’s access to vacated areas. It’s a parallel process that must move forward together,' the diplomat added. Lebanon has entered a period of political opportunity following the appointment of a new president and prime minister. 'Our message to Israel is to support – or at least not hinder – the efforts of Lebanon’s new government. They deserve a chance,' said the diplomats. Meanwhile, Syria’s new government issued a statement pledging to maintain stability along its shared border with Lebanon. Syria has also signaled to the international community and Israel its intent to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from resuming arms transfers from Syria into Lebanon. This development is seen as a significant step forward for both Lebanon and Israel. As the deadline approaches, all eyes are on the region to see if the delicate balance of military withdrawal and political cooperation can be sustained to ensure long-term stability. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sygfivap1l	2025-01-21T13:04:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/BkBMmbGhHkl/BkBMmbGhHkl_0_167_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Yemen Red Sea port capacity down sharply after hostilities, UN sa...	Operations at a Red Sea port in Yemen used for aid imports have fallen to about a quarter of its capacity, a UN official said on Tuesday, adding it was not certain that a Gaza cease-fire would end attacks between the Iran-backed Houthis and Israel. Houthis have launched attacks on international shipping near Yemen since November 2023 in solidarity with Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. This has prompted Israel to strike port and energy facilities, including the Red Sea port of Hodeidah. '(The) impact of airstrikes on Hodeidah Harbour, particularly in the last weeks, is very important,' Julien Harneis, U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Yemen told a U.N. meeting in Geneva on Tuesday via videolink. Four of the port's five tugboats needed to escort the large ships bringing imports had sunk, while the fifth was damaged, he said, without attributing blame. 'The civilian crews who man them are obviously very hesitant. The capacity of the harbor is down to about a quarter,' he added, saying the port was used to transit a significant portion of imported aid. Since a Gaza ceasefire agreement last week, Yemen's Houthis have said they will limit their attacks on commercial vessels to Israel-linked ships, provided the Gaza cease-fire is fully implemented.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj7hsftdkg	2025-01-21T12:03:32-08:00	
Hezbollah commander shot dead outside his home	Mohammed Hammadi, commander of Hezbollah's western al-Baqaa region, was shot by gunmen and died in hospital; It is currently unclear what the motive was and who was responsible for the shooting The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, affiliated with Hezbollah, reported Tuesday evening that the commander of Hezbollah's western al-Baqaa region, Mohammed Hammadi, was shot dead in front of his home. According to security sources who spoke to the Saudi Al-Hadath channel, gunmen who arrived in two vehicles shot Hammadi. He was taken from the scene to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. It is unclear what the motive for the shooting was, and who was responsible for it. On Sunday, the 60 days of the first phase of the cease-fire in the north are set to end, after which the IDF must, according to the agreement between Israel and Lebanon, complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon and deploy on the Israeli side of the border. 'The deadline is not important in itself, but it is important to create a sense of dynamism and we hope that it can be maintained and that the IDF will continue to withdraw from the positions it holds,' said a senior Western diplomat about the date by which the IDF must complete the withdrawal.

According to Magen David Adom emergency service, two young men in their 20s were moderately injured and a man in his 50s was lightly injured. The forces are conducting additional searches in the area. It is suspected that the terrorist arrived on a motorcycle - and the rider who drove him fled. Security forces are conducting searches in the area. The attacker has been identified as a permanent resident of the U.S. originally from Morocco who arrived in Israel three days ago. The stabbings occurred while the street was bustling with life, as it is every evening. People who heard the gunshots fired at the stabber panicked, entered restaurants and hid under tables. Passersby who witnessed the stabbings, who are IDF soldiers from an elite unit, neutralized the terrorist. 'We came down from the house, and saw the terrorist knocking a civilian to the floor. We shouted at him to stop and shot him when he refused. We fired four bullets in total,' they said. According to an eyewitness, 'the terrorist got off the scooter and the driver continued driving.' Aviyah, who works at a bar near the scene of the attack, said: 'We didn't hear anything outside, and then we saw a lot of people running and people with guns drawn.

Trump launches presidency with bold executive orders. What comes ...	Live from Washington: Trump expressed belief in the potential for peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia U.S. President Donald Trump wasted no time advancing his agenda and fulfilling the promises he made to the people of the United States. Trump took swift action to honor his campaign commitments, rolling back nearly 80 executive orders signed by the Biden administration. Among these were measures emphasizing his administration’s strong support for Israel. Trump revoked sanctions on Israelis living in Judea and Samaria, reinforcing U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty. He restored sanctions on the International Criminal Court, paused U.S. foreign aid programs—such as those benefiting UNRWA, accused of ties to Hamas—for a 90-day review to ensure alignment with administration policies, and authorized the removal of visa holders involved in pro-Hamas protests, riots, or fundraising on U.S. campuses, as well as those supporting hateful ideologies, among other orders. These actions came just hours after Trump was inaugurated. In his speech, he expressed satisfaction that the day before he took office, Israeli hostages had begun returning to their families. During Monday night’s inaugural parade, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff welcomed the families of American and Israeli hostages onto the stage. Witkoff, a key figure in brokering the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal, received a standing ovation alongside the families as they shook hands with First Lady Melania Trump. However, when Trump signed his executive orders, a reporter asked about his confidence in the Gaza deal progressing to Phase III, which aims to return the remaining 94 hostages to Israel. Trump admitted he was not confident. On a more optimistic note, Trump expressed belief in the potential for peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. When asked by a reporter, 'Will you push Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations?' Trump responded, 'I don't think I have to push them. I think it's going to happen.' Trump emphasized his desire for a legacy as a peacemaker and unifier, leading some to speculate he may no longer pursue a U.S.-led strike on Iran. In his inaugural speech, he stated: 'We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.' The entire environment was electric, and there were certainly many Jews from across the United States who came to Washington to attend the celebrations, as well as a number of Israelis. Here’s what some of them had to say: 'We fought, fought, and we won, won, won,' said Santo Aquila of New York. 'We trust his ability to speak the language that terrorists can understand,' said Nicole Levine, who came to D.C. from Herzliya for the inauguration. 'Let's make America great again. And you know what? Let's make the world a safer place.' 'The three hostages that came home yesterday are only the start,' noted Eliza Laganas of Florida. 'I truly believe that had Trump been in office, October 7 would have never happened, and now I know for the next four years it will never happen again.' Yifat Schnur from New Jersey said, 'I think that Trump is going to be wonderful for the world, for the United States, and also for Israel.' There were also Israeli Knesset members on the ground, such as Religious Zionist Party MK Simcha Rothman. He said, 'I came here for the inauguration of President Trump, to meet with all the people that are getting into office, getting ready, as they say, to make America great again, but also to see how to make Israel great.' 'I came here because I think it's a historic event,' added MK Ohad Tal. 'These are historic days. It's important not just for America. I think it's important for the world, definitely for the free world, because now finally, we have in the White House a leader who knows to differentiate between good and evil.' And what did Manuel Vilar have to say? 'Strength, independence, security, empowerment—and making America great again. And Israel great again too, while we're at it.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syh0jvtwkx	2025-01-21T10:01:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/S12FhPTPJx/S12FhPTPJx_1_34_1038_585_0_small.jpg

Emily's mom posts message to world, and 1st photo of her daughter...	Mandy Damari thanked citizens in the UK and around the world who called for her daughter's release from captivity, emphasizing: 'There are 94 more hostages who need us' Mandy Damari, the mother of Emily, who was returned from Hamas captivity on Sunday, posted a message to the world on the X platform - including the first photo of her daughter without the bandage covering her shot off-fingers that she returned with from Gaza. 'Thank you to everyone in the UK and around the world who supported the campaign to bring Emily home, and for all your messages here on X. You are amazing and we love you all. 94 hostages still need us,' she wrote in her post. Emily, a British citizen, immediately became a symbol of heroism upon her release, when, among other things, she pushed one of the Hamas terrorists out of the vehicle that brought her to the Red Cross collection point - and also provided a special victory image, when she showed her brother her severed fingers in a phone call. Emily was the only Gaza hostage holding British citizenship and, until her release, there has been no sign of life from her during her time in captivity. On the morning of October 7, Hamas terrorists invaded her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, killed her dog, and abducted her from the Young Generation neighborhood of the kibbutz.

Not a second goes by that we don't think of you, pray for you, fight for you to come home alive.' One of the campaigns for Emily's release was by fans of her beloved English soccer team, Tottenham, who made sure to release yellow balloons into the air at every game, wave her picture, and wish for her return and the return of the other hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qfgvtpkg	2025-01-21T09:19:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/SyYMTIpv1l/SyYMTIpv1l_0_179_900_507_0_small.jpg
Israel's Iron Wall operation in West Bank: IDF strikes terrorists...	The IDF struck a terrorist cell using a drone as part of fresh operation Iron Wall; Military plans to deploy bulldozers in the city to expose and clear booby-trapped routes The IDF eliminated a terrorist cell in Jenin on Tuesday as they were planting explosive devices in Jenin. The attack was carried out with drones as part of Israel's counter-terrorism Iron Wall operation in the West Bank. Palestinian sources initially reported air raid sirens sounding throughout the city as the operation began with drone strikes, followed by a combat helicopter assault. The Palestinian Authority's Health Ministry reported six fatalities and at least 35 injuries from IDF airstrikes, with casualties ranging from mild to critical. Following the drone strike, IDF bulldozers, including D9s, are expected to enter the area to clear roads suspected of being booby-trapped. The operation, which began with targeted strikes on infrastructure, continued with ground forces entering Jenin. It is anticipated to continue for several days, involving significant military resources, including special forces, the Shin Bet security agency, and Border Police units. The IDF aims to maintain operational freedom across the West Bank, dismantle terrorist infrastructure, and neutralize imminent threats. The decision to launch the operation was approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet on Friday. The timing reflects the influence of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who reportedly pressured Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to action following a shooting attack in the northern West Bank Palestinian village of Funduq that killed three Israelis, including two women in their 70s. Initial concerns about potential international backlash, particularly from the Biden administration, delayed the operation, despite months of planning by the IDF as part of its offensive strategy. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF has also intensified arrests across the West Bank, with Palestinian sources reporting 11 arrests in Idna near Hebron and seven in Qalqilya. Earlier in the day, the Palestinian news agency WAFA claimed that Israeli forces tightened restrictions in Ramallah and Al-Bireh, closing additional roads. The operation coincides with the winding down of an unprecedented six-week crackdown by Palestinian security forces targeting terrorist activities in the Jenin refugee camp. According to an IDF source, the Palestinian Authority sought to demonstrate its ability to curb terrorist presence and assert control. 'They signaled to the Palestinian public and the international community – especially the U.S. and EU – that they can exercise authority, even in areas heavily impacted by Hamas,' the source said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjglusawyl	2025-01-21T08:37:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/rJb00Ivfavkg/rJb00Ivfavkg_0_96_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Turkish ski resort fire kills 66, guests forced to jump from wind...	Eyewitnesses say the flames engulfed the hotel in half an hour, as people tried to climb down using bedsheets; Hotel guests said they fled through smoke-filled corridors and heard no alarms A fire at a ski resort hotel in Turkey's Bolu mountains killed 66 people and injured 51 others on Tuesday, forcing panicked guests to jump out of windows in the middle of the night. 'It was like the apocalypse. The flames engulfed the hotel immediately, like in half an hour,' said Mevlut Ozer, who witnessed the incident at the Kartalkaya ski resort in northwest Turkey. The fire began around 3:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) on the restaurant floor of the 12-story Grand Kartal Hotel, authorities said. Several fire engines and ambulances later surrounded the charred, wood-fronted building, with white bed sheets tied together and dangling from at least three upper-floor windows where people tried to flee. 'People all started to jump with panic. One friend jumped from the 11th floor - may God have mercy on him,' said Omer Sakrak, another witness and employee of a neighboring hotel.

Iran's axis is weakened, but threats persist	While Tehran's control in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza has been severely impacted during the war, Iran and its proxies make efforts to portray victory in cease-fire and hostage deal The hostage release and Gaza cease-fire agreement took effect on Sunday, with the Iranian-Shiite axis continuing its rhetoric of boasting and threats. Despite significant setbacks in Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere, 'victory speeches' persist in Iran and elsewhere. Iranian officials, allied militias in Iraq, Hezbollah and the Houthis have issued statements celebrating the cease-fire, claiming it as a triumph. 'The people of Gaza stand firm like a mountain. Despite the loss of figures like Yahya Sinwar, the resistance front will not falter. Hamas is alive and will remain alive,' Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei posted on X in Hebrew. He attached a video showing Hamas terrorists and the release of three Israeli hostages Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian added: 'We congratulate the resilient people of Gaza and Palestine on this victory. The Palestinian people stood with strength and dignity against Israel and achieved a great accomplishment.' Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqaei declared that 'the Gaza cease-fire is a complete defeat for the Zionist entity and its allies, another example of the triumph of resistance and confrontation against the occupation.' Iranian Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri called the cease-fire a sign of Israel’s 'collapse of authority' and an 'important turning point for the region and the Islamic world.' He claimed, 'The resistance axis emerged victorious, imposing this agreement on the enemy.' Iranian Revolutionary Guard Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani also claimed that Israel 'was forced to accept Hamas's terms, the same ones it proposed in earlier negotiations.' Meanwhile, Iranian outlets showcased military capabilities, with the Tasnim news agency revealing a strategic naval base and Mehr agency highlighting new defense systems added to Iran's navy. According to the Iranian news agency IRNA, a military drill began in the Kermanshah region of western Iran on Tuesday and will last nine days. The drills aim to enhance military readiness, demonstrate the forces' defensive capabilities, improve regional security and signal the army's readiness to defend Iran. Hezbollah, which reached its own agreement with Israel nearly two months ago, echoed similar sentiments. In an official statement, it praised the cease-fire as a 'political and military victory' that demonstrated Israel’s failure to achieve its goals. It thanked Iran, Iraqi resistance factions and the Houthis, reaffirming its commitment to supporting Palestinians 'until the occupation ends.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In Yemen, the Houthis hailed the agreement as a 'historic victory,' vowing to monitor its implementation and confront any Israeli escalation. 'We will limit attacks in the Red Sea to Israeli-linked vessels,' the terror group’s military spokesperson Yahya Saree said, while reaffirming ongoing support for the Palestinian cause. Hezbollah’s acting Secretary-General Naim Qassem, who replaced Hassan Nasrallah after he was killed during the war, said in a recorded speech that the 'Palestinian resistance achieved its goals, while Israel failed to meet its objectives.

Executive orders galore: Trump's first day back is already raisin...	Donald Trump’s second term began with sweeping executive orders targeting immigration, asylum seekers and birthright citizenship; He canceled legal pathways for migrants, granted pardons to Capitol rioters, and fired over 1,000 Biden-era officials, all while promising a 'Golden Age' for America Donald Trump wasted no time on his first day back, signing more than 200 executive orders, sparking immediate controversy. His actions focused on fighting illegal immigration, declaring a 'national emergency' at the southern border to block unlawful entries and deport 'millions of foreign criminals.' Trump also suspended the CPB One app, which had legalized asylum requests for nearly a million migrants, leaving thousands stranded at the Mexican border. For many, this app was the only legal way to seek asylum. Migrants like Margelis, a Venezuelan mother, pleaded for compassion: 'Have compassion and let us cross.' Others, like Maria, an Ecuadorian fleeing cartel violence, and Imane, a Cuban migrant, shared similar despair. Critics warned that Trump’s mass deportation plans could tear families apart, hurt businesses and cost taxpayers billions. With Maria, for example, violence of drug cartels forced her family to flee Ecuador. On Trump’s inauguration day, the family was supposed to enter the United States, but they are now stuck in Mexico. 'I am not asking for anything from the world, only from God: Please let us in,' she said, crying. Trump also proposed ending birthright citizenship, limiting it to children of permanent residents – a move likely to face legal challenges for violating the U.S. Constitution. Additionally, he suspended the U.S. refugee program indefinitely, canceling resettlement for 1,660 Afghans, including unaccompanied minors and relatives of U.S. service members, many of whom fear Taliban retaliation for aiding the U.S. Another polarizing decision was Trump’s pardon of 1,500 people involved in the January 6 Capitol riots. He called them 'hostages' who were treated unfairly, granting full pardons to non-violent offenders and commuting sentences for far-right group members. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move as a blow to democracy. According to data from the U.S. Department of Justice, 1,583 were prosecuted for offenses related to the Capitol breach. Over 600 were charged with assaulting police officers or resisting law enforcement, including 175 accused of using weapons or causing serious harm to officers. Trump decided to grant full pardons to those who participated in breaching and illegally entering the Capitol but were not charged with violent crimes, and to commute the sentences of those convicted of assaulting police officers. This decision reduced the sentences of 14 members of far-right groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who had been sentenced to long prison terms. However, their convictions still stand.

Trump must confont Iran'	Israeli-Canadian philanthropist Sylvan Adams expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration are preparing a strong response against Iran Israeli-Canadian philanthropist Sylvan Adams expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration are preparing a strong response against Iran, which he described as the greatest threat to Israel and the entire region. 'We cannot allow a fanatical regime, where they believe martyrdom is a goal to pursue in life, to have weapons of mass destruction,' Adams told ILTV News on the day of Trump’s inauguration. Adams emphasized that Iran continues to pose a significant strategic threat despite Israel’s successful efforts against both Iran and its proxies. Over the past year, Israel has retaliated against missile attacks carried out by Iran, striking Iranian targets in response. 'Iran has never been weaker,' Adams said. 'But Iran remains a threat.'

Live from Washington: Trump's first 100 days could redefine U.S. ...	U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn in using two Bibles It was absolutely frigid in Washington, D.C., where U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn in using two Bibles—one given to him by his mother in 1955 and another that belonged to President Lincoln in the 1860s. The cold weather in Washington forced the inauguration ceremony indoors, significantly reducing the number of people able to attend. Despite this, the atmosphere in the city remained festive, with hundreds of watch parties and events taking place throughout the area. Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, a celebratory event was held to mark Trump’s inauguration. For many Israelis, the new president’s term brings high hopes and anticipation for strengthened ties with the U.S. The night before the swearing-in of U.S. President Donald Trump, he criticized the Biden administration, claiming he had accomplished more in the Middle East in recent months than his predecessor did during his entire term. Speaking at a rally on Sunday night, Trump praised the recent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which he described as 'epic.' He attributed the agreement to the Republican victory in the November U.S. elections, calling it a 'first step towards lasting peace in the Middle East.' Trump also announced plans to direct the military to begin construction of an 'Iron Dome' missile defense shield once he takes office. He emphasized that the system would be built in the United States. With Trump’s inauguration, Republicans now control all three branches of policymaking government—the House, the Senate, and the White House—giving them the chance to fulfill promises to combat antisemitism and support Israel. In his first 100 days, Trump is expected to issue dozens, if not hundreds, of executive orders addressing both domestic and foreign policies. His administration has signaled an immediate reversal of what he labeled as 'every radical and foolish executive order of the Biden administration.' On Monday, Trump had already revoked Biden-era sanctions on Israeli citizens and nonprofits in Judea and Samaria, among other pro-Israel moves. Trump has also suggested he will confront Iran’s growing nuclear capabilities, a move many expect to at least in part define his foreign policy priorities. Israel should see what the future holds fairly quickly. ILTV will be in Washington for the next couple of days and provide additional coverage.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wdtg6dkg	2025-01-21T04:03:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/03/Syb86DZBW1l/Syb86DZBW1l_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Israel must return to Gaza to finish war against Hamas'	Amir Avivi: 'As long as we go back to fighting and finishing the job, this will be a momentary setback' Israel will need to return to Gaza and finish the war against Hamas after the hostages return to Israel, according to Brigadier General (Res.) Amir Avivi. He told ILTV that he and his team at the Israel Defense and Security Forum recently met with the Defense Ministry leadership. 'I was very happy about what I heard. It is crystal clear that Israel needs to win this war decisively, and winning the war means bringing the hostages home and also eradicating Hamas, ensuring that Israel and the South are safe for generations to come.' Avivi acknowledged that releasing thousands of terrorists with blood on their hands is a 'kind of setback' that goes against Israel’s goal of eradicating Hamas, but he believes it is only temporary. 'As long as we go back to fighting and finishing the job, this will be a momentary setback and not something that will have long-term repercussions,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1fdrgtvyx	2025-01-21T03:41:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/B1zR00ge3Pyg/B1zR00ge3Pyg_1_0_1601_901_0_small.jpg

IDF launches counterterror operation in West Bank city of Jenin	Shin Bet and border police join effort to eliminate terror infrastructure and seize illegal weapons as Palestinian Authority operation nears conclusion The IDF, Shin Bet and Border Police on Tuesday launched a counterterrorism operation in the West Bank’s Jenin. The operation began with a drone strike in the city. Palestinians reported alarms in Jenin, claiming the discovery of an 'Israeli special forces unit' and the arrival of military vehicles from the Dotan checkpoint. The operation, which began with airstrikes targeting terror infrastructure and continued with ground forces entering the area, is expected to last several days and involves numerous Israeli forces including special units, Shin Bet and Border Police. The mission’s goals were said to be maintaining operational freedom across the West Bank, dismantling terror infrastructure and neutralizing 'ticking time bombs.' The Palestinian Health Ministry, operated by Hamas, reported one fatality and at least ten injuries from the strikes. Earlier, Palestinian news agency WAFA claimed Israel intensified actions across the West Bank, including road closures near Ramallah and al-Bireh. Arrests continued prior to the Jenin offensive, with 11 individuals detained in Idna near Nablus and seven in Qalqilya. 'The threat to settlements and residents in the West Bank and the seam line is growing.' Defense Minister Israel Katz told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 'Our enemies see this as the only open front now, a space for confrontations, gunfire and terrorism against Israel.' 'The Iranian axis continues to fund, direct and arm these activities.' Katz said he directed the IDF to 'act forcefully to protect all communities and residents, to strike hard and prevent terrorism.' Overnight masked men entered Palestinian villages in the West Bank, vandalizing property and setting buildings, cars and shops on fire. Two people were hurt during clashes with security forces that arrived on the scene, according to initial invetigations, a police officer shot and seriously wounded the two after he was attacked with pepper spray and fired to push back the crowd. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority's (PA) extensive security operation targeting terrorism in Jenin’s refugee camp, ongoing for over a month and a half, is nearing completion. The IDF observed a decline in arrests and activity in the past two weeks, with a military source saying the operation achieved its goal. 'They demonstrated to Palestinians and the world that they won’t tolerate such terrorist presence.' The source added, 'It’s also their signal to the U.S. and EU that they’re capable of controlling parts of Gaza in place of Hamas, particularly areas hit hardest by the IDF.' However, the operation resumed in recent days after pausing under Palestinian pressure following Israeli strikes in the area. Senior figures in the camp reached agreements with the Palestinian Authority, which aims to tackle illegal arms and crime in a region plagued by weapons trade and money laundering. Still, terrorist Jenin Brigades members aligned with Islamic Jihad detonated two explosive charges against PA security vehicles on Monday. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli security sources reported that the Palestinian security forces arrested around 340 terrorists, eliminated 10 (including a senior figure described as the camp’s second-in-command) and seized 290 explosives, 23 car bombs and numerous drones intended for military use. Six Palestinian security personnel were killed and 59 armed terrorists were injured during the operation. Unlike IDF protocols, Palestinian forces adopted a different approach to homes used for shooting during clashes by torching them. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk11e8wtvye	2025-01-21T03:26:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/S1bjrWTw1x/S1bjrWTw1x_81_81_1230_693_0_small.jpg
Putin secures Hamas promise to release Sasha Troufanov, alive and...	Russian-Israeli hostage 'to be freed soon' while Moscow intensifies efforts to secure other captives' after Putin demands intesified efforts to release Maxim Harkin, also a Russian national who is not named in the first phase of the cease-fire deal Russia's ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov said on Tuesday the Hamas promised the Kremlin that Sasha Troufanov, who hold both an Israeli and Russian passport would soon be released 'alive and well.' Troufanov is among the hostages named to be freed in the first phase of the deal In an interview to Russian media Viktorov said Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed intensified efforts to secure the release of Maxim Harkin,36, also a Russian national, who is not included in the list of 33 hostages set for release. He said Moscow has information suggesting Sasha Troufanov was injured in Gaza. Hamas leadership has assured Russia that he will be returned to his homeland. The Islamic Jihad terror faction in Gaza released a video of the hostage last November. 'A year that I have been here in captivity, a year in which there is a shortage of food and water, no electricity. Now even basic hygiene products, such as soap and shampoo, have run out. I have a skin problem that did not exist before because of this situation. I want to remind the citizens of Israel, every time you eat something or drink something, remember us hostages, we don't have this opportunity to enjoy the food and water you eat or drink,' he said. ''Please, please, don't forget about us. I am asking you, citizens of Israel, please, please, go out and demonstrate. I want to thank you for the demonstrations you do every week on Saturday evenings, but I also want to tell you, a whole year you have demonstrated and the government doesn't really care.' Troufanov's mother Yelena who was also captured by Hamas during the October 7 massacre along with his grandmother Irena Tati, and his friend Sapir Cohen and freed in the 2023 deal, met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov last October in Moscow and was told that her her son's release was a priority for the Kremlin. After her son's video appeared she said she was happy to see that he was alive. 'However, you can see the despair and hopelessness in his face and I am very worried about his health. I want to address you Sasha first, my beloved son; I ask you to continue to be strong and hold on, we will not stop fighting for your release until you are here at home.'

And to you, the people of Israel - thank you for the warm embrace, support and unceasing prayers. This is the time for us all to unite in one clear call - return everyone home, now.' Sasha and his friend Sapir, who were visiting the kibbutz at the time of the surprise attack, were abducted to Gaza along with their mother Yelena and grandmother Irena Tati. In the last message he sent to his friends before he was kidnapped, Trofanov wrote: 'It's a shame I came to visit the kibbutz this weekend with Sapir.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rysnc1tvkl	2025-01-21T03:07:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/13/Sy65hyfM1l/Sy65hyfM1l_0_0_805_473_0_small.jpg
Trump not sure cease-fire deal is fully implemented, Burns says t...	Former CIA chief says complex issues concerning Gaza's future were deferred to later stages of the negotiations, question for Israel is how to translate tactical victories against Iran and Hezbollah into strategic success U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking last night in Washington following his inauguration, brought former hostages Noa Argamani and Shoshan Haran, along with hostage families, onto the stage before his address. When asked if he believed all phases of the hostage deal would be implemented, Trump responded, 'I'm not sure.' 'We won. We won, but now the work begins. We have to bring them home,' Trump said. Later, he spoke on the Gaza war and welcomed the former hostages: 'For the former hostages here today, welcome home.' He also referred the three released hostages Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari, released from Hamas captivity on Sunday. Trump continued addressing the released hostages: 'We never stopped praying for you, and we’re so glad that you’re reunited with your friends and families.' He also spoke about the hostages still held by Hamas, pointing to the parents of Omer Neutra: 'Some families are saying, 'My son won’t return, but please bring his body home.' This should never have happened.' Trump added that had he been president on October 7, the massacre wouldn’t have taken place. 'Iran would’ve been broke, without money for Hamas or Hezbollah and your children would be alive. They certainly wouldn’t be imprisoned like they are now. But we’ll get many of them out shortly.' Meanwhile, William Burns, who ended his term as CIA director on Monday with the conclusion of Joe Biden's administration, was a central figure in the talks for reaching a hostage deal. Over the past 15 months, he held 'daily phone calls' with Mossad chief David Barnea and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani, searching for a breakthrough in the negotiations, according to an interview he gave to The New York Times. 'This probably has been the most complicated negotiations I have been involved in, in the sense it was indirect talks twice removed,' Burns said in the interview. He noted that many negotiations involve emotions and enthusiasm. 'Lots of negotiations are passionate, but here you had this human predicament of hostages and their families, innocent civilians in Gaza suffering terrible conditions for the last 15 months.' According to him, these were not just 'texts,' but talks 'about real human beings whose lives were in danger.' Since October 7, 2023, Burns has made 19 trips to the region attempting to mediate on the issues of the Gaza war and hostages. Until this week, just before Donald Trump's inauguration, the talks seemed like a failed mission in Burns's career. Ultimately, the agreement reached aligned with the multi-phase approach that Burns and the American team tried to dictate: the release of some hostages in exchange for prisoners, aid and the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces in Gaza. The complex issues concerning Gaza's future were deferred to later stages of the negotiations. Burns and Biden, as reported in the outlet, pushed this formula for months. According to Burns, what changed was that Hamas's military leaders felt 'beleaguered,' with their forces significantly weakened. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Israel's strikes on Iran and Hezbollah created political space for the deal. ' The Israeli political leadership is beginning to see that perfect is not on the menu here, but they have achieved a lot of what they wanted to achieve,' Burns told the outlet. Bruns added the question facing Israel is how to translate tactical victories against Iran and Hezbollah into strategic success. Burns and his colleagues in the U.S. intelligence community believe that a cease-fire and the hostages' release are crucial components of this process. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj1zpjpd1x	2025-01-21T01:55:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/S1WP3P00nDkl/S1WP3P00nDkl_0_0_800_450_0_small.jpg

Retired IDF general: Israel considering ‘dead zone’ on Lebanese b...	Amid Israel's fragile cease-fire, General Amir Avivi urges action against Iran, Hezbollah, and HTS, while stressing US-led coalitions and the Abraham Accords for long-term Middle East stability As a seemingly fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas finishes its first full day, retired IDF General Amir Avivi detailed Israel's broader regional challenges and the strategic complexities shaping its military operations. Speaking to The Media Line, Avivi reiterated the need to address regional threats, secure borders, and coordinate with allies to ensure long-term stability. Avivi emphasized Israel's efforts to weaken Hezbollah in Lebanon, stressing that the IDF is closely monitoring and dismantling potential threats. 'Israel has dismantled completely everything along its border, two miles at least inside Lebanon, in a way that there cannot be a terror infrastructure near the Israeli border,' he said. He added that Israel is considering creating a 'dead zone,' a cleared buffer area free of any infrastructure or hostile elements, to prevent Hezbollah from reestablishing its presence along the border. This zone would be closely monitored and controlled by Israeli forces, ensuring that no group could rebuild facilities or pose a security threat in close proximity to Israeli territory. While Avivi acknowledged that significant Hezbollah infrastructure remains deeper inside Lebanon, he noted that Israel’s operations have made it difficult for the group to rebuild. 'In a way, Lebanon is landlocked... Syria is in control of Sunni forces and not Shia,' he said, stressing that Hezbollah’s supply lines have been disrupted. Avivi also called for increased international pressure to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which requires the disarmament of militias like Hezbollah. 'There needs to be big pressure from the administration, from Europe, from the moderate Sunni states in Lebanon to dismantle Hezbollah,' he explained. He linked these efforts to the broader vision of 'peace through strength,' a strategy championed by U.S. President Donald Trump during his first administration. Avivi noted that strengthening alliances, particularly with moderate Sunni states, is essential to creating a robust Western-Israeli-Sunni coalition capable of resisting Iranian influence and stabilizing the region. 'These goals are completely dependent on each other and connected,' he said, emphasizing that progress on normalizing relations with countries like Saudi Arabia under the Abraham Accords would bolster regional security. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Avivi highlighted Egypt’s role in securing the Gaza border, particularly along the Philadelphi Corridor. 'The Egyptians did reinforce the border with Gaza at the beginning of the war with tanks,' Avivi said. He noted that while the number of forces on the Egyptian side has remained stable since the conflict’s onset, Israel has bolstered its own presence along the corridor in recent days. 'Israel, in the last few days, reinforced the Israeli forces along the Philadelphi Corridor to make sure that Gaza is completely closed and there is no smuggling of weapons or terrorists into Gaza from the Sinai Peninsula.' Avivi emphasized the importance of Israel’s coordination with Egypt, describing their collaborative efforts to ensure that Gaza remains isolated from external military aid. This cooperation underscores Egypt’s strategic role in maintaining regional stability and controlling the flow of weapons and personnel. Turning to Syria, Avivi expressed skepticism about the prospects of stability in the region following the collapse of Bashar Assad’s regime in December 2024. 'Whether they’ll function as a country or not, whether they’ll go back to civil war, it’s completely unclear,' he remarked. The fall of Assad marked the end of over five decades of family rule, with opposition forces, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), swiftly capturing key cities and forcing Assad into exile in Russia. The transitional administration now led by HTS-associated leaders, including Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir and Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammed al-Golani), has raised concerns due to their Islamist ideology. Avivi cautioned against trusting figures like al-Julani, describing him and his government as a significant threat to Israel. 'He's a very radical guy, and his points in the government are also very radical,' Avivi noted. 'So they cannot be trusted, and we cannot let them rebuild a military force because this will endanger Israel at a certain point. So Israel is opening its eyes and really monitoring what's going on in Syria and keeping our forces in a perimeter that can defend our towns. On Iran, Avivi argued for a more aggressive stance, particularly targeting Iran’s nuclear program and military infrastructure. 'We need to attack the nuclear sites of Iran, and we also need to attack the Houthis,' he stated, calling for a coalition led by the U.S. to show strength and deter global adversaries. 'This is about the U.S. really being a world leader and deterring also the Chinese from invading Taiwan or the Russians from further aggression in Europe.' Avivi also addressed the growing concern about Hamas exploiting social media to track IDF soldiers. He cited instances where Israeli soldiers on vacation were targeted by Hamas operatives, sometimes in coordination with local authorities, to attempt arrests abroad. 'The army is very proactive dealing with Hamas and trying to change its tactics all the time,' Avivi said. He acknowledged that the issue extends beyond Hamas, with international delegitimization campaigns targeting Israeli soldiers and officials. 'The fact that people are trying to arrest Israeli soldiers, it’s a very big problem that Israel needs to deal with,' he said. Avivi called for a more robust response to these campaigns, which he described as part of a global effort to undermine Israel’s legitimacy. 'We have to be very active and proactive in really fighting this phenomenon.'

In an attempt to reconstruct its powerbase in Gaza, Hamas stages spectacle at Saraya Square including hundreds of people and terrorists in a bid of power projection Hamas exhibited an image of hoards of people and many armed fighters on the streets during the transfer of the three first hostages, released on Sunday, to the hands of the Red Cross. But drone footage shows that the area around the crowed that had gathered was mostly empty. Only hundreds of Palestinians were seen gathering around Red Cross vehicles in an otherwise empty area. Israel resisted finding an alternative government to Hamas in Gaza for months leaving Hamas to demonstrate their hold on power. Hamas's propaganda was directed not only at Israel but also at Palestinians and the broader Arab world to project a victory narrative and reinforce its military and civilian control. only hundreds of Palestinians were seen gathering around Red Cross vehicles in an otherwise empty area. Images released by Hamas, which faced international criticism, depicted armed terrorists and civilians swarming the hostages’ vehicle. The release took place in Saraya Square, a symbolic location connecting Gaza City’s north and south, chosen by Hamas to enhance its propaganda. The terror group sought to showcase its elite Nukhba Force and 'Shadow Unit,' responsible for hostage operations, to solidify its position. Al Jazeera journalist Tamer Almisshal, known for his ties to Hamas, said that the choice of Saraya Square had strategic and political significance, especially during the initial days of the cease-fire agreement. 'This area, heavily targeted by Israeli operations, sends a message: You didn’t break us — Hamas is still here.' The square, heavily damaged by IDF activity, previously housed Hamas leadership tunnels. Almisshal claimed the release's location symbolized Hamas's defiance and highlighted Israeli failures to dismantle its military infrastructure. Before the war, Saraya Square was a bustling hub surrounded by banks, shopping centers and government buildings, including a central prison dating back to the British mandate, later used by various Palestinian factions. According to Gaza residents, Hamas operatives frequently used hidden tunnels in the area during airstrikes. Red Cross officials described the scene of armed terrorists surrounding the vehicles as 'complex and threatening,' but the transfer proceeded. The organization plans to address future security concerns with Hamas. Sunday also marked widespread Palestinian celebrations for the cease-fire, which Hamas framed as a dramatic victory over Israel. However, as refugees returned to their devastated homes, many expressed shock and frustration at the extensive destruction. For Hamas, the cease-fire provided an opportunity to re-emerge from hiding, displaying its strength across Gaza. Armed terrorists roamed openly and Hamas police officers were spotted in blue uniforms in several areas. The peak of these displays coincided with the hostage release in central Gaza City. Although the IDF attacked Hamas vehicles in Khan Younis shortly before the cease-fire, the truce has since limited Israel’s ability to counter Hamas’s public displays of strength. The terror group aims to demonstrate that its military and governance capabilities remain intact despite suffering significant losses during the 15-month war.

He noted that the terror group had successfully rebuilt its forces and recruited new terrorists, nearly matching the number lost in battles with Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhx5ahp1g	2025-01-21T00:29:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/SyaEP12Pyx/SyaEP12Pyx_346_78_753_424_0_small.jpg

Appearance of fighters on the streets is aimed to demonstrate strength to Israel, rivals in the Palestinian Authority, and residents of Gaza A group of fighters from the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, on Sunday, January 19, 2025, emerged from their tunnels beneath the Gaza Strip and made an open appearance on the streets of Deir al-Balah, where they interacted with local children, many of whom are reportedly undergoing training as recruits for the armed group. In an exclusive video obtained by The Media Line, young boys were seen posing with rocket launchers and other weapons as parents encouraged them to take souvenir photographs. Families attended the event in large numbers. Earlier the same day, as the newly agreed-upon ceasefire with Israel took effect, Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigade forces held a public parade in Gaza City showcasing their strength. During the event, the fighters, traveling in white Toyota pickup trucks, displayed a range of weapons, including locally manufactured missiles, drones, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and Russian-made Kornet missiles.

Finally, to the people of Gaza, they sought to assert control over local markets and public spaces, emphasizing their dominance in the region.

Settlers riot in Palestinian villages, set fires; two hurt in sho...	Military investigates serious injury to two people in suspected freindly fire incident while dozens of settlers vandalize Palestinian property, burn buildings, homes, cars Dozens of masked West Bank settlers rioted in two Palestinian villages late on Monday, vandalizing property and setting buildings, cars and shops on fire. In the village of Jinsafut, the rioters clashed with security forces who arrived on the seen and emergency services reported that at least two people in their 20'swere seriously hurt by gunfire. Shortly before midnight, the IDF said its forces dispersed rioters in the village of Al-Funduq, where three people were killed in a terror attack earlier this month. According to the military, a police officer and a soldier were involved in a shooting incident that was under investigation and the police later said an officer was placed on house arrest pending an inquiry. Initial probes indicate the men were mistakenly shot by a a member of the security forces who was hurt by pepper spray and fired shots to disperse any potential immediate threat. The riots came as security forces were attempting to prevent an uptick in West Bank violence at a time when Palestinian prisoners were being released from Israeli jails as part of the negotiated cease-fire and hostage release deal that came into effect on Sunday and after Defense Minister Israel Katz lifted administration detention from some violent settlers, imposed on them by his predecessor, Yoav Gallant. Katz made the move without consultation with security services including the Shin Bet. 'I decided to release detained settlers to send a clear message of strength and support for Jewish settlement,' he said. Earlier on Monday, the IDF announced that Sergeant first class (res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda, was killed and four others were hurt from an explosive device that detonated under their vehicle while operating in the West Bank village of Tammun.

Trump lifts sanctions on West Bank settlers	Hours earlier settlers riot in Palestinian villages setting property on fire; decision is a reversal of a major policy action by former President Joe Biden's administration U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday rescinded sanctions imposed by the former Biden administration on far-right West Bank settler groups and individuals accused of being involved in violence against Palestinians, the new White House website said. The website said Trump rescinded Executive Order 14115 issued on Feb. 1, 2024, which authorized the imposition of certain sanctions 'on Persons Undermining Peace, Security, and Stability in the West Bank.' Trump's decision is a reversal of a major policy action by former President Joe Biden's administration which had slapped sanctions on numerous Israeli settler individuals and entities, freezing their U.S. assets and generally barring Americans from dealing with them.

Trump speaks flanked by freed hostages and families of captives	Presidnet says Oct. 7 massacre would not have happened had he been president, calls the treatment of hostages a disgrace and says hostages will be coming home daily U.S. President Donald Trump expressed skepticism about the Gaza ceasefire deal on Monday when asked if he was confident that all three phases of the agreement would be implemented. After his inauguration the president invited freed hostages Noa Argamani and Shoshan Haran as well as members of the families of other captives and the parents of slain IDF soldier and U.S. citizen Omer Neutra, to stand by him as he spoke at the Capital One hall in Washington. 'We never stopped praying for you,' he said. They wore yellow scarves and held pictures of hostages and chanted with the crowd 'Bring them home.' Trump thanked his envoy Steve Witkoff who ' has tremendous power of persuasion,' after reportedly bringing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to the cease-fire and hostage exchange deal. 'Three young ladies that came home yesterday, were hurt. 'It's a disgrace.' he said 'we're so glad you are united with your friends and family.'

Trump gets to work: deportations and 'two genders only'	New U.S. President is set to sign almost 200 executive orders that'll mostly repel the Biden administration's efforts, pardon Capitol rioters and impose new gender policy In his inauguration speech in Washington on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump described himself as ' saved by God to make America great again.' Immediately after being sworn in, Trump began signing a wave of executive orders. According to U.S.-based outlet ABC, he is also expected to announce pardons for some supporters prosecuted for the January 2021 riot in the Capitol. The report indicates that Trump will pardon those charged without violent offenses and commute sentences for others convicted of assaulting police officers during the unrest. Trump plans to sign between 100 and 200 executive orders on Monday, many aimed at reversing decisions made by former U.S. president Joe Biden’s administration, which he criticized in his speech, referring to January 20, 2025, as 'Liberation Day' for Americans. 'We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world,' Trump said, targeting the outgoing administration. The orders include measures to combat illegal immigration, repeal much of Biden’s energy and climate policies, limit transgender rights and designate drug cartels as 'foreign terrorist organizations.' Trump also announced his intent to 'declare a national emergency at our southern border,' enabling federal funding for border wall construction without Congressional approval. He pledged to resume wall construction and halt refugee admissions, saying, 'We will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.' Trump plans to deploy troops to the Mexico border to 'repel the disastrous invasion of our country,' a move expected to face immediate legal challenges due to restrictions on using military forces domestically. He also aims to sign an order denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants, directly challenging the 14th Amendment. The measure, like others, is anticipated to spark lengthy legal battles. On energy, Trump intends to declare a 'national emergency,' expediting approvals for pipelines and power plants. He will revoke Biden’s vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency standards, authorize additional oil and gas drilling on federal lands in Alaska and withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement once again. One of the most controversial orders involves transgender rights. Trump declared, 'The official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.' His administration will end the federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, bar transgender women from participating in women’s sports, prohibit transgender individuals from serving in the military and roll back protections for transgender inmates. 'After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America,' Trump added. Trump also plans to reinstate an earlier order curtailing workplace diversity training programs, which Biden rescinded on his first day in office. In his speech, Trump reiterated his desire to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America' and to return the Panama Canal to U.S. control, though he did not outline how to achieve the latter. > >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjjo3v2wyg	2025-01-20T14:35:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/r1V9RDN3Pkg/r1V9RDN3Pkg_0_216_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Just bravado': No charges in Hamas operative’s killing as case d...	State attorney decides to close investigation against five suspects in case of killing of bound Hamas operative at start of war, citing lack of evidence of wrongdoing State Attorney Amit Isman announced Monday that all investigations against Roi Yifrach, Yisrael Biton and Sahar Ofir in the case of the suspected killing of a Hamas Nukhba terrorist will be closed, citing lack of evidence. The case, initiated in December 2023, involved an extensive investigation by Tel Aviv’s Central Unit into the terrorist’s death during the October 7 attacks. Yifrach, the main suspect, faced allegations of impersonating an IDF soldier in Gaza and murdering the terrorist. Initially detained in December 2023 and re-arrested in July, he was ultimately cleared of the charges and convicted solely of illegal firearm possession. Biton, a volunteer with United Hatzalah, was also arrested on suspicion of murder but released during the first detention hearing. Biton maintained throughout that he was in Gaza border towns on October 7, 2023, to save lives and aid in combat, carrying a licensed firearm. Ofir, 22, from Elkana, was similarly cleared of allegations related to the terrorist’s death. Ofir, who was also investigated for an unrelated incident involving the alleged abduction and assault of a Palestinian, was accused of participating in the brutal beating after detaining the individual based on suspicions tied to a Hamas-affiliated phone background photo. Security officials later confirmed no connection between the detainee and Hamas or other terror groups. The prosecutor’s statement noted that the case, launched in November 2023, initially focused on Yifrach, Ofir, Biton, Akiva Kaufman and Israel Peretz, following Ofir’s claim that Yifrach had shown him a video of stabbing a bound terrorist to death. While evidence such as blood in Yifrach’s vehicle, a video of him striking a terrorist and WhatsApp confessions from Yifrach and Ofir raised suspicions, significant contradictions emerged during the investigation. The forensic report ruled out all proposed causes of death and testimonies indicated the terrorist was handed over alive to security forces. The statement also noted Ofir’s history of false boasting about ties to security forces. 'Given the chaos during the initial days of the war, the difficulty in reconstructing events and the low credibility of the confessions, which are likely just bravado, the state attorney decided — contrary to other recommendations suggesting closure due to insufficient evidence — to dismiss the case entirely for lack of criminal culpability,' the statement read. Yifrach’s attorney, Eitan Sabag, said, 'Roi is a hero who faced character assassination after his re-arrest over an absurd claim of murdering a Nukhba terrorist. We welcome the State Attorney’s decision to dismiss the baseless allegations, fully exonerating him.'

All evidence in the case demonstrated his innocence, leading to his exceptional release in the first hearing.'

Two critically injured in West Bank shooting	shooting near Ramat Gilad occurred close to Funduq, flashpoint of ongoing clashes between settlers and Palestinians following deadly attack earlier this month that killed 3 Israelis Two people in their 20s were injured, one severely and one critically, in a shooting near the settlement of Ramat Gilad, approximately two kilometers from the Palestinian village of Funduq, where masked Jewish youths rioted Monday night. The Magen David Adom ambulance service reported that one victim sustained life-threatening injuries and the other was in serious condition. Both were evacuated to hospitals in Petah Tikva and Kfar Saba. The identities of the injured and the connection, if any, between the shooting and the riots remain unclear. The unrest in Funduq involved approximately 40 masked individuals who set fire to three buildings, several vehicles and reportedly shops in the village. The IDF dispatched forces to the area to disperse the rioters and establish roadblocks along Route 55. 'IDF and Border Police forces responded to reports of disturbances in Funduq and are currently working to restore order,' the military said, adding that claims of arson are under investigation. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Funduq has been a flashpoint since a shooting attack there earlier this month that killed three Israelis: police officer Elad Winkelstein, 35, and civilians Rachel Cohen, 70, and Aliza Reiss, 73. The violence follows the death of Sgt. First Class (res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda, who was killed Sunday night when an improvised explosive device detonated under his vehicle during a military operation in Tammun, near the Jordan Valley. Four others, including the battalion commander, were wounded in the attack. The IDF said initial findings indicate the road was booby-trapped, though no intelligence had warned of explosives in the area. The riots also coincide with Defense Minister Israel Katz’s controversial decision to release five settlers from administrative detention. Katz justified the move, citing the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of a hostage deal, saying, 'I decided to strengthen and encourage the settlements, which stand on the frontlines against Palestinian terrorism.' Critics, including the Shin Bet, warned of potential security risks tied to the decision. Meanwhile, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi stressed the need for heightened readiness in the West Bank. 'Alongside reinforced defenses in Gaza, we must be prepared for significant operations in Judea and Samaria in the coming days to intercept and apprehend terrorists before they reach our citizens,' Halevi said, directing further preparations for continued operations in Gaza and Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byma5enwkl	2025-01-20T12:20:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/B1xp45V2Dyl/B1xp45V2Dyl_0_216_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Moved dozens of times, kept in darkness: Inside Romi, Doron and E...	Freed hostages say Hamas informed them of their release only hours before; 'We were terrified of the Gazan crowds,' they share; moved dozens of times, often underground, they say, 'We cared for each other constantly,' with one adding, 'I thought I’d die' Romi Gonen, 24, Emily Damari, 28, and Doron Steinbacher, 31, freed after 471 days in Hamas captivity, have begun recounting their experiences in Gaza while recovering in the hospital. According to Channel 12 News, although none of the three were held alone, they were separated at various points and at times kept in underground facilities with little exposure to daylight. The women said they were occasionally allowed access to television and radio, through which they saw their families and the public campaigning for their release. They learned that their families had survived the October 7 attacks in Israel. 'We cooked for each other and looked after one another constantly,' one said. 'I didn’t think I would return. I was sure I would die in Gaza,' one of the women shared, adding that they only learned of their impending release on the morning of their handover. 'We were terrified during the transfer from the terrorists to the Red Cross because of the hostile Gazan crowds,' they recalled. Despite intermittent provisions from Hamas, one of the hostages endured a medical procedure without anesthesia, underscoring the terrorist group’s cruelty. Emily Damari recounted spending extended periods with Romi Gonen, during which they were repeatedly moved between locations, including both underground tunnels and residential apartments. Emily, who lost two fingers to Hamas gunfire on October 7, revealed she also sustained a leg injury during captivity. Romi, trained as a medic, treated her wounds and provided vital care. The three women also disclosed they learned Arabic during their time in captivity. 'Dorona is still Dorona, Emily is a fighter' Friends of Doron Steinbacher visited her at the hospital Monday evening and recounted to Ynet the moment they saw on television that their close friend had returned from Gaza. 'It was overwhelming excitement; honestly, our first reaction was screaming—screams of joy,' said Meitar Yaakobi. 'Then came tears and an emotional breakdown, the realization that she’s finally here. For 471 days, we hoped, prayed and waited, and finally, it happened. It was a moment we’ll never forget.' Noa Mizrahi shared that she and the group have yet to meet Doron in person. 'We had a short video call with her, and we mostly told her that we hadn’t slept from excitement, that we couldn’t believe we were seeing her and that this day had finally come, and that we love her,' Mizrahi said. 'She kept saying she loves us too and that she thought about us all the time. There was an outpouring of emotions on both sides—a huge, joyful release. It was a short call, but it filled our hearts and souls.' Another friend, Chen Kaner, described the happiness of seeing Doron again: 'Her smile is the same smile, and Dorona is still Dorona. It’ll take time for us to process what she’s been through and figure out how to move forward, but for us, she’s the same Dorona. We waited for her. She’s smiling, and that’s what we were waiting for—to see her smile, to know she’s alive, breathing, healthy and standing on her own two feet.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Commenting on Doron’s brunette hair—normally blonde—her friends said, 'It looks so much better on her; it really makes her blue eyes pop. But she’s perfect in every way, and we’ll take her in any color.' They added that the first thing they plan to do with Doron is attend a reunion concert of Argentinian soap opera cast Rebelde. 'Doron already knows and is in shock that they’re coming to Israel. The show’s been postponed twice, probably because they were waiting for Doron,' they joked. 'We also have a list of gossip saved for her, and we’re waiting to sit down for coffee so she can catch up—she won’t miss a thing.' The group of friends is also close with Emily Damari, who, like Doron, lived in Kibbutz Kfar Aza before October 7. Meitar spoke about Emily: 'I think everyone saw last night exactly who Emily is. The clips were so brief, but they showed her essence—a fighter, someone who conquers everything, the queen of life. We saw her pictures along with the entire nation, and we saw how she broke the Internet—there’s no one like her. She’s incredible.' Chen added, 'That’s Emily. No one can meet Emily and not fall in love with her. She’s one of a kind, truly.' Noa reminded everyone that Keith Siegel, Gali Berman and Ziv Berman from Kibbutz Kfar Aza remain in Gaza. 'Our fight isn’t over until they come back and until the last hostage comes home. We’re not just here for Doron—the fight is for everyone. We’re not letting up. This deal needs to be fully realized and completed.' 'Too many families are still waiting for their loved ones' The families of Emily, Romi and Doron gave their first public statements Monday evening following the women’s release from Hamas captivity. '472 days ago, we received Doron’s harrowing recording. Those words brought us immense pain and relentless fear. That moment will forever be etched in our hearts, but today, Doron is home,' said Doron’s sister, Yamit Ashkenazi. 'We are still processing and trying to cope. She is well, strong and brave, but the road to recovery is long. She is surrounded by the warmth and love of her family, friends and all of Israel.' Ashkenazi also expressed gratitude for the support they received throughout Doron’s captivity. 'Our community in Kibbutz Kfar Aza and Israeli society as a whole stood by us at every step of this long journey. You gave us strength and hope, and you were an inseparable part of her return home. Your embrace crossed borders. The journey to bring Doron back has ended, but her journey to recovery is just beginning. We, too, survived the massacre and have yet to begin our own process of healing.' Mandy, Emily’s mother, said, 'I’m happy to share that Emily is in good spirits and on the path to recovery. She is strong and determined.' She thanked Israeli security forces, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, incoming President Donald Trump, the British government, volunteers who worked for Emily’s release and the hospital staff caring for her. 'I have one request,' Mandy continued. 'Keep fighting for the 94 hostages who still need to come home. Too many families are still waiting for their loved ones. The hostages in Gaza must receive humanitarian aid while awaiting their release—they need food, water and medicine. Thank you again for your support.' Merav, Romi’s mother, began her remarks by noting the number of cameras present compared to the days following the October 7 massacre. 'This shows where the nation and the media stand—kudos to us,' she said. Overcome with emotion, she added, 'We are happy to say that Romi is now a former hostage. The reality we dreamed of has come true, and we are now a family of returnees.' Merav also honored Ben Shimony, who tried to rescue Romi in his car during the Nova music festival before being killed, along with Romi’s friend Gaya Khalifa and Ofir Tzarfati, who were also murdered in the attack. She thanked the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for their 'courage and moral decision to initiate this critical process of bringing our sons and daughters home.' Merav also expressed gratitude to the bereaved families, the families of the soldiers, U.S. President Trump and Qatar and Egypt for mediating the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bji00uq2vjx	2025-01-20T11:11:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/HJ0hf65wye/HJ0hf65wye_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Biden issues preemptive pardons for family and Trump targets Chen...	Joe Biden issued preemptive pardons on Monday for several of his immediate family members and people his successor Donald Trump has targeted for retaliation, including Republican former lawmaker Liz Cheney and Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The pardons, issued in Biden's last hours as president, cover the select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, as well as all lawmakers, including Cheney, who served on the congressional committee and police officers who testified before it. They also covered Anthony Fauci, who served as White House chief medical advisor during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump, who was sworn in as president on Monday, has repeatedly called for the prosecution of his perceived enemies since winning the White House in November. Biden praised public servants as the 'lifeblood of our democracy.' Without mentioning Trump, he expressed alarm that some of them were subjected to threats and intimidation for doing their job. 'These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions,' Biden said in a statement. Just before he handed over the office to Trump, Biden also pardoned five members of his family, saying he wanted to protect them from politically motivated investigations. He pardoned his siblings — James Biden, Frank Biden and Valerie Biden Owens — as well as their spouses, John Owens and Sara Biden.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rydpwf2djg	2025-01-20T09:38:16-08:00

Hamas delays next hostage release to Sunday, violating deal terms	Israel prepared for second phase of hostage release Saturday, set to include 4 captives; however, terror group announces would provide names Saturday, with release itself now delayed to Sunday Hamas announced Monday that the second phase of the hostage exchange, originally scheduled for Saturday under the agreed framework, will now begin Sunday, with the list of hostages to be exchanged provided the day before. Hamas spokesperson Nahed Fakhoury confirmed the timeline: 'The second part of the initial phase will begin implementation on Saturday, January 25, 2025. On that day, the resistance will present the names of Israeli captives to be released, and in return, Israel will provide a list of Palestinian prisoners to be freed. Based on these lists, the actual exchange will take place on Sunday, January 26, 2025.' The second stage of the initial phase of the hostage deal will see four additional Israeli hostages released from Hamas captivity. Israeli officials anticipate the release of one civilian and three female soldiers, believed to be observers abducted from the Nahal Oz base on October 7. The release is expected late Sunday afternoon, when Hamas will hand over the hostages to the Red Cross, which will transfer them to Israeli forces inside Gaza. From there, they will be transported into Israel, reunited with their families and flown to a hospital for medical care. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Israel is preparing for negotiations on the second phase of the deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to establish working teams in the coming days. Talks are set to begin on February 4, the 16th day of the agreement, during which Israel will finalize its positions on the next steps. The international community is hopeful the cease-fire will be extended, potentially allowing for the release of more than the 33 hostages included in the first phase. In the November 2023 deal, the number of hostages freed exceeded initial expectations, with 105 captives released, including 81 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals. However, Hamas has indicated it may not agree to an expanded release this time without a permanent cease-fire that ends the war in Gaza. French and German officials have expressed optimism to families of the hostages, hoping the ongoing momentum of the cease-fire and hostage releases will result in an expanded list of freed captives. The second phase of the hostage deal is set to be an early test for U.S. President Donald Trump’s relationship with Israel. During the Security Cabinet’s dramatic session approving the deal, Netanyahu claimed to have assurances from Trump that if negotiations on the second phase fail, the U.S. would back a return to military action. However, sources familiar with the details believe Netanyahu’s promises to the political right were intended to secure support for the deal. These sources suggest that Trump is likely to pressure Netanyahu to extend negotiations, possibly offering incentives such as additional hostage releases, progress on Iran or normalization with Saudi Arabia. While Trump has declared his intent to end wars rather than start them, he is expected to prioritize outcomes favorable to Israel. Observers believe Trump will exert significant pressure on Netanyahu to avoid a swift return to fighting and focus on diplomacy. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy9ijwnpyg	2025-01-20T08:53:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/B1mun00Jiv1e/B1mun00Jiv1e_29_0_2972_1673_0_small.jpg

We're going to see a real wave of peace': Sylvan Adams on Trump'...	Speaking to Ynet, Jewish billionaire says Trump's reelection makes him hopeful for return of hostages, facing Iran and signing historic peace agreements across the region U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to the White House on Monday, many in Israel wonder if he’ll be as kind to Jerusalem as he was in the past. Talking to Ynet, Jewish billionaire and entrepreneur Sylvan Adams adamantly ensured Trump’s second term will be a blessing to Israel: 'Our prayers were answered when President Trump won the election. President Trump has proven himself to be a true friend of Israel.' 'In his first term, he did remarkable things. He moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, which was the American law, but all presidents had signed waivers. He had the strength and moral conviction to complete what was promised. He recognized that we own the Golan Heights. Our sovereignty there is forever. With the fall of Syria, had we ever decided to play with the Golan Heights and compromise on our security, his recognition is more than symbolic,' he added. 'It gives us standing in the world that the Golan is ours and in this time it's of particular importance. President Trump has appointed the most pro-Israel cabinet in history. His new ambassador, who is not Jewish by tradition, a lot of the ambassadors from the U.S. have been Jewish, but Mike Huckabee actually loves us more than we love ourselves and you couldn't ask for a better ambassador. 'Trump has proven himself a great friend of Israel. In his previous term, we had the Abraham Accords. All of the experts told Trump that he was wrong, it couldn't happen and he defied everyone's expectations. He is out of the box thinker. He is unconventional. He is brave and he has moral conviction. And we have a great friend in President Trump.' Adams also addressed the three Israeli hostages released from Gaza as part of the second hostage deal on Sunday, saying, 'It's a blessing today that we saw those three strong, beautiful young women returning home alive, seemingly in good health. It truly is a miracle to their resilience. And we are all citizens of Israel, all decent-minded people in the entire world are happy to see them come home.' When asked what he thought Trump might plan for Israel in the surrounding region in his upcoming stay in office, Adams said, 'I believe that his views on Israel are demonstrated by his choice of cabinet picks. And if you listen to what the cabinet members have been saying, they all understand that Hamas needs to be eliminated, cannot rule Gaza, notwithstanding the hostage deal that we've made. Hamas cannot rule Gaza.' 'Now we have to focus on Iran' 'The cabinet members have mentioned, of course, that Iran is an issue that must be dealt with. I think they really understand it. And for us today, even more important than Gaza, once our hostages come home, really is Iran. It's more important. It's the single biggest strategic threat to our country. We took care of all of their proxies. I am so proud of our country, of our soldiers, of our technology, of our brilliant IDF.' 'What we did to Hezbollah, they told us we would have 5,000 missiles raining on us, which would have overwhelmed our defense systems. We have no missiles raining on us, we have destroyed them. The fall of Syria was a result. So now we have to focus on Iran. And for me, the greatest problem we face for the West, but specifically America and Israel is eliminating the nuclear threat and fomenting, helping, abetting regime change in Iran.' 'I believe that Trump is a man who has been saying the same thing. He's a man of great conviction. He doesn't change his views and his talk is based on public opinion, how the wind is blowing. He's been saying the same thing for the last 40 years. I've seen interviews with a young Donald Trump and he's always maintained the same views,' Adams stressed. 'If we were to see a regime change in Iran, the Iranian people despise their regime, so the conditions are there. They have no beef with Israel. They have no beef with the Jews. We know it. There are contacts with Iranians. We know that they would embrace a warm hug with Israel and we could see peace with Iran, we could see peace with Syria, with Lebanon. Of course, the next peace deal we hope to see is with Saudi Arabia and quickly followed by Indonesia, but if we saw a regime change in Iran, all of the dominoes would fall.' 'After the few I mentioned, we would see Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and double-crossers of Qatar. They would change sides and they would come and join us. And they would all be standing in line to have a free trade agreement with Israel because they would all want to benefit from our brilliant economy and our technological prowess. And we would see peace, honestly, I believe for a hundred years.' Adams also shared he believed Trump would be willing to aid Israel with facing Iran if push comes to shove. 'I have spoken to some of the members of the cabinet. And as I said, the cabinet is very strong on this. The new Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has made strong statements recently on this. He wouldn't be making the statements unless they were authorized by his boss, President Trump. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I believe that Trump understands the problem. They've been clear with us that all of the restrictions that Biden put on us on weaponry and the things that we need to finish the job in the region, Trump will release. We have a great friend and I think he truly understands the issues that we face,' he added. He also shared his opinion about a possible normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia under Trump’s new administration. 'I was told by Jared Kushner that had Trump been re-elected, they were days away from a peace deal with Saudi Arabia. The deal had all been negotiated and they were just simply waiting for Trump to be re-elected. So I think it's been made more complicated by Biden, unfortunately, because he pushed them away.' 'They also saw that the American system is democratic and it means that you can have alternation between friends and administrations that are less friendly. And the Saudis are asking for a lot more. And Israel will also need to give some permissions to the Saudis.' 'They're talking about more advanced weaponry, things like the F-35 jets and Israel will have to participate in these trilateral negotiations, but ultimately I really believe we will see a peace agreement with the Saudis.' 'I think the Indonesians will be next because we have a president in the White House who understands the region and who will make it happen. And the Saudis were reluctant to give Biden a peace agreement with us because Biden was very hostile to them and only changed his mind when the price of oil went up and he came asking for favors from Mohammed bin Salman. I think we're going to see a real wave of peace blowing across our region with this wonder new administration.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyv51x2wkg	2025-01-20T07:59:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/HkXYhe3wyx/HkXYhe3wyx_59_16_314_177_0_small.jpg

More than 630 humanitarian aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip on Sunday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council, with at least 300 of those trucks going to the enclave's north, where the UN says famine looms. The trucks entered on the first day of a cease-fire deal between Israel and Palestinian terror group Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ngpe3vkl	2025-01-20T07:43:19-08:00	
IDF: Nahal Brigade Combat Team prepares for next missions after G...	The IDF’s Nahal Brigade Combat Team, operating under the command of the 162nd Division, is preparing for its next missions following extensive operations in the Gaza Strip, the IDF announced on Monday. Over the past 15 months, Nahal forces have conducted combat missions across dozens of areas in Gaza, eliminating hundreds of terrorists and destroying thousands of terror sites. Since the onset of the October 7 attacks and the subsequent war, the brigade has lost 67 soldiers and officers. Addressing the troops, the brigade commander praised their dedication and resilience. 'I am proud of each and every one of you. It is a privilege to command you. I could not have imagined better people by my side or under my command during this chaotic time,' he said. Nahal forces, which recently operated in the area of Beit Hanoun, are now transitioning to focus on their upcoming assignments.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyba8e3v1x	2025-01-20T07:16:36-08:00	
Trump arrives at US Capitol for swearing-in as 47th president	President-elect Donald Trump arrived on Monday at the U.S. Capitol, where he will be sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. The inauguration ceremony marks Trump’s official return to political leadership, following a contentious campaign. Joined by his wife, Melania, Trump made his way to the Capitol after a stop at the White House, where he met with outgoing President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. The Bidens hosted the Trumps for tea, continuing the tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. Trump’s swearing-in will be followed by an inaugural address expected to outline his administration’s priorities, including domestic and international policies. Security remains tight in Washington, D.C., as thousands gather to witness the ceremony.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjbbil3dkl	2025-01-20T07:14:00-08:00	
Welcome home': Biden greets Trump at White House before inaugura...	Bidens greet Trumps at White House before handover; Trump promises flurry of executive orders on Day One; tech billionaires, including Musk, flock to Trump's side; heavy security for swearing-in after two assassination bids Donald Trump will be sworn in as U.S. president on Monday, ushering in another turbulent four-year term with promises to push the limits of executive power, deport millions of immigrants, secure retribution against his political enemies and transform the role of the U.S. on the world stage. Even before Trump was to take office at noon ET (1700 GMT), aides detailed a raft of executive actions that he would sign immediately, including 10 focused on border security and immigration, his top priority. The president will declare a national emergency at the southern border, send armed troops there and resume a policy forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court dates, an incoming White House official told reporters. The inauguration completes a triumphant comeback for a political disruptor who survived two impeachment trials, a felony conviction, two assassination attempts and an indictment for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss. Shortly before 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), Trump and incoming first lady Melania Trump arrived at the White House, where Biden and first lady Jill Biden greeted them with handshakes. 'Welcome home,' Biden said. The ceremony will take place inside the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, four years after a mob of Trump supporters breached the symbol of American democracy in an unsuccessful effort to forestall Trump's defeat by Biden. The swearing-in was moved indoors for the first time in 40 years due to the extreme cold. Trump, the first U.S. president since the 19th century to win a second term after losing the White House, has said he will pardon 'on Day One' many of the more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Biden, in one of his last official acts, pardoned several people whom Trump has targeted for retaliation, including former White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci, former Republican U.S. Representative Liz Cheney and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. Trump will restore the federal death penalty, which Biden had suspended, and require that official U.S. documents such as passports reflect citizens' gender as assigned at birth, incoming administration officials told reporters. He will also sign an order ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the federal government on his first day, which is also Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the officials said. But Trump will not impose new tariffs on Monday, instead directing federal agencies to evaluate trade relationships with China, Canada and Mexico, a Trump official confirmed. 'A tide of change is sweeping the country,' Trump plans to say in his inaugural speech, according to excerpts seen by Reuters. 'With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Trumps began the day at St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, where several tech executives - including the three richest men in the world, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg - joined them. Disruptive force As he did in 2017, Trump enters office as a chaotic and disruptive force, vowing to remake the federal government and expressing deep skepticism about the U.S.-led alliances that have shaped post-World War Two global politics. The former president returns to Washington emboldened after winning the national popular vote over Vice President Kamala Harris by more than 2 million votes thanks to a groundswell of voter frustration over persistent inflation, though he still fell just short of a 50% majority. In 2016, Trump won the Electoral College - and the presidency - despite receiving nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. Jeremi Suri, a presidential historian at the University of Texas at Austin, compared the present era to the late 19th century, when Grover Cleveland became the only other president to win non-consecutive terms. Like now, he said, that was a time of upheaval, as industrial advances transformed the economy, wealth inequality exploded and the proportion of immigrant Americans reached a historical peak. 'What we're really talking about is a fundamentally different economy, a fundamentally different country in terms of its racial and gender and social makeup, and we are as a country struggling to figure out what that means,' he said. 'It's an existential moment.' Trump, who will surpass Biden as the oldest president ever to be sworn into office, will enjoy Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress that have been almost entirely purged of any intra-party dissenters. His advisers have outlined plans to replace nonpartisan bureaucrats with hand-picked loyalists. Even before taking office, Trump established a rival power center in the weeks after his election victory, meeting world leaders and causing consternation by musing aloud about seizing the Panama Canal, taking control of NATO ally Denmark's territory of Greenland and imposing tariffs on the biggest U.S. trading partners. His influence has already been felt in the Israel-Hamas announcement last week of a ceasefire deal. Trump, whose envoy joined the negotiations in Qatar, had warned of 'hell to pay' if Hamas did not release its hostages before the inauguration. Unlike in 2017, when he filled many top jobs with institutionalists, Trump has prioritized fealty over experience in nominating a bevy of controversial cabinet picks, some of whom are outspoken critics of the agencies they have been tapped to lead. The inauguration will proceed amid heavy security after a campaign highlighted by an increase in political violence that included two assassination attempts against Trump, including one in which a bullet grazed his ear. 'American carnage' Eight years ago, Trump delivered a bleak inaugural address vowing to end the 'American carnage' of what he said were crime-ridden cities and soft borders, a departure from the tone of optimism most newly elected presidents have adopted. Foreign governments will be scrutinizing the tenor of Trump's speech on Monday after he waged a campaign laced with inflammatory rhetoric. The traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House will now take place indoors at the Capital One Arena, where Trump held his victory rally on Sunday. Trump will also attend three inaugural balls in the evening. Amid the pageantry of the day, Trump will begin signing his first executive orders, many of which are likely to face legal challenges. Trump will be the first felon to occupy the White House after a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star. Winning the election also rid Trump of two federal indictments - for plotting to overturn the 2020 election and for retaining classified documents - thanks to a Justice Department policy that presidents cannot be prosecuted while in office. In a report last week, Special Counsel Jack Smith said he had enough evidence to convict Trump in the election case if Trump had reached trial. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj00d1lhwye	2025-01-20T06:54:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/BJSvUy2wke/BJSvUy2wke_0_259_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Oron Shaul laid to rest in Israel 10 years after his death in Gaz...	Thousands, including Golani soldiers, honor Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul, nearly 10 years after his death in 2014 Shijaiyah APC disaster; 'I waited so many years and never believed this day would come,' his mother Zahava says Staff Sergeant Oron Shaul, whose body was recovered from Gaza late Sunday night, was laid to rest Monday afternoon in Israel, 10 and a half years after his death. Thousands attended the funeral at the Poria Illit Cemetery in northern Israel, where he was buried next to his father, Herzl. Shaul was killed during the 2014 Gaza war, known as Operation Protective Edge, when his armored personnel carrier was struck in Gaza City's Shijaiyah neighborhood, and Hamas abducted his body. The emotional funeral saw six Golani Brigade soldiers carrying Shaul’s coffin. His mother, Zahava Shaul, arrived at the cemetery accompanied by her sons, Aviram and Ofek. Among the attendees were Golani soldiers, civilians, family members and government officials, including ministers Idit Silman and Ofir Sofer, as well as Brig. Gen. Gal Hirsch, Israel’s coordinator for captives and missing persons. Former IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz, who led the military during Shaul’s death and abduction, was also present. Zahava Shaul delivered a heart-wrenching eulogy to her son: 'My dear Oron, no words can capture who you truly were. For 10 and a half years, I waited for you, and each day became harder. I thought, ‘Now he’ll never return. Others will come back, but not you. And I’ll have to go on living without you.’' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She recounted the moment she learned of her son’s return: 'That day, I got a call to open the door. Moran was standing there. I was in pajamas, uncombed and unprepared. I asked, ‘Why are you here now?’ She said, ‘Let me in.’ I offered to make coffee, but she insisted on talking first. Then, after some hesitation, she turned to me and said, ‘Zahava, Oron is home.’ I asked, ‘What do you mean, home? Where is he?’ And she said, ‘He’s back. Oron is home.’' Expressing her gratitude, she said, 'I waited so many years and never believed this day would come. I thank the IDF, the Shin Bet and the prime minister for finally bringing you back. I love you so much, I don’t even know how to put it into words. It’s so hard. It’s so very hard. I have so much more to say, but I don’t have the strength anymore.' In her closing words, Zahava addressed Oron and the attendees: 'Look at all your friends who loved you—they’re all here to say goodbye. I want to thank those who rescued you and wish a full recovery to all the injured soldiers. To those still in Gaza, I hope they’re released as soon and as safely as possible. I love you, Mom.' Shaul’s body was positively identified at the Forensic Medicine Institute in Tel Aviv before his family was notified by representatives from the IDF, Shin Bet and Hirsch. The family of Lt. Hadar Goldin, another soldier whose body remains in Hamas custody since the same war, was also briefed on the recovery. Goldin’s body was not retrieved in the operation. Gaza currently holds 94 hostages, including Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, civilians captured in 2014 and 2015, respectively, who are expected to be part of the initial stages of the hostage release deal. Shaul’s father, Herzl, passed away in 2016 after a battle with cancer, which he attributed to the anguish of waiting for his son’s return. Before his death, he described the toll the ordeal had taken on his health and his family. In December 2023, Golani Brigade soldiers and a tactical team from the 188th Armored Brigade destroyed Palestine Square in Shijaiyah, where Hamas had erected a statue commemorating the 2014 incident. The statue, featuring a fist emerging from an armored vehicle clutching dog tags—including one bearing Shaul’s name—was dismantled as part of the IDF’s operations in Gaza. The recovery operation comes as families of other fallen soldiers reflect on the sacrifices made. Sarit, the mother of Sgt. Ben Vaanunu, who was killed in the same incident as Shaul, remembered her son as a beacon of light. 'Ben spread joy, love and positivity wherever he went. He was determined and driven, with a dream to join Golani, which he achieved. Beyond that, he was a loving, respectful, and humorous child who always cared deeply for those around him.' She noted the bond between her son and Shaul, even in tragedy. 'Ben and Oron shared the same painful fate in the APC disaster. Though they didn’t know each other well, they were part of the unique camaraderie of IDF soldiers—marked by dedication, mutual responsibility and brotherhood. They shared a path and a mission to serve the country.' Itamar Eichner and Roni Green Shaulov contributed to this story. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byoewy3p1g	2025-01-20T06:34:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/HyU3qCivyx/HyU3qCivyx_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Sweden eyes charges against man over 2014 killing of Jordan pilot...	Swedish prosecutors have requested the detention of a Swedish man on suspicion of war and terrorism crimes over the killing of a Jordanian air force pilot in Syria a decade ago, they said on Monday. The man, named in Swedish court documents as Osama Krayem, has previously been convicted for involvement in attacks in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels in 2016. The Islamic State militant group, which once imposed a reign of terror over millions of people in Syria and Iraq, captured Jordanian pilot Mouath al-Kasaesbeh in December 2014 and later published a video of him being burned alive in a cage. 'The man now requested for detention is suspected of having executed the pilot, together with other perpetrators belonging to IS,' the Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement. The prosecutors said Krayem, 32, alongside others, forced the pilot into the cage. The killing of the pilot violates the laws of war, and the killing and video constitute terrorist activities, they said. No individuals have so far stood trial for the killing of the Jordanian pilot, the prosecutors said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj6mu1nwkx	2025-01-20T06:14:37-08:00

Trump’s Middle East sheriff: How Steve Witkoff pressured Netanyah...	Incoming US president's Middle East envoy blends sharp negotiation skills with unwavering loyalty to Trump; a longtime ally, his mission prioritizes Trump’s vision over regional interests, with a focus on deals and diplomacy People who know Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s nominee for envoy to the Middle East, weren’t surprised to hear that a single stern talking to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convinced him to sign a deal that included a cease-fire and the return of hostages. 'He’s a smart man and a skilled negotiator,' said a source close to Witkoff over the weekend. 'His usual negotiation style isn’t confrontational—he doesn’t see the other side as an enemy, and he doesn’t look for blood on the floor before closing a deal. But that’s what makes him even more effective when he does come down hard. If you’ve managed to anger Steve, you’re in trouble. There’s no swear word he won’t use.' Witkoff is a staunch supporter of Israel—and, by extension, of Netanyahu. He attended the prime minister’s speech to Congress last year and called it an 'epic speech' when speaking to Republican members of Congress. But his loyalty to Trump is even stronger. Trump referred to him recently as 'not a nice guy'—said in the best possible sense. When it came to choosing between taking a softer approach with Netanyahu or following Trump’s instructions, there was no hesitation then, nor will there be any in the future. Witkoff took on the role previously held by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for the same reasons: loyalty to Trump, and a belief that no problem can’t be solved with a deal. Even the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in Trump’s eyes, isn’t a centuries-old religious struggle but rather a particularly complicated real estate negotiation. Witkoff’s flexibility in pursuit of a deal was evident in his collaboration with Joe Biden’s envoy, Brett McGurk. 'They had a productive partnership and worked in complete coordination,' an American official said. 'They didn’t get caught up in politics or rivalries between the two administrations. They had a common goal, and they achieved it.' Trump’s appointment of Witkoff as his Middle East envoy came as no surprise. The two have been close friends since their first meeting in 1986 when Witkoff was a young real estate attorney working at a New York law firm where Trump was a client. They first crossed paths at a deli after working on a joint deal. 'Trump didn’t have any cash on him, so I bought him a ham sandwich,' Witkoff once recounted. Witkoff was one of Trump’s most significant fundraisers during his presidential campaign and often served as the man cleaning up Trump’s messes behind the scenes. After Trump insulted Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, Witkoff flew to Atlanta to smooth things over. A few days later, Kemp announced his support for Trump. When Florida Governor Ron DeSantis dropped out of the primaries, Witkoff mediated a truce between the two. He arranged a breakfast meeting at Trump’s golf club north of Miami, where membership costs over $1 million. By the end of the meal, DeSantis shook hands with Trump and publicly endorsed him. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Witkoff, 67, is the son of a women’s coat manufacturer, born in the Bronx and raised in Long Island. Trained as a lawyer, he transitioned to real estate in the 1980s. He married Lauren Rappaport, and the couple had three sons: Zach, Alex and Andrew. In 1997, he founded the Witkoff Group, where his wife and two of his sons also work. Tragically, his youngest son, Andrew, died of an opioid overdose in 2011. Witkoff credits Trump for offering him comfort during that dark time, saying his support brought 'real solace in a dark hour.' Compared to the billionaires in Trump’s orbit, Witkoff is considered modest. His net worth is estimated at around $500 million, stemming from his ownership of dozens of properties in London, Miami and New York. He has strong connections in Abu Dhabi and Qatar, whose governments helped finance two major Witkoff Group projects in New York. Like Trump, Witkoff is a New Yorker who built his fortune in the city, brought his children into the business and then split his time between New York and Florida. As Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Witkoff’s first priority will always be Trump’s wishes—not necessarily the desires of the people in the region. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h111jtnopkg	2025-01-20T05:38:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/21/HysLak6f1l/HysLak6f1l_0_91_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Our driving force is the will of the Palestinian people, not Trump or the American administration.' He added, 'We have discussed the management of the Gaza Strip with the Palestinian Authority and agreed on a technocratic government, but Fatah has not agreed to this for now.

Houthis signal they'll limit attacks in the Red Sea corridor to I...	As the cease-fire in Gaza enters its second day, Houthis say they will now limit their attacks to 'Israeli-affiliated' vessels; The move, however, is unlikely to get international ships to feel safe entering the Red Sea via the Bab al-Mandab Strait Yemen's Houthi rebels have signaled they now will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships, just as a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip entered its second day Monday. The Houthis' announcement, made in an email sent to shippers and others on Sunday, likely won't be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that's crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. The Houthis separately planned a military statement on Monday, likely about the decision. The Houthis made the announcement through their Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center, saying it was 'stopping sanctions' on the other vessels it has previously targeted since November 2023. For Israeli ships, those 'sanctions ... will be stopped upon the full implementation of all phases' of the ceasefire, it added. However, the center left open resuming attacks against both the United States and the United Kingdom, which have launched airstrikes targeting the rebels over their seaborne assaults. 'In the event of any aggression ... the sanctions will be reinstated against the aggressor state,' the center said. 'You will be promptly informed of such measures should they be implemented.' The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel's military offensive in Gaza has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Iranian-backed Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels had maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked had little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. That may be due in part to the U.S. airstrike campaign. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. However, the rebels had continued to launch drones and missiles targeting Israel, which has warned it will continue to strike Houthi leadership. It also remains unclear how President-Elect Donald Trump will handle Yemen after he is inaugurated Monday. He may reapply a foreign terrorist organization designation on the Houthis that President Joe Biden revoked, which could spark attacks again. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryempoiwke	2025-01-20T02:48:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/05/rkUdBF3rp/rkUdBF3rp_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Brother of hostage says all must be freed	In an interview with ynet Danny Elgart whose brother Itzik is among the 94 hostages still held in Gaza, says believes Hamas has interest in deal playing out to the end; 'My real concern is with our side' Danny Elgart, the brother of hostage Itzik Elgart said on Monday that Israelis must keep their eyes on far-right allies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure the completion of the hostage deal and the return of all the captives. Speaking to ynet, Elgart said he believed Hamas had an interest in the cease-fire and hostage release deal continuing to its end. 'My real concern is with our side,' he said. 'I hope this process doesn’t stall and that everyone is brought back. We need to keep an eye on [ministers Itamar] Ben Gvir and [Bezalel] Smotrich, to ensure they don’t shift focus to other issues that could jeopardize this deal.' He did not hold back when addressing their tweets from last night, where they expressed excitement over the release of the three hostages. 'They’re hypocrites and cowards. Politicians of the lowest kind,' he said bluntly. Danny also stressed that his fight isn’t just for his brother’s return. 'We’re waiting for Itzik to surprise us. He always surprised us—I hope this time will be no different,' he shared. He reflected on their last conversation, on the morning of October 7. 'After he said to me, ‘This is the end,’ I just hope that wasn’t really the case.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He said that any deal must prioritize the living, even if his brother was no longer alive. 'If my brother isn’t alive then leave him there for now. Bring the living back first,' he said. 'I’m not just fighting for my brother’s return on a personal level—I’m fighting for this country to get back on track. Don’t bring back bodies now and leave living people behind.' Itzik is one of 94 hostages still being held in Gaza. According to estimates, dozens are believed to still be alive. Last night, after 471 days in captivity, Emily, Doron, and Romi were released. They spent the night with their families at Sheba Medical Center. The next wave of liberated captives is expected on Saturday, when four more are set to be freed. Now, all eyes in Israel are on Friday, when the next list of hostages slated for release is expected to arrive. The list, which will be provided by Qatar’s Prime Minister, is anticipated to include four women: one civilian and three military observers. Among those who may be released in the next phase are Arbel Yehud, Shiri Bibas (Mother of Kfir Bibas, who was just 8 months old on the day of his abduction), Karina Ariev, Liri Elbag, Daniela Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Agam Berger. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy11pzjiwye	2025-01-20T02:11:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/SJpnq3XDkl/SJpnq3XDkl_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Champion of the struggle for hostages vows to continue; 'Give me ...	Meirav Leshem Gonen reunited with her daughter on Sunday says the fight will go on untill all 94 remaining captives are free; 'I promise to be back,' she says 'our world now has only family, sorry' Meirav Leshem-Gonen, mother of freed hostage Romi and a champion of the struggle to free the hostages held in Gaza said on Monday that she will continue the fight. 'It will take me, us, a minute to breath her in and to believe in the reality we were able to achieve together,' she said in a post. 'I promise to be back. There are 94 loved ones that need this reality to come to fruition.' In an additional post she said the family was in an alternate universe, disconnected from the outside world. 'Our world has nothing but family. I'm sorry. Give us a minute and we will pull ourselves together and be back.' Over the 471 days of her daughter's captivity after she was abducted from the Nova music festival in the Oct. 7 massacre, Meirav became one of the more prominent voices in the struggle of the families of hostages. From the start of the war she was interviewed by media outlets around the world, met with leaders, and addressed international forums, while always maintaining her persistent stance. 'We are one big family,' she said of the families of hostages, refusing to receive information or advocate for herself, separately. On Sunday, mother and daughter were finally reunited. 'Where is my mother?' Romi asked upon her arrival in Israel. After the two were able to embrace, they joined the rest of the family, waiting for them at the Sheba Medical Center. Meirav's fight began 15 months ago. In an interview with Al Jazeera in November 2023 she refused to participate in a political debate and focused on one message – the release of the hostages. As her interviewer attempted to move the conversation to the 'occupied territories' and the siege on Gaza, Meirav stuck to her message. 'My daughter has been a captive for the past six weeks and she is wounded. I want her and all of the hostages to return.' She was asked about Romi's military service but rejected the attempts to claim that the politics were in the heart of the crisis. 'Stop asking questions about the territories,' she said pushing back on the accusations that her refusal to discuss such matters was a lack of courage. After receiving a sign of life from her daughter from a hostage who was freed in the first exchange, Meirav said the information was scant and concerning. Romi was alive but hurt and was not receiving proper treatment. 'This is enough to give me some peace,' she said but admitted that the situation was 'very challenging.' Meirav's leadership skills were revealed in an interview when she insisted that the struggle of the families was one and united. 'We are one big family and as such, we march together,' she said. 'I may have an easier time in interviews, but I do not have any more rights than the other families, to receive information. When the war resumed after some of the hostages were released in the first deal, she said she demands clear answers from the government about the continuation of negotiations for the release of the captives. 'I am not a strategist, I am a mother,' she said. During her address to the United Nations Human Rights Council last June, Meirav revealed for the first time, details of her daughter's abduction and their last conversation. 'Trying to escape from their murderous hands, she was shot while driving in a car with three other young people,' said the mother, who listened to the attack over the phone as it was happening. 'As the only survivor, she was brutally dragged by her long, beautiful hair from the car, along the road. I was a witness to this reality while speaking with her on the phone, hearing her helplessness and frustration without being able to help my baby. That was 257 days ago. Romi and 119 hostages are still being held without communication in the Gaza Strip to this day.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During that address which was the first time the UN held an official meeting with the families of hostages, she criticized the international body for ignoring their fate. 'Twenty-three-year-old girls should not be taken hostage, no one should. Mr. President, we should be on the same side. The side fighting hostage taking, never accepting the use of young women as political tools. I hope my Romi still believes in the free world, still believes in us, and still believes that together we will end the nightmare she is in. I believe we can do more for them, we can do better for them; the hostages need us, and the world needs them, please help me hug my daughter again.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hktrujsw1g	2025-01-20T02:04:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/BygY811T5vyg/BygY811T5vyg_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Captivity survivor takes to social media to thank her family and friends, expressing joy at simply being alive; calling her companions the 'best friends in the world,' they rushed to the hospital to greet her upon her arrival, providing a heartfelt reunion Emily Damari expressed her love and thanks in a post on Monday, her first reactions after her release from Hamas captivity. 'I love, love, love. I thank God. Thank the family, Oreli and the best friends I have in this world. I am back to life my loves. I saw just a snap of everything and you made my heart explode from excitement. Thank you, thank you, thank, you. I am happiest in the world just to be. Her mother Mandy said that her daughter was in better medical condition than they had feared. 'It is a huge joy to see, together with the world, a glimpse of her strength, determination and charisma as she was released. In Emily's own words, she is the happiest woman in the world. She has her life back,' the overjoyed Mandy said. 'It is important to remember that Hamas still holds 94 hostages. the cease-fire must continue until the last one of them is home,' she added. Damari’s friends could no longer contain themselves—they rushed to Sheba Medical Center on Sunday evening, where she was reunited with her family after 471 days in captivity. Draped in an Israeli flag and embraced by her mother and brother, Emily—known to many as 'everyone’s best friend'—was finally home. She spent the night surrounded by loved ones, her unmistakable smile lighting up every victory photo.

It shows how strong she is, and thank God she’s safe now,' said Noy Ben Moshe, a former army friend who was among the dozens who had come to the hospital to see her. 'I never thought this moment would actually come,' Ben Moshe added. 'We’re overwhelmed with mixed emotions because there are still others in captivity. Sadly, I’ve lost family members and friends from my hometown in the south. All of Emily’s friends are inside waiting to see her. The Emily I saw in the photo is the same Emily I’ve always known—strong and full of life.' Other friends described the emotional moments when Emily arrived at Sheba. Spotting them outside, she leaned out of a hospital window to wave. 'We shouted up to her, and she was so happy, so full of joy,' one friend said. 'We couldn’t rest until we saw her, and we still can’t rest—she’s Emily Damari, one in a million.' 'There are about 50 of us here, and more are on their way,' another friend added. 'She’s everyone’s friend. You’ll be hearing so much more about her. She’ll share her story, and I’m sure she was everyone’s best friend in captivity too. She’s our light, she’s magic. There’s a reason people everywhere are talking about Emily Damari.' Emily’s release was part of an emotional and dramatic day that also saw the liberation of Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher.

Qatar and Egypt navigate complex ties as Gaza’s future hangs in b...	Improved Egypt, Qatar ties raise concerns in Israel regarding Hamas' future, how strained alliances proceed and who will govern enclave; Saudi Arabia hints at quietly reshaping its role in the region As the Qatar-brokered hostage deal takes shape and three hostages have been reunited with their families, it’s hard to forget the 'Gentleman of Qatar,' who once rolled into Gaza in a luxury car brimming with suitcases stuffed with $30 million in cash. For nearly three years, Mohammed Al-Emadi, a senior official from Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made these high-profile visits to the Strip with the blessing of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But just before the seismic events of October 7, Israel abruptly slammed the brakes on the infamous 'dollar cars.' Since then, this peculiar chapter has all but vanished into the annals of forgotten history. An uneasy triangle: Israel, Egypt, and Qatar Israel’s grievances extend beyond the financial pipelines. Sharp accusations have been hurled at General Ahmed Abdel Khalek, the Egyptian intelligence officer overseeing Palestinian affairs. Israeli officials have alleged, with what they claim is solid evidence, that Abdel Khalek has shown a troubling tilt toward Hamas, often at the expense of Israel’s interests. As part of his role, Abdel Khalek has been seen roaming the streets of Gaza, even meeting with Hamas officials in situations that, according to Israeli sources, served no legitimate purpose. Early in the negotiations for the current deal, a high-ranking Israeli source close to the prime minister leaked to CNN allegations of Abdel Khalek’s blatant pro-Hamas bias. Yet, not only did Abdel Khalek retain his post, but his powers were reportedly expanded, further straining relations. The waters between Qatar and Egypt have long been murky and tumultuous. In June 2017, a coalition of Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt, severed ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting extremist Islamic factions and the Muslim Brotherhood—a group that posed a direct threat to Egypt and the Saudi monarchy. The boycott, driven by these accusations (widely seen as justified), cast Qatar into isolation. But Egypt, grappling with a dire economic crisis and soaring unemployment, was the first to break ranks in 2021. In a surprising gesture, Qatar's foreign minister arrived in Cairo to pave the way for a visit from the Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Alongside diplomatic smiles came checks of staggering proportions, as Qatar committed $5 billion to Egyptian economic projects. The deal effectively rewrote history, cooling the flames of Al Jazeera’s once-fiery anti-Egyptian broadcasts and providing Cairo with a much-needed financial lifeline. Yet, beneath the surface, suspicion still simmers, with Egypt wary of Qatar’s long-term intentions. Polished words in a fragile dance This weekend, Qatar lavished effusive praise on Egypt’s 'critical role' in brokering the hostage deal. Cairo returned the favor with its own honeyed statements, as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and his intelligence officials expressed gratitude to their counterparts in Doha. Israel, however, remains caught in a precarious balancing act with both nations. Officially, Israel has chosen to remain silent despite its frustrations. Meanwhile, anti-Israel propaganda continues to flow in Egypt with venom that could be described as lethal, while Al Jazeera’s inflammatory coverage enrages Qatari citizens. Amid hostility, the humanitarian plight of Gaza's Palestinian population remains a shared focal point, though one tinged with political calculations. So who will rebuild Gaza? With the agreement between Israel and Hamas now moving forward, the next phase of operations shifts to Egypt. Preparations are already underway for an international summit on Gaza’s reconstruction, but Israel will not be invited to the table. Cairo is determined to ensure, with absolute certainty, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian side of the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah border crossing. On one matter, however, all parties agree—no one wants Hamas to retain control of Gaza. Yet, the question of who should take over remains unresolved. Secret committees have deliberated but reached no consensus. The Palestinian Authority is seen as too feeble to govern effectively. Egypt, while adamant about denying Gaza residents access to its territory, is equally unwilling to assume full control of the enclave.

Trump takes a jab at Biden as he claims credit for hostage deal	Incoming president says deal underway one day before he takes office, thanks Steve Witkoff for doing 'very well' to secure the deal; 'We took in the first hostages today and they're coming in tomorrow and they're going to keep coming in,' he says Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump did not want to share credit with the outgoing Biden administration for the cease-fire and hostage release that began on Sunday. In a speech he gave in Washington, on the eve of his inauguration Trump wondered if the Biden team had anything to do with the successful outcome. 'It just happened to be one day before we took office,' he said taking a jab at the outgoing president and thanked his envoy Steve Witkoff. 'He just came back from the Middle East. He had a little project and he did very well on.' Trump who appeared not familiar with the terms of the deal said hostages would be released on Monday. 'We took in the first hostages today and they're coming in tomorrow and they're going to keep coming in,' he said. The deal began as the administrations were changing hands and with it was the battle for credit. While outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani. The Secretary thanked the Prime Minister for his critical role in mediation efforts to reach a ceasefire that will end fighting in Gaza, bring the hostages home, and enable a surge in humanitarian assistance,' the State Department said in a statement.

Gazans shocked at devastation; 'We have no life. We will live on ...	OCHA says 436,000 buildings destroyed, 276,000 damaged in war; residents return to search for their homes flattened by bombings; 'nothing is left from my home but the key' Gazans who were displaced by the war began returning home on Sunday to discover the devastation brining some to express shock and extreme frustration. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 436,000 buildings were destroyed in the Strip and 276,000 were severely or partially damaged after 90% of Gazans were displaced. 'What have we achieved? I have four houses and they are all flattned,' Mohammed Abu Bilal, who returned to Rafah told CNN. 'Where am I? Is this my house? Is this my live?' Another resident who returned to the city said he came to see if his house was standing but found it destroyed. 'We are defeated. We have no life. We will live on the streets.' The IDF began withdrawing from populated areas on Sunday as the cease-fire and hostage exchange deal came into effect after a three-hour delay after Hamas failed to deliver the names of the three first hostages that were to be freed. Thousands of people returned to areas in the northern parts of the Strip, even before the truce was announced.

'The entire area was bombed, and the devastation effected everything: people, stones and trees. There is nothing left of my house except the key,' she said. 'all our memories were destroyed with the house. May God compensate and reward us for this catastrophe. This is Hamas's victory.' 'It’s an indescribable scene. It’s like you see in a Hollywood horror movie,' Mohamed Abu Taha, a Rafah resident, told AP as he and his brother were inspecting his family home. 'Flattened houses, human remains, skulls and other body parts, in the street and in the rubble.' He shared footage of piles of rubble that he said had been his family’s house. 'I want to know how they destroyed our home.' Ahmed Abu Ayham, 40, of Gaza City said that while the ceasefire may have spared lives, the losses and destruction made it no time for celebration. 'We are in pain, deep pain and it is time to hug one another and cry,' he said. For Hamas the cease-fire allowed armed fighters to come out of hiding on to the streets to demonstrate power.

Trump on hostage deal: 'We’ve achieved in 3 months more than Bide...	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday praised the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, calling it an 'epic cease-fire agreement' and 'a first step toward lasting peace in the Middle East.' His remarks came during a rally in Washington, D.C., on the eve of his inauguration. 'This agreement could only have happened as a result of our historic victory in November,' Trump declared, linking the breakthrough to his election win. He added, 'I’m glad to report that the first hostages have just been released... and who knows what’s going to happen.' Trump’s comments followed his administration's behind-the-scenes role in finalizing the deal. While publicly threatening Hamas with 'all hell to pay' if hostages were not released by his inauguration, reports indicate that Trump’s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, also pressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make necessary compromises during a meeting on January 11. Outgoing President Joe Biden has defended his administration’s role in the agreement, highlighting that it is based on a framework his team developed in May. However, White House officials acknowledged collaboration with Trump’s transition team, describing it as critical to sealing the deal. Trump, taking aim at Biden, said, 'Our incoming administration has achieved all of this in the Middle East, in less than three months, without being president — we’ve achieved more… than they’ve achieved in four years with being president.' His remarks drew cheers from the crowd, underscoring the incoming administration’s ambition to reshape U.S. policy in the region.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyhzi11ovjg	2025-01-19T14:33:00-08:00

Israeli officials accuse Red Cross of delaying prisoner release	Officials claim humanitarian movement stalling on purpose to portray Israel as failing to uphold its commitments under the agreement; matter has been referred to Israeli security authorities for investigation Israeli officials involved in the release of Palestinian prisoners from Ofer Prison accused Red Cross representatives late on Sunday of intentionally delaying the process to extend it past the agreed-upon timeline. Although Israel initially intended to release the prisoners shortly after the hostages were returned, six hours later, the release had yet to begin. Israeli Prison Service (IPS) officials attributed the delay to routine medical checks and Red Cross supervision required for the prisoners’ transfer. However, as midnight approached, Israeli officials claimed the move aimed to portray Israel as failing to uphold its commitments under the agreement. The matter has been referred to Israeli security authorities for investigation. Under the terms of the deal, 90 Palestinian prisoners are slated for release, including 69 women and 21 men. Red Cross officials have yet to respond to the allegations. The move comes hours after the release of three Israeli hostages—Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher—from Hamas captivity. At Ofer Prison, where the prisoners were gathered under tight security involving 1,500 security personnel, tensions mounted among inmates. Some banged on doors and shouted in frustration. Outside the prison, police and Border Police forces dispersed dozens of protesters attempting to storm the facility, arresting three individuals. Demonstrators also tried to block roads leading to the prison, but officers preemptively secured key routes. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Of the 90 prisoners, 78 were slated for release at the Beitunia checkpoint near Ramallah, while 12 from East Jerusalem were transferred to the Russian Compound detention facility in Jerusalem before returning home. While Israeli authorities plan to suppress public celebrations in East Jerusalem, they acknowledge they cannot prevent festivities in Palestinian Authority territories. In Beitunia, Palestinian crowds waving Hamas and Hezbollah flags gathered in anticipation of the release. Photos of slain Hamas leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, were displayed, prompting clashes with Israeli forces, who deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd. The prisoners being released include individuals convicted of incitement, affiliation with terror groups and attempted terrorist attacks. Among them are minors involved in significant terror incidents, including a 15-year-old who carried out a shooting in Jerusalem’s City of David and a 17-year-old who injured two people in an attack in the capital's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. High-profile detainees include A'blaa Saadat, wife of Popular Front leader Ahmed Saadat, and Khalida Jarrar, a senior Popular Front figure linked to the 2019 murder of Israeli teen Rina Shnerb. The release has heightened concerns among Israeli settlers about a potential wave of renewed terrorism. The IDF has bolstered its presence along major routes and stated its intent to act decisively against any attempts by released prisoners to reestablish terror networks. 'We will identify any activity and respond with force to suspected terror actions,' said a senior security official. The release is part of the first phase of a broader exchange deal, under which Israel is expected to release nearly 2,000 prisoners for 33 Israeli hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rybxyzspkg	2025-01-19T13:54:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/Hybi1goPJg/Hybi1goPJg_0_19_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Speaking in the ILTV News studio on Sunday as Hamas released Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, he said, 'Let’s celebrate the return of these three women today and hope that many more come.

'Finally, the true strength of Israel and the Jewish people is the value it places on each and every individual life.'

Hostages free, but Hamas threat remains, expert says	Or Yissachar: Hamas is 'obsessed with antisemitic, vile rhetoric' While Israel should celebrate the release of three female hostages on Sunday, the country must also reflect on 'who we are as a nation' and how to handle the Hamas terror organization moving forward, said Or Yissachar of the IDSF-Habithonistim organization. He told ILTV News on Sunday, during a live broadcast as the hostages crossed from Gaza into Israel, that Hamas is 'obsessed with antisemitic, vile rhetoric' and warned that despite agreeing to a ceasefire, the group would aim to carry out another attack like October 7 in the future. Furthermore, he noted, 'Fatah praised the October 7 [massacre] and vowed to repeat the October 7 attack after the ceasefire' agreement was signed. Yissachar emphasized that he believes Israel has become 'disillusioned' by Hamas’s behavior and has come to accept the current paradigm. Once the hostages are released, he told ILTV, Israel must work to change this paradigm. On Sunday, Hamas released Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari.

How did the Israel Police prepare for the return of three female ...	Dean Elsdunne: 'It’s important to remember that in the framework of this release of our loved ones from terrorist captivity is the release of terrorists' The Israel Police carried out extensive preparations for various security scenarios as the country prepared to welcome the first three hostages to be released as part of Phase I of the hostage deal, according to International Police Spokesperson Dean Elsdunne. On Sunday, Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari were freed from the grips of Hamas. Elsdunne explained that police guarded and escorted the women as they returned from the Gaza border to Sheba Medical Center in central Israel. Additionally, police officers were stationed outside the hospital and at the individuals’ homes to ensure their safety. 'It’s important to remember that in the framework of this release of our loved ones from terrorist captivity—where they were taken from their homes, from a Nova music festival—is the release of terrorists,' Elsdunne noted. 'So, Israel Police also prepared for this.' He emphasized that the Israel Police have zero tolerance for any type of celebration, identification with, or support for the released terrorists or the Hamas organization. As such, any Arab residents of Israel displaying such support would be arrested. 'Over the last few days, when people identified with terrorists, wrapped themselves in Hamas flags, or handed out sweets in Shuafat in Jerusalem, we went in and arrested them,' Elsdunne said. 'They’re in custody now.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1sv2ejvkx	2025-01-19T13:30:58-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/SkM2Ks09v1g/SkM2Ks09v1g_0_131_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Pardons, Gaza cease-fire and farewells: Biden wraps up presidency	On his final day as president, Biden delivers reflective speech in South Carolina, marking key achievements like ending Gaza war and granting symbolic pardons; as Trump prepares to return, Biden bids farewell with highlights in diplomacy and gratitude to pivotal supporters The 46th and outgoing president of the United States, Joe Biden, is spending his final full day in office before handing over the White House to Donald Trump, who is set to return for a second non-consecutive term. Biden's last day has been marked by symbolism, reflection and action. He spent much of the day in South Carolina, the state credited with revitalizing his political career during the 2020 Democratic primaries, using the opportunity to deliver significant messages, including remarks on the cease-fire in Gaza, which overshadowed much of his final year in office. Biden also issued a series of last-minute pardons, cementing his legacy as a president who embraced redemption and second chances. Trump’s return to power Meanwhile, all eyes are on Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony, set to take place on Monday. His return to the White House is already being framed as bold and theatrical, with insiders describing the plans as aimed to 'create shock and awe.' Reports highlight the extravagant guest list, ticket costs and the notable figures invited, including the leader of the anti-Israel Satmar Hasidic sect and Hollywood icons Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone, assigned as Trump’s 'ambassadors' to the entertainment industry. A final bow in South Carolina At 82 years old, Biden will officially conclude his term on Monday noon, just after Trump’s swearing-in. Choosing to spend his final hours as president in South Carolina, Biden delivered a poignant speech at a local church, part of the federal holiday honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. South Carolina holds a special place in Biden's heart—it was the state that rescued his faltering 2020 campaign, delivering him his first primary victory after early losses in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. The state’s majority-Black Democratic electorate provided Biden with the momentum that carried him through the primaries and ultimately to the presidency. Congressman Jim Clyburn, a close ally of Biden and a key figure in securing his South Carolina victory, described the president’s visit as a gesture of gratitude. Following his church address, Biden and First Lady Jill Biden visited the International African American Museum, built on the historic site where tens of thousands of enslaved Africans were brought to America between the late 18th century and 1808. Reflections on Gaza and diplomacy Biden also addressed the recent release of Israeli hostages Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher from Gaza, expressing prayers for their recovery and their families. 'Today, the guns in Gaza have fallen silent,' Biden proclaimed, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy and urging the incoming administration to ensure the agreement’s full implementation. He highlighted the second phase of negotiations, set to begin on the 16th day of the first phase, as a critical opportunity to end Hamas’s rule in Gaza. 'This phase includes the release of Israeli soldiers and a complete end to the war, with Hamas no longer in power or capable of threatening Israel,' Biden stated, underscoring his hopes for lasting peace. Second chances On his final full day in office, Biden issued pardons to five individuals and commuted the sentences of two others, a continuation of his commitment to justice reform. In the United States, a pardon absolves an individual of guilt and punishment, while a commutation reduces or eliminates a sentence without erasing the underlying conviction. The most prominent figure to receive a pardon was Marcus Garvey, the civil rights pioneer convicted of mail fraud in 1923. Garvey, whose sentence was commuted by President Calvin Coolidge in 1927, is celebrated as the first leader to organize a mass movement among African Americans. His legacy inspired figures like Malcolm X and others in the civil rights movement. Advocates have long argued that Garvey’s conviction was politically motivated, intended to suppress his growing influence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Other recipients included Don Scott, the first Black Speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates, who served eight years in prison for drug offenses in the 1990s before rebuilding his life in public service. Scott described the pardon as a moment of redemption for a mistake that profoundly shaped his life. Biden extended clemency to several others, including an immigrant rights activist convicted of a non-violent offense, a prison reform advocate whose sentence was previously commuted by Bill Clinton, and a gun violence prevention activist who has since dedicated his life to researching and combating gun violence. Biden’s clemency record has been historic. Just days ago, he commuted the sentences of nearly 2,500 convicted of non-violent drug offenses. However, one of his most controversial acts was pardoning his son, Hunter Biden, who faced charges related to firearms and taxes. The move, seen by many as an attempt to shield Hunter from potential targeting by Trump’s incoming administration, drew sharp criticism. Biden also commuted the death sentences of 37 federal inmates, replacing them with life imprisonment without parole. Sources suggest Biden may use his final hours in office to issue additional pardons, particularly to figures he fears could face retribution under Trump’s administration. Among the names floated are Liz Cheney, the Republican congresswoman and staunch Trump critic, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who led the nation’s COVID-19 response. A presidency concludes As Biden prepares to leave office, his final actions reflect a presidency defined by its commitment to unity, diplomacy and redemption. Whether through his efforts to end the Gaza war or his record-setting clemency, Biden’s legacy is one of striving to mend a divided nation. As Trump prepares to return to power, the stark contrast between the two leaders’ approaches is already shaping the narrative of America’s political future. Thank you, Mr. President! >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj4obkop1x	2025-01-19T12:59:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/HJdzlncwJx/HJdzlncwJx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Terror group gifts hostages bags with 'souvenirs,' including symbolic 'release notice' and photo of Gaza; footage shows Emily Damari pushing Hamas terrorists as she exits vehicle Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher, freed Sunday in the first phase of a hostage deal, revealed new details of their harrowing 471-day captivity in Gaza. Emily and Romi were held together, and Hamas handed each woman a bag containing 'souvenirs' of their time in captivity, including a photo of Gaza. A video released by Hamas showed Emily pushing a terrorist while exiting a vehicle and receiving a 'release notice,' which was placed in the bag. The bags were visible when Emily and Doron arrived at a reception site in Re’im, after Israeli forces transported the hostages from Gaza to Israeli territory. Israeli officials called the items a 'cynical and psychological exploitation of women who were deprived of their freedom by monsters.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following their handover to the Red Cross, the hostages were driven by IDF and Shin Bet personnel to the border, where they reunited with their mothers. After an emotional reunion and initial medical checks, the three women were flown by Air Force helicopters to Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv for further care. At the reception site, Romi was heard calling, 'Where is my mom? Where is my mom?' Her mother, Merav Leshem-Gonen—one of the leaders of the campaign to free the hostages—embraced her, fulfilling a 15-month-long struggle. A leopard-print blanket, Romi's favorite color, awaited her in the helicopter. Emily’s mother, Mandy, was seen smiling in a video call Emily made to friends. Another photo showed Emily raising her bandaged hand in a victory gesture, though two fingers were missing, a result of gunfire during her abduction from her home in Kfar Aza on October 7. Doron Steinbrecher’s family expressed gratitude in a statement: 'After 471 unbearable days, our beloved Dodo has returned to our arms,' her family released a statement. 'We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who supported us throughout this journey. Special thanks to the people of Israel for their unwavering support and strength during the hardest times.

Disaster waiting to happen: Is Israel ready to face extreme natur...	Widespread fires like those in Los Angeles, excessive rain and flooding and devastating earthquakes can hit Israel at any time, but is the country ready for such scenarios? Recent days have been marked by shock around the world at the massive fires in Los Angeles, which claimed the lives of at least 27 people and caused damage worth tens of billions of dollars. Historical natural disasters aren't exclusive to foreign nations — they can strike Israel as well. Despite numerous warnings, it seems the country — unaccustomed to extreme natural events — is unprepared for a large-scale disaster. The October 7 attack revealed the vast gap between the promises of Israeli officials and reality, proving that the lofty rhetoric of public statements often lacks substance. The issue is that contingency plans are often tested only in extreme cases, where the cost of failure is immeasurably high. This is where the state comptroller steps in to warn and alert. However, his reports often make a brief splash in public discourse before fading away, with little public pressure on ministers to prepare for scenarios that are hard to imagine until they take place. Successive state comptrollers, including the incumbent Matanyahu Englman, have repeatedly warned that Israel isn't prepared for a catastrophic natural disaster. For example, our region is historically prone to earthquakes, primarily along the Dead Sea Fault, part of the Syrian-African Rift. Most tremors are of low intensity, but every century or so, a major earthquake occurs. The last significant one struck about 98 years ago, killing 130 and injuring 450 in Israel. Approximately 300 homes collapsed in that event when the area was far less populated. Today, a powerful earthquake could bring unprecedented challenges, including the risk of tsunamis. According to Israel’s National Emergency Management Authority (NEMA), a major earthquake could cause extensive damage, including building collapses, transportation disruptions, road blockages, fires and hazardous material leaks. The physical destruction would likely result in casualties, displaced residents and increased strain on emergency services. Public services might face partial to full shutdowns, including schools and workplaces, while critical rescue, health, military and police forces could be stretched thin. Healthcare systems could become overwhelmed with the influx of injured people and suffer staff shortages. Essential supplies like food, medicine and fuel might face distribution challenges, prolonging recovery efforts. The greatest danger lies along the Syrian-African Rift, running through eastern Israel from Eilat to the Golan Heights, including the Jordan Valley, Dead Sea and Arava Desert. Another seismic hotspot is the Yagur Fault, spanning northern Mount Carmel to Yokne’am, potentially affecting Haifa Bay and the Lower Galilee. In 2005, Israel introduced National Master Plan 38 (TAMA 38) to strengthen approximately 80,000 buildings constructed before 1980. However, most developers focused on the densely populated central region, where property values are higher, rather than vulnerable areas like Tiberias, where a series of minor quakes in 2018 caused structural damage. Residents then warned, 'A major earthquake will come and the buildings will collapse.' State Comptroller Englman’s January 2024 follow-up report revealed little progress since his predecessor Yosef Shapira’s 2018 findings. By the end of 2022, only 4,755 residential buildings had been approved for reinforcement, with work completed on just 3,000 — mainly in central Israel. In the country's periphery, near fault lines, less than 1% of the required buildings were reinforced. Despite some positive steps, such as establishing an inter-ministerial team to draft a long-term earthquake recovery strategy in 2022, many issues remain unresolved. For example, only 87 out of 1,600 schools requiring maintenance work were completed or nearing completion. Similarly, the Transportation Ministry has yet to standardize infrastructure checks for tunnels nationwide. In October 2023, in a report delayed by the outbreak of war, Ynet examined transportation bridges for earthquake safety. Israel’s national transportation infrastructure company Netivei Israel reported at the time that only five of 34 bridges requiring repairs had not been addressed, but those have since been fixed. Meanwhile, in Netivei Ayalon, it was found that 20 out of approximately 80 bridges were designed before 1992 and did not meet seismic standards. Senior officials told Ynet this week that the company addressed these bridges over the past two years at a cost of about NIS 50 million (approximately $13.2 million). While significant improvements have been made, such as reinforcing critical bridges and introducing early warning systems, much remains to be done. In late October 2024, a false earthquake alert triggered by an explosion in Lebanon served as a stark reminder of these dangers but was quickly forgotten. Israel also faces challenges from extreme heat, wildfires and floods exacerbated by climate change. In recent years, devastating fires have occurred, including the Carmel forest fire disaster in 2010 and smaller-scale fires in 2021 that burned 11,000 acres near Jerusalem. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Yet, Israel’s firefighting services remain understaffed, with only about 2,100 firefighters—half the OECD-recommended number for a country of Israel's size. Financial constraints further hinder the fire department’s capacity to investigate incidents and learn from them. Efforts have been made to bolster Israel’s firefighting capabilities, including adopting smaller fire trucks and establishing local teams. Awareness campaigns about the risks of hot, dry weather have also improved readiness. However, forecasts predict longer and more intense heatwaves, which will likely increase wildfires and strain energy suppliers. The Environmental Protection Ministry, under Minister Idit Silman, has done little to address these challenges. Floods pose another growing threat, with heavier rainfall over shorter periods overwhelming Israel’s outdated drainage infrastructure. A 2021 state comptroller report called for a nationwide strategy to reduce flood risks, yet coordination between government bodies remains fragmented. Recent pilot projects have introduced flood detection systems on major highways, providing early warnings and preventing accidents. As these challenges mount, it’s clear that Israel must invest more in preparedness to mitigate the devastating impacts of natural disasters. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkp8jk5vjg	2025-01-19T11:31:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/rJSQEZ11P1g/rJSQEZ11P1g_0_129_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Shock and awe': Trump's plans to kickstart his second term	Trump plans sweeping day-one executive orders: hardline immigration policies, mass deportations, ending birthright citizenship, banning transgender women in sports/military, freeing Jan. 6 rioters and slashing funds for schools with vaccine mandates During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly stated his intention to act as a 'dictator in the first 24 hours,' promising to sign 'at least 100 executive orders' immediately after his inauguration. Trump's allies, including the initiators of Project 2025, a 900-page conservative policy plan that Trump claimed on the campaign trail to be unfamiliar with, have prepared a stack of executive orders for him. These orders cover a wide range of topics, including immigration, transgender rights and the dismantling of large parts of outgoing President Joe Biden's energy and climate policies. 'I can undo almost everything Biden did through executive orders, and on the first day, a lot of it will be canceled,' Trump told Time Magazine last November. However, many of the orders may be more symbolic than practical, and some could exceed the scope of his authority, as a president cannot overturn laws. Nevertheless, according to his advisers, the plan is to create a 'shock and awe' effect within minutes of his return to the White House. The first orders on immigration, a central topic in Trump’s campaign, may include closing the southern border, reinstating entry bans for migrants from certain countries, and halting the acceptance of refugees. 'I want to close the border,' Trump said at a campaign rally in July. 'On the first day, I will reinstate the entry bans, suspend refugee admissions, stop the colonization of America and keep terrorists out of our country.' Stephen Miller, Trump’s most extreme adviser on immigration, said last month that Trump would issue a series of executive orders on the first day to 'initiate the largest deportation operation in American history.' Republican Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said he expects the president-elect to initially focus on deporting about one million immigrants. 'That’s the easy part,' Lankford said. 'These are people who recently crossed the border, immigrants who are legally present but have been convicted of crimes, and those whom the court has ordered deported. That’s over one million people who can be deported immediately.' Trump has pledged during his campaign to end the automatic birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S. If he indeed signs such an executive order, it would be one of the most radical ones in presidential history and seemingly unconstitutional. It would also face immediate legal challenges. Another order may involve withholding federal resources from liberal cities designated as 'sanctuary cities' for immigrants and refugees. Beyond immigration, no issue has energized Trump’s supporters more than the fight against transgender rights and the rights of non-binaries. This is also where it will be easiest for him to sign orders that take immediate effect, as they do not overturn existing laws but rather create new prohibitions. For example, Trump promised during the campaign to protect women's rights by banning transgender women (biological males who have undertaken procedures to transition to women) from competing in women’s sports. 'We’re going to stop the transgender madness on day one,' Trump said. 'I will sign orders to end the sexual mutilation of children and remove transgenders from the military.' During his first term, Trump already banned transgender people from serving in the military, a ban that was later reversed by Biden. 'Under the Trump administration,' he noted, 'it will be the official policy of the U.S. government that there are only two genders: male and female.' Another expected order involves directing the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to 'convene an external panel to investigate whether hormone treatments for transgender people increase the risk of severe depression and violence.' Another element of Trump’s cultural war appeal to his supporters may involve cutting federal funding for schools that teach the history of race relations in the U.S. or implement diversity and inclusion policies, commonly known as DEI. Schools that enforce vaccine mandates may also face funding cuts. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another significant order may involve granting blanket pardons to more than 1,500 convicted of crimes related to the storming of Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021. In an interview with Time after his election victory, Trump said that pardoning those convicted in connection to January 6 would be something he’d do 'within the first nine minutes.' He said, 'If they weren’t violent and were punished without reason, I’ll release them. I’ll also review the convictions of those accused of violence.' It seems the area most likely to see a flood of orders on Monday will be a comprehensive attack on Biden’s climate and energy policies. Trump received tens of millions of dollars in donations from U.S. oil and gas industry leaders and reciprocated with a laundry list of promises. First, he will cancel regulations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on car emissions, which were designed to encourage automakers to sell more electric and hybrid vehicles. Trump is also expected to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement for the second time. During his first term, leaving the agreement took several months due to opposition from some close advisers and cabinet members, but this time, his plans are expected to advance unopposed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1yaufcwjl	2025-01-19T10:46:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/03/Syb86DZBW1l/Syb86DZBW1l_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Qatar says 'won’t allow' Gaza truce to end after one phase, aimin...	Qatari Foreign Ministry Spokesman Majed Al-Ansari underscored the fragility of the Gaza cease-fire during an interview on Al Jazeera on Sunday, stressing the importance of continued diplomatic efforts to ensure its success. 'The mediators assured rapid implementation after this morning’s delay,' Al-Ansari said, referencing the initial logistical setbacks in the hostage exchange process. He expressed optimism about the agreement’s potential to stabilize the situation in Gaza, noting, 'We hope for calm to prevail during the next phase of the deal.' Al-Ansari emphasized Qatar’s commitment to extending the truce beyond the first stage of the agreement. 'We won’t allow this agreement to end after one phase,' he said. 'We aim for it to open the door to lasting peace.' The agreement, which includes the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, has been marked by logistical challenges and heightened regional tensions. Qatar, serving as a key mediator, has worked to coordinate the deal, including facilitating humanitarian aid and the return of displaced individuals. 'There are logistical details requiring effort and monitoring,' Al-Ansari added. 'The developments prove that the only path to peace and the return of hostages is through diplomacy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjzpmaqdje	2025-01-19T10:34:59-08:00

Outgoing National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who resigned from the government in protest over the approval of a contentious hostage exchange deal, reiterated his opposition Sunday while expressing joy at the return of three Israeli hostages. 'Romi, Doron and Emily, we are happy and excited at your return and await the others,' Ben-Gvir said in a statement. 'This must be done through military force, halting fuel and humanitarian aid, not through surrender.' Ben-Gvir, leader of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, voted against the deal in the Cabinet, arguing that the release of Palestinian prisoners, including those convicted of violence, was a capitulation to terrorism. His resignation marked a significant rift in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, which has seen growing tensions over the terms of the cease-fire and hostage negotiations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkc911a5wyl	2025-01-19T10:27:47-08:00

Israeli lawmaker blasted for comparing hostage return to release ...	MK Ayman Odeh of the predominantly Arab Hadash-Ta’al party faced fierce criticism from right-wing politicians on Sunday after expressing satisfaction over the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Odeh wrote, 'Now we must free both peoples from the burden of occupation. We are all free.' The comment drew sharp condemnation from lawmakers across the political spectrum. Yisrael Beitenu Chairman and former defense minister Avigdor Liberman accused Odeh of acting as 'Hamas’ spokesperson in the Knesset,' adding that he 'should go to Gaza with them.' Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar said, 'Anyone celebrating the release of murderous terrorists belongs in prison, not the Knesset.' Odeh, a prominent voice for Arab citizens in Israel, has often drawn fire for his outspoken views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His latest remarks came amid heightened tensions following a contentious cease-fire and a prisoner-hostage exchange deal, which saw the release of several dozen Palestinian prisoners, including convicted murderers.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rysskaqv1x	2025-01-19T10:22:53-08:00

After 471 days in Hamas captivity, Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher reunite with their mothers and airlifted to Sheba Medical Center; Emily, seen smiling with a bandaged hand, lost two fingers during her abduction; Romi embraced her mother, Merav, a leading advocate for the hostages’ release, while Doron and her mother wept during their emotional reunion Romi Gonen, 24, from Kfar Vradim, Emily Damari, 28, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31, both from Kfar Aza, were released Sunday afternoon after 471 days in Hamas captivity. The women, who were handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza earlier in the day, reunited with their mothers at an IDF reception center near the Gaza border before being airlifted by helicopter to Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer for medical evaluation and a family reunion. The IDF confirmed that the hostages crossed into Israeli territory at 5:53 p.m., with emotional footage showing their first contact with IDF forces inside Gaza. After reaching the reception center, the three embraced their mothers in scenes of relief and joy. Emily Damari's mother, Mandy, awaited her daughter alongside the mothers of Gonen and Steinbrecher. The two were photographed smiling together during a video call with Emily’s friends. In another image, Emily, whose hand was bandaged, raised it in a victory sign, though it was visibly missing two fingers, likely lost when she was shot during her abduction from her home in Kfar Aza on October 7. The IDF said that the three hostages, accompanied by their mothers, were en route to Sheba Medical Center via an Air Force helicopter for medical assessments and to reunite with other family members. Emily, a dual Israeli-British citizen, expressed gratitude through her mother Mandy in a statement to the BBC issued shortly after it was confirmed she was in the country: 'After 471 days Emily is finally home. I want to thank everyone who never stopped fighting for Emily throughout this horrendous ordeal, and who never stopped saying her name. In Israel, Britain, the United States and around the world. Thank you for bringing Emily home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Where is my mother? Where is my mother?' Gonen called out to IDF representatives at the reception center immediately after crossing the border from Gaza. Romi's mother, Merav Leshem Gonen—one of the leading advocates for the release of hostages over the past 15 months—was waiting for her alongside the Damari and Steinbrecher's mothers at the Re’im crossing near the Gaza border. An IDF helicopter prepared to transport Romi to Sheba Medical Center had a leopard-print blanket, her favorite color, waiting for her. Romi’s friends gathered at the Tel Aviv restaurant where she worked, watching her release unfold. Romi's grandmother, Deborah, expressed her joy, telling Channel 12 that Romi appeared 'excellent' as she was seen standing on her feet during her handover by Hamas terrorists to the Red Cross in Gaza. Deborah added emotionally, 'This is the only reason I’m still alive. I pray for the release of all the other hostages. We must do everything to bring them home. My heart is with everyone, not just my granddaughter. I know how much they’re suffering, just as Romi suffered. We must bring them all back.' Doron Steinbrecher was seen surrounded by thousands of armed terrorists during her transfer to a Red Cross vehicle. Friends of Doron celebrated her release and her arrival in Israel about an hour later. 'After 471 unbearable days, our beloved Dodo has returned to our arms,' her family released a statement. 'We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who supported us throughout this journey. Special thanks to the people of Israel for their unwavering support and strength during the hardest times. We also thank President Trump for his involvement and significant support.' 'Our heroic Dodo, who survived 471 days in Hamas captivity, begins her journey of recovery today. We will continue standing alongside all the families and do everything possible until all their loved ones are home.' Ophir Cohen, Doron’s best friend, who received her final recording on October 7, shared: 'We set up speakers, brought tons of alcohol and closed off our room in Ruhama. I’m feeling every emotion—crying and laughing at the same time. Thank God she’s finally in good hands. God, she’s home. I only saw her sister Yamit in the morning and promised to take out her dog. Soon, they’ll all reunite. Finally.' She added: 'We’re so happy they’re together, and that they’re okay. What a dream, what a joy to see them after all this time. Her hair is brown! We recognized her—she’s healthy and on her feet. Thank God. We’re in tears of joy.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ghmt9pjl	2025-01-19T09:38:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/H1MbNshcwye/H1MbNshcwye_123_0_1551_873_0_small.jpg
As dozens of Palestinian prisoners set for release, Israeli secur...	Police and Border Police forces announce heightened readiness to counter any attempts by released prisoners to reestablish terror networks, following imminent release of 90 inmates as part of ongoing hostage-prisoner exchange deal With the return of three Israeli hostages — Doron Steinbrecher, Emily Damari and Romi Gonen — on Sunday, the release of Palestinian prisoners began as well. Some 90 prisoners were released in the first batch, consisting of women and minors. Police and Border Police forces have prepared outside Ofer Prison, where the prisoners, gathered from various detention facilities, were released through the Bitunya checkpoint. Dozens of protesters opposing the releases attempted to rush toward the prison compound but were blocked by police. Two individuals were arrested in the ensuing clashes, authorities confirmed. The Israel Prison Service (IPS) hung a sign at the prison entrance conveying a vow of retribution against the released prisoners, reading, 'The eternal nation does not forget. I will pursue my enemies and overtake them!' The message was displayed in both Hebrew and Arabic. Twelve of the released prisoners are set to be released to East Jerusalem. Members of the Nachshon unit, the IPS's primary prisoner transport unit, are tasked with transferring the prisoners to the central intake point at the prison. A total of approximately 1,500 IPS officers participated in the operation. Upon arrival, the prisoners were identified by International Red Cross Committee representatives and held until the Israeli hostages returned. The prisoners were transported by the Red Cross from Ofer Prison to their release points only after receiving confirmation from officials. The IPS received the full list of prisoners to be released on Sunday, though it has not been publicly disclosed. However, it is known that 90 prisoners are being released from a previously published list of 95. According to the government-approved framework, 30 Palestinian prisoners (minors or women) are to be released in exchange for a living hostage or kidnapped children under 19 (excluding soldiers). The IDF plans to reinforce key routes ahead of the return of prisoners to the West Bank and will act decisively against any attempts by released prisoners to reestablish terrorist infrastructure. 'We’ll identify any attempted gatherings and act against any suspected terrorist activity. The gloves are off. We’re operating from the air and the ground. There's a shift in how we think about the area,' a security source said.

Emily Damari, freed after 471 days in Hamas captivity, reunites with her mother Mandy at Gaza border; Mandy thanks those who fought for Emily's release and calls for freeing all hostages; in video call, Emily smiled, holding up her bandaged hand, missing 2 fingers The ordeal of Emily Damari, 28, came to an end Sunday evening as she was released from Hamas captivity in Gaza after 471 harrowing days, alongside Doron Steinbrecher and Romi Gonen. Emily’s mother, Mandy, was among the first to greet her at an IDF reception center near the Re’im crossing, where families were reunited shortly after the hostages crossed into Israeli territory. A video call captured the emotional moment Emily spoke to friends, smiling despite her injuries.

'Every last hostage must be released, and humanitarian aid must be provided to the hostages who are still waiting to come home,' she continued. She also requested privacy for Emily and their family during this time. At the Re’im base entrance, dozens of supporters held signs, including one reading, 'Our Emily, welcome home. Our hero!' Emily was abducted from her home during the October 7 Hamas attack. She had been sheltering in a safe room with neighbor Gali Berman—who was also kidnapped along with his twin brother Ziv—and another neighbor. Before their abduction, the group managed to send a selfie, which only reached Berman’s mother later that evening. During the attack, Hamas terrorists killed Emily’s dog and shot her in the hand, likely leading to the loss of two fingers. Mandy narrowly escaped harm when she hid in her home. A bullet fired by the assailants jammed the lock on her hiding place, preventing the attackers from entering. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1pfvh5pkx	2025-01-19T08:47:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/B1J9W3qvkg/B1J9W3qvkg_0_0_961_541_0_small.jpg

Leopard blanket and a mother’s love: Anticipation builds for Romi...	Merav Leshem Gonen shares emotional post ahead of her daughter Romi's release after 471 days in Hamas captivity; IDF helicopter, ready to transport Romi, holds her favorite leopard-print blanket; friends gathered at her Tel Aviv workplace to watch Romi Gonen, 24, from Kfar Vradim, was released Sunday evening as part of the initial phase of the hostage deal after 471 harrowing days in Hamas captivity in Gaza. Joining her in the release were Emily Damari, 28, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31, both from Kfar Aza. Gonen’s mother, Merav Leshem-Gonen, waited anxiously at the Re’im border crossing, hoping for an early reunion once the hostages are transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza by the Red Cross. An IDF helicopter prepared to evacuate Gonen to a hospital also carried a leopard-print blanket, her favorite. Friends of Gonen gathered at a restaurant on Tel Aviv’s Dizengoff Street, where she had worked before her abduction, to watch the moments of her release and share in the emotional event. Leshem-Gonen, who fought tirelessly for the release of her daughter over the past year and three months, shared her emotions in a heartfelt message just before the reunion. 'The excitement is at its peak,' she wrote after receiving official confirmation that Romi was on the list of hostages to be released. 'Soon, we will see our loved ones. We will meet our Romi and begin true healing. You’re likely watching the news, following along as we are. These are moments that require us to take deep breaths, stay strong, and support one another. Sending a hug to all of us, and so much love.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Romi was abducted from the Nova music festival during the October 7 Hamas massacre. From 6:30 a.m. that morning, she remained in constant phone contact with her mother until 10:15 a.m., when she reported being shot. In a chilling recording, Mirev reassured her daughter: 'Romi, I’m with you, my love. Everything will be okay. We’ll go to the hospital, and you’ll feel better. You’re not alone; you’re with me.' Moments later, Hamas terrorists can be heard shouting in Arabic before the call abruptly disconnects. While in captivity, Romi marked her 24th birthday last August. Her brother, Shahaf, sent her a hopeful message: 'We all believe you’ll return, stronger than ever. We have no doubt.' At the end of Hanukkah that year, her father, Eitan, expressed his frustration, saying: 'Even the festival of miracles is ending today. The one thing that hasn’t changed is that Romi remains in a tunnel. I wish for myself, for us, for the Gonen family, and for all the families that this surreal, nightmarish, unimaginable ordeal comes to an end.' Eitan also expressed optimism that pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump would bring about change, which he credited as a key factor in securing the hostage deal. Earlier this month, Merav penned a column for Ynet, reflecting on the struggle and calling for collective accountability: 'In the past year, we’ve been forced to face reality head-on. We’ve stopped trying to sugarcoat things and accepted the unvarnished truth we cannot escape. Our eyes search for every shred of information, every piece of hope, every ounce of human decency to bring them back—today, yesterday, a year ago.' She continued: 'When we look in the mirror, what do our eyes tell us? Do they show that we’re making the right effort? Do they reveal that we’ve given up? Every morning, I ask all of us to look deeply into our hearts and minds, to tell ourselves that we’re truly present. To affirm that we’re not running from reality, not shirking responsibility—but instead harnessing our core values to ensure we’re doing everything possible to bring them home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1knccqdjg	2025-01-19T06:37:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/rkbsrF9PJg/rkbsrF9PJg_0_111_1067_601_0_small.jpg

Live: First batch of hostages freed under Gaza deal	The highly anticipated exchange is set to begin at 4 p.m., with Israeli captives released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, including convicted murderers; Ynetnews and ILTV will provide live coverage throughout the process With the cease-fire firmly in place, the highly anticipated hostage release and the corresponding release of Palestinian prisoners, including convicted murderers, was set to begin at 4 p.m. Ynetnews and ILTV will provide live coverage of the process. The cease-fire officially went into effect several hours late Sunday at 11:15 a.m., after delays caused by Hamas failing to deliver the list of the first three hostages scheduled for release. Later, the names Romi Gonen, 24, Emily Damari, 28, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31, were confirmed as the first hostages to be freed. These women are among the 33 hostages slated for release during the initial phase of the deal, ending their 471-day captivity by Hamas. Following the release of the three women, facilitated by the Red Cross, Israel will release 90 Palestinian prisoners and transfer them to the West Bank or East Jerusalem. Romi Gonen was on the phone with her mother on the morning of October 7, 2023, until she reported being shot at 10:15 a.m. In a chilling call recording, her mother reassured her: 'Romi, I am with you, my love. Everything will be OK.' The call ended abruptly as terrorists were heard speaking in Arabic. Emily Damari, a British citizen, was abducted from her home in Kfar Aza during the massacre. She and her neighbor Gali Berman, who had hidden in a safe room with others, managed to send a selfie before being taken. > Doron Steinbrecher was also taken from Kfar Aza. She had last spoken with her sister Amit in the early hours of October 7, saying she felt safe after blocking her door with an armchair. By 11 a.m., she sent a final recorded message saying she had been captured. Hamas later released a video showing her after 107 days, offering the first sign she was alive. The IDF has established three reception centers near the Gaza border in Kerem Shalom, Re’im and Zikim to process the returning hostages. Medical personnel and representatives from the Health Ministry, Shin Bet and police are stationed at these sites. The military estimates it will take two hours for initial medical examinations before the hostages are transported to hospitals. As the cease-fire took effect, the IDF repositioned its forces along new defense lines in Gaza’s Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors. Troops remain on high alert, prepared to respond to any cease-fire violations by Hamas. In the West Bank, additional security measures have been implemented ahead of the prisoner release. Although no new public safety instructions have been issued, the IDF has bolstered aerial defenses and remains vigilant for potential rocket fire leading up to or during the cease-fire. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryvco00cvke	2025-01-19T04:50:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/SyD12wqv1l/SyD12wqv1l_157_0_2665_1500_0_small.jpg

IDF readies for release of Palestinian prisoners back to West Ban...	Troops spread across the area ahead of release of 50 expected convicts in attempts to prevent celebration marches; IDF bolsters forces in region The IDF on Sunday made ready for the expected release of about 50 terrorists into the West Bank as part of the hostage deal signed with Hamas. The military's focus is on bolstering forces along roads and in settlements across the area. Efforts will also be made to prevent celebratory marches by the freed terrorists in Palestinian cities and refugee camps. Police and Border Police forces have begun transporting prisoners set to be released into a central collection point within Ofer Prison. According to officials, over 1,500 prison personnel will take part in the operation. The prisoners will be transported in Israeli buses with blacked-out windows from Ofer Prison to the center of Ramallah, a short drive away. From there, each will continue to their respective villages and cities. Some 12 of the 90 prisoners estimated to be set free will be sent to East Jerusalem. Last week it was reported that the IDF's activities in the West Bank are expected to shift in the coming weeks. IDF Central Command plans to increase operational actions and adopt a more aggressive approach, particularly in the northern West Bank. Reinforcements, including from the Egoz Unit, are expected to be deployed from the Gaza Strip and other locations. The northern West Bank will be reorganized between the Ephraim and Menashe Brigades to enhance offensive capabilities and increase the continuity and pace of operations. IDF Central Command chief Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth approved relatively lax operational freedom to brigade commanders in the area. Another region where the IDF has recently operated is an area near the Jordan Valley encompassing the villages of Tammun, Tubas and Tayasir. The IDF conducted airstrikes against terrorist cells in the area, with special forces conducting operations in the region for several days. Security officials claimed these operations have brought some change to the region. Security sources highlighted that the situation in the West Bank is different from that before October 7, 2023. A security official stressed that forces will act firmly against any attempt by freed terrorists to establish terrorist infrastructure in the heart of the West Bank. 'We’ll identify any attempted gatherings and act against any suspected terrorist activity. The gloves are off. We’re operating from the air and the ground. There's a shift in how we think about the area,' the official said. Palestinian security forces recently operating in the Jenin refugee camp are deeply concerned about the prisoners' release and the public's response. The legitimacy of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the northern West Bank has been eroded during the operation, raising fears that Hamas will gain influence in the area, being seen as the one who secured the prisoners' release.

They are to be freed after 471 days in Hamas captivity. Romi's family confirmed the news in social media posts earlier. Romi was on the phone with her mother all morning on October 7m 2023, and at 10:15 a.m. said she had been shot. In a chilling recording of the call her mother said: 'Romi, I am with you my love. Everything will be OK.' But then the terrorists were heard speaking in Arabic and the call ended. Her mother, Meirav Leshem Gonen, who has become one of the symbols of the struggle to release the hostages, did not stop fighting for her daughter and the rest of the hostages, meeting world leaders, government ministers and international organizations pleading for more to be done to bring her Romi home. In June, Leshem Gonen spoke to the UN Human Rights Council's Commission of Inquiry against Israel. 'When women’s bodies are used as political tools, when their dignity is set aside because they are not on the ‘right side,’ it is a badge of shame for us all,' she told the council. Romi turned 24 in captivity. Her brother Shahaf said in a post on Instagram that the family believes she would return home. Later, her father Eitan said he hoped U.S. president-elect Donald Trump will bring change and, in fact, it was the pressure from Trump that led to the deal that was signed last week.

When we get up in the morning and look into the mirror, I ask all of us to look deep into our hearts, into our thoughts, into our souls and tell ourselves daily that we are really where we are.' Emily Damari, a British subject, was taken from her home in Kfar Aza by terrorists during the Oct. 7 massacre. She and Gali Berman, who was abducted with his twin brother Ziv and another neighbor, had hidden in a safe room and even sent a selfie of themselves that was received only after their capture. The terrorists killed Damari's dog in the attack. Her mother, Mandy, who was also hiding as the terrorists tried to enter her home, survived after a bullet hit the door of the room she was in, and jammed it. Mandy said she had appealed to the British government to imagine her daughter starved, dehydrated and manhandled by men who want to murder or rape her.

Far-right national security minister tells Netanyahu in letter that he repeatedly warned against policies of appeasement of Hamas before Oct. 7, claims cease-fire and hostage release deal is a capitulation to terror; Coalition has 63 out of 120 seat majority National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir handed in his resignation from the government on Sunday along with the other ministers of his Otzma Yehudit Party. The far-right politician said last week that he would resign if the cease-fire and hostage release deal would be implemented but said he would return to the post if the IDF resumes 'fierce fighting' in Gaza after the completion of the first phase of the deal. The coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now has a 63-seat majority in the 120 seat Knesset. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich did not join Ben-Gvir in resigning, claiming he would remain in the government to ensure that fighting is resumed until 'all of the objectives of the war are achieved.' In a statement Ben-Gvir said the deal signed was reckless and lamented 'the release of hundreds of murderers who have the blood of men, women and children on their hands who are released to Jerusalem and the West Bank while abandoning the achievements of the IDF in the war, withdrawing troops from parts of Gaza and suspending the fighting in what is a capitulation to Hamas.'

Trump envoy plans to visit Gaza, mulls relocation for Gazans to h...	Steve Witkoff considers visiting Gaza regularly to resolve issues during the implementation of the deal, NBC reports; Will Gazans live in Indonesia until Gaza is rebuilt? Steve Witkoff, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, is considering visiting the Gaza Strip as part of his efforts to preserve the cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, that went into effect at 11;15 a.m., American news network NBC reported. To emphasize how fragile the president-elect's team believes the deal is, Witkoff also plans to serve as a 'near-constant' presence in the Middle East in the coming months. This, according to the source, is to resolve problems on the ground that he believes could derail the agreement and stop the release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 'You have to be right on top of it, ready to snuff out a problem if it happens,' an official said. At the same time, Trump's envoy is working to achieve long-term stability for Israelis and the roughly two million displaced Palestinians, through the three-phase agreement reached last week. For now, Witkoff’s main concern is an unforeseen incident that would arise from the daily interaction between Israelis and Palestinians in and around the Gaza Strip, despite the cease-fire. 'Remember, there’s a lot of people, radicals, fanatics, not just from the Hamas side, from the right wing of the Israeli side, who are absolutely incentivized to blow this whole deal up,' the transition official said. A source said that Witkoff visiting Gaza will allow him to see the dynamics there for himself, rather than relying on the word of Israel or the Palestinians on the matter. 'You got to see it, you got to feel it,' he said. While Trump and his team are working on the first phase of the deal and helping negotiate the second phase, they are also working on long-term solutions. 'If we don’t help the Gazans, if we don’t make their lives better, if we don’t give them a sense of hope, there's going to be a rebellion,' the official said. The question of how to rebuild Gaza remains, as does where to relocate some two million Palestinians at the same time. According to the source, Indonesia is a possible host country being discussed where some of the Palestinians could be sent. The question of whether the Gazans would be willing to relocate for a while also arose. The idea of relocation is controversial among Palestinians and their Arab counterparts. Many believe that relocation would be the first step in Israel forcing them to leave their land. However, at this stage, the issue of bringing humanitarian aid into the Strip, as agreed in the first phase of the deal, remains a challenge. Israel still worries that Hamas will steal any aid that is brought into Gaza, while the humanitarian crisis there worsens. Despite the entry of aid to Gaza, hunger and disease are still prevalent in the Gaza Strip. Witkoff, a real estate developer who has known Trump for decades, entered the negotiations alongside Joe Biden’s team, which has been working for a deal for more than a year. Trump's one directive in these negotiations was bring the hostages home, and if not, come back and explain why you couldn’t, the source explained. The president-elect’s envoy used Trump’s history with Israel and his dynamic with Netanyahu pressure the Israelis. For example, he went to meet the prime minister on Saturday to have a harsh exchange. Witkoff told people privately that his words to Netanyahu that Saturday, January 11, were not a threat, and that he had been invited to his residence by one of his close aides, Minister Ron Dermer. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the source, Witkoff gave Netanyahu a reality check about his intentions with the deal, telling him what was needed to reach an agreement, including Israel sending a senior representative to negotiate in Doha who could make decisions in real time. In talks with Israeli officials, Witkoff didn’t hesitate to point out everything Trump has done for Israel. During his first term as president, he moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognized the Golan Heights as Israeli territory, and cut humanitarian aid to the Palestinians. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjm2amqpkg	2025-01-19T01:00:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/11/HymmoJgw1g/HymmoJgw1g_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Names of first 3 hostages set to be released received in Israel, ...	After Hamas provides list of hostages, 3 women, set to be released later in the day, cease-fire looks to be on track; Names will not be released until families informed The names of the first three female hostages set to be released were transferred to Israel more than half a day after they were expected, according to the prime minster's office. They are expected to be released no earlier than 4 p.m. on Sunday. The IDF completed the construction of three compounds to receive hostages near the border, at Kerem Shalom, Re'im and Zikim. The IDF believes that it would be about two hours between the arrival of hostages into IDF hands, an initial medical examination and until they arrive at hospitals. Representatives of the Ministry of Health, the Shin Bet, Israel Police and the IDF are already positioned at those locations. Immediately after the kidnapped women are released and handed over to Israel, through the mediation of the Red Cross, the first 90 terrorists will be released from prisons in Israel and transferred to Palestinian territories in the West Bank or East Jerusalem. As of the cease-fire coming into effect the deployment of IDF divisions will be along new lines of defense in the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors. The IDF said it was on high alert and prepared to respond to any violations of the agreement by Hamas. The IDF is also on high alert in the West Bank to prepare for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Although there are no new instructions issued to the public from the Homefront command, the military said it was prepared for Hamas to launch rocket fire at Israeli communities during the hours leading up to the cease-fire, and aerial defenses have been deployed to respond. The IDF carried out strikes against Hamas targets in Gaza as overnight and in the early hours of Sunday. The military also published maps showing civilians in Gaza where troops would be deployed in the coming weeks, to ensure their safety. In the post the Arabic Language spokesperson warned Gazans not to attempt to return to areas in the northern parts of the Strip. Up until the cease-fire was set to go into effect on Sunday morning, the Israeli Air Force, under the direction of the IDF and the Shin Bet, continued carrying out airstrikes.

Sergeant Oron Shaul fell in battle in Shejaiyah during Operation Protective Edge in July 2014; In a joint operation by the Shin Bet and the IDF, in which special units participated, his body was recovered from the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours The IDF and Shin Bet, in a special and secret operation, rescued the body of the kidnapped soldier, Sergeant Oron Shaul , who fell in the battle of Shejaiya on July 20, 2014, during Operation Protective Edge.

The IDF determined that he was no longer alive and a few days later declared him a martyr whose burial place was unknown, and his family even held a vigil for him. 'Efforts to recover him, including the collection of information and intelligence by the Prisoners of War and Missing Persons Command and the Special Operations Division in the Intelligence Branch, have continued throughout the past decade and even more intensely during the war,' the IDF said. Several special units in the IDF and Shin Bet took part in the operation, including the 13th Battalion, forces from the 162nd Division, and units of the Intelligence Directorate, as well as Golani fighters. The IDF does not address questions about when and how this happened, but the body was recovered in the past 24 hours. There were no casualties among IDF forces in the operation. Shaul was identified at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Israel, after which IDF representatives informed his family. The family of the kidnapped soldier Hadar Goldin was also informed, although his body was not recovered from the Strip. Some 97 hostages are currently being held in the Gaza Strip, including Hadar Goldin, who also fell in Operation Protective Edge. In addition to him, hostages Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed have also been held in the Strip since 2014, and are scheduled to be released during the first phase of the hostage deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that 'in a special operation by the Shin Bet and the IDF, before the cease-fire came into effect, we returned to Israel the body of the late Golan fighter Oron Shaul. I hug the Shaul family, my dears, and congratulate the Shin Bet and IDF forces for their resourcefulness and courage.' 'The picture of Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, of blessed memory, who fell in Operation Protective Edge in 2014, has been in front of my eyes in my office for many years as daily testimony to my commitment to bringing them home. Tonight we completed the mission to return Oron, and we will not be silent or rest until we also complete the mission to return Hadar Goldin.

Hamas expected to submit hostage list in coming hours	Despite prior commitments, terror group misses 4:30 p.m. deadline but reportedly assures mediators it would submit list soon after transferring hostages to secure location; Israeli officials remain confident plan will proceed as scheduled Hamas is expected to provide the list of hostages slated for release on Sunday within hours, the Saudi television channel Al Hadath reported on Saturday. Despite prior commitments, Hamas missed the 4:30 p.m. deadline but reportedly assured mediators it would submit the list soon after transferring them to a secure location, according to Saudi network Al Arabiya. Israeli officials remain confident that the plan will proceed as scheduled. The government approved the cease-fire agreement with Hamas early Saturday, set to take effect Sunday at 8:30 a.m., 415 days after the first truce following the December 2023 hostage deal and 471 days since the October 7 massacre that sparked the war. Under the deal’s initial phase, 33 hostages will be released over 42 days, starting with three hostages scheduled for release Sunday evening in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners. The truce requires the IDF to begin a gradual withdrawal from populated areas in Gaza. The release of the first three hostages is expected to start no earlier than 4 p.m. Sunday. Israeli officials have expressed readiness for delays and violations, with one senior source warning of Hamas’ likely use of psychological warfare and propaganda throughout the deal. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The agreement’s first violation has already occurred, with Hamas missing the deadline to deliver the names of the first hostages. 'There is a high probability of delays and manipulations by Hamas, starting on day one,' an Israeli official said. 'As a terrorist organization, they will subject Israeli families to psychological warfare.' Once the hostages are handed over to Israel under Red Cross mediation, 90 Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli prisons and transferred to the West Bank or East Jerusalem. The deal’s future remains uncertain, as the agreement’s second phase, involving the release of additional hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full withdrawal from Gaza, has not been finalized. As part of the first phase of the deal approved by the government, hostages described as belonging to 'humanitarian categories' will be released, including women, children (Kfir and Ariel Bibas), IDF observer soldiers abducted from the Nahal Oz outpost, elderly men over 50 and civilians with medical needs. Long-term captives Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, held in Gaza for over a decade, are also included. The first hostages to be released are women, beginning with those abducted from kibbutzim and the Nova music festival, followed by five female observers. The full list of living hostages is expected on the seventh day of the agreement, but all living hostages are set to be released before the remains of the deceased are returned. Israeli officials estimate that out of the 33 hostages to be returned in the first phase, at least 25 are alive. The second phase of the agreement is set to begin on the seventh day, though it is unclear whether it will fall on the following Saturday or Sunday. In this phase, four additional women will be released. Starting on the 14th day of the deal, three hostages will be released every seven days until the end of the fifth week. During the sixth and final week, the remaining 13 hostages, including al-Sayed and Mengistu, will be released. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj542ffdkl	2025-01-18T11:34:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/25/rJ11vciyxBa/rJ11vciyxBa_0_64_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

At noon (7 p.m. Israel time), Trump will take the oath of office at the Capitol, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. He will swear on the Lincoln Bible, used by the 16th president during his 1861 inauguration. Trump also used the same Bible in his 2017 inauguration, as did former President Barack Obama in both of his inaugurations. After the swearing-in ceremony, Trump, officially recognized as president, will deliver his inaugural address. He has pledged to 'unite and uplift' the American people, a stark contrast to the speech he gave eight years ago, in which he described the U.S. as a 'dystopian nation in deep crisis.' Every president since George Washington has delivered an inaugural address. Washington’s speech remains the shortest at just 135 words. In contrast, William Henry Harrison holds the record for the longest inaugural address, delivering 8,445 words. Sadly, Harrison died a month later, likely from pneumonia contracted after prolonged exposure to harsh weather during his inauguration. Who was invited, and who will attend the ceremony? Outgoing President Joe Biden has confirmed his attendance at the inauguration, signaling a peaceful transfer of power—a gesture Trump did not extend to Biden four years ago. All living former U.S. presidents—Biden, Obama, Bush and Clinton—are expected to attend. The ceremony stage will also feature tech moguls Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos. Other notable tech figures, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, are also on the guest list. In an unprecedented move, Trump has invited foreign leaders to the event, breaking with past norms that sought to avoid diplomatic politicization during inaugurations. Argentine President Javier Milei, a staunch supporter of Trump, has already confirmed his attendance. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni are reportedly considering joining. Additionally, Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to send a representative. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not receive an invitation, rumors suggest his wife, Sara Netanyahu, currently in Miami with their son Yair, was invited and might attend. Members of the Yesha Council, representing Israeli settlements, were also invited and are expected to attend. Families of American hostages and victims from the October 7 Hamas attacks will also be present, including the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was killed in captivity; the parents of abducted IDF soldier Edan Alexander; and relatives of fallen hostages Omer Neutra and Itay Chen. Other invitees include the father of hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, the daughter of slain and abducted couple Gadi Haggai and Judy Weinstein, and Aviva Siegel, a hostage released in November 2023 as part of the first hostage deal.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, another frequent target of Trump’s rhetoric, has also announced she will not attend. Where will the ceremony take place? Despite freezing temperatures expected to range between -5°C and -12°C (23°F to 10°F), over 220,000 tickets have been distributed for Monday’s inauguration at the U.S. Capitol. However, Trump announced that due to the severe cold, the ceremony will be moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda, which can accommodate no more than 700 people. 'I don’t want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way. It is [sic] dangerous conditions,' Trump posted on Truth Social. Attendees unable to secure one of the 700 coveted spots will be directed to watch the proceedings on jumbo screens at the Capital One Arena, where a mass viewing party will be held. Trump promised to visit the arena after the ceremony to greet attendees. Meanwhile, the National Park Service has authorized a gathering of up to 250,000 people at the National Mall, the city’s central promenade connecting its major monuments. The pastor, the rabbi and the anti-Israel imam As is customary, the inauguration will feature blessings from religious leaders, and for the first time, an imam will join a pastor and a rabbi in addressing the audience. Trump chose Imam Husham Al-Husainy of Dearborn, Michigan, a spokesperson for the Iraqi-American community, whose record includes controversial anti-Israel statements. In a primetime interview, he claimed Hezbollah is not a terrorist organization and, during a televised debate, predicted 'good news' from the Quran, foreseeing an attack on Israel and Muslims 'enter Jerusalem and kick the Jews.' In addition to the imam, Rabbi Ari Berman, president of Yeshiva University in New York, will deliver a prayer. Berman, the first American Israeli to speak at a U.S. presidential inauguration, said that he will pray for 'the safety and swift return of the remaining hostages in Gaza.' $1 million per ticket: The inauguration events and celebrations Guests at the swearing-in ceremony will enjoy performances by country music star and American Idol winner Carrie Underwood, longtime Trump friend and country singer Lee Greenwood and opera vocalist Christopher Macchio. The celebrations, which begin on Saturday, will conclude Tuesday morning. In Washington, D.C., hotels hosting approximately half a million attendees have capitalized on the occasion, increasing rates by 300%. Many are requiring a minimum three-night stay with no refunds. This year’s inauguration events are considered relatively modest compared to those of Obama and Clinton. Some have even dubbed the 'MAGA celebrations' as 'not so mega.' During Trump’s first inauguration, an estimated 300,000 to 600,000 attended, far fewer than the million permitted. The festivities kick off with a reception and fireworks display at Trump’s golf club in Virginia, followed by a private dinner hosted by Vice President JD Vance. Tickets for the exclusive event are priced at $1 million for two seats—double the cost of a similar dinner during Trump’s previous inauguration, which was hosted by then-vice president and current rival Mike Pence. Sunday morning, a traditional wreath-laying ceremony will take place at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Trump will then deliver remarks at the MAGA Victory Rally at Capitol One Arena, accompanied by a performance from disco legends The Village People, whose hits Trump frequently played during his campaign rallies. Their participation has sparked anger among fans, given the group’s prior endorsement of Trump’s rival, Kamala Harris. Following the rally, Trump and his wife Melania will host a candlelit dinner priced at $1 million for six guests—offering a relative 'bargain' compared to the dinner with Vance. Proceeds from the events, nearly $200 million in total, will go to the inauguration committee led by Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. The committee covers all festivities except the taxpayer-funded official swearing-in ceremony. Following the swearing-in ceremony, a farewell event will honor outgoing President and Vice President Harris. Trump will then hold a signing ceremony at the President’s Room in the U.S. Capitol. Afterward, he will join members of Congress for a luncheon, concluding with a motorcade procession to the White House via Pennsylvania Avenue, accompanied by a military parade and civic organizations. However, due to the expected freezing temperatures, the parade may be combined with the viewing party at Capitol One Arena immediately following the inauguration ceremony. Once in the Oval Office, Trump is expected to sign a series of executive orders marking the start of his second term. These include expanding immigration enforcement powers, deploying additional troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, resuming construction of the border wall and promoting oil and gas drilling. In the evening, festivities will continue with three official inauguration balls and nearly 15 informal celebrations throughout Washington, D.C. Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks at each official event. The next day, he will participate in the longstanding tradition of the National Prayer Service at the Washington National Cathedral. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry1wpvtvye	2025-01-18T10:20:27-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/04/BJ00tK98Wye/BJ00tK98Wye_0_107_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel Prepares for Cease-Fire Implementation Amid Heightened Sec...	Military readies for Hamas cease-fire with repositioning in Gaza, bolstering forces in West Bank and protocols for safe return of hostages; officials warn of potential cease-fire violations and psychological warfare campaigns The IDF announced on Saturday that preparations are underway for the implementation of the cease-fire agreement with Hamas, which is set to take effect Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m. The military emphasized its readiness to execute the operational framework agreed upon in the deal while ensuring the safe return of hostages from Gaza. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi conducted a situational assessment, focusing on the readiness of Southern and Central Commands for the agreement's execution. The IDF has established three reception centers near the Gaza border to process the released hostages, who will undergo medical and psychological evaluations before being transferred to hospitals. Heavy security measures will accompany the transfer of Palestinian prisoners to designated facilities for their release. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As part of the agreement, the IDF will reposition along newly defined defensive lines in Gaza. The Gaza Division will secure the southern Philadelphi Corridor near the Egyptian border, while the 162nd Division will oversee northern Gaza and the 99th Division will maintain internal positions near the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza. The military has bolstered its air defenses in the south and remains on high alert for potential violations of the cease-fire, including rocket fire from Hamas. Officials also warned of likely psychological warfare and disinformation campaigns from Hamas aimed at the Israeli public during the cease-fire. To prevent celebrations following the release of Palestinian prisoners, the IDF has reinforced the West Bank with additional forces, including a full brigade-size force from the Kfir and Commando Brigades. Security measures in border towns and along major routes have been heightened, and offensive counter-terrorism operations will continue. The deal stipulates the release of three hostages on Sunday in exchange for 95 Palestinian prisoners. Subsequent releases will see hostages and prisoners exchanged over a period of weeks. Hamas will provide lists of hostages 24 hours before each phase, which will be vetted by Israel’s intelligence agencies and approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The agreement also includes operational oversight at the Rafah border crossing, where non-Hamas-affiliated personnel approved by the Shin Bet security service will manage the passage of patients and wounded individuals under international supervision. Hamas announced plans to deploy its security personnel across Gaza once the cease-fire begins. The EU is expected to provide technical oversight at the Rafah crossing. An American private security company will conduct inspections in Netzarim to prevent the reintroduction of arms and terrorists into northern Gaza. In an overnight Cabinet meeting, ministers were briefed on the agreement's conditions, including logistical and security arrangements. Netanyahu said that the release of hostages is a central objective of the war, affirming that the IDF is prepared to respond to any cease-fire violations and resume hostilities if necessary. As the agreement takes effect, Israeli officials urged the public to remain patient and resilient amid the complexities of implementing such a sensitive arrangement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ek00pkd1g	2025-01-18T08:59:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/18/H170sUFvyg/H170sUFvyg_0_164_1600_901_0_small.jpg

The cease-fire is scheduled to take effect at 8:30 a.m. Sunday, with the release of hostages expected to begin around 4 p.m. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: 'We will not proceed with the agreement unless we receive the list of hostages to be released, as stipulated.

Israeli officials urge patience as cease-fire begins at 8:30 a.m. Sunday; 3 hostages set for release by 4 p.m., while Palestinian prisoners will be moved under heavy guard to facilities ahead of their handover Israeli officials reported Saturday evening that Hamas has yet to provide the list of three hostages set to be released on Sunday as part of the first phase of a cease-fire and hostage-prisoner exchange deal. Once the list is received, preparations will begin to transport Palestinian prisoners to facilities where they will be released under heavy security.

Israel will not tolerate breaches of the agreement. Hamas bears full responsibility.' Netanyahu is set to deliver a statement later Saturday. Despite prior commitments, Hamas has not yet provided the list, which Qatar’s prime minister was supposed to relay to Mossad Director David Barnea. Israeli officials are urging Qatar and other mediators to pressure Hamas to comply with the terms. Israeli officials cautioned against weeks of potential psychological warfare and disinformation campaigns by Hamas targeting the Israeli public. 'This will be a nightmare. We must prepare for a very difficult period,' one official said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari told Qatari channel Al Arabi that there have been no violations of the agreement so far. He acknowledged the complexity of implementing prisoner exchanges and emphasized that a joint operations room in Cairo would oversee the delivery of aid to Gaza and monitor the swap process. Under the agreement, Hamas is required to submit a list of hostages 24 hours before each phase of releases. The list is reviewed by Israel's negotiation team and approved by Netanyahu before families are notified. The IDF and Shin Bet are preparing to receive the hostages as each phase progresses. In the first phase, Israel is set to release 95 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for three female hostages. Among those to be released are prominent figures such as Nahil Masalmeh, the wife of senior Hamas operative Aeid Dodin; Abla Saadat, wife of Ahmed Saadat, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) leader behind the 2001 assassination of Israeli minister Rehavam Ze’evi; and Khalida Jarrar, a PFLP leader linked to the 2019 murder of Rina Shnerb in the West Bank. The agreement specifies the release of 33 hostages in total during the first phase, including women, children (Kfir and Ariel Bibas), elderly men over 50 and civilians with medical needs. Long-term captives Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, held in Gaza for over a decade, are also included. Subsequent phases will see four women released on the seventh day of the agreement, with three hostages released weekly thereafter. The deal concludes in the sixth week with the release of all remaining hostages. Israeli officials urged the public to remain patient, warning that delays and manipulations by Hamas are likely. 'There is a high likelihood of violations from the first day,' officials said, adding that the timing of lists and hostage arrivals is subject to change due to potential disruptions. Israeli officials reported Saturday evening that Hama*s has yet to provide the list of three hostages set to be released on Sunday as part of the first phase of a cease-fire and hostage-prisoner exchange deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b14h4wkvkl	2025-01-18T08:40:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/17/BkqZohDDke/BkqZohDDke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Likud MK says hostage deal ensures countless kidnappings	MK Amit Halevi: Deal is victory for America’s enemy; IDF fighting for Washington, London and Mecca The result of the hostage-for-ceasefire deal will be 'hell unleashed on Israeli civilians,' according to Knesset member Amit Halevi of the Likud Party. As the deal was finalized, Halevi told the ILTV News Podcast that Israel’s agreement to the current terms would lead to a future of terror for the country and the world. 'We didn’t compromise with the Nazi ideology [in 1945], and we should not have any compromise with the Nazi regime today,' Halevi said, comparing the Hamas terror organization to the Nazis. Britain’s Winston Churchill once considered making a deal with Nazi Germany to end World War II. However, he ultimately declared that Britain would fight to the end: 'We are fighting to save the whole world from the pestilence of Nazi tyranny and in defense of all that is most sacred to man.' 'Hamas has a racist vision,' Halevi said. 'It has totalitarian aspirations, and Israel is only the first course… There should not be any compromise with this regime.' Watch these previous podcasts: This country is the world's least antisemitic – can you guess where? Can Israel Block a Palestinian State Forever? The Secret Weapon for Israel's Future: Faith-Based Diplomacy While Halevi emphasized his desire to bring all the hostages home, he argued that the IDF could have achieved this by force earlier in the now 15-month war. He criticized the agreement, which secures the release of only some hostages in exchange for dangerous prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops, as a betrayal of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives, limbs, and futures in Gaza. 'It is not acceptable,' Halevi stressed. 'It’s horrible.' He argued that the deal is also detrimental to the hostages themselves. While phase I is likely to result in the release of 33 hostages—mostly women, children, and the elderly—in exchange for hundreds of prisoners, there is no guarantee regarding subsequent phases. This means two-thirds of the 98 hostages still in Gaza may never be freed. Instead, they could face the same fate as Gilad Shalit, who was held for around five years before his release in 2011. Others, he said, may never get out. Halevi stated that the current deal effectively restores Hamas to power. The military had reported dismantling 80% of Hamas’s military infrastructure. However, recent U.S. State Department reports indicate that Hamas has managed to recruit as many terrorists as Israel has killed over the past year. In addition, Hamas continues to rule the majority of the Gaza Strip, controlling the distribution of international humanitarian aid and diverting much of it for its own purposes. In the past, such aid has been used to sustain Hamas and build the underground tunnel network that facilitated the October 7 massacre. Moreover, the long-term implications of the deal include removing Israeli soldiers from the Rafah crossing into Egypt—a known entry point for weapons, ammunition, and other supplies used to support terror activities in Gaza. Halevi said that Israel should have declared total war and finished Hamas while it did not bring the hostages home. He criticized top commanders in Tel Aviv for their handling of the war, asserting that Israel should have taken control of the Strip rather than running a series of operations. For example, Israel has been in and out of Jabalia more than a handful of times. He added that providing humanitarian corridors for Gaza’s civilians was essential, but Israel should have relocated civilians and cut off electricity, water, and other necessities from those areas to force Hamas out of its tunnels. 'It will take a week or two, and they will get out of the tunnels, exhausted, hungry, and surrounded,' Halevi said. 'This is the only way that Hamas understands. This is the only way to prevent future kidnappings.' He warned that the hostage deal guarantees repeated kidnappings of Israelis and Jews. 'Let’s say now we get 20 hostages back,' Halevi said. 'All of their kids, all of their grandchildren—they will be kidnapped again.' He concluded: 'This deal will be a victory for America’s enemy. Our soldiers are not fighting for Gaza or for Jerusalem. They are fighting for Washington, for London, and for Mecca.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rji5fa00vye	2025-01-18T07:13:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/17/S14O9owvJl/S14O9owvJl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir tells state television that the two judges had long been involved in 'national security cases, including espionage and terrorism'. Two senior Iranian Supreme Court judges involved in handling espionage and terrorism cases were shot dead in the capital Tehran on Saturday, Iran's judiciary said. It said the attacker killed himself after opening fire at the judges inside the Supreme Court, and that a bodyguard of one of the judges was wounded. The judiciary identified the judges who were killed as mid-ranking Shi'ite Muslim clerics Mohammad Moghiseh and Ali Razini. While the motive for the assassination was still unclear, judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir told state television that the two judges had long been involved in 'national security cases, including espionage and terrorism'. 'In the past year, the judiciary has undertaken extensive efforts to identify spies and terrorist groups, a move that has sparked anger and resentment among the enemies,' he said. State TV said these cases were related to individuals linked to Israel and the Iranian opposition supported by the United States. It did not elaborate. Opposition websites have in the past said Moghiseh was involved in trials of people they described as political prisoners. Razini was a target of an assassination attempt in 1998.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjpapwkdjx	2025-01-18T01:57:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/18/B1UDNbYv1g/B1UDNbYv1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Trump envoy tells PM its time to make a deal, or we pack up and l...	Witkoff delivers 'stark message from Trump to Netanyahu, promptingthe prime minister to instruct the Israeli negotiating team to head to Qatar and reach an agreement; Envoy says Trump was a great friend to Israel and now Israel must resiprocate Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump instructed his envoy Steve Witkoff to relay a 'stark message' to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, 'make the deal.' According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Witkoff who arrived in Israel from Qatar last Saturday to meet with the prime minister, told him 'the president has been a great friend of Israel and now it’s time to be a friend back.' 'I would say that the president is exasperated,' Witkoff told reporters last week. Trump warned there would be 'ALL HELL TO PAY' if a deal was not agreed. The journal quoted a source familiar with the conversation that Witkoff told Netanyahu that choices had to be made and Israel’s negotiators needed the authority to make decisions adding ' If Netanyahu didn’t want to work that way, everyone should just pack their bags and go home.' According to the report, Netanyahu immediately instructed the negotiating team made up of heads of Mossad and Shin Bet and a representative of the IDF, along with a political advisor to the prime minister, to head to Qatar for intensive negotiations to finalize the deal. The same message was delivered to the Qatari and Egyptian negotiators by Witkoff when he met with them a day earlier. He said the diplomatic back and forth must end. The deal that was agreed in Doha on Wednesday and finally approved by the Government late on Friday, was similar to the one proposed in May, the WSJ said. but since Netanyahu depended on his far-right coalition partners to maintain his government, he told the families of hostages in July that he was not ready to end the war. 'If we give up on victory over Hamas, we are all in danger from every front,' he said pounding on the table, in a recording heard by the paper. After Witkoff's meeting with Netanyahu, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform statements quoted from Arab officials who said Trump had more influence on Netanyahu in one meeting than Biden was able to have in a year. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli and American officials told the WSJ that the deal was still fragile. A key issue that Witkoff helped overcome in recent days was Hamas's concern that the IDF would resume fighting after the most vulnerable hostages were freed in the first phase. 'Witkoff said if everyone abides by the agreement, then Trump would encourage meaningful negotiations in Phase 2,' the source told the paper. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjk8nbfdke	2025-01-18T01:45:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/11/HJFl3klwyg/HJFl3klwyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The government approved the release of 737 Palestinian prisoners; NSC says security services, Strategic Affairs and Foreign ministries say approval of the deal to serve Israel's wider interests and its national security Isareli officials believe 25 of the 33 hostages to be released from Hamas captivity in the first phase of the deal approved by the govenernment, are alive. Israel will release 737 Palestinian prisoners in the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage exchange deal approved by the government on Friday. Their names were made public soon by the Justice Ministry after the government adjured. In addition, Israel will free 1,167 residents of the Gaza Strip that were detained but had not participated in the Oct. 7 massacre, bringing the total number of Palestinians to be exchanged for the hostages, to 1,904. Some of the ministers who opposed the deal said in the meeting that there was significant danger in freeing such a large number of terrorists and that they were shocked to discover the identity of some of them who were responsible for hundreds of terror attacks and said that in order to free the captive IDF soldiers held by Hamas, Israel would be compelled to release all of the convicted terrorists who were sentenced to life in prison for their actions. The National Security Council attached an opinion to the government's approval of the deal. 'In its confidential agreement, the NSC presented the considerations, opportunities and security and political risks,' including negative security implications in the West Bank. 'According to the view of security agencies there is an urgent and vital need to accept the current outline and they along with the Strategic Affairs Ministry and the Foreign Ministry believe that the deal would serve Israel's wider interests and its national security,' the NSC opinion said. The deal includes some political achievements including a letter from U.S. President Joe Biden attached to the agreement, that specifies Israel's right to resume the fighting in Gaza if the next phase of the deal is not put into effect. Another achievement is the agreement that the IDF would maintain control of a mile-wide perimeter along the border for up to 50 days.

Critically injured soldier: A mother’s struggle for support and r...	For over a year, Inbal Nechmad has fought for her son Ido, a soldier critically injured by a sniper in Gaza; As he lies unconscious, family dedicates their lives to his recovery, advocating for support and singling out one member of Knesset for praise For over a year, Inbal Nechmad’s life has revolved around the bedside of her son, Ido, a soldier who was critically injured by a sniper on January 3 of last year in northern Gaza. Since that fateful day, Ido has been hospitalized in a state of unconsciousness. Inbal recently made waves with a heartfelt letter in which she expressed her pain over how severely injured soldiers, who gave everything for their country, seem to be forgotten by the nation over time. Ido, a 21-year-old Nahal Brigade soldier from the town of Mevaseret Zion, has been unconscious since his injury. 'He was always someone who volunteered and supported the weakest members of society,' his mother shared. 'Even in the Scouts, he guided children on the autism spectrum, and during his service year with the Ayalim Association before enlisting, he worked with children with special needs and cared for society’s most vulnerable. Now, when he is the weak link, it’s time for society to stand up and fight for him—whether it’s the state, the authorities, Defense Ministry, IDF, or the healthcare system. They all need to give back to him what he deserves, not as charity, but as a right.' Before Ido’s injury, the family lived a relatively normal life. Inbal was the principal of a school, her husband worked in retail, their eldest daughter Zohar, 24, is studying through the army, and their youngest son, Yahli, 18, is currently in a service year with the same Ayalim Association that Ido was part of before his enlistment. Since Ido’s injury, their lives have been turned upside down. 'Everything changed. Nothing will ever be the same as it was before,' Inbal explained. 'Our entire family’s path has shifted. We are now fully devoted to the mission of trying to bring Ido back to us. He has been fighting for his life for over a year and five days. Every day, we fight for every vital system in his body and for the chance to give him a real opportunity for rehabilitation.' Ido has been transferred between eight different hospitals since his injury and is currently hospitalized at Sheba Medical Center. Each day, Inbal hopes for a change, for Ido to wake up. 'We hold on to every little thing. If, for one day, his basic vital signs are stable, that is a good day for us. But there are also very hard days when we see him suffering, and we’ve learned to sense how he feels. According to the doctors, we have to wait—wait for something to happen, for Ido to regain consciousness and respond. In the meantime, as long as he fights, we fight with all our strength. We will fight alongside him and anyone we need to, to ensure he gets the best chance for recovery with the most advanced technologies, the best experts in the world, and the latest research. Whatever is needed, we will bring it to help Ido recover. And he fights—he fights like a lion, just as he fought to defend our country, he is now fighting for his life, and we are fighting alongside him.' A community of support Inbal praised Member of Knesset Hili Tropper (from the National Unity party) for his efforts to assist the family. 'Visiting rehabilitation departments isn’t something most people can stomach. It’s not pleasant, to say the least, but that’s exactly what Hili does. He comes, sits with us, looks us in the eye, listens to us, and does everything he can so humbly and quietly. He genuinely cares and checks in on us constantly. People need to know that there are politicians like him—public servants and humans who are willing to help.' > Inbal added, 'Throughout this journey, we’ve met incredible people. The Israeli public is truly wonderful, full of good people who try to help in every way possible. But Hili Tropper is unique because he’s a public servant, an elected official. I was connected to his teachings and philosophy long before I met him in person. Before Ido’s injury, I ran a school for a population similar to the one Hili works with, and I always drew strength and inspiration from him.' She continued, 'My daughter reached out to him about six months ago during one of Ido’s many surgeries. He came to visit us then, and since that moment, he’s been working tirelessly to make sure people see us, see Ido—not through words, pictures, or stories, but by bringing everyone he can to Ido’s bedside to witness what it means for someone to lie in a bed, unconscious, for over a year.' The broader picture Since the Gaza war began, 5,606 soldiers have been wounded, 825 with life threatening wounds. According to data from the Defense Ministry’s Rehabilitation Department, which includes injuries from other security forces and emergency response units, the total number of injured is nearly double this figure. To this must be added hundreds of civilians who have also been hurt. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hyhtz88wkx	2025-01-17T21:00:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/SkOm8RiL1g/SkOm8RiL1g_0_103_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Ex-CIA analyst pleads guilty to leaking Pentagon documents on Isr...	Asif Rahman, who leaked classified documents exposing Israel’s plans for retaliatory strike on Iran, delaying operation, pleads guilty; arrested in November, Rahman faces up to 6.5 years in prison under plea deal Asif Rahman, a former CIA analyst, pleaded guilty on Friday to leaking classified Pentagon documents that revealed Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran. The leak delayed Israel’s planned operation, according to security officials in both the U.S. and Israel. Rahman, 34, was arrested after an FBI investigation linked the leaked documents to his workstation at the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The highly classified documents detailed aerial drills, weapons movements at an Israeli air base and preparations for a possible strike on Iran. These included a 'large-scale deployment drill,' aerial refueling drills and handling of advanced air-launched ballistic missiles (ALBM), including at least 16 'Golden Horizon' missiles and 40 'Rocks' or ISO2 missiles. The documents were leaked on October 17 via a Telegram channel called Middle East Spectator, shortly after Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel in response to assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. At the time, the Biden administration was urging Israel to refrain from attacking Iranian nuclear or energy facilities. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Rahman, a Yale University graduate, faces up to 20 years in prison under the Espionage Act. However, a plea deal under negotiation could limit his sentence to six and a half years. Federal prosecutors reportedly agreed to the reduced penalty after Rahman took responsibility for his actions and expressed a desire to resolve the case. Rahman’s sentencing is scheduled for May 15. Prosecutors indicated they might recommend further leniency if Rahman continues cooperating with authorities. During Friday’s court session, it was revealed that Rahman had printed additional classified documents while working in Virginia in spring 2024. He took the documents home, copied them and shared them with unauthorized individuals. He also deleted over 1.5 gigabytes of sensitive data, including Middle East reports, in an effort to cover his tracks after the leak. Prosecutors said Rahman acted on ideological motives and remains a risk for further disclosures. Rahman was arrested in November while planning to travel to Thailand and later return to his family near Washington, D.C. At his hearing, he shook hands with prosecutors and waved to his wife and family before being escorted into custody. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1d7pvodkg	2025-01-17T14:39:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/19/ryDaczZlyx/ryDaczZlyx_0_0_854_479_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu: Trump to reinstate military supplies if fighting in Ga...	In 7-hour Cabinet meeting on deal to release 33 hostages, PM says Hamas agreed due to its isolation; security chiefs warn of rising West Bank terror, with IDF prepared to resume fighting and Mossad noting Israel still has leverage over Hamas Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that former U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to restore military supplies halted under the Biden administration if the cease-fore with Hamas collapses and Israel resumes combat operations in the Gaza Strip. 'This is significant because if we don't reach the next stage of the deal, we will have the tools to return to fighting,' Netanyahu told ministers during a government meeting to approve a proposed hostage deal with the Palestinian terrorist group. 'Trump is giving full backing for Israel to resume the war if the agreement is breached.' The meeting, which began late after six hours of deliberations in the Security Cabinet, aims to finalize a deal to release 33 hostages held by Hamas. The first phase of the agreement is set to begin Sunday, with Israel releasing 95 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for three hostages. Netanyahu also addressed the timing of the deal, saying, 'For months, we couldn't make progress—not because a deal existed, but because Hamas resisted any agreement. The situation changed due to the bravery of our fighters and actions we’ve taken in the region, including significant blows to the Iranian axis. Hamas remains isolated, which led to their decision to fold and accept this deal.' For the 33 hostages expected to be released from Hamas captivity in the first phase of the deal, Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences. The initial phase will span 42 days. Under the agreement, three hostages will be freed on the first day, four more on the seventh day and three additional hostages will be released each week. In the final week, the remaining 12 hostages will be freed, along with Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, two Israeli nationals who have been held in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively. Earlier on Friday, the Security Cabinet recommended that the government approve the deal despite opposition from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, with the latter vowing to exit the coalition if ministers greenlight the deal. Other ministers opposed but were not eligible to vote. Prime Minister Netanyahu sought to reassure skeptics, particularly Smotrich, saying that U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Trump had provided guarantees that if negotiations for the next phase of the agreement fail and Hamas refuses to accept Israel’s security demands, Israel can resume full-scale military operations with U.S. backing. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi emphasized that troop deployment in the Philadelphi Corridor would increase during the first phase of the deal, ensuring stronger control. According to him, the agreement is based on the force deployment map for the corridor that was approved by the Security Cabinet last August. Under this map, the IDF will be able to maintain a larger presence in the corridor than it had before the deal's implementation. Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar warned ministers of an anticipated increase in terror activity in the West Bank, calling for proactive measures to counter it. Halevi echoed the warning, saying the military is prepared to respond with full force if needed. He also cautioned that Hamas may use the cease-fire to rebuild its terror infrastructure. Despite the risks, all senior security officials, including Bar, Halevi, Mossad Director David Barnea and National Security Council head Tzachi Hanegbi, urged ministers to back the hostage deal. During the meeting, Barnea noted that Israel retains leverage over Hamas to ensure compliance with the deal. Senior security officials assessed that Hamas has an interest in respecting the agreement and extending the cease-fire as long as possible. The Security Cabinet decision also drew attention to logistical issues, as debates over holding a government session on Friday, before the start of Shabbat, caused delays. Some ministers were prepared to leave written votes to meet religious considerations, while judicial sources clarified that the High Court would not delay the deal, even holding emergency hearings on Saturday if needed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy8lku00wyl	2025-01-17T13:49:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/17/rklMzZTvPJl/rklMzZTvPJl_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

Bipin, Joshua, Pongsak: The foreign nationals still held captive ...	10 foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza, excluded from hostage deal’s first phase—8 Thai, 2 from Nepal and Tanzania; among them: student in Israel for weeks, father supporting his child and man who heroically shielded others under fire Of the 98 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, 10 are foreign nationals abducted from their workplaces in southern Israel’s kibbutzim. Eight are Thai citizens who came to Israel to support their families, while the others include one Nepali student and one Tanzanian student. These foreign hostages are not included in the first stage of the planned deal, which is set to begin next week and involves the release of 33 captives. So far, 23 Thai hostages have been freed, thanks to negotiations between Thailand and Arab and Muslim nations, including Hamas' main backer, Iran. These releases occurred outside of Israel’s hostage deal. However, 49 Thai nationals were killed during the October 7 attack, and nearly 30,000 Thais were working in Israeli agriculture before the war. In Kibbutz Nir Oz alone, 11 Thai workers were murdered, five were abducted and two were freed in an earlier deal. After the massacre, Kibbutz Chair Osnat Perry sent a letter in Thai to the Thai people, their prime minister Srettha Thavisin and Thai Ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya, expressing deep regret over the harm to innocent Thai citizens. She emphasized efforts to secure the safe return of all hostages. Among those abducted was Sattin Suwankham, 34, who was seriously wounded during his capture. Suwankham’s mother learned of his kidnapping from a video of the abduction uploaded to Facebook. The other Thai hostages are Surasak Lamnau, 30, Pongsak Tanna, 35, Bhanawat Saitieo, who was shot in the leg on October 7, Pinta Natthaphong, 35, and Watchara Sriaoun, 32. Two other Thai workers—Sontha Oakkharasri, 32, and Rinthalak Sudthisak, 43—were murdered in the plantations of Kibbutz Be’eri on the day of the massacre and their bodies are held in the Gaza Strip. According to the website Untold, Not Forgotten, Pongpak, originally from Buriram Province in Thailand, worked in Israel for just over six years to support his 15-year-old daughter. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In addition to the Thai hostages, Nepali student Bipin Joshi, 23, and Tanzanian student Joshua Loitu Mollel, 22, are also held captive. Both came to Israel to study agriculture. Joshi and his Nepali peers arrived just three weeks before October 7 and were living in Kibbutz Alumim, where they were set to specialize in citrus farming. On the morning of the attack, they awoke to the sound of rockets. According to The Wall Street Journal, after hearing the rockets and gunfire, Joshi realized the attack was different from the usual alarms he had experienced. As rockets fell, the Nepali and Thai residents scattered to various hiding places. One foreign worker near Joshi sought refuge above a refrigerator, writing to his wife, 'I won’t be coming home.' Others hid under wooden tables in a kitchen near crates of onions. In a bomb shelter where 17 Nepali workers huddled shoulder-to-shoulder, they took a selfie, with Joshi smiling in the foreground. As gunfire approached, panic ensued. When Hamas terrorists entered the shelter, they shot dead a student filming on his phone and another who shouted, 'We are Nepali.' Two grenades were thrown into the room; Joshi managed to grab one and throw it away but could not reach the second grenade, which exploded, leaving several injured and unconscious. After the attackers moved on, Israeli police called for survivors to head to a nearby kitchen. While some Nepali and Thai workers fled to new hiding spots, Joshi helped gather the injured to assist them. He quickly messaged his cousin, writing in English: 'If something happens to me, you’ll have to take care of the family. Stay strong and always look to the future.' A young terrorist armed with a rifle later burst into the area and forced Joshi and three Thai workers toward the door. Another terrorist recorded the abduction on his phone—the last footage of Joshi seen to date. His family and the Nepali government are tirelessly campaigning to raise awareness of his captivity and secure his release. On October 7, 10 Nepali students were killed in the attacks. Prof. Chaim Shaked, president of Hemdat College of Education in Sdot Negev, where they studied, traveled to Nepal to visit the victims' families. Mollel, an agronomy student from Tanzania, was confirmed dead several weeks after the attack, with his body taken to Gaza. Since then, his father, Loitu, has led an international campaign to recover his remains, even traveling to Israel. He met with then-foreign minister Eli Cohen, who presented the family with a certificate for 18 trees planted in Mollel's name in partnership with Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael. Another Tanzanian, Mollel’s roommate Clemence Felix Mtenga, was also killed during the attacks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjl6qvow1g	2025-01-17T11:07:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/16/Sk111iaIPkg/Sk111iaIPkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar warned the Cabinet on Friday of an anticipated increase in terror activity in the West Bank, calling for proactive measures to counter it. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi echoed the warning, saying the military is prepared to respond with full force if needed. He also cautioned that Hamas may use the cease-fire to rebuild its terror infrastructure. Despite the risks, all senior security officials, including Bar, Halevi, Mossad Director David Barnea and National Security Council head Tzachi Hanegbi, urged ministers to back the hostage deal.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjsrjq00vjg	2025-01-17T10:11:48-08:00

Houthis threaten to resume attacks on Israel if Gaza cease-fire c...	Ahead of cease-fire deal and hostage release, Yemeni rebels pledge continued support for Palestinians, vowing to 'expel the Israeli enemy'; departing from past statements on Gaza, spokesperson declares, 'The goal is to liberate every inch of Palestine' Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree warned Friday that the Yemeni militia would escalate attacks on Israel if the recently declared Gaza cease-fire is violated. Speaking at a rally in the capital of Sanaa, Saree claimed responsibility for alleged missile and drone strikes on Israeli and U.S. targets, including cruise missile launches at Eilat and drones targeting Tel Aviv, Ashkelon and the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier. However, no evidence has emerged to substantiate these claims. Saree’s remarks marked a shift in rhetoric. While previous statements called for ending aggression and lifting the siege on Gaza, Saree now vowed to 'liberate every inch of Palestine and expel the Israeli enemy.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He added that the Houthis remain committed to monitoring the situation in Gaza and are prepared to act against any perceived escalation by Israel. The rally was one of many pro-Gaza demonstrations regularly held in Yemen since the war began, with Sanaa hosting the largest events. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi echoed Saree's stance, describing the cease-fire as 'one round in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy' and reiterating the group's commitment to supporting the Palestinian cause until 'Palestine is free of occupation.' Critics accuse the Houthis of leveraging the Palestinian issue to divert attention from Yemen’s severe humanitarian crisis, where hunger, disease and poverty are rampant in Houthi-controlled areas. Despite the criticism, the Houthis claim their alignment with other regional anti-Israel forces has yielded significant successes, and they remain ready to escalate if Israel reneges on the cease-fire agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bymc2gdvkl	2025-01-17T09:17:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/B1o9maAUye/B1o9maAUye_0_0_3000_2001_0_small.jpg

Russia and Iran sign strategic cooperation treaty	Putin and Pezeshkian sign 20-year strategic partnership treaty emphasizing closer defense and economic cooperation, specifics remain undisclosed Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian on Friday signed a 20-year strategic partnership treaty involving closer defense cooperation that is likely to worry the West. Pezeshkian, on his first Kremlin visit since winning the presidency last July, hailed the signing as an important new chapter in the two countries' relations, while Putin said Moscow and Tehran had many of the same views on international affairs. 'This (treaty) creates better conditions for bilateral cooperation in all areas,' said Putin, emphasizing the upside for economic ties and trade, which he said was mostly carried out in the two countries' own currencies. 'We need less bureaucracy and more concrete action. Whatever difficulties are created by others we will be able to overcome them and move forward,' Putin added, referring to Western sanctions on both countries. Putin said Russia regularly informed Iran about what was going on in the Ukraine conflict and that they closely consulted on events in the Middle East and South Caucasus region. Russia and Iran were the main military allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who fled to Moscow after being toppled last month. The West also accuses Iran of providing missiles and drones for Russian attacks on Ukraine. Moscow and Tehran say their increasingly close ties are not directed against other countries. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Putin said work on a potential gas pipeline to carry Russian gas to Iran was progressing despite difficulties, and that, despite delays in building new nuclear reactors for Iran, Moscow was open to potentially taking on more nuclear projects. Pezeshkian, whose words were translated by Russian state TV, said the treaty would create good opportunities and showed Moscow and Iran did not need to heed the opinion of what he called 'countries over the ocean.' 'The agreements we reached today are another stimulus when it comes to the creation of a multi-polar world,' he said. Close cooperation Moscow has cultivated closer ties with Iran and other countries hostile towards the U.S., such as North Korea, since the start of the Ukraine war, and already has strategic pacts with Pyongyang and close ally Belarus, as well as a partnership agreement with China. Immediate details of the 20-year Russia-Iran agreement were not available but it was not expected to include a mutual defence clause of the kind sealed with Minsk and Pyongyang. It is still likely to concern the West, however, which sees both countries as malign influences on the world stage. Neither leader mentioned defense cooperation during their Kremlin press conference, but officials from both countries had said earlier that part of the pact focused on defense. Russia has made extensive use of Iranian drones during the war in Ukraine and the United States accused Tehran in September of delivering close-range ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine. Tehran denies supplying drones or missiles. The Kremlin has declined to confirm it has received Iranian missiles, but has acknowledged that its cooperation with Iran includes 'the most sensitive areas.' Russia has supplied Iran with S-300 air defense missile systems in the past and there have been reports in Iranian media of potential interest in buying more advanced systems such as the S-400 and of acquiring advanced Russian fighter jets. Pezeshkian's visit to Moscow comes at a time when Iran's influence across the Middle East is in retreat with the fall of Assad in Syria and the Israeli pounding of Iran-backed groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The fate of two major Russian military facilities in Syria has been uncertain since the fall of Assad. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rypgy1100d1l	2025-01-17T07:59:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/12/HkhnJTefke/HkhnJTefke_0_0_3000_2031_0_small.jpg
US Supreme Court upholds law banning TikTok	The U.S. Supreme Court upheld on Friday a law banning TikTok in the United States on national security grounds if its Chinese parent company ByteDance does not sell the short-video app by Sunday, as the justices in a 9-0 decision declined to rescue a platform used by about half of all Americans. The justices ruled that the law, passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress last year and signed by Democratic President Joe Biden, did not violate the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. The justices affirmed a lower court's decision that had upheld the measure after it was challenged by TikTok, ByteDance and some of the app's users. 'There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,' the court said in the unsigned opinion. The court added that 'we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners' First Amendment rights.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1bqub00vjx	2025-01-17T07:43:09-08:00

Israel names 95 Palestinian prisoners to be released in first pha...	First phase would secure freedom of 3 female hostages held in Gaza, contingent on government approval; if approved, first release set for no earlier than Sunday at 4:00 p.m. Israel is set to release 95 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal to secure the release of three female hostages held in Gaza. The names of the prisoners, published on the Justice Ministry’s website, are contingent upon government approval of the agreement. A Cabinet meeting to finalize the deal, originally scheduled to convene at 3 p.m., has yet to take place. If approved, the first release is set for no earlier than Sunday at 4:00 p.m. Under the first stage of the agreement, 33 hostages, held by Hamas in Gaza for 469 days, are slated for release. In exchange, Israel will free nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences. The final number depends on how many hostages are returned alive in this initial phase, following over 15 months in captivity. Under the deal, 210 minors and women will be released for five female civilian hostages and two children from the Bibas family. For five female soldiers, 150 prisoners serving life sentences and 100 others will be freed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Additional releases include 110 lifers for nine ill or injured hostages, 30 lifers and 270 others for 10 elderly hostages, and 60 prisoners along with 47 re-incarcerated Shalit deal detainees for Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, two Israeli nationals who have been held in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively. Furthermore, 1,000 Palestinians arrested after October 8 will be freed, excluding those involved in the October 7 attacks. Life-sentenced prisoners will also be released to the West Bank and East Jerusalem. However, Israeli officials stressed that convicted murderers will not be among those returned to these areas. Cabinet discussions revealed data showing that 82% of prisoners freed in previous deals resumed terrorist activities. The government’s deliberations follow the Security Cabinet’s earlier approval of the deal, which included extensive debate. Israel’s military leadership presented plans to ensure heightened troop presence in critical areas during the initial phase of the agreement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bky1dx00pjl	2025-01-17T06:47:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/BJKq4vN41x/BJKq4vN41x_0_185_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Cabinet approves hostage deal after 4 hours, with Smotrich and Ben-Gvir opposing; PM says Biden and Trump guaranteed Israel can resume fighting if Phase II fails; lifers will be freed to West Bank and East Jerusalem, excluding murderers After four hours of deliberations, the Security Cabinet approved a hostage deal on Friday, under which 33 hostages held by Hamas for 469 days will be freed in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences. The government is now set to approve the agreement, with the release process expected to begin on Sunday. A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the decision was reached after 'considering all political, security and humanitarian aspects' and assessing that the deal supports Israel’s war objectives. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich voted against the deal, citing concerns over its impact on national security. Other ministers opposed but were not eligible to vote. The agreement has sparked significant debate, with data presented during the meeting showing that 82% of released prisoners in past deals returned to terrorism. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Prime Minister Netanyahu sought to reassure skeptics, particularly Smotrich, saying that U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump had provided guarantees that if negotiations for the next phase of the agreement fail and Hamas refuses to accept Israel’s security demands, Israel can resume full-scale military operations with U.S. backing. The deal allows the release of life-sentenced prisoners to the West Bank and East Jerusalem but excludes high-profile murderers from entering those areas. During discussions, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi emphasized that troop deployment in the Philadelphi Corridor would increase during the first phase of the deal, ensuring stronger control. President Isaac Herzog welcomed the decision, calling it 'a vital step toward fulfilling the highest covenant between the state and its citizens.' However, he acknowledged the challenges and sacrifices involved, urging unity as the country faces difficult moments. Ben-Gvir, however, remained fiercely critical after the vote, expressing heightened concerns over the release of prisoners to areas where they could return to terrorism. 'I urge my colleagues in Likud and the Religious Zionist Party to join me in stopping this reckless deal before it’s too late,' he said. In a statement released by Netanyahu’s spokesperson Omer Dostri, he wrote: 'All the spins have dissipated: there would be no deal if the prime minister insisted on staying in Philadelphi – we are staying; no deal if the prime minister insisted on not committing to ending the war – no commitment was made; no deal if the prime minister insisted Israel remains within the perimeter – we are staying; no deal if the prime minister insisted Israel could return to fighting – there are guarantees.' The Cabinet decision also drew attention to logistical issues, as debates over holding a government session on Friday, before the start of Shabbat, caused delays. Some ministers were prepared to leave written votes to meet religious considerations, while judicial sources clarified that the High Court would not delay the deal, even holding emergency hearings on Saturday if needed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkiyt100vkx	2025-01-17T05:48:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/17/rklMzZTvPJl/rklMzZTvPJl_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu seeks US visit, promises from Trump on Iran	Incoming US president says prime minister will be among the first to visit him, during which Netanyahu will attempt to secure best cooperation possible Behind-the-scenes discussions have been taking place in recent days on a possible visit by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington, a few days after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Several dates are being considered, though nothing has been finalized. It’s expected that the visit could happen as early as February, with the timing also dependent on Netanyahu’s health condition. Trump reportedly mentioned in private conversations that Netanyahu would be the first or one of the first world leaders to be invited to the White House. Such an invitation would also serve as a gesture by Trump toward Netanyahu, especially after his willingness to agree to the hostage and cease-fire deal in Gaza. The visit holds significant importance for Netanyahu for several reasons: It would mark his first trip abroad since the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague issued an arrest warrant against him. A visit to the U.S. would project 'business as usual' and demonstrate strong coordination between Israel and the U.S. against the ICC. The visit also presents an opportunity for Netanyahu to coordinate on key issues of shared interest between the two nations, including addressing Iran's nuclear program, post-war plans for Gaza, normalization with Saudi Arabia, the situation in Syria, continuing the cease-fire in Lebanon and discussions on the next U.S.-Israel security memorandum. The current agreement, signed during Barack Obama’s administration, is set to expire in 2028 and Israel hopes to negotiate a similarly generous memorandum with Trump. Currently, Israel receives $3.8 billion annually in U.S. security aid. Iran is expected to top Netanyahu’s agenda. The partnership between Israel and the U.S. under Trump’s leadership opens unprecedented opportunities to address the Iranian threat through diplomatic negotiations, economic pressure and credible military threats. During Trump’s previous term, he applied immense economic pressure on Iran, though it wasn’t supported by a credible military threat, which may now change.

Strengthening the western Negev and the Galilee is the most crit...	As soon as the war began, the UJA Federation of New York partnered with several other organizations to establish Horizon, a project focused on rehabilitating the communities along the Gaza border most severely affected by the war. Tens of millions of shekels have been invested in this initiative, making it the largest philanthropic effort dedicated to the region’s residents. But it’s not just about the financial support. 'They really listened to us,' said a resident of Nir Yitzhak. 'We felt we could trust them.' On the first night of Hanukkah, exactly one year ago, a few members of the Nir Yitzhak community, near Gaza, gathered by candlelight, holding onto great hope. The community suffered severe losses on October 7, including fierce battles at the kibbutz gate, the abduction of an entire family from their safe room, and hours of intense fear and uncertainty. At that candle-lighting ceremony, they were joined by guests who would later become central partners in the community’s recovery—representatives from the Israeli office of the UJA Federation of New York, along with those from the Horizon initiative. Together, they connected deeply with the community’s story and have since supported Nir Yitzhak, along with 53 other southern communities that came under attack. 'The meeting was incredibly moving. We immediately understood they were here to help,' said Rona Minaker, a member of Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. 'They truly listened and wanted to understand our needs. Trust was built quickly, and we felt we could rely on them.' The Horizon initiative, led by the UJA Federation of New York, is the largest philanthropic effort dedicated to rehabilitating the Gaza border region. Launched in the early days of the war, it partners with 150 of Israel’s leading companies and has already invested over 60 million shekels to help affected communities recover and thrive. 'One of Horizon’s key contributions early on was paying salaries to sustain the shattered communities,' Minaker explains. Kibbutz Kfar Aza, another community involved in the project, recently launched a program called 'Ofir’s Seeds,' in memory of the late Ofir Libstein. This initiative focuses on supporting young adults, the group most severely impacted by the events of October 7. Over 2 million shekels have been allocated for student scholarships tied to community volunteering and retreats designed to strengthen youth bonds. The program aims to encourage young residents to return and play an active role in rebuilding their community, serving as a model for similar initiatives across the Sha’ar HaNegev Regional Council. 'Horizon’s guiding principle is to put the community at the center,' said Itzik Shmuli, Director-General of UJA in Israel. 'This means that the community itself defines its most urgent needs—whether in trauma recovery, resilience, education, or employment—areas that have not yet received government funding. By doing so, we not only help the community overcome its most difficult challenges but also empower it, offering a strong reason to look toward the future from within the great rupture—and dare to envision the next steps in rebuilding and recovery.' According to Shmuli, 'The New York Federation has supported Israel on an extraordinary scale for 80 years, even before the state was established. But it’s in times like these that you truly understand how deep the connection runs and how strong the solidarity is between us. The mobilization of the New York community is incredible, and the message is clear: this is a fight for our shared national home. Horizon stems from that place—a desire to stand with communities in their darkest hour and build genuine partnerships for the years ahead. Today, Horizon represents the largest philanthropic initiative supporting the affected communities in the south.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The critical goal of returning to these communities requires action on multiple fronts. 'The focus is forward-looking,' emphasized Minaker. 'It’s not just about returning and supporting families but also about demographic growth. We’re talking about rebuilding from an event that hasn’t yet ended, which makes it complex. There’s no sense of security—the war is still here.' 'The most painful place' 'From the early days of October, it was clear to us that we needed to reach those communities that had endured the unimaginable,' said Shmuli. 'We chose to step into the most painful place—not as donors or consultants, but as partners.' Thus, the Horizon project was born, in collaboration with the Businesses Forum—a consortium of 150 leading Israeli companies, including Wix, Tidhar, Cisco, and Viola—along with key philanthropic partners, including CJP Boston, the DC Federation, and Tozeret Haaretz, as the coordinating body. The initiative focuses on a wide range of areas aimed at community recovery and rebuilding: resilience, trauma care, employment development, empowering local leadership, educational initiatives, and informal education programs. Examples of activities include helping affected communities transition to temporary housing, recruiting professional personnel to support communities, establishing educational frameworks, and offering group therapy programs—particularly for children and teenagers living in temporary housing facilities, such as hotels. And the list goes on. Tzohar, a community in the Eshkol Regional Council located just 7 kilometers from the Gaza border, finds itself excluded from support provided by the Tkuma Directorate, the government body responsible for assisting Gaza border communities. 'Tzohar is a large community with 600 families,' explains the community’s secretary, Yaniv Ben Haggai Levi. 'In recent years, many young families have moved here. We don’t own land, and, apart from paying taxes, we lack the ability to generate resources through entrepreneurship, industry, or agriculture. Because of this, we can’t offer activities that develop the community or its culture. It’s incomprehensible that, despite the enormous challenges we face, we are left out of the ‘border region’ support—by a mere 123 meters separating us from the official area. The state was nowhere to be found in these past months, and now it’s floundering. Without the help of the New York Federation and American Jewry, I don’t know where the Gaza border region would be today. And this applies not only to us but to everyone.' He recalls, 'When the representatives from UJA and Horizon visited, they asked how they could help. I shared that our biggest challenge was the lack of funding for programs for children, youth, and the community. They loved the idea and funded the program for three years. They’ve given my residents a renewed sense of hope.' 'Immense responsibility' Guy Pross, a member of the steering committee for the Businesses Forum, reflects, 'The war caught us, as business professionals, ill-prepared. Unlike the military or government, we didn’t have an official framework. We found ourselves heading to hotels in Eilat and the Dead Sea to meet with the displaced from the affected communities.' These meetings were profoundly challenging. 'We encountered broken people and realized that simply standing before them and offering help carried an immense responsibility,' says Pross. 'Creating a joint project that brings together the business world with the most significant federations in the U.S. is a major achievement, enabling us to accomplish many things—both in terms of funding and operational execution.' Shmuli shares a resolute message for the Gaza border communities: 'We are here and not going anywhere. We will continue to provide support and assistance to the best of our ability. Strengthening the western Negev and the Galilee is the most critical Zionist mission of our generation, and we are honored to take part alongside the incredible residents. This is the most important project we are undertaking in Israel today.'

Initiative launches West Bank support caucus in US Congress	Congressional Friends of Judea and Samaria aims to lift sanctions from Jewish settlers in the West Bank and address the area with its Israeli naming convention Over 20 members of the U.S. Congress recently attended a historic launch event for the caucus supporting the West Bank in Congress. The event took place just days before the inauguration of incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Among the attendees were relatives of hostages, including ex-hostage Aviva Siegel whose husband Keith, an American citizen, is still held in Gaza, as well as Yarden Gonen, sister of hostage Romi Gonen. Other attendees included members of the incoming Trump administration, evangelical community leaders and representatives of Jewish communities in the U.S. The caucus was initiated by Yossi Dagan, head of the Samaria Regional Council, in collaboration with New York Republican Representative Claudia Tenney. According to Dagan, the goal is 'to deepen the ties between Israel and its friends in Congress and advance legislative initiatives supporting Jewish settlement.' The caucus plans to promote new legislation banning the use of the term 'West Bank' in official U.S. government documents, mandating instead the use of 'Judea and Samaria.' It also seeks to work with the incoming administration to lift sanctions on settlement activity and strengthen international support for the settlement enterprise. Speaking at the event, Dagan said, 'Today we start a marathon together — one that will lead us to victory: a victory for historical justice. Judea and Samaria aren’t just about historical justice for the Jewish people. 'Samaria is the security belt for Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion Airport and the State of Israel as a whole. Judea and Samaria are also protecting the United States and all Western culture.' Tenney added, 'We’re working to raise awareness of the historical importance of Judea and Samaria in the U.S. Congress, aiming to unite voices across America and globally in support of the region.' Republican Representative Tom McClintock from California added, 'Judea and Samaria are an inseparable part of the historical land of the Jewish people, with roots spanning thousands of years.

Security Cabinet convenes to approve deal after hour’s delay	Israel’s Security Cabinet convened on Friday an hour after its initial set time to approve the hostage deal signed in Qatar overnight.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bytpfjppke	2025-01-17T00:57:13-08:00	
These are the 33 hostages set to be released in deal's first phas...	Hostages' families receive notice of updated list confirmed by Hamas that includes Israeli women, children and elderly set to be freed after being abducted on October 7 Following the signing of a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas on Friday, the IDF informed the hostages’ families about the list of names Israel requested for release which Hamas approved. The updated list included the 33 individuals, as well as others hoping their relatives — both living and deceased — will be released in the deal's second phase. The list aligns with the one Hamas approved earlier this month, based on a roster Israel submitted months ago. However, the families weren't provided information regarding the hostages' conditions. The first to be released are expected to be women abducted from kibbutzim and the Nova Music Festival: Romi Gonen, Emily Damari, Arbel Yehud, Doron Steinbrecher and Shiri Bibas and her young children, Ariel and Kfir. Subsequently, five female IDF lookouts captured at the Nahal Oz base will be freed: Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, and Naama Levy. The list also includes 10 men aged 50–85: Ohad Ben-Ami, Gadi Moses, Keith Siegal, Ofer Calderon, Eliyahu Sharabi, Itzik Elgart, Shlomo Mansour, Ohad Yahalomi, Oded Lifshitz and Tsahi Idan. Additionally, nine other injured or ill hostages are set to be released in the deal's first phase: Yarden Bibas, Sagui Dekel Hen, Yair Horn, Omer Wenkert, Alexander Trufanov, Eliya Cohen, Or Levy, Tal Shoham and Omer Shem Tov. Also included are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held captive in Gaza for nearly a decade. Hamas plans to release the hostages over 42 days (six weeks), with at least three hostages freed weekly. Living hostages will be released before the deceased. Under the terms of the deal, women will be released first in two stages: three women on the first day and four on the seventh day.

Israel's Security Cabinet to convene to approve hostage deal	Ministers set to meet Friday morning to finalize deal signed in Qatar and present list of Palestinian prisoners to be released; government meeting to follow on Saturday Representatives from Israel, Hamas, the U.S., and Qatar officially signed the hostage deal in Doha after a roughly 24-hour delay. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was updated by the negotiation team that an agreement had been reached on the hostage release deal Thursday overnight. The Security Cabinet is scheduled to convene at 10:15 a.m. to approve the deal. According to the Prime Minister's Office, the government will also meet 'at a later time,' though no specific time has been mentioned, nor is it clear if this meeting will take place on Friday. 'The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation to the negotiation team and everyone who assisted,' the statement read. 'The hostages’ families were updated on the agreement by the Prime Minister’s Office’s Hostage Directorate,' Netanyahu instructed the Hostage Directorate to coordinate preparations for the hostages’ return. Amid pressure from his coalition partners urging a resumption of hostilities once the first phase of the deal is complete — during which 33 hostages are expected to be released —Netanyahu said, 'The State of Israel is committed to achieving all the war’s objectives, including the return of all our hostages, both the living and the fallen.' Members of the negotiation team returned to Israel overnight. If the Security Cabinet and government convene to approve the deal on Friday, during which the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released will be presented as well, three hostages may still be released by Sunday. According to several government officials, the delay stems from the expectation that the cabinet meeting will be very lengthy, prompting the decision to postpone it until the morning and to schedule the government meeting for Saturday night. However, in the previous agreement, the deal was approved overnight following a short cabinet discussion and a subsequent lengthy government debate. The only plausible explanation for the delay until Saturday night is opposition from religious and ultra-Orthodox ministers to holding the meeting on the Sabbath.

Palestinian Authority cannot replace Hamas, expert says	Einat Wilf: The problem is ‘Palestinianism’ as an identity, as an ideology that tragically organized an entire people over the obsession of the nonexistence of a Jewish state The Palestinian Authority (PA) cannot replace Hamas in governing the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli author and thought leader Einat Wilf. Speaking to ILTV News, Wilf explained that the issue extends beyond Hamas alone. 'The problem is ‘Palestinianism’ as an identity, as an ideology that tragically organized an entire people over the obsession of the nonexistence of a Jewish state,' Wilf said. 'Hamas is merely the most brutal and recent executive arm of Palestinianism, but the Palestinian Authority shares the same vision of no Jewish state.' Wilf emphasized that the difference between the PA and Hamas lies in their approach: the PA aims to destroy Israel diplomatically by working to isolate it as a pariah state. Wilf pointed out that Hamas remains 'hugely popular' in the West Bank and argued that the PA has not distanced itself from the events of October 7 or from Hamas. She also urged the American administration to recognize that 'you cannot want for the Palestinians a state they have never wanted for themselves if it has to live next to a Jewish state.' Her comments were made a day after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed an Atlantic Council event, where he proposed a plan for Gaza’s governance after Hamas is eradicated. Blinken encouraged the Palestinian Authority to play a role in Gaza’s future.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bynlq8wwjl	2025-01-16T19:21:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/SkWijgSpU1e/SkWijgSpU1e_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Did Israel sabotage Iran's nuclear program?	Iran claims explosives were embedded in centrifuge components purchased by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran A new interview has revealed fresh details about Israel's sabotage efforts against Iran's nuclear program. In an interview from Iran, Mohammed Zarif, the Islamic regime's vice president and former foreign minister, disclosed for the first time that Israel had planted explosives in Iran's nuclear centrifuges. However, he did not specify when this incident occurred or when the regime became aware of it. According to Zarif, the explosives were embedded in centrifuge components purchased by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. These components were eventually located and neutralized by the regime. Zarif claimed that international sanctions left the regime vulnerable to what he described as 'Israeli traps,' forcing Iran to rely on intermediaries for critical equipment—intermediaries that Israel successfully infiltrated. He likened this infiltration to past operations, such as the 2021 pager attack on Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon. A separate incident involving a power failure at the Natanz nuclear facility, caused by an explosion, was previously labeled an act of 'nuclear terrorism' by the Islamic regime. However, it remains unclear whether that event was connected to the explosives Zarif described. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the Natanz explosion. With the transition to President-elect Donald Trump, the Iranian regime is bracing for another round of sanctions. The Trump administration’s previous sanctions nearly crippled Iran's economy, significantly reducing oil exports, funding to terror proxies, and nuclear enrichment activities. Executions and other repressive measures also increased during Trump’s tenure, adding to the regime’s challenges.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhpuuvdyl	2025-01-16T19:06:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/11/HkTOOygvJl/HkTOOygvJl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
3 challenges of the hostage-for-ceasefire deal	Comment: Despite challenges, most Israelis support the deal and believe that all the hostages must be brought home The hostage-for-ceasefire agreement has been signed in Doha, according to the Prime Minister’s Office, and is expected to begin implementation next week, pending government approval on Friday. While the country can celebrate and begin to heal as it witnesses at least some hostages return home, the deal comes with significant challenges: No. 1: Prisoners Will Be Released As with all previous hostage deals, Israel will release a significant number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages, the majority of whom are not expected to return alive. These prisoners include individuals responsible for heinous acts, some with blood on their hands from murdering innocent people. The deal includes prisoners serving life sentences. However, the government has emphasized that those being released will not include members of Hamas’s Nukhba forces or individuals arrested for participating in the October 7 massacre. No. 2: Israel Is Not Done in Gaza Israel has not yet completed its military campaign to eliminate Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The terror organization still wields significant power, particularly in certain areas, as evidenced by ongoing clashes. In the past week alone, several Israeli soldiers have been killed in battle, and rockets continue to be launched from Gaza into southern Israel. Israeli officials report that the IDF has dismantled approximately 80% of Hamas’s military infrastructure. However, a recent U.S. Department of State report suggests that Hamas has managed to recruit nearly as many new operatives as Israel has killed, raising concerns about the group’s resilience. No. 3: Strategic Corridors Will Be Relinquished During Phase I of the agreement, Israel will maintain control over the Rafah crossing into Egypt and the Philadelphi Corridor. However, the deal eventually calls for Israel’s withdrawal from these critical areas. These corridors have historically been used by Hamas to smuggle weapons, ammunition, and materials for constructing its extensive underground tunnel network. Without proper monitoring, Hamas could exploit the opportunity to rebuild, potentially putting southern Israel at risk of another attack. Despite these challenges, most Israelis support the deal and believe that all the hostages must be brought home. Rachel and Jon Goldberg Polin, the parents of Hersh Goldberg Polin—an American-Israeli hostage murdered by Hamas last year—said this week that Israel needs to begin its process of national healing. They emphasized that true healing can only start when all the hostages are safely returned. Furthermore, a guiding principle for many Israelis comes from the Talmud (Sanhedrin 37a): 'Whoever saves a single life is considered by scripture to have saved the whole world.' This teaching, along with the Jewish commandment to redeem captives, underscores the moral imperative driving efforts to secure the hostages’ release. Lastly, Israelis need assurance that if they or their loved ones serve in the IDF or are captured by terrorists, the country will spare no effort to rescue them. This unwavering commitment is seen as a cornerstone of Israel’s national ethos.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hylamiwdyl	2025-01-16T18:55:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/26/Byy3zz11ST/Byy3zz11ST_1_0_992_558_0_small.jpg
Hostage families have 'mixed emotions' around deal	While families of the hostages are, understandably, eager to see their loved ones return home, other Israelis are expressing concerns about the nation’s security Mixed emotions surround the recently signed hostage deal, according to Israelis who spent time at Hostage Square this week. While families of the hostages are, understandably, eager to see their loved ones return home, other Israelis are expressing concerns about the nation’s security and the potential long-term implications of the agreement. For families, the primary goal is clear: ensuring that every single hostage is brought back, whether alive or, in tragic cases, as bodies prepared for burial in Israel. However, there are concerns. One example is the family of Tal Haimi, a hostage who was murdered on October 7. Haimi’s cousin shared that this is a painful deal to accept, particularly given the number of prisoners set to be released in exchange. Other families have voiced cautious optimism. Despite the deal being signed, they remain wary, recalling past instances when Hamas backed out of agreements.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rykje8vwkg	2025-01-16T18:38:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/16/SJQaKIkwPkg/SJQaKIkwPkg_0_293_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
‘Israel must stay in Gaza to eliminate Hamas’	As Trump prepares to take office next week, experts debate the long-term viability of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage agreement Israel cannot win the war against Hamas without maintaining a presence in the Gaza Strip, according to Or Yissachar, head of research and content for Habitchonistim. Speaking to ILTV on its weekly Insider program just before Israel signed a hostage deal in Doha, which could eventually lead to a full withdrawal of soldiers, Yissachar emphasized that without such a presence, it is 'impossible to be able to protect ourselves.' He added that it sends a troubling message to the world: that thousands of people can be massacred, yet those responsible can still hold onto their land and maintain the status quo. On October 7, 2023, more than 6,000 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists, along with Gazan civilians, infiltrated Israel and slaughtered 1,200 people. They kidnapped 251 individuals, 98 of whom remain in the Gaza Strip. Hostage-for-ceasefire negotiations have been ongoing since the first group of civilians was released in November 2023. Overnight on Thursday, the Prime Minister’s Office announced that a deal had been signed. 'The end game of this war must be that Hamas is eliminated and that the threat from the Gaza Strip is removed,' Yissachar said. 'That cannot only be achieved without a permanent military presence of Israel in the Gaza Strip, until such time the Palestinians concede their arms struggle against Israel.' Phase I of the hostage-for-ceasefire plan signed in Doha includes the IDF beginning to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. However, according to the plan, by Phase III, when all hostages are supposed to be released, there will be a complete IDF withdrawal. Moreover, some have argued that the phased plan, which allows only some hostages to be released, could result in others never leaving the coastal enclave. The plan was devised by the Biden administration but supported by the incoming Trump administration, which sent Steve Witkoff, the incoming special envoy to the Middle East, to assist in the negotiations. Yigal Marcus, a board member for Republicans Overseas Israel, said Witkoff was involved because Brett McGurk, who has been leading the negotiations for Biden, 'didn’t get the job done.' He argued that the success of the first phase should not be viewed in isolation but as part of Trump’s influence in the region. 'Thanks to President Trump’s threat, a deal was cut,' Marcus said. 'I think that Steve Witkoff represents the future, which is a future based on strength, a future based on taking America seriously, anywhere in the world.' Marcus also challenged Yissachar’s perspective, suggesting that while a first deal has been signed, the situation could change significantly after Trump’s inauguration on January 20. 'I think Hamas made a terrible mistake. Trump didn’t say, give me back 33 hostages. Trump said, I want all the hostages. On January 21 next week, on Tuesday, when Trump comes to the office and there are still 64 hostages being held, Hamas is going to have to answer for that,' Marcus said. He warned, 'They’ll have all hell to pay,' referencing Trump’s repeated threats to Hamas about releasing the hostages. 'They’re making a huge mistake by not taking Donald Trump seriously.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byupubppyl	2025-01-16T18:01:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/16/H1xBrs8vyl/H1xBrs8vyl_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

The cry of European hostages in Iran	The deal that secured the release of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala from a Tehran prison last week has sparked outrage among other European detainees still held in Iran; Through recordings smuggled from their cells, they are urging their governments to take action to bring them home as well For years, Iran has employed 'hostage diplomacy,' detaining innocent civilians under fabricated charges to extract concessions such as sanction relief or the release of Iranian nationals accused of terrorism in the West. Days after Italian journalist Cecilia Sala was freed from a Tehran prison last week, Italy agreed to release an Iranian businessman wanted in the U.S. on charges of supplying advanced and lethal technology to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for its attack drones. The intervention of incoming President Donald Trump in the secretive, multi-party deal has sparked hope that the fate of other Western hostages in Iran could soon improve. One such case is that of 70-year-old German-Iranian human rights activist Nahid Taghavi, who was released from Iran’s notorious Evin Prison after four years of severe conditions. Upon her release, she immediately returned to Germany. The terms of her release remain unclear. Meanwhile, Iran recently reported that a 64-year-old Swiss tourist arrested months ago on espionage charges had died by suicide in custody. The details of his case remain murky, but the sequence of recent events has prompted renewed pleas from Western detainees for their rescue. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another prisoner is Olivier Grondot, a 34-year-old Frenchman imprisoned in Iran since 2022. On Monday, Grondot revealed his identity in a recording smuggled from prison, where he described sharing a cell with 17 other inmates. 'What I am doing now puts me at risk, but I am exhausted,' he said, calling his detention an act of 'political extortion' by Iran aimed at France. He also detailed the deteriorating conditions faced by two other French prisoners, teachers Cécile Kohler, 39, and Jacques Paris, 71. 'Their condition is worse than mine. They are utterly exhausted,' he said. France had not previously disclosed Grondot’s identity, though he was convicted of espionage and sentenced to five years in prison. 'Everyone knows I am innocent. They have no evidence against me,' Grondot said, urging French authorities to 'recognize the truth' and act. Separately, Ahmad Reza Djalali, a Swedish-Iranian academic held in Tehran since 2016 under a death sentence for alleged espionage for Israel, issued a new recording from prison on Monday. In it, the 53-year-old doctor accused Sweden of treating him as a 'second-class citizen' and abandoning him. 'The Swedish government is aware of my situation but does nothing. My execution or declining health doesn’t seem to concern them,' he said. Djalali was arrested during a scientific conference in Tehran and kept in solitary confinement for months before being convicted of spying. Despite his appeals for intervention, Swedish authorities have been unable to secure his release. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ktfkvp1l	2025-01-16T14:28:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/r1s3t9ASkx/r1s3t9ASkx_0_0_1200_675_0_small.jpg
Senior Holocaust Memorial historian says free speech on Facebook ...	Experts warn that Meta's changes to the Facebook Moderation Policy and the move to a model of community notes may lead to increased online antisemitism and even election meddling In a seismic shift from its past moderation policies, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, announced the end to its fact-checking program and the move to a model of community notes. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg referred to the reelection of President Donald Trump during the announcement, noting that it marked 'a cultural tipping point toward prioritizing free speech,' and many Trump supporters have celebrated the news. According to experts in antisemitism and bias, though, the policy may end up amplifying hate speech, with potentially profound consequences for Jews, Israelis, and vulnerable communities everywhere. Meta said that the new community notes model will 'take a more personalized approach to political content' and will remove restrictions on some topics 'that are part of mainstream discourse.' It said that professional moderators’ biases under the previous model had led to unwarranted censorship. Robert Rozett, senior historian at Yad Vashem’s International Institute for Holocaust Research, described the new policy as 'a step in the wrong direction,' noting that free speech has its limits. 'It’s essential to refine these boundaries in a way that protects individuals and groups, such as Jews, who are frequently targeted online. Achieving a balance between preserving free expression and safeguarding against harm is crucial,' he explained. 'Everyone has the right to live without being subjected to hatred and attacks.' Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, head of the Democracy in the Information Age program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said that the policy change will have significant effects on Jews and on transgender people, who are often victims of online hate. 'Obviously Zuckerberg is trying to align himself with the Trump administration,' according to Shwartz Altshuler. 'It’s not about ideology; it’s political calculus. Meta is pivoting hard to the right, mirroring Silicon Valley’s capital shift since Donald Trump’s November victory.' Arik Segal, founder of the Conntix tech mediation agency and an expert in digital diplomacy, said that financial incentives played a part in Meta’s decision as well. 'The less content that is deleted for being fake means more money for Meta, and fake and controversial content is known to drive more traffic, which means more screen time and more money from advertisers,' he explained. Facebook’s shift away from content mediation has precedent in changes to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. When businessman Elon Musk acquired the platform, he imposed an approach of free speech absolutism, leading to the proliferation of antisemitism and other hate speech. Segal pointed to influencer Dan Bilzerian, who has nearly 2 million followers on X, as an example of the content that has thrived under Musk’s approach. Bilzerian has said that Jews were behind the September 11 attacks, that Nazi Germany 'flourished' following persecution of Jews, and that Jews control the media, among many other antisemitic comments. 'We will probably see similar profiles and pages on Facebook,' Segal said. Shwartz Altshuler similarly said that X’s move to a community notes model turned it into 'the biggest neo-Nazi platform in history.' 'Meta’s new plan is to outdo Elon Musk’s anything-goes approach on X, turning Facebook and Instagram into platforms of unchecked chaos,' she said. She warned that the change in policy would lead not just to increased hate but to all-out digital warfare. 'It’s about election meddling, social unrest, and real wars,' she said. The problems of community-led moderation predate X. Rozett pointed to Wikipedia, which is moderated entirely by community members. 'There are issues there, too,' he said. 'Because Wikipedia grants privileges to long-term editors rather than experts, it’s tough for a Holocaust scholar like me to challenge distortions effectively. This demonstrates the broader limitations of community regulation. The self-regulation can only be as good as its community members in this case, enabling pockets of hate speech to persist and grow.' Under Facebook’s new system, bad actors may weaponize the community notes tool, the experts warned. Hateful content will have a larger reach and will stay up for longer—if ever taken down at all. All low-level infractions will be addressed only if flagged by a user rather than automatically marked for review. 'This is going to take weeks to be flagged, which is like an eternity in internet time,' Shwartz Altshuler said. 'This will further divide America politically.' Similarly, the Anti-Defamation League warned that relying on user reports was no replacement for a proactive moderation policy. 'We know user reporting is broken, so for them to say they’re going to rely on that for antisemitism and hate without announcing some kind of big overhaul of reporting is tantamount to giving up,' a representative for the organization said. While experts criticized Meta’s new moderation policies, a notable percentage of Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn users celebrated the decision on social media. Many hailed the decision as a victory for free speech, with some saying that Facebook, as a private entity, should not attempt to behave like a government. Others said that Facebook isn’t meant to edit or curate content but simply to provide an open platform for users. Nadja Bar-Ner, a security analyst specializing in cognitive warfare, welcomed Facebook’s new moderation policies. 'They tried to moderate speech, and look what happened. If I go on Instagram, if I go on Facebook, I’m overwhelmed by antisemitism and straight-out hate speech and terror apologists,' he described. He accused Facebook’s moderators of being biased against Israel and censoring pro-Israel points of view. 'There should be limits to what can be said or shared, but these are very extreme things, such as planning violence, for example,' he continued. 'Beyond that, moderation not only was biased but was also acting like makeup, and people could not realize how much hate there really is out there.' Meta has experienced a significant stock rally in recent months, surging over 65% in 2024 and maintaining a positive outlook for 2025. Analysts have raised their price target for Meta stock to $715. That increase has to do with Meta’s plans to introduce generative AI tools to its vast user base of nearly 4 billion individuals and over 200 million businesses. Despite anticipated increases in capital expenditures to support AI initiatives, analysts project Meta’s earnings per share to exceed $26 in 2025 and surpass $30 in 2026, indicating sustained growth.

'With the ease of using AI apps, things will become even more chaotic. Some people will leave the platforms, like what is happening now with X, and some will see it as an opportunity to make a profit and perhaps offer solutions,' he said. 'However, it all depends on the dynamics of politics-tech relations.' Rozett said that the problem of hate speech on social media platforms requires a more coordinated response. 'What’s missing is a serious, ongoing international effort involving experts from different fields and platforms to figure out effective solutions that truly address the intricacies of this problem, which isn’t going away anytime soon,' he said. 'We need all available tools: technology, education, regulations, and thoughtful policy.'

Likud defends deal: 'Allows Israel to return to fighting under Am...	It is the first time the party has published an official statement on the deal; Claims it will allow Israel to 'maintain full control of the Philadelphi Corridor and the security buffer that surrounds the entire Gaza Strip' The Likud party issued a statement Thursday evening against National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in which it stated, that the 'existing deal allows Israel to return to fighting under American guarantee' - the first time any official has addressed this, after a series of references attributed to a 'political figure.' The party's statement against the minister, who threatened to leave the government coalition - at least temporarily - over the cease-fire and hostage release deal, also claimed that 'anyone who dismantles a right-wing government will be remembered as a global disgrace.' The statement then details the reasons why Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to the deal, including that it allows Israel to 'receive the weapons and means of warfare it needs, maximize the number of live hostages released, maintain full control of the Philadelphi Corridor and the security buffer that surrounds the entire Gaza Strip, and achieve dramatic security achievements that will ensure Israel's security for generations.' Otzma Yehudit responded to Likud in a statement. 'We expect our friends in the Likud to express appreciation for the ideological step of Otzma Yehudit, which stood by its values ​​against the reckless deal, which endangers Israel's security, undermines the achievements of the war, and constitutes a complete victory for Hamas,' the party said in a statement that also was posted on social media. 'This deal is a violation of all of the prime minister's public commitments to his partners and the Israeli public. It includes stopping the war, leaving the Philadelphia Corridor, abandoning the Netzarim Corridor, returning the terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip without inspection, and releasing hundreds of murderers with Jewish blood on their hands,' the statement continued. 'As we said, we will continue to support the coalition and will not allow the left to overthrow the Prime Minister, but we will not sit in a government that makes such immoral agreements. We will remind the Likud that, even before October 7, the Otzma Yehudit faction came out against the 'Gaza conception policy'' (of appeasing Hamas). 'Unfortunately, we were right then, we were right in many other cases, and I hope we are wrong this time.' > The agreement stipulates that in phase two of the deal, which would take place after 50 days, Israel will make a full withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor. The agreement also stipulates that the temporary cease-fire will continue as long as negotiations on the second phase continue, which will begin on the 16th day of the first phase - and the mediators are committed to working within its framework to continue the negotiations. This clause calls into question the continued presence in Philadelphi if the negotiations on the second phase drag on beyond the first phase, and the U.S. under Trump may force Israel to continue participating in the talks. The big question is whether incoming President Donald Trump, who has put a lot of pressure on Hamas and Netanyahu in recent weeks in an attempt to reach a deal, will actually allow Israel to quickly return to fighting after the first phase. According to sources in Israel, Netanyahu has reached an understanding with the Trump administration that he will back Israel if it decides to return to fighting if Hamas violates the agreement. The problem is that it is not at all certain that in real time the president-elect will give Israel the green light to return to fighting the terrorist organization, after promising in his victory speech that he 'ends wars, not starts them.' In a post he published Wednesday night on his social network Truth Social, Trump also signaled that he was moving toward a complete end to the war. He promised to work with Israel and U.S. allies to ensure that Gaza 'NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven,' and he also promised to expand the Abraham Accords, which he led at the end of his previous term, under which Israel signed a normalization agreement with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. 'We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords. This is only the beginning of great things to come for America, and indeed, the World!' he wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk4z11zvdkg	2025-01-16T13:53:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/15/rk0ttirwJg/rk0ttirwJg_0_58_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Former hostage, partner of fallen soldier find love together in r...	Almog Meir Jan, rescued from Hamas captivity, is now in a relationship with Osher Hanum, former partner of fallen soldier Amit Ben Yigal; The couple has received blessings from Amit's father: 'She deserves to love and be loved' Almog Meir Jan, who was rescued from Hamas captivity in June during 'Operation Arnon,' is now romantically involved with Osher Hanum, the former partner of Sergeant First Class Amit Ben Yigal, who was killed five years ago when a stone was thrown at his head during an operation in a Palestinian village. The two have been dating for about six months. Baruch Ben Yigal, the fallen soldier's father, told Ynet he approves of the relationship. 'When we marked six months since Amit’s passing, Osher and I stood together at his grave, and I told her that I wish her the best in the world, and that, God willing, she’ll invite us to her wedding. I told her she deserves to love and be loved, and I would be happy to hear that she’s in a relationship. I think this is the best thing that could happen. She’s a young woman who went through a tragedy.' 'I was very happy to hear about her relationship,' he continued. 'The kind-hearted Almog also attended the opening of the synagogue we dedicated in Amit’s memory and the ceremony where we brought in a Torah scroll. They came together. We are close to them, and we are so happy and supportive of them. My dream is to see Osher walk down the aisle, and I will dance all night at her wedding because she deserves it. I hope God grants me the opportunity to see her under the wedding canopy and the blessings of marriage.' The grieving father added: 'We are a supportive, loving, and embracing family. We only want her to be happy and to have the best and most joyful life. We’ve had enough sorrow. We deal with this sorrow every day, all day, so we only want the best for her.' Almog Meir Jan’s emotional speech at Hostages Square Almog Meir Jan was rescued on June 8 from the Nuseirat camp along with Shlomi Ziv, Noa Argamani, and Andrey Kozlov. About a week ago, he appeared at Hostages Square for the first time since his rescue and gave an emotional speech about the long period he spent under the constant threat of terrorists controlling his life. > 'It has been 210 days since that Saturday when I was taken out of hell, but I’ll never forget the sight of the outstretched hand toward me, the hand that saved my life,' he said. 'Arnon and his team will forever remain in my heart.' Arnon Zamora fell during the operation to rescue the hostages, and the operation was renamed in his memory He urged progress on a hostage deal. 'The outstretched hand for the hostages and their families is a deal that must be signed, a deal to save their lives, to save all of our lives,' he said, adding that: 'As long as all 100 of our hostages have not returned home safely, there is no recovery, no continuity and no future.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rkxzqv8p1l	2025-01-16T13:10:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/Sk04Gr11w1e/Sk04Gr11w1e_0_486_591_333_0_small.jpg
Erdogan says Israel must not be allowed to 'exploit' cease-fire	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday welcomed the cease-fire agreement and the release of the hostages reached between Israel and Hamas, but in light of the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip that continued with greater intensity, with dozens of deaths according to the Palestinians, he said that Israel must not be allowed to allegedly 'exploit' the cease-fire. Erdogan, who throughout the war has made very harsh statements against Israel, describing it as a genocidal terrorist state and promising to continue supporting Hamas, described the deal at a press conference in Ankara as a victory for the Palestinians. 'Despite losing more than 50,000 martyrs, most of them women and children, Gaza did not surrender, it was not conquered, and the people of Gaza did not bow down to the aggressor. The happiness, excitement, and pride that erupted last night in the streets of Gaza are the result of the uncompromising faith and heroic struggle,' he said. According to data from the Hamas Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip, some 46,600 Palestinians have been killed since the beginning of the war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhrrxdwkx	2025-01-16T12:53:17-08:00	
Italy's Foreign Minister expected to arrive in Israel	Following Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar's visit to Rome, Deputy Prime Minister and Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is expected to be the most senior visitor to visit Israel after the cease-fire deal is signed, and is expected to land as early as Monday. The Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will bring with him a large business delegation in the fields of cyber, energy, and connectivity to the Middle East, for meetings with counterparts in Israel. Another important area in which the relationship continues is defense procurement. The planned visit will be Foreign Minister Taiani's fourth to Israel since October 7, and in what stands out as an unequivocal expression of support for Israel's right to defend itself and an expression of solidarity after the expected hostage deal. The visit joins the understandings reached by Foreign Minister Saar during his visit, according to which Italy will respect the immunity of Israel's heads of state, despite the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court in The Hague.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylwnxvw1x	2025-01-16T12:48:28-08:00	
Biden and Trump collaborated on Gaza cease-fire, hostage-release ...	Negotiations for the Gaza cease-fire deal gained traction following Trump’s election win, driven by a rare cooperation between his team and Biden’s, despite their ongoing rivalry; Both presidents claimed credit for the breakthrough, with Trump asserting his role in securing the deal, while Biden acknowledged the challenge but deflected questions about credit, responding, 'Is that a joke?' In a rare show of bipartisan cooperation, representatives of the Biden and Trump administrations worked together to broker a cease-fire-for-hostages deal in Gaza. The cooperation between the two administrations was 'almost unprecedented,' a senior Biden administration official told CNN, underscoring a rare alignment of interests following Trump's 2024 election victory. Brett McGurk, President Joe Biden’s longtime Middle East negotiator, had been stationed in Doha for weeks pushing for an agreement. He was joined in recent days by Steve Witkoff, President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, who focused on ensuring the deal was finalized before Trump’s inauguration. The two negotiators split responsibilities, with McGurk handling the deal’s technical details, while Witkoff emphasized Trump’s push for a completed deal. Notably, Witkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, with McGurk joining by phone. Once the agreement was announced, both Biden and Trump claimed credit, reflecting the ongoing tensions between the two. However, the deal ultimately allows both men to claim victory, providing Biden with a much-needed positive news story as he prepares to leave office with his lowest approval ratings, and boosting Trump’s standing ahead of his second inauguration. The reality of the deal’s origins is nuanced. Biden administration officials say momentum began before the election, following a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah. The final agreement with Hamas closely mirrored a proposal Biden had put forward in May but was unable to finalize. Speaking earlier this month at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, Witkoff said Biden’s team was the 'tip of the spear' in the talks. 'No one has pride of authorship. We are totally outcome-oriented. Let’s get them home,' Witkoff, a former real estate investor, said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even Biden officials acknowledged that Trump’s election victory spurred the deal’s finalization after months of stalled talks. Trump, monitoring developments from Florida, quickly declared the agreement was only possible because of his win. 'This EPIC cease-fire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,' Trump wrote on social media. Biden was more measured in his response. 'It’s a very good afternoon,' he said Wednesday from the White House Cross Hall, where members of the incoming Trump team were meeting with Biden’s officials. Describing the deal’s negotiations as 'one of the toughest' he had ever faced, Biden noted that his team had been 'speaking as one' with Trump’s team. Asked who deserved credit for the deal, Biden shot back: 'Is that a joke?' before walking away. By the final stretch of the 2024 presidential campaign, few within the White House believed a deal could be reached before the election results were known. Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, were seen as waiting to assess which U.S. president they would be working with. Despite hours of tense phone calls between the White House and Netanyahu’s office, progress was limited. Even the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar failed to prompt an agreement. Trump’s victory, seen by many as Netanyahu’s preferred outcome, led some in Biden’s team to seize a new opportunity. During a post-election meeting at the Oval Office, Biden asked Trump to work with his team to secure the release of the hostages. 'We’re prepared to work with the incoming team in common cause on a bipartisan basis to do everything in our collective American power to secure the release of the hostages, both living and deceased,' Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in the days following the election. The timing of the agreement benefited both men. Trump’s advisers believed a deal reached before he took office would allow him to take credit for it while relieving him of the issue as he focused on his second term’s priorities. For Biden, securing a hostage deal after years of effort would validate the political capital spent on the issue. With both leaders’ support, the final push was on. A key hurdle in the final months was Hamas’ refusal to disclose the number or identity of hostages it would release. U.S. officials made clear no deal could be struck without full transparency. By late December, Hamas agreed to provide the list, pushing talks into high gear. McGurk remained in Doha, working to finalize the complex details, including the timing of prisoner releases. Negotiations continued into the early hours, with American, Israeli, Qatari, Egyptian and Hamas officials working to overcome last-minute demands. As the agreement neared reality, Netanyahu called both Trump and Biden to thank them. His first call was to Trump to arrange a meeting in Washington, followed by a call to Biden to express his gratitude, according to a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjddaa8v1l	2025-01-16T12:09:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/16/SyudaiIP1g/SyudaiIP1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Rome's chief rabbi criticizes Pope Francis over Israel remarks	Rome's chief Jewish rabbi on Thursday sharply criticized Pope Francis over the pontiff's recent ramping up of criticism against Israel's military campaign in Gaza, in an unusually forceful speech during an annual Catholic-Jewish dialogue event. Francis has unfairly focused his attention on Israel compared to other ongoing world conflicts, including those in Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Ethiopia, said Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni, spiritual leader of Rome's Jewish community since 2001. 'Selective indignation weakens the pope's strength,' said Di Segni. 'A pope cannot divide the world into children and stepchildren and must denounce the sufferings of all,' he said. 'This is exactly what the Pope does not do.' Francis, leader of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church, has recently been more outspoken about Israel's military campaign against Palestinian militant group Hamas. Last week, he called the humanitarian situation in Gaza 'very serious and shameful.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1eqkkvv1x	2025-01-16T11:19:31-08:00

Putin and Pezeshkian are set to sign a long-awaited strategic cooperation agreement on Friday in a move likely to worry the West, which sees both countries as malign influences on the world stage. A Kremlin statement on the eve of the meeting said relations between Moscow and Tehran were 'on the rise and are being developed intensively on the basis of mutual respect and taking account of (their) interests.' The statement said the leaders were likely to discuss key issues, specifically Middle East developments, including in Syria and in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Also on the agenda were events in the Caucasus region and Iran's nuclear program.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byomfywdjg	2025-01-16T11:17:21-08:00	
Basketball arena briefly closed off ahead of Paris v Maccabi Tel ...	Police closed off the Adidas Arena ahead of a Euroleague basketball game between Paris and Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv on Thursday because of a suspicious package outside the stadium. A police officer told Reuters that no one was allowed inside the security perimeter while a dog was sent in to sniff a food delivery package that had been left on a bike. The package was destroyed on site and spectators were allowed inside the security perimeter after half an hour. 'There was nothing in there,' a police officer told Reuters.'It was a preventive measure.' The Euroleague Round 22 match was already classified as high-risk by the French National Division for the Fight against Hooliganism (DNLH), part of the Ministry of the Interior, due to security concerns linked to ongoing geopolitical tensions. On the Place Stalingrad south of the Arena, dozens gathered to protest against the game being held, while several others celebrated the cease-fire.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjd2vjww1g	2025-01-16T11:14:50-08:00	
Hostage release likely pushed to Monday, will coincide with Trump...	Deal has been officially announced, and prisoners to be released identified, but prime minister won't convene cabinet until every i dotted and t crossed; With Cabinet meeting likely delayed until Saturday night, release of first hostages delayed as well The last-minute crisis toward the cease-fire and hostage-release deal has been resolved, but the government meeting to approve the deal has been delayed, as well as the first round of hostage releases. Israeli officials said Thursday evening that the crisis surrounding the identity of the Palestinian terrorists who will be released in the hostage deal has been resolved. 'There is a deal,' they announced. However, a political source later stated that a final agreement has not yet been reached and, contrary to previous estimates, the government will not meet Friday to approve the deal, but only on Saturday night. This means that the cease-fire and the first release of the hostages will not begin on Sunday as planned, but only on Monday. Monday is the day that President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in - a date he himself declared as the deadline for the release of the hostages. Trump will be sworn in at 7:00 p.m. Israeli time. According to the agreement, the first three hostages will be released on the first day of the deal's implementation, and four more will be released on the seventh day. Senior Israeli officials said Thursday evening that it is likely that if a 'final green light' is received from the team continuing talks in Doha, the political-security cabinet will convene Friday to approve the deal, but according to the officials, there will not be enough time for another required meeting of the government plenum, and therefore the first release of kidnapped women can only take place on Monday. Friday's cabinet meeting is expected to be very long, and for this reason it was preferable postpone the government meeting until Saturday evening. Only after that will the list of Palestinian prisoners who will be released be published, and an additional period of time will be given for petitions to the High Court against the release of individual terrorists. It is impossible to petition the High Court at the end of the week, so even convening the government after the Sabbath will not change the course of events, and only on Saturday evening will it be possible to begin the appeal process, which they hope to shorten from 48 hours to 24 hours. The political source claimed that there is still no final conclusion and therefore there is still no official decision on convening the cabinet and government. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu is adamant on finalizing all the details of the agreement before he brings it to the cabinet and government for approval,' the political source said. 'This is how he firmly opposed Hamas' demand to change the deployment of our forces on the Philadelphi Corridor and this is how he firmly stands against other demands from Hamas today, which deviate from the understandings reached during the negotiations. It seems that this insistence is bearing fruit, but until things are fully agreed upon, Prime Minister Netanyahu will not convene the cabinet and government,' he added. Despite the apparent postponement, the Israeli delegation in Doha, the capital of Qatar, is expected to return to Israel in the coming hours. The cabinet and government meeting was first supposed to take place Thursday, but was postponed due to disagreements that emerged at the last minute over the deal. In the background is also the coalition crisis that threatens the Netanyahu government, and on Thursday evening, Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir announced that he and his whole party would resign from the government over the deal. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also opposes the deal, but is not yet threatening immediate resignation and is demanding the resumption of fighting immediately after the end of the first phase as a condition for his remaining in the government. Shas Chairman Aryeh Deri announced earlier this evening that he had received 'a final announcement that all obstacles have been overcome, and the hostage deal is underway.' According to Deri, who congratulated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the agreement, 'the parties are now busy with the final technical wording.' Deri, who spoke at the annual Shas conference in Jerusalem, also addressed the widespread opposition to the deal in the coalition, saying: 'I understand the opposition, I feel this pain, it's not easy to release murderers, but we all know what the commandment of ransoming captives is. We grew up in the seminary of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and we know how important the commandment of ransoming captives was for him.' Deri's remarks came against the backdrop of a dispute that emerged at the last minute over the identities of the terrorists who would be released – including prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment. The parties argued over who is defined as 'symbolic' – serious terrorists that Hamas has a great interest in releasing, and that Jerusalem does not wish to include in the deal. The BBC reported that Hamas tried at the last minute to include the names of two 'symbolic' terrorists imprisoned in Israel, so that they would be released as part of the deal. According to the report, this is an effort by the terrorist organization to project an 'image of victory' and restore its popularity in the Gaza Strip, which was 'significantly affected' by the events of the war, after many Palestinians – including in Gaza – said that Hamas was responsible for their suffering following the October 7 massacre. At the same time, a Hamas source told the Quds TV network, which belongs to the terrorist organization: 'The differences and interpretations that were reversed regarding some of the provisions of the cease-fire agreement have been resolved.' He said that the final agreement will be signed this evening. Behind the scenes, a Shin Bet 'battle' was underway in the last dramatic hours over the names of the prisoners who would be released - or, more importantly, who would not be released. Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and his team in Doha sat with the lists and insisted on hours-long discussions with the mediators about each and every name. Their goal was that the list would not include terrorists who were a veto from the Shin Bet's perspective, such as symbols or figures who could immediately influence the area, rehabilitate Hamas, or inspire terrorism. This is why the Israeli delegation was delayed in Doha, and this is what made it possible to move forward during the day and arrive towards the closing. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another dispute concerned the question of presence on the Philadelphi Corridor, where, according to the prime minister's spokesman, Omer Dostri, the differences of opinion concerned changes demanded by Hamas in the way forces would be deployed along the axis during the cease-fire. Israel had earlier estimated that the crisis would be resolved. 'This is nothing more than last-minute arm-twisting,' said an Israeli official. The deal, he clarified, is 'irreversible.' White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also said earlier that he was confident that the release of hostages could begin on Sunday, although 'there are still some details that need to be worked out, and we are working very hard on them right now.' A US official later told Reuters that both Biden’s envoy to the region, Brett McGurk, and Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, were still in Doha, working to resolve the dispute. Meanwhile, an embarrassing incident occurred this evening at Secretary of State Anthony Blinken's briefing on the hostage deal, during which reporters stormed in. 'Criminal! You belong in The Hague,' shouted Sam Husseini, an independent journalist and longtime critic of Washington's approach to the world. He was removed by security guards while continuing to shout. Blinken was interrupted twice more, and one of the reporters shouted at him: ''Why did you keep the bombs flowing when we had a deal in May?' Blinken also expressed confidence in the briefing that the agreement would be implemented on Sunday, noting that he and other officials were working to resolve the remaining issues. 'It’s not surprising that in the process, in negotiations that have been so complicated, there would be problems. We are working to resolve that right now.' He added that the deal needed to be fully implemented, and called for a plan to be completed that would provide Gaza with an interim government, security and reconstruction — and also ensure that the fighting does not resume. 'It will take a lot of effort, political courage and compromise to make that possible, to try to ensure that the gains that we have made over the last 15 months at tremendous and excruciating cost are actually fixed,' he said. Over 70% of Israelis support deal A new poll conducted by the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) shows that over 70% of Israelis support the hostage deal and a normalization arrangement with Saudi Arabia, including a path to separation from the Palestinians. An absolute majority of 72.5% of the entire Israeli population indicated that they would support a political plan by incoming President Donald Trump that includes the return of the hostages, an end to the war, normalization with Saudi Arabia, a moderate coalition against Iran, and a path to separation from the Palestinians. Only 14.5% of Israeli society as a whole indicated that they would oppose such a plan. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1hnq08pkx	2025-01-16T11:04:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/r18Ig3bPyl/r18Ig3bPyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Ben-Gvir threatens resignation over proposed hostage deal, calls ...	This deal will erase the progress we have made and bring an end to the fighting' Ben-Gvir said National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir denounced the emerging hostage deal in a Thursday night press conference, calling it a 'reckless agreement' and threatening to exit the coalition. Ben-Gvir criticized the proposed deal for including a withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor and halting military operations, warning it would undermine the war's achievements and fail to secure the release of all remaining hostages. 'This deal will erase the progress we have made and bring an end to the fighting,' Ben-Gvir said. 'If the agreement is approved, we will submit letters of resignation and no longer be part of the government.' He added that his faction would only rejoin the coalition if military operations resumed with the clear goal of achieving decisive victory and fulfilling the war's objectives. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Prior to the announcement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's confidant, Natan Eshel, announced that Ben-Gvir has resigned from the government. Ben-Gvir has been threatening to resign from the government if the hostage deal reached between Israel and Hamas goes ahead, and even suggested that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich join him in the move. Ben-Gvir's statement comes in the shadow of the crisis in the negotiations after the deal was approved Wednesday night, but senior sources said that 'there was no political connection to the crisis. There were issues on which Hamas tried to squeeze out a few additional concessions - and was rebuffed. Regarding the schedule of discussions, it is likely that if we receive a final green light from the team in Doha, there will be a cabinet discussion on Friday and a government discussion on Saturday night. After that, there will be 24 hours for petitions to the High Court of Justice, and on Monday the implementation of the agreement will begin.' On Tuesday, after the breakthrough in the talks, Ben Gvir went on the attack and said that this was a 'surrender deal to Hamas,' and called on Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to resign from the government if it was approved. 'Otzma Yehudit alone does not have the ability to prevent the surrender deal,' he said at the time.

Ben-Gvir threatens resignation over proposed hostage deal, calls ...	National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir denounced the emerging hostage deal in a Thursday night press conference, calling it a 'reckless agreement' and threatening to exit the coalition. Ben-Gvir criticized the proposed deal for including a withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor and halting military operations, warning it would undermine the war's achievements and fail to secure the release of all remaining hostages. 'This deal will erase the progress we have made and bring an end to the fighting,' Ben-Gvir said. 'If the agreement is approved, we will submit letters of resignation and no longer be part of the government.' He added that his faction would only rejoin the coalition if military operations resumed with the clear goal of achieving decisive victory and fulfilling the war's objectives.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byjc6auw1g	2025-01-16T10:28:26-08:00

Journalists berate Blinken over Gaza policy at his final press co...	Several journalists who are outspoken critics of U.S. support for Israel loudly lambasted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken over the war in Gaza on Thursday, repeatedly interrupting his final press conference as he sought to defend his handling of the 15-month-old conflict. 'Criminal! You belong in The Hague,' shouted Sam Husseini, an independent journalist and longtime critic of Washington's approach to the world. The unusually confrontational scene in the State Department briefing room only ended when security personnel forcibly picked up Husseini and carried him out of the room as he continued to heckle Blinken. 'Why did you keep the bombs flowing when we had a deal in May?' Max Blumenthal, editor of the Grayzone, an outlet that strongly criticizes many aspects of U.S. foreign policy, called out to Blinken, before he was escorted out. Blinken, who leaves office on Monday when the administration of President-elect Donald Trump takes over, calmly asked for quiet while he delivered his remarks, and later took questions from reporters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjv8pcivye	2025-01-16T10:06:06-08:00

Russia demands Hamas fulfill promise: 'We expect the release of S...	Russian Foreign Ministry officials spoke with senior figures in the terrorist organization, demanding the release of the hostage, who holds Russian citizenship; 'The question of his speedy return was raised during our regular contacts'; Moscow welcomed the deal, saying: 'We believe that the agreement will contribute to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital' Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday that Moscow 'expects the release of hostage Sasha Trupanov from Gaza as part of the deal.' Russia welcomed the cease-fire and hostage release deal , and Zakharova noted that 'the question of his speedy return home was raised during our regular contacts with Hamas representatives.' Alex (Sasha) Trupanov, 29, who holds Russian citizenship, was kidnapped on October 7 along with his mother Yelena, his grandmother Irena, and his girlfriend Sapir Cohen from the family home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The three women were released in the hostage deal in late November 2023, after 54 and 55 days in captivity. Sasha's father, Vitaly, was murdered in the Hamas massacre. Sasha was included in the list published by the terrorist organization earlier this month under the humanitarian category, but at this time a final list of hostages expected to be released in the deal has not been published. Islamic Jihad has released several videos of Trupanov from captivity, the last of which was about two months ago . In the previous video, also released in November, Trupanov addressed his family and spoke about the difficulty of his long stay in captivity . He said at the time that 'for a whole year my life has been in danger. My life has been in danger mainly because of the military efforts that are supposed to free us. The only good thing they did for the prisoners was the first cease-fire.' However, it should be noted that it is likely that the things said in the videos were dictated by the captors as part of the psychological terror of the terrorist organizations in Gaza. Russia has received assurances from Hamas, and wants to make sure that Trupanov is included in the current deal. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov personally spoke with the deputy head of the terrorist organization's political bureau, Mousa Abu Marzook. A few days earlier, he also spoke with the head of Hamas' political bureau abroad, Khaled Meshaal. According to Russia, the Palestinians expressed their appreciation in the talks for Moscow's consistent efforts to guarantee the rights of the Palestinian people, as well as its position on the issue. The senior officials shared the Russian deputy minister's talks on a cease-fire early in the negotiations, and Bogdanov asked them to ensure Trupanov's release from captivity. The Russian Foreign Ministry statement after the deal was reached stated that 'Russia praises the work of the Qatari and Egyptian mediators. Their diplomatic efforts deserve the highest appreciation and, at the final stage, representatives of the new American administration also joined the marathon of negotiations. We expect that the implementation of the current agreement will contribute to stabilizing the situation in Gaza, create conditions for the temporary return of the displaced, and enable the start of reconstruction work on what was destroyed in the war. Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners will be reunited with their families, and we hope that the implementation of the agreement will be an important practical step toward long-term normalization of the Israeli-Palestinian issue, and create conditions for recovery in the entire Middle East, including in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.'

'Its ultimate goal is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, while living in peace and security with Israel. We are convinced that there is no logical alternative to this approach, only the implementation of a two-state formula, which will be approved by the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, will help the people of the Middle East break the cruel cycle of violence and establish a sustainable peace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b15czr8w1l	2025-01-16T09:52:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/23/rJ11SyrEMa/rJ11SyrEMa_1_59_574_323_0_small.jpg
Rafael inks major deal to supply Iron Dome missiles to Israel usi...	Deal will see Rafael supply a substantial number of interceptors to the IDF, and the package includes $5.2 billion earmarked specifically for enhancing Israel's air defense capabilities The Defense Ministry signed a contract with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to expand the serial production of Iron Dome interceptors. This move, funded by a portion of the recently approved $8.7 billion U.S. aid package for Israel, aims to bolster the country’s air defense systems, including the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and the advanced 'Iron Beam' laser system currently under development. The deal signed on Wednesday will see Rafael supply a substantial number of interceptors to the IDF, and the package includes $5.2 billion earmarked specifically for enhancing Israel's air defense capabilities. Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir praised the agreement. 'The Iron Dome contract is a cornerstone in an unprecedented effort led by the Defense Ministry, Rafael and other defense industries to strengthen Israel’s capabilities while engaged in combat,' he said. 'This was made possible by the U.S. aid package finalized in Washington, and we deeply appreciate the American administration’s support,' Zamir noted.

Paris theater shut down after occupation by hundreds of migrants	The Gaîté Lyrique Theatre in Paris faces bankruptcy as 300 migrants continue a forced occupation, halting operations and causing financial losses; Local authorities appeal to President Macron for intervention, with no housing solutions yet found for the stranded migrants The Gaîté Lyrique Theatre, located in Paris's 3rd arrondissement and built on the ruins of the historic Théâtre de la Gaîté, is on the brink of bankruptcy. The crisis began five weeks ago when approximately 250 migrants, invited to attend a free event, refused to leave the premises and have been occupying the building ever since. The theater, known for its alignment with radical left-wing circles, regularly hosts performances, exhibitions and installations that reflect these values. On December 10, 2024, the theater held an event titled 'Reinventing the Reception of Migrants in France,' which featured speakers from various universities, representatives from the Red Cross, and 250 migrants from African countries, warmly welcomed by activists organizing the event. However, after the event concluded, the invited migrants refused to vacate the premises. Over the past five weeks they have been occupying the theater, preventing scheduled performances and bringing the theater to the verge of financial collapse. All performances have been canceled through January 24. In a statement, the theater's management revealed that the number of migrants occupying the space has since risen to 300. They noted that 'sanitary conditions are deteriorating daily, and staff are left to handle the situation alone.' Management called on authorities to find housing solutions for the migrants but added: 'Although the occupation is forced, it is unthinkable for the Gaîté Lyrique to cast these people into the streets in the dead of winter.' Meanwhile, the Paris City Council has stated that no alternative solutions have been found for the migrants and has demanded that President Emmanuel Macron's government intervene to resolve the crisis. The financial damage to the theater is estimated at several hundred thousand euros so far. > Local businesses are also feeling the strain. The manager of a nearby bistro told the British Daily Mail: 'They are destroying my business. They hang around my terrace all day, smoking joints and fighting among themselves. Passersby are frightened by all these young men.' The occupation is reportedly being led by the 'Belleville Park Youth Collective' (Collectif des Jeunes du Parc de Belleville), which claims that the migrants are minors and therefore cannot be evicted. The group has declared the theater occupation a turning point in their 'anti-racist and anti-colonialist struggle.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkm4us8d1e	2025-01-16T09:13:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/15/rybGJM11rvkx/rybGJM11rvkx_294_0_1536_864_0_small.jpg
Teen from south who planned to join ISIS indicted	16-year-old resident of southern Israel charged with security offenses after an investigation by Shin Bet and police revealed he planned to join the Islamic State and was planning to prepare explosive devices for terror attacks. Indictment says he planned to 'establish a terror cell in Israel that would carry out attacks against Jews' The Southern District Attorney's Office filed an indictment Thursday against a 16-year-old resident of southern Israel for security offenses. A joint statement by the Shin Bet and police spokespersons reported that the teen planned to join ISIS and had begun to prepare explosive devices for terrorist activity. Shin Bet forces and police arrested the teenager, an Israeli citizen, two and a half weeks ago on suspicion of committing security offenses inspired by terrorist organizations. During the investigation, it emerged that he identifies with and supports the Islamic State (ISIS) organization, and that he was extensively invested in the organization's content and its extremist ideology. The investigation revealed that he planned to join ISIS, and was both thinking of joining the organization's ranks in combat arenas outside the country or alternatively of establishing a terror cell inside Israel that would carry out attacks against Jews. It also emerged that he had carried out activities to prepare explosives and manufacture charges, as part of the preparation stages for joining the terrorist organization. In addition, numerous documents were found in his possession dealing with the training and method of preparing explosives and charges for terrorist activity. 'This report presents a worrying picture, according to which a minor, an Israeli citizen, consumed extremist ISIS content and saw himself as part of an extremist terrorist organization,' according to the joint statement from the Shin Bet and the police. 'We will continue to act resolutely to detect and prevent terrorist activity, and we will take all measures at our disposal to thwart any activity that endangers the security of the State of Israel.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: This is not the first time that teenage Israeli citizens have been accused of involvement in terrorist activity. Last week, indictments were filed against three teenage residents of Israel's northern triangle area who assisted terrorist operatives in the West Bank, and against another teenager who planned to carry out terrorist activity inspired by ISIS. 'The investigations reveal a worrying picture according to which minors, Israeli citizens, are in direct and continuous contact with terrorist operatives in the West Bank, sharing the extremist ideology of the terrorist operatives as well as their goals, including harming the security forces and citizens of the country,' a Shin Bet official said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy7luaivjx	2025-01-16T09:05:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/27/Hk78cDmjj0/Hk78cDmjj0_0_0_3000_1872_0_small.jpg
WHO calls for international support to fund aid in Gaza after cea...	pra)rlier this week. The U.N. health agency said its member states, donors and the global community, including the private sector, should support both the urgent health needs and the longer-term rebuilding of Gaza's healthcare system. 'The UN cannot deliver the response alone,' said Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, speaking at a virtual press conference on Thursday. Part of the ceasefire deal requires 600 truckloads of humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza every day from when it is due to begin, on Sunday. Peeperkorn said the WHO was ready to deliver, although the 'significant security and political obstacles to delivering aid across Gaza' need to be removed. He urged all parties to uphold the cease-fire deal. Now is the time for member states, donors and the global community to step up and provide flexible funding to enable this swift and effective response for urgent and longer term needs,' he said. He said the costs for rebuilding the health system in Gaza were enormous, estimated at around $3 billion for the next year and $10 billion in the next six or seven years, although these are only early estimates. â€œWHO remains committed to addressing the acute health needs of the people in Gaza now and after the deal takes effect and to support the rebuilding of Gazaâ€™s health system. This will be a massive undertaking. Less than half of Gazaâ€™s hospitals are functional,â€ said the WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Deal is underway': Cabinet, government to meet Friday, hostage r...	Israeli officials announce that crisis over cease-fire and hostage release deal has been resolved; There was a last-minute dispute surrounding Hamas' demand for the release of 'symbolic' murderous terrorists; Now, officials say, 'The deal is irreversible' Last-minute crisis resolved: Israeli officials said Thursday evening that the crisis surrounding the identity of the Palestinian terrorists who will be released in the hostage deal has been resolved and that 'there is a deal'; The cabinet and government will meet Friday to approve the deal, and release of the first hostages is expected to begin as early as Sunday. The sources' comments came minutes after Shas Party Chairman Aryeh Deri also announced that he had received 'a final announcement that all obstacles have been overcome, and the hostage deal is underway.' According to Deri, who congratulated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the agreement, 'the parties are now busy with the final technical wording.' Deri, who spoke at the annual Shas conference in Jerusalem, also addressed the widespread opposition to the deal in the coalition, saying: 'I understand the opposition, I feel this pain, it's not easy to release murderers, but we all know what the commandment of ransoming captives is. We grew up in the seminary of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and we know how important the commandment of ransoming captives was for him.' Deri's remarks came against the backdrop of a dispute that emerged at the last minute over the identities of the terrorists who would be released – including prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment. The parties argued over who is defined as 'symbolic' – serious terrorists that Hamas has a great interest in releasing, and that Jerusalem does not wish to include in the deal. The BBC reported that Hamas tried at the last minute to include the names of two 'symbolic' terrorists imprisoned in Israel, so that they would be released as part of the deal. According to the report, this is an effort by the terrorist organization to project an 'image of victory' and restore its popularity in the Gaza Strip, which was 'significantly affected' by the events of the war, after many Palestinians – including in Gaza – said that Hamas was responsible for their suffering following the October 7 massacre. > Israel had earlier assessed that this was a solvable crisis. 'The crisis will be resolved. This is nothing more than last-minute handwringing,' said an Israeli official earlier in the day. The deal, he clarified, is 'irreversible.' Still, the last-minute dispute led to a postponement of the political-security cabinet meeting scheduled for Thursday to approve the agreement after which another vote is required in the government plenum. It is believed that it is still possible to meet the timeframe set by Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani, namely a cease-fire on Sunday at 12:15 p.m., if the cabinet and government approve the agreement Friday - and then there will be enough time to publish the list of terrorists who will be released and allow for an expedited process of petitions to the High Court of Justice, petitions that it is expected to reject. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjpu002iwkg	2025-01-16T08:00:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/r18Ig3bPyl/r18Ig3bPyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Miles of tunnels and thousands of terrorists: This is what Hamas ...	Hamas still retains undiscovered tunnels, untouched brigades and thousands of terrorists, but much of its leadership has been eliminated; Despite significant IDF successes in Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and across Gaza, the ground campaign is far from over and could continue for years Senior political and military officials are deliberately maintaining an air of ambiguity regarding the aftermath of the agreement reached Wednesday and the continuation of the fight against Hamas following the conclusion of phase two of the cease-fire and hostage-release deal. However, for the commanders involved in the protracted and complex mission, it is clear that further action will be necessary. Despite the conspicuous silence from Israeli authorities, reports from foreign sources – left unchallenged by Jerusalem – and insights from former insiders suggest that Israel has acceded to Hamas' demand for an effective end to the war. The war, which had already largely concluded operationally after maneuvering in Gaza ceased more than six months ago, appears to be formally ending with U.S. assurances provided by both the outgoing and incoming administrations, as well as commitments from Egypt and Qatar. A two-stage process with a fragile cease-fire Under the terms of the agreement, Phase One – spanning about six weeks – will see the release of 33 hostages. A negotiation window will follow this before implementing phase two, likely under a temporary cease-fire. These negotiations carry the risk of collapse, potentially reigniting hostilities sooner than anticipated, with dozens of hostages remaining in captivity. Defense officials believe that Hamas or other rogue groups in Gaza likely will provide justification for resuming combat operations under any scenario, even if phase two is implemented. The IDF plans to withdraw from key areas, including the Netzarim Corridor, the Philadelphi Corridor bordering Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, and the northern bypass corridor between Gaza City, Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia – territory currently under the command of the 162nd Division. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Once the agreement is fully implemented, Israeli forces are expected to remain in a buffer zone extending one to two kilometers on average within Gaza territory. This area, where the IDF has leveled thousands of structures and agricultural fields over the past year, has largely been prepared above ground. Residents of nearby Israeli communities such as Kibbutz Nahal Oz and Moshav Netiv HaAsara now see significantly fewer Palestinian buildings on the horizon than before, particularly in areas like Shijaiyah and Beit Lahia. The remaining task – detecting and destroying tunnels leading to the subterranean barrier along the border – remains a hidden and critical challenge, primarily in southern Gaza. Engineering units from the 143rd Division are engaged in these operations daily, a mission they will continue long after the agreement is implemented. Long-term operations to diminish Hamas Looking ahead, military commanders anticipate years of ground operations in Gaza to scale Hamas back to its original, smaller size – a state comparable to its stature two decades ago, before the Palestinian Authority lost control of Gaza and prior to Israel’s disengagement. Hamas still retains an estimated network of tens of kilometers of tunnels, particularly in central and southern Gaza. These tunnels could be used to restart limited weapons production, conceal thousands of weapons, and hide senior commanders. Key Hamas figures like northern brigade commander Ezzedine Haddad and Rafah brigade commander Mohammed Shabaneh remain at large, poised to play central roles in rebuilding Hamas if given the opportunity. 'You can’t dismantle a terror army that’s been built over 15 to 20 years in a single year,' one experienced brigade commander noted. Hamas has also recruited and armed hundreds of new members, including teenagers, to replenish its ranks. More than 15 months since the war began, Hamas finds itself at an unprecedented military low due to relentless IDF operations. Thousands of Israeli troops have been wounded in action, and over 400 have lost their lives in the campaign. Hamas’s command-and-control capabilities have been severely impaired, its factories for large-scale weapons production destroyed, and many senior leaders eliminated. Yet Hamas continues to mount guerrilla attacks on Israeli troops in areas like Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, launch drones sporadically, produce propaganda videos and maintain control over the local population –a critical factor in its survival. Geographically, Hamas retains two brigades in Nuseirat and al-Bureij in central Gaza, which have been largely untouched – possibly due to the presence of hostages in the area. Additionally, the organization has partially restored military capabilities in Khan Younis, the largest city in Gaza’s south, where the IDF has not operated for over six months. Signs of recovery are also evident in Gaza City itself, north of the Netzarim Corridor, with approximately 100,000 residents still living in its partially ruined neighborhoods. Military officials estimate that response times to new hotspots will be swift – just a few hours to locations like the western edge of the Philadelphi Route or the heart of Sabra neighborhood. However, the human and operational cost of clearing Hamas from these areas remains a pressing concern. The ongoing offensive in Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, which has lasted four months, has already claimed the lives of 60 Israeli soldiers and wounded hundreds, even as brigades like Givati, Nahal, Kfir and 401 Armored achieve significant gains. The IDF does not plan to mobilize the 30,000 soldiers who participated in last year’s peak operations, raising questions about future capacity. In Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, the Nahal Brigade has already cleared large swathes, demolishing hundreds of buildings while uncovering a maze of tunnels. While the IDF projects rapid response times to potential threats, the real challenge lies in the time and cost – both human and material – required to fully neutralize Hamas. As Israel moves forward with the agreement, its military leadership braces for a long and arduous road ahead, one defined by complex operations in a volatile and unforgiving environment. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryr2ssipkl	2025-01-16T07:34:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/15/yk14225577/yk14225577_0_127_1010_569_0_small.jpg

Haifa man arrested after being caught on film brutally killing a ...	In a security camera video circulated on social media, the suspect is seen beating a cat to death near a pet store in Tirat Carmel; Police will ask the Haifa Magistrate's Court to extend his detention A 27-year-old Haifa resident was arrested after he was filmed beating a cat to death near a pet store in Tirat Carmel. Coastal District police from the Tirat Carmel station, with the assistance of the Carmel Area Crime Suppression Unit, arrested the suspect for severely abusing the cat and causing its death in great agony. The shocking incident occurred after the suspect arrived at the pet store and purchased cat food. Upon leaving, he fed one of the street cats that was near the store. When the cat approached the food, the suspect grabbed its tail and slammed its head and body on the floor several times, killing it. The horrific incident, which occurred on Tuesday of this week, was recorded on the store's security camera. The man was identified from store footage, where he paid for cat food using his smartphone shortly before the attack. The video, published on Daniel Amram's Telegram channel, shocked many, who responded on social media and spread the suspect's photo to help the police identify him. Depending on the needs and findings of the investigation, the police will ask the court on Friday to extend his detention. The police investigation revealed that the suspect paid at the store using a credit card. Since the credit card company is prohibited from handing over customer information, due to customer confidentiality, the police turned to the Haifa Magistrate's Court and requested an order forcing the credit card company to hand over the customer information. After the suspect's identity was established, an arrest warrant was issued for him, and he was arrested this afternoon. Eli Nahum, one of the owners of the Nahum Brothers store, next to the place where the man killed the cat, said: 'Around 6 p.m., a passerby came in and told me she saw someone abusing a cat, and it was dying. I went out and found the cat’s body on the ground. Since I was busy with customers, an employee, Regina, coordinated with the bystander to try and help the cat, but it was too late.' Nahum reviewed the store’s security footage and identified the suspect as the same man who had purchased cat food earlier. 'The cat wasn’t from the store; it was one of the stray cats we and others in the area regularly feed. He must have lured it with the food and then killed it in a horrific manner. When I saw the video, I immediately recognized the suspect as the one who bought the food from me,' he said, adding, 'I couldn’t bring myself to watch the entire video.' > Nir Schuber, a Haifa-based animal welfare activist, expressed his shock: 'I was horrified when I heard the story and saw the video. I filed a police complaint this morning, and I know two other women, including a store employee, also filed complaints. This level of cruelty is unthinkable.' Etti Altman, co-founder of the animal welfare organization Let the Animals Live, condemned the attack: 'This is a monstrous act of cruelty against a defenseless cat. This man is a walking menace, and I hope he’s apprehended swiftly, brought to justice and sentenced to a lengthy prison term. Our legal team immediately filed a police complaint upon learning of the incident. Tirat Carmel police seem to be taking this case seriously. Anyone who harms animals poses a real threat to people as well.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj6driivyx	2025-01-16T07:08:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/15/rJjldLSvJg/rJjldLSvJg_61_0_379_213_0_small.jpg

Azerbaijan suspends cooperation with USAID, foreign minister says	Azerbaijan has refused to renew its cooperation agreement with The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov said on Thursday, accusing Washington of using USAID to pursue its political agenda. Bayramov, who was speaking at a news conference with his Georgian counterpart, said that Baku had suspended cooperation with USAID in June 2024. Azerbaijan began criticizing USAID in late 2023 after Samantha Power, the agency's head, said that Azerbaijan's military operation to return its breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh had 'forced more than a hundred thousand people to leave their homes and move into neighboring Armenia.' In response to Power's statement, Hikmet Hajiyev, a foreign policy adviser to President Ilham Aliyev, said that USAID 'has no place in Azerbaijan anymore.' Azerbaijan is not the first country in the post-Soviet space to stop cooperation with USAID.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skszliiv1l	2025-01-16T06:31:16-08:00	
Maritime sources expect Houthis to halt Red Sea attacks after Gaz...	Maritime security officials said on Thursday they were expecting Yemen's Houthi militia to announce a halt in attacks on ships in the Red Sea, after a cease-fire deal in the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. The experts pointed to an email, seen by Reuters, from the group postponing a planned security briefing that had been due to take place in the coming days as a possible signal. The Houthis' leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, is also due to give a speech later on Thursday, as he does most weeks, and speculation has mounted in the region that he may use the occasion to announce a pause off the back of the Gaza deal. The group has carried out more than 100 attacks on ships crossing the Red Sea since November 2023, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. The attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa for more than a year. 'British, American and Israeli strikes have succeeded in significantly limiting the attacks by Houthis, who are looking for a pretext to announce a ceasefire,' Dimitris Maniatis, the chief executive officer of maritime security company Marisks told Reuters regarding the briefing postponement. Another maritime security official said that an announcement was largely expected and there were indications that some companies were preparing to resume Red Sea journeys but it was still too early to say that traffic would be restored. 'The first sign that business returns to normal will be seen in the insurance market, as insurance fees will start decreasing,' the official said. A second maritime official, who also asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said that a halt in attacks was widely expected but was not able to confirm it. In the email seen by Reuters, the Houthis said that the security webinar, aimed at shipping and maritime companies and the first such invitation they had issued, had been postponed to Feb. 10 due to the large number of questions and suggestions received from participants. 'This will ensure that the event is more comprehensive and beneficial for all attendees,' they said in the email on Wednesday.

Israel used Iranian presence to move into Golan buffer zone, Syri...	Ahmed al-Sharaa claimed that Israel used the presence of Iranian militias in Syria as an excuse to advance in the Golan Heights buffer zone, and now 'the pretext is not valid' and Israel should have 'no presence at all' Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, met Thursday with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani. During a news conference, the leaders announced the renewal of relations between the countries, following the overthrow of the Assad regime and the end of the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. Al-Sharaa leads the jihadist organization Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, which led the offensive that defeated the Syrian army and toppled President Bashar Assad. At the press conference, al-Sharaa addressed the situation in the region, saying that 'Israel's advance in the region was due to the presence of Iranian militias and Hezbollah.' He added that 'after the liberation of Damascus, I believe that they have no presence at all. There are pretexts that Israel is using today to advance into the Syrian regions, into the buffer zone' According to al-Julani, 'This excuse is no longer valid after the liberation of Damascus. We are ready to accept international forces in the buffer zone, so that the situation returns to the way it was before the Israeli advance.'

According to him, 'Israel must withdraw' from the territory. 'I am pleased to renew Syria-Qatar relations after a 13-year hiatus,' said the Qatari prime minister. 'We welcome the positive steps taken by the new Syrian government, and we will provide the necessary technical support to renew the infrastructure. We look forward to future partnership.' He added that the 'situation in Syria requires the lifting of sanctions from the country. The Emir of Qatar will visit Syria in the near future.

Undocumented teens in Israel fight to enlist in IDF amid manpower...	Thousands of teens in Israel barred from IDF service due to status, attorneys push for permanent solution A letter sent Wednesday to Defense Minister Israel Katz, Interior Minister Moshe Arbel and Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chair MK Yuli Edelstein has unveiled a proposal to regularize the status of undocumented youths in Israel, enabling them to enlist in the IDF amid a severe manpower shortage. The initiative was described by attorneys Tomer Warsha, chair of the Israel Bar Association’s Immigration Committee, and Asaf Weitzen as 'a national and security necessity of the highest order.' The letter outlined the challenges facing the IDF since the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023. With mass reservist enlistment and the extension of the reserve duty exemption age, defense officials estimate prolonged fighting will necessitate expanding the regular army. Approximately 5,000 undocumented youths aged 15–24 currently reside in Israel and could potentially enlist if their status is resolved. Many of these youths were born in Israel, raised in its education system and feel deeply connected to the country. However, their lack of permanent status prevents them from contributing to national defense. ‘I want to contribute to the country; it’s my duty’ One such youth is 17-year-old Ashley Casao, born in Israel to a Filipino mother. Ashley grew up in Israeli schools, where she learned Zionist values, and dreams of enlisting alongside her cohorts. Despite applying for permanent residency, her temporary status bars her from military service. 'In these challenging times for the State of Israel, I can’t see myself not helping and contributing my part. It’s my duty,' Ashley wrote in her application. 'As someone who grew up here and received so much from this country, I’m part of Israeli society and ask to take part in defending my homeland.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I’m ready to contribute in any way needed, in a combat role or otherwise. I’m ready to contribute in whatever the country or IDF requires with great pride.' ‘I’m ready to serve in any role needed’ The story of Nathan Admaso, 24, from Jerusalem, and his mother, Elizabeth, highlights the complexities and absurdities of Israel’s immigration system. Nathan was born in Israel to a father recognized as a refugee and holding temporary residency (A/5 license). However, when his father left the family and moved to the U.S., Nathan and his mother’s status changed. Elizabeth, a 54-year-old single mother battling diabetes, has raised Nathan alone for over two decades. After a long legal battle, Nathan’s status was reinstated to A/5, yet it still doesn’t permit him to enlist in the military. Nathan, who also grew up and was educated in Israel, sees military service as an opportunity to give back to the country that raised him. 'This is the only country I know,' he said. 'I’m ready to serve in any role needed, but my status denies me the right to contribute.' Warsha and Weitzen emphasized the urgency of addressing these cases, noting that resolving the youths’ statuses could correct a historical injustice while benefiting national security. 'Israel has an opportunity to gain high-quality personnel who will contribute to the country,' Warsha said. 'Time isn’t on our side.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1k9vp8vyg	2025-01-16T05:00:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/31/Hybpk00DDFA/Hybpk00DDFA_0_64_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Smotrich conditions backing first stage of hostage deal on destru...	Finance minister's Religious Zionist faction conditionally backs first phase of hostage deal but demands written guarantees from Netanyahu to resume war to destroy Hamas and secure all hostages; faction warns support hinges on commitments before approval Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich expressed conditional support Thursday for the first phase of the proposed hostage deal, emphasizing that Israel must resume its campaign to eliminate Hamas immediately after. Smotrich insisted that the agreement should not undermine the war's achievements but instead ensure the destruction of Hamas and the safe return of all hostages. He added that the continuation of the war is a prerequisite for his hardline Religious Zionist Party remaining in the coalition. Smotrich has demanded written assurances from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel will resume its military operations in Gaza after the initial phase of the deal, which involves the release of 33 hostages over 42 days. Despite signs from Netanyahu’s office suggesting guarantees could be provided, Smotrich noted that several key issues remain unresolved. The Religious Zionist faction convened earlier Thursday to weigh its future in the coalition and reiterated its opposition to the deal without these commitments. Party members expressed concern that the agreement could harm Israel’s security and weaken its position. 'The faction stands behind the demands of party chairman, Minister Bezalel Smotrich, for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure Israel's return to the war to eliminate Hamas and secure the return of all hostages, with a revised strategy for achieving decisive victory, immediately after the first phase of the deal. This is a condition for the party's continued participation in the government and coalition,' the faction said. After the faction meeting, Smotrich asked the ministers and Knesset members of his party not to give interviews or discuss the content of the meeting. Religious Zionist Party MK Tzvi Succot told public broadcaster Kan Radio on Thursday morning he believes the party is likely to head to the opposition: 'I think the chances are high that we will leave the government,' said the far-right lawmaker, echoing his recent threats on social media that a halt to the war would lead to the party's exit from the coalition. A source familiar with the discussions revealed that Smotrich is deeply conflicted, fearing the deal could tarnish his reputation, much like the political fallout experienced by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, after his support for the 1993 Oslo Accords—a controversial agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: A source familiar with the discussions revealed that Smotrich is deeply conflicted, fearing the deal could tarnish his reputation, much like the political fallout experienced by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, after his support for the 1993 Oslo Accords—a controversial agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Smotrich has publicly opposed the agreement in recent days, which has sparked internal pressure on him to quit the coalition. 'Smotrich is in a very difficult position,' a senior official explained the challenge. 'Unlike [Itamar] Ben-Gvir, who thrives on provocations, Smotrich is driven by ideology. For him, this is a matter of conscience.' Smotrich has publicly opposed the deal in the past, calling it 'a bad and dangerous agreement for Israel's national security.' Following a meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he said, 'While there is great joy and excitement over the return of every hostage, this deal undoes many achievements of the war, where the heroes of this nation risked their lives, and it will tragically cost us more blood.' Smotrich further elaborated on his demands for Netanyahu: 'The cries of our brothers’ blood reach us. A clear condition for our continued participation in the government is absolute certainty of a return to the war—full-scale, intensified and in a new framework—until total victory, including the destruction of Hamas and the return of all hostages. Over the past two days, the prime minister and I have had intensive talks. He knows the detailed demands of the Religious Zionist Party, and the ball is in his court.' Religious Zionist Party members also sharply criticized Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, leader of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party, for supporting the deal. 'When we need to return to Gaza to destroy Hamas, we will be there, not him,' Yehuda Wald, the party's director-general, said. 'When we have to fight in the streets of Nablus and Jenin against released terrorists who carry out attacks, we will be there, not him. And the Rambam's commandment to serve in the army? That’s less relevant for him: 'What is a mandatory war? Saving Israel from an enemy attacking them.' Shameful.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjvgioupkl	2025-01-16T04:08:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/01/ByHRYwXlDA/ByHRYwXlDA_0_58_1280_721_0_small.jpg

No deals with the devil': Bereaved families protest Gaza cease-f...	Families claim deal endangers Israeli national security; demonstration features symbolic coffin installation as families urged government to halt agreement Members of the Gvura Forum of families who lost loved ones fighting in Gaza marched to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem on Thursday morning, vowing to block the entrance in protest against the proposed hostage deal and Gaza cease-fire. The families erected a symbolic installation of coffins draped with Israeli flags at the protest encampment, symbolizing what they call the 'blood price' Israel will pay after the deal. Demonstrators chanted 'A freed terrorist is tomorrow’s murderer' and 'No deals with the devil.' Israel and Hamas announced an agreement on the hostage deal on Wednesday following several days of intense negotiations. Under the deal, 33 hostages will be released in stages over 42 days, and the IDF will adjust its troop deployment in Gaza. On the 16th day of the first stage, discussions will begin on the second phase of the deal. Despite the agreement, technical details remain unresolved. The Israeli negotiation team, led by Mossad Director David Barnea, stayed in Doha overnight to finalize the agreement’s implementation, including finalizing the list of prisoners to be released, which includes convicted terrorists. The protest comes amid Netanyahu’s claim that 'Hamas reneges on parts of the agreement,' which the terror organization has denied. As a result, a Security Cabinet meeting scheduled for 11:00 a.m. to approve the deal was postponed. The meeting was to be followed by a government session where the finalized list of prisoners would have been published. According to Israeli law, the public will have 48 hours to file petitions to the High Court of Justice against the deal and the list of prisoners to be released. The families, joined by supporters, spent Wednesday night outside the Prime Minister’s Office, urging the government to halt the emerging deal with Hamas. Yehoshua Shani, the chairman of Gvura Forum and father of Captain Ori Shani, who fell in combat in the Gaza border region, called on the public to join the protest at 11:00 a.m. in Jerusalem and appealed to Cabinet ministers to block the deal, which he claimed endangers hostages and Israel's security. 'We spent the night here outside the Prime Minister’s Office. It was, of course, hard to sleep out of anxiety for the fate of the hostages and the security of the people of Israel,' Shani said. 'We call on the prime minister and the Cabinet to stop this at the last moment. Don’t sign a deal that amounts to surrender, the abandonment of the remaining hostages, and jeopardizing Israel’s security. Come here before the Cabinet meeting and join us in urging the prime minister not to sign a deal that surrenders to Hamas.' 'This deal will lead to the result symbolized by these coffins, where more and more soldiers will end up in such coffins,' Shani warned. 'Members of the government, it’s in your hands to stop this catastrophe.' David Bohbot, the father of Elkana Bohbot, 35, who was abducted from the Nova music festival on October 7, also voiced frustration: 'We are waiting for good news. How has the Israeli government not brought everyone back in this deal? It’s something I can’t find peace with. After all this time, how is it possible that not everyone is home? I’m disappointed and angry. Everyone needs to be brought home.' Speaking passionately, Bohbot criticized the selective criteria for the deal: 'This selection process determines the fate of people. Such a thing must not happen in Israel. We’re disappointed with the deal, which should have included everyone. If you’re stopping the war—release them all. My son is injured, he has a child at home and he is defined by humanitarian law as a priority. I expect him to be part of this phase. If you’ve set a criterion, you must stick to it.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Yitzhak Pitourim, father of Staff Sgt. Yishay Fitusi who fell on October 7, urged Cabinet members not to 'buy security from external forces.' 'Nineteen years ago, we were promised that we’d be able to act, and then my son returned to fight,' he said, referring to Israel’s disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005. 'History is repeating itself. By agreeing to release hundreds of terrorists, you are creating more bereaved families in Israel. There must be no compromises—neither from Trump nor Biden. This deal will not bring anyone back later.' Wally Wollfstal, father of Capt. Ariel Wollfstal, who died in the January 2024 Gaza building collapse disaster, expressed his anguish: 'I never imagined my son would return in a coffin. Today, we stand in front of 50 symbolic coffins representing soldiers who may be killed. I call on the prime minister and the Cabinet—ask yourselves, is this what we want? We want all the hostages home. I have two sons still serving in the reserves, and I want them healthy and safe, not in these coffins. You promised to destroy Hamas and secure the Philadelphi Corridor. Even in Gaza, we can win this war.' Ya’akov, father of Sergeant Major (res.) Yossi Hershkovitz, who was killed by an explosive device in a booby-trapped tunnel shaft in Gaza in November 2023, added: 'A 42-year-old man went to war. Perhaps they were naïve to think that returning the hostages would end the humiliation of this nation. If the Israeli government knew four months ago that this was its plan, why did they send more soldiers? Who benefited from this? We must continue until everyone is home. Who says that those who remain captive today will be released tomorrow or the day after? There are no guarantees.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syvumwlvke	2025-01-16T03:15:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/16/rJtNmdrUvyg/rJtNmdrUvyg_0_0_1280_853_0_small.jpg

The Shin Bet security agency and police announced Thursday morning the indictment of a 16-year-old from southern Israel for planning to join Islamic State (IS) and preparing explosive devices for terror activity.

The investigation revealed that he intended to join IS forces abroad or, alternatively, establish a terrorist cell in Israel to carry out attacks against Jews. Evidence showed he actively worked to produce explosive materials and devices.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skhb11dlvjx	2025-01-16T01:36:24-08:00	
Netanyahu accuses Hamas of reneging on hostage deal terms	PM accuses terror group of introducing last-minute demands to release life-sentenced prisoners, delaying Cabinet meeting to approve hostage deal; Israel has vetoed release of high-profile figures and remains firm on negotiated terms Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office claimed Thursday morning Hamas had made last-minute demands to release life-sentenced prisoners as part of a deal to release hostages held in Gaza, which Israel vetoed as part of the agreement. 'Hamas reneges on parts of the agreement reached with the mediators and Israel in an effort to extort last-minute concessions,' a statement read, explaining delays in convening the Cabinet, which was scheduled to meet on Thursday at 11 a.m. 'The Israeli cabinet will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement. Hamas denied the allegations, with Izzat al-Rishq, a senior political bureau member, asserting, 'Hamas remains committed to the cease-fire agreement announced by the mediators.' Sami Abu Zuhri, another senior Hamas figure, dismissed Netanyahu's claims, urging both the current and incoming U.S. administrations to pressure Israel to implement the deal. The Hostages and Missing Persons Directorate in the Prime Minister’s Office released a statement parallel to Netanyahu’s, notifying hostage families that Hamas had introduced demands conflicting with the agreement. 'As of now, the details of the agreement have not been finalized, and the negotiation team continues its efforts to reach a solution. Therefore, no official announcement on the success of the negotiations or a Cabinet meeting has been issued,' the statement said. A senior Israeli official refuted reports claiming Israel would leave the Philadelphi Corridor as part of a potential deal with Hamas. 'Contrary to misleading publications, Israel is not leaving the Philadelphi Corridor. Israel will remain fully deployed throughout Phase I, covering all 42 days. The size of the forces will remain unchanged but will be redistributed—encompassing outposts, patrols, observation points and control along the entire route,' the official said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'During Phase I, starting on Day 16, negotiations to end the war will begin. If Hamas does not agree to Israel's demands to achieve the war's objectives, Israel will remain on the Philadelphi Corridor beyond Day 42 and into Day 50. In practice, Israel will remain in Philadelphi until further notice.' The cabinet was scheduled to meet at 11 a.m., followed by a government session to approve the deal, but delays are expected amid ongoing disputes and the possibility that the far-right Otzma Yehudit and Religious Zionist parties could leave the coalition. 'The Cabinet and government will convene only when the team in Doha recommends doing so,' a source familiar with the situation said. 'For now, that hasn’t happened. Resolving this depends on Qatar's pressure on Hamas.' Overnight, Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying he held a conference call with the negotiation team in Doha. The team reported last-minute attempts by Hamas to renege on the agreement. 'Contrary to an explicit clause granting Israel veto power over the release of high-profile terrorists, Hamas is demanding the right to dictate their identities,' the statement read. Netanyahu instructed the team to insist on the agreed-upon terms and to reject Hamas' last-minute extortion attempts outright. Hamas is demanding the release of prisoners serving life sentences, whom Israel has vetoed as part of ongoing negotiations. Among those Israel refuses to release are former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti, serving five life sentences, and the killers of a Jewish family in a 2011 attack, whose release Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesperson, Omer Dostri, denied would be included in the deal. Although vetoed prisoners like Barghouti will not be part of the agreement, the first phase of the deal includes the release of 290 prisoners serving life sentences and an additional 1,687 prisoners and detainees. The exact numbers depend on how many of the 33 hostages held by Hamas for over 15 months return alive in the first phase of the agreement. At first, Israel resisted releasing prisoners in exchange for hostages presumed dead, but eventually agreed to a limited compromise. Under the terms, convicted terrorists will not return to the West Bank but will be exiled to third countries such as Qatar, Turkey or Algeria. Prisoners who are not serving time for the murder of Israelis may return to their homes in the West Bank. Additionally, Israel is preparing to transfer the bodies of Palestinian terrorists back to Gaza. In total, the deal includes 210 minors and women in exchange for five civilian hostages and two children from the Bibas family. For five captive female soldiers, Israel will release 150 prisoners serving life sentences and 100 others. For nine injured and ill hostages, 110 prisoners serving life sentences will be freed. For 10 elderly hostages, 30 prisoners serving life sentences and 270 others will be released. The deal also includes the release of 60 prisoners and 47 recaptured Shalit deal prisoners for the return of Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, as well as 1,000 Palestinians arrested since October 8, 2023, who were not involved in the October 7 massacre. Hamas is also pressing for the release of some of the most notorious terrorists, including Ibrahim Hamed, mastermind of multiple suicide bombings during the Second Intifada; Abbas al-Sayyid, planner of the 2002 Park Hotel bombing in Netanya; Abdullah Barghouti, serving 67 life sentences; and Ahmed Saadat, secretary-general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who orchestrated the 2001 assassination of Minister Rehavam Ze'evi. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywwc88p1e	2025-01-16T01:27:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/16/BkqI2HUw1g/BkqI2HUw1g_0_248_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Iran says Gaza cease-fire agreement is a 'defeat for Israel'	Khamenei accuses Israel of 'murdering thousands women and children in Gaza' and praises Palestinian resistance for making IDF 'retreat' Iran made extensive efforts on Thursday to portray Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist factions as victorious in the Gaza war, referring to the expected cease-fire agreement to be signed today as a 'defeat for Israel.' Amid the severe blows Tehran and its allies suffered in recent months, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei claimed that history would remember Israel as a murderer of women and children. 'History books will say there was a group that murdered thousands of children and women in Gaza! Nevertheless, in the end, everyone will understand that the steadfastness of the Palestinian people, the Palestinian resistance and the resistance front forced the Zionist entity to retreat,' he wrote on X in Hebrew. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps praised the cease-fire agreement, describing it as a 'victory' for the Palestinians and a 'defeat' for Israel: 'The end of the war and the imposition of a cease-fire are a clear and great victory for Palestine and an even greater defeat for the monstrous Zionist regime,' the statement read. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf added that the agreement 'prevented the Zionist regime from achieving its strategic goal.' He called for action to 'punish the Zionist regime and heal the wounds of the Palestinian nation.' During the first year of the war, Iran exhibited great confidence in its power, appearing at times to achieve a significant strategic victory through the 'ring of fire' it established around Israel, which was operated from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Gaza and the West Bank following the October 7 attack. However, Iran has since suffered a series of setbacks. The massive Israeli assault on Lebanon decimated much of Hezbollah’s strength, pro-Iranian militias in Iraq decided to cease fire and Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria was overthrown. Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination in Tehran was a particularly humiliating blow for Iran. Israel’s extensive airstrike campaign, which incapacitated its defense systems following Iran's direct missile launches at Israel, has also left Iran exposed to future attacks and is now seen as greatly weakened. Against this backdrop, Iran is set to sign a strategic partnership agreement with Russia in Moscow on Friday.

Smotrich’s party threatens coalition exit over Gaza cease-fire de...	Finance minister's hardline Religious Zionist Party weighing future in coalition government following Gaza hostage deal and cease-fire; party members demand guarantees from Netanyahu to resume war Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's hardline Religious Zionist Party convened Thursday morning to decide its future in the government following the announcement of the hostage deal and cease-fire in Gaza. MK Tzvi Succot told public broadcaster Kan Radio he believes the party is likely to head to the opposition: 'I think the chances are high that we will leave the government,' said the far-right lawmaker, echoing his recent threats on social media that a halt to the war would lead to the party's exit from the coalition. 'Stopping the war is a step backward. We are in discussions with the prime minister to secure guarantees that the war will continue and are awaiting answers. The government is not just a tool to achieve goals—it becomes unacceptable only when a red line is crossed that you cannot live with.' A source familiar with the discussions revealed that Smotrich is deeply conflicted, fearing the deal could tarnish his reputation, much like the political fallout experienced by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, after his support for the 1993 Oslo Accords—a controversial agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Smotrich has publicly opposed the agreement in recent days, which has sparked internal pressure on him to quit the coalition. Despite optimism in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's camp following a meeting with Smotrich on Wednesday, tensions remain high. 'Smotrich is in a very difficult position,' a senior official explained the challenge. 'Unlike [Itamar] Ben-Gvir, who thrives on provocations, Smotrich is driven by ideology. For him, this is a matter of conscience.' 'Everything hinges on agreements between Netanyahu and Smotrich,' a Religious Zionist Party source said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Smotrich’s brother Tuvia sent him an open letter, writing: 'The feeling is that perhaps we established a state, have an army and even said 'never again,' but history will still ask why we didn’t bomb Auschwitz. I want to believe there is real hope behind your decision to stay in the government because the world has become a less safe place for our children today. Love you.' Religious Zionist Party members also sharply criticized Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, leader of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party, for supporting the deal. 'When we need to return to Gaza to destroy Hamas, we will be there, not him,' Yehuda Wald, the party's director-general, said. 'When we have to fight in the streets of Nablus and Jenin against released terrorists who carry out attacks, we will be there, not him. And the Rambam's commandment to serve in the army? That’s less relevant for him: 'What is a mandatory war? Saving Israel from an enemy attacking them.' Shameful.' Minister Smotrich has publicly opposed the deal in the past, calling it 'a bad and dangerous agreement for Israel's national security.' Following a meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he said, 'While there is great joy and excitement over the return of every hostage, this deal undoes many achievements of the war, where the heroes of this nation risked their lives, and it will tragically cost us more blood.' Smotrich further elaborated on his demands for Netanyahu: 'The cries of our brothers’ blood reach us. A clear condition for our continued participation in the government is absolute certainty of a return to the war—full-scale, intensified and in a new framework—until total victory, including the destruction of Hamas and the return of all hostages. Over the past two days, the prime minister and I have had intensive talks. He knows the detailed demands of the Religious Zionist Party, and the ball is in his court.' Meanwhile, Religious Services Minister Michael Malchieli from Shas hinted during an interview with ultra-Orthodox radio station Kol Berama that the coalition could unravel if the draft exemption law for Haredi men, a core demand of the ultra-Orthodox parties, is not advanced. 'Netanyahu understands politics, and he knows the significance of this law for the ultra-Orthodox community,' Malchieli said. 'We joined the government for this law, which is a cornerstone for us. The ultra-Orthodox parties will bring down the government if instructed by our rabbis, and Netanyahu knows this law is on the desks of the greatest religious leaders.' Malchieli emphasized the determination to pass a law acceptable to all parties: 'There is great resolve to draft a law that will be accepted by the senior rabbis, the coalition and legal authorities. Alongside [Defense Minister Israel] Katz and [Knesset Security and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Yuli] Edelstein, we aim to propose an agreed-upon law. 'Everyone says Netanyahu understands politics, and this is the lifeblood of the ultra-Orthodox public. We joined the government on the understanding that a draft exemption law would be enacted. We are not a lawbreaking public; we respect the law. We want the Torah study arrangement to be enshrined in law. Torah students do not need the law; they will continue studying because their rabbis instruct them to, but we want it formally recognized as legislation.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkdyi4ipjx	2025-01-15T23:32:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/03/S1eCrct4hR/S1eCrct4hR_0_223_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

After Assad’s fall, ‘forgotten’ Idlib is bustling once again	Those displaced from the northwestern region of Syria are cautiously beginning to return, and the region’s markets are experiencing new life Street vendors shout across narrow alleys, and even in the early morning, crowded streets are bustling with shoppers from all over the country. It’s a scene that would have been unimaginable just two months ago: Idlib, the site of significant fighting and displacement since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war more than a decade ago, is on its way back to being the vibrant city it once was. People have come from all over Syria to visit malls, shops, and relatives in this northwestern governorate. After 10 years away from Syria due to the repression imposed by the deposed Syrian regime and various Islamic factions in the country, this reporter entered Idlib at dawn on January 6, through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing, which separates the Turkish city of Reyhanlı from Syria’s Idlib Governorate. The people there were joyful at the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. These are the first days in nearly 14 years that the area has not witnessed aerial bombardment by the Syrian regime and Russian aircraft. At the entrance to Sarmada, one of the cities in Idlib Governorate, a taxi driver said that markets in the area are seeing significant crowds again after having been paralyzed by bombings. Over 500,000 civilians were killed in the Syrian civil war, and millions were displaced in Syria and beyond. Since 2018, more than 1.5 million civilians have been displaced just from the rural areas of Idlib and Hama, a governorate in west-central Syria. The Islamist rebel group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) controls large parts of Idlib Governorate. Together with various other factions, the rebels succeeded in toppling the Assad regime, which had controlled Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Latakia, Tartus, and parts of eastern Syria. Since the fall of the Syrian regime, Syrians inside the country and in refugee-hosting nations have begun returning home and checking on their properties. Over 160,000 Syrian refugees have returned to Syria from Turkey, Jordan, and Europe. Hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Syrians have also returned to their towns. Abu Hassan, originally from the Idlib Governorate town of Kafr Nabl, is one such Syrian preparing for the return to his hometown. Part of that preparation involves getting fig tree saplings to plant since hundreds of thousands of fruit trees in the town were destroyed by Assad’s soldiers. 'We found our homes completely destroyed and even the trees were cut or burned. Therefore, we must start over from scratch,' he told The Media Line. 'Sadly, those trees they cut were decades old, so we’ll have to wait years again after planting new ones for them to bear fruit.' Khaled, who fled the Idlib Governorate city of Ma'arat al-Nu'man for Damascus, told The Media Line he has no plans to return. His home and shop were destroyed, and he has no means to rebuild either one. While sentiments about resettling in Idlib vary, thousands of Syrians from across the country are flocking to cities in Idlib Governorate like Idlib, Sarmada, and Dana to shop at the cities’ markets. The markets are known to feature a wide variety of goods at low prices. In the markets and across the country, Syrian residents currently use multiple currencies, with the Syrian pound the weakest among them. The city of Idlib was known among Syrians as 'the forgotten Idlib,' a reference to the severe neglect that the city suffered during the rule of Bashar Assad and his father, Hafez Assad. According to locals and researchers, the Assad family abandoned the city ever since the day residents pelted Hafez Assad with tomatoes when he came to visit in the 1980s. On Thursday morning, Khaled and his wife arrived in Idlib to shop. Khaled said that life under Assad was hellish, with exorbitant prices and a severe shortage of goods. 'In Damascus, it was difficult to obtain gas, diesel, or even bread. But these materials are widely available in Idlib,' he said. 'However, it was forbidden for us to visit Idlib before Assad fell. Now, things have become better.' He expressed admiration for the progress and openness he witnessed in Idlib, noting that Damascus lacks much of the development he saw there. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Before the fall of the Assad regime, different forces ruled different regions in Syria, creating the effect of multiple countries in one state. Military checkpoints separated the Assad-regime-controlled areas from those under HTS rule. Similarly, Turkish-backed Syrian National Army checkpoints divided areas in rural Aleppo from other regions, and Kurdish checkpoints separated eastern Syria from the rest of the country. Today, the country is interconnected once again, except for eastern Syria, which remains embroiled in clashes between the Syrian National Army and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led, US-backed group. Idlib’s markets have witnessed a remarkable return to activity, with goods quickly selling out due to the influx of Syrians from all parts of the country. These new shoppers have caused congestion in the markets. 'Like other Syrians, we are working hard because the country is in a phase of rebuilding after years of war' Abu Sateef, a sheep and poultry trader in Sarmada, told The Media Line that prices have improved significantly and that traders are actively purchasing. 'Like other Syrians, we are working hard because the country is in a phase of rebuilding after years of war,' he said. While Syrians like Abu Sateef are calling for the rapid reconstruction of their country, economic experts emphasize that the current stage is still one of restoring trust in the national economy. The cost of reconstructing Syria is estimated to be at least $200 billion. One aspect of rebuilding the country will involve bringing back professionals and skilled laborers, many of whom have fled the country. Children in Idlib after the war Millions of Syrian children have grown up in the areas their families fled to, never knowing the family hometown. But children, too, share in the joy of Assad’s fall. When children at a displacement camp in Idlib were asked about Assad, they immediately responded by calling him a criminal. One child looked at the sky and said, 'Bashar Assad used to kill us with airplanes.' Northwestern Syria hosts 1,633 displacement camps, housing more than 1.8 million people. According to the Syrian Response Coordinators humanitarian organization, many young people in the camps have dropped out of school due to poor living conditions and the economic crisis. More than two-thirds of children in northern Syria are unable to access formal education, and more than 2.1 million children across the country have dropped out of school. Girls and children with disabilities are especially likely to be out of school. Since 2011, nearly 1,200 schools in Syria have been destroyed in airstrikes. Between 2019 and 2022 alone, the Syrian regime forces and allied Russian forces carried out more than 138 attacks on educational facilities in the region. More than 40% of the country’s educational infrastructure was destroyed, depriving hundreds of thousands of children of continuing their education. Across northwestern Syria, 10% of the 1,834 schools are not functional. Around 553,000 children in the region are enrolled in schools, while another 500,000 remain outside the education system. The Syrian educational system operates separately in different regions, with separate curricula for areas that were controlled by Assad, those controlled by the Syrian Salvation Government of HTS, and those controlled by Kurdish forces. The new administration is working to create a unified curriculum after removing books that praise the Assad family and their Baath Party. The 950 public schools in Idlib adhere to curricula approved by the Syrian Salvation Government and are attended by approximately 213,000 students. Male and female students are educated separately, and female students are required to wear Islamic attire. Idlib also has an additional 450 private schools. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1dshvuv1e	2025-01-15T22:40:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/16/rkW11PVIDyg/rkW11PVIDyg_53_1_878_495_0_small.jpg

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a conference call with the Israeli negotiation team in Doha, during which he was briefed on Hamas' last-minute attempts to reverse the agreements reached on May 27. According to Netanyahu's office, Hamas is now demanding the right to dictate the identity of high-profile prisoners set for release, contrary to a clause granting Israel veto power over individuals considered symbols of terrorism. Netanyahu instructed the team to stand firm on the agreed terms and reject what he called 'Hamas’ last-minute extortion attempts.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk6bizip1g	2025-01-15T20:18:39-08:00

Technical details' remain, list of prisoners not finalized: Desp...	Although a final agreement has already been reached, there are still details that have not yet been finalized; The cabinet will convene only after the negotiating team gives final approval and if all goes well the cease-fire will go into effect on Sunday at 12:15 p.m. - and 3 hostages will be returned to Israel Technical details in the agreement on the hostage release deal that is expected to come into effect in the coming days are still unresolved. The Israeli negotiation team, headed by Mossad Chief David Barnea, will remain in Qatar overnight Wednesday to conclude the details on the deal's implementation, including the final list of Palestinian terrorists who will be freed. More than a year after the previous hostage deal collapsed, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani convened a press conference Wednesday night, in which he officially announced that Israel and Hamas had reached an agreement under which the cease-fire will begin on Sunday at 12:15 p.m. Only after all the details have been finalized will the head of the National Security Council, Tzachi Hanegbi, summon the members of the Security Cabinet to approve the deal, and a full government meeting is expected to follow. The negotiating team will likely participate remotely from Qatar. Although both the far-right Religious Zionist and Otzma Yehudit parties have said they would oppose the deal, it is expected to be approved in the government by a large majority. The final names of the terrorists to be freed will be released by the government secretariat on Thursday to allow opponents to appeal to the Supreme Court. If everything goes as planned, there is an expectation that the implementation of the deal will begin next week but the schedule is dependent on the ability of Hamas to carry out the release of hostages. According to the details of the deal, a six-week cease-fire will come into effect, during which the IDF will gradually withdraw from the central Gaza Strip, and displaced Palestinians will be allowed to return to the north. During this period, Israel will release 30 terrorists in exchange for each kidnapped civilian, and 50 terrorists for each female soldier released. The women will initially be released in two rounds, on the first day of the cease-fire, three women will be released, and on the seventh day four women will be released. Israel agreed with Hamas that the living hostages will be released first and only then the dead, out of a desire to release the living hostages as quickly as possible. So far, Hamas has not provided Israel with the list of the living hostages, and is supposed to provide this list on the seventh day of the cease-fire. After the women and the two Bibas children are released, adults over the age of 50 are expected to be released, followed by the wounded men, including Yarden Bibas, the father of Kfir and Ariel. Only at the end of the process will the dead hostages be returned to Israel. For the older hostages, Palestinian prisoners will be released at a ratio of 3:1 serving a life sentence, and another 27 prisoners for each sentenced to different terms. In addition, 50 wounded Hamas members will be allowed to cross daily through the Rafah crossing into Egypt with escorts, and each of them will be required to obtain permission from Israel and Egypt. Wounded civilians also will be allowed to leave. In the sixth week of the cease-fire, Hamas is scheduled to release long-held hostages Hisham al-Sayed and Abra Mengistu – who will be released under the category of the sick and wounded – and Israel will release 47 prisoners from the Shalit deal in exchange for their release. In total, 210 Palestinian minors and women will be released for five civilian hostages and the two Bibas children; 150 prisoners serving life sentences and 100 additional prisoners will be released for the five abducted female soldiers; 110 serving life sentences and 100 additional prisoners will be released for the nine sick and wounded hostages; 30 serving life sentences and 270 additional prisoners will be released for the 10 adult hostages; 60 prisoners and 47 released in the Shalit deal who were re-imprisoned will be released for Mengistu and al-Sayed; and 1,000 Palestinians who were detained since October 8 and did not participate in the massacre will be released. A total of 290 life prisoners and 1,687 other prisoners and detainees will be released, but the final number depends on how many hostages return alive. Initially, Israel resisted releasing prisoners in exchange for dead bodies, but ultimately compromised on a limited release. The murderous terrorists will not be released to the West Bank but will be deported to a third country of their choice – Qatar, Turkey, Algeria or another country. Prisoners who do not have blood on their hands will be able to return to their homes in the West Bank. In addition, Israel is also preparing to return the bodies of Palestinian terrorists to Gaza. During the first 42 days of the cease-fire, Israel will maintain a 700-meter security zone in the Gaza Strip, and will control the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors - but there will also be a gradual withdrawal of the IDF from the rest of Gaza areas. As part of the agreement, Gaza residents will be able to return to the northern Gaza Strip, but they will not be allowed to return armed or bring in weapons. The deal includes security arrangements regarding a mechanism that will inspect vehicles and freight wagons on the Netzarim Corridor, which crosses the Strip at its width. According to the plan, an American company will carry out the inspection. On the seventh day, displaced persons will be allowed to return to the northern Gaza Strip, without weapons and without being searched. In addition, vehicles will be allowed to pass north, which will be inspected by a private company. As part of the agreement, there will be a significant increase in the amount of humanitarian aid that will be brought into Gaza, to about 600 trucks per day. Israel also agreed to stop intelligence gathering in Gaza during the days of the release of the hostages. Negotiations on the second phase will begin by the 16th day of the first phase, during which all remaining live hostages, including the soldiers, are expected to be released - at which time a permanent cease-fire also will come into effect and there will be a full withdrawal of IDF forces. In the third phase, all dead hostages will be returned and, according to the agreement, the rehabilitation and rebuilding of the Strip will begin under the supervision of Egypt, Qatar and the UN. The handshakes between the parties were delayed until the last minute, and even after the announcement that a deal had been reached, the Prime Minister's Office rushed to issue a clarification statement stating that 'in light of Prime Minister Netanyahu's firm stance, Hamas backed down on its demand at the last minute to change the deployment of forces on the Philadelphi Corridor. However, there are still 'a number of clauses in the hostage-ceasefire deal that have yet to be finally agreed upon,' and that 'the details will be finalized tonight.' Prime Minister's spokesman Omer Dostri also noted that 'the reports of a 'withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor' are a complete lie. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not given up a millimeter of Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor.' However, according to the disclosed agreement, Israel will gradually reduce its forces on the Philadelphi Corridor during the first phase of the deal - and will complete the withdrawal no later than the 50th day. 'Israel made it difficult, Hamas was the main obstacle' After an agreement was reached on the details of the hostage deal, U.S. President Joe Biden, who had been involved in the negotiations for the past year, also officially announced that Israel and Hamas had reached an agreement. Other senior American officials who were partners in the efforts also gave briefings and congratulated the sides on reaching the long-awaited goal. A senior White House official involved in the talks shared behind-the-scenes details. 'On May 27, President Biden presented the plan that led to a cease-fire in Gaza and the release in the first phase of women, children, the elderly, the wounded and the sick among the hostages.' In fact, the deal approved Wednesday night is similar to the one Biden presented last summer. 'We had intensive talks about this deal that was approved a few months ago,' the official said, 'but the talks stalled on August 31, when Hirsh Goldberg-Polin and five other hostages were killed in the tunnel in Rafah.' According to the official, after the murder of the six hostages , the Americans changed their strategy and focused on the northern border in order to 'push out' Hezbollah. 'Since October, we have been holding talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his national security team regarding the effects of the situation in Lebanon on the deal to release the hostages,' the senior official said. 'During an important visit on November 27, we reached a cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, which led to more intensive engagement in the arrangement for the release of the hostages in Gaza.' 'On December 12, during a visit to Israel, we discussed for hours the acceleration of efforts,' the official added. 'The changes in the region, including the isolation of Hamas, helped to move forward. By the end of December, Hamas agreed to provide a list of 33 hostages for release, which allowed for progress. From January 5 until today, we have been working on the final details, including cease-fire agreements, force deployment, Hamas conditions, humanitarian aid and lists of Palestinian prisoners to be released.' Steve Witkoff, President-elect Donald Trump's designated Middle East envoy, who arrived in Israel on a surprise visit on Saturday, helped finalize the final details, the official said. 'For an entire night until 3 a.m., the negotiating teams, the Americans, the Israelis, the Qataris and the Egyptians, were coordinating to ensure that the agreement could be completed Wednesday.' U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller hinted at another briefing for reporters that the move to the second phase of the agreement is not certain. 'To get from the first phase to the second phase, Egypt and Qatar need to push Hamas, and the U.S. needs to push Israel - these are promises that we cannot keep in the five days remaining until the new administration,' Miller said. 'Therefore,' Miller explained, 'it is critical that all parties involved see that the United States is in the room and that when it makes promises, these are long-term promises. The involvement of President-elect Donald Trump's team in the negotiations was necessary to reach a signing. This was an unusual conduct and we greatly appreciate the team's involvement.' Miller also shared the difficulties that preceded reaching an agreement. 'There were times when we came to the Israeli government and said, 'You're pushing too hard and we're asking you to back off,'' he said. A day after National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir admitted that Israel had torpedoed deals, Miller said that 'there were times when Israel presented new conditions and new proposals that made it difficult to reach an agreement - just like Hamas did.' 'That's the nature of negotiations,' he said. 'But in the last five, six months, it was Hamas that wasn't willing to negotiate - and for a period, after Sinwar's elimination , it couldn't either. We thought we were very close to a deal in July-August, but then we saw that Hamas simply wouldn't budge. Israel was willing to discuss and Hamas wasn't. Hamas was undoubtedly the main obstacle, especially since August.' UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has frequently criticized Israel since the outbreak of the war, also welcomed the declaration of the cease-fire. 'I commend the mediators – Egypt, Qatar and the United States – for their dedicated efforts in formulating the agreement,' he said Wednesday evening. 'Their uncompromising commitment to finding a diplomatic solution was critical to this achievement. I call on all parties to uphold their commitments and ensure that the agreement is fully implemented.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In his official statement, the UN Secretary-General focused on 'alleviating the immense suffering' caused to the Palestinians. 'It is essential that the cease-fire removes the significant security and political obstacles that prevent the delivery of aid throughout Gaza, so that we can significantly increase the urgent humanitarian support that saves lives. The humanitarian situation is at catastrophic levels,' he said. 'This agreement is a critical first step, but we must also harness all efforts to advance broader goals, including preserving the unity, contiguity and integrity of the occupied Palestinian territory,' Guterres said. 'I urge the parties and all relevant partners to seize this opportunity to establish a credible political path for a better future for Palestinians, Israelis and the region.' He said: 'Ending the occupation and achieving an agreed-upon two-state solution, in which Israel and Palestine live side-by-side in peace and security, in accordance with international law, relevant UN resolutions and previous agreements, remains an urgent priority. Only through a viable two-state solution can the aspirations of both peoples be realized.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjtnb2bvyx	2025-01-15T14:27:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/16/r1mYWTBD1x/r1mYWTBD1x_0_0_850_1773_0_small.jpg

Netayahu thanks Trump 'for ending suffering of hostages and their...	Prime Minister's Office puts out statement describing the warm thanks the prime minister expressed to the incoming American president in phone call; Netanyahu also spoke with and thanked Biden Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Wednesday with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and with President Joe Biden. In a statement released by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Wednesday night, Netanyahu was said to lavish Trump with compliments. According to the statement, Netanyahu 'thanked the president-elect for his assistance in advancing the release of hostages and for helping Israel bring an end to the suffering of dozens of hostages and their families.' The statement said that Netanyahu is committed to returning all of the hostages 'however he can, and commended the U.S. President-elect for his remarks that the U.S. would work with Israel to ensure that Gaza will never be a haven for terrorism.' The statement went on to say that the two men agreed to meet in Washington soon, and ended by saying that Netanyahu also spoke with and thanked Biden for his help in advancing the deal. Earlier Trump celebrated the agreement in a post on his Truth Social platform. 'We have a deal for the hostages in the Middle East. They will be released shortly. Thank you.' He said he was pleased that the hostages would soon be returning home. 'With this deal in place, my National Security team, through the efforts of Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven. We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this cease-fire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords. This is only the beginning of great things to come for America, and indeed, the World!' Biden also expressed his pleasure at the agreement reached in Qatar in an announcement from the White House. 'I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council. It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran — but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done,' he said.

Amnesty International Venice event to present Gaza 'genocide' rep...	The event’s use of the term 'genocide' drew backlash from Venice’s Jewish community, leading to venue changes and rising tensions Venice has become the center of a heated debate following Amnesty International’s recent event aimed at presenting its findings on alleged genocide in Gaza. The controversy erupted over the event’s original title, 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman: The Genocide of Israel Against the Palestinian People in Gaza,' which some deemed inflammatory. This sparked venue changes and a broader discussion on freedom of expression versus cultural sensitivity. Amnesty International had planned the event for January 9, 2025, at the Venetian Athenaeum to present its report on the situation in Gaza over the past 15 months. However, the use of the term 'genocide' provoked immediate backlash from the local Jewish community, which argued that it was provocative and trivialized their historical experiences. 'This whole situation reminded me of Germany in 1933. We live in an historical moment in which hatred toward Jews is growing stronger than ever. Not only did Jews face the Shoah [Holocaust] in the past, but worldwide they are still contested,' explained Paolo Navarro Dina, vice president of the Jewish Community of Venice. 'The flyer Amnesty distributed mentioned the word ‘genocide,’ which trivializes our history. So, as the Jewish community, we asked the Venetian Athenaeum to opt for a different term, without opposing the event per se,' he added. For Amnesty, however, the title reflected the gravity of its findings. After nine months of investigation, we concluded that Israel committed three acts of genocide, as defined by the 1948 Convention 'After nine months of investigation, we concluded that Israel committed three acts of genocide, as defined by the 1948 Convention,' said Riccardo Noury, spokesperson for Amnesty Italy. 'This was not a term we used lightly,' he added. The Venetian Athenaeum ultimately withdrew its support for the event, citing concerns over 'public order.' 'We criticized the mention of genocide, but we had no intention of censoring or canceling the event. This was the Athenaeum’s decision, not ours, but the way it was handled suggested otherwise,' Navarro Dina explained. The event was later moved to the University of Ca’ Foscari on the same date, drawing a crowd of about 500 people. However, it was presented under a different title: 'Presentation and Discussion of the Report of Amnesty International Regarding the Israeli Military Campaign in Gaza' – suggesting the university’s intention to use more neutral language. We criticized the mention of genocide, but we had no intention of censoring or canceling the event 'Without us knowing, the title was changed, but we still achieved our goal of sharing our findings with a larger audience than expected, despite the controversy that initially aimed to prevent the event by shifting the focus from this genocide to antisemitism,' Noury explained. 'It is not a matter of measuring the number of victims; it is about recognizing that a state has committed acts prohibited by international law. It is our job to report it, just as we have in other international cases, such as Rwanda, Bosnia, Cambodia, and the Yazidis,' he added. Amnesty rejected accusations that its report incited hatred or antisemitism. 'Antisemitism is a violation of human rights. It is unacceptable to accuse an organization like ours, which defends human rights, of being antisemitic,' countered Noury. Following the controversy, the Jewish community reported receiving hate mail and threats, escalating tensions. 'We are facing hate unfairly and have received several letters. These people are not even anonymous—they write their full names – so we are still checking who they are,' Navarro Dina said. Messages ranged from accusations of political manipulation to more serious threats. 'Some letters accused us of controlling political and economic power to silence counter-narratives, while others contained statements like, ‘You will end up in hell and be finally condemned,’' Navarro Dina revealed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The overall atmosphere is heavy; we just witnessed the recent events in Bologna. I want to remind everyone that, most of the time, hatred towards Israel hides a far uglier facade,' Navarro Dina concluded. There’s an epidemic of anger and division today, for sure, and we condemn any form of hate towards anyone Amnesty distanced itself from these incidents and stressed that addressing uncomfortable truths is essential to protecting human rights. 'There’s an epidemic of anger and division today, for sure, and we condemn any form of hate towards anyone. But equating our work with antisemitism undermines our pursuit of justice,' Noury concluded.

Trump administration plans ICC sanctions over arrest warrants for...	Trump administration is preparing sanctions against ICC officials following arrest warrants for prime minister and former defense minister; Measures include freezing assets and travel bans, aiming to pressure the court to withdraw the warrants and halt proceedings Israel and the United States are coordinating an extensive sanctions plan targeting judges and officials of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in response to the issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Sanctions are set to take effect on January 20, President-elect Donald Trump's first day back in office. The U.S. is reportedly preparing severe measures against ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, as well as judges and staff involved in the case. These include entry bans to the United States and the freezing of bank accounts, which would also hinder their ability to use credit cards in Europe. According to a senior Israeli official, these actions resemble sanctions previously imposed on violent West Bank settlers, which effectively barred them from using credit cards in Israeli banks due to fears of repercussions from the U.S. Treasury. In a second phase, additional sanctions are being pushed forward by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. These measures would prohibit the transfer of U.S. aid to countries that announce they will honor the ICC arrest warrants. While these sanctions are unlikely to affect Western European nations, they could have significant consequences for countries reliant on U.S. assistance. The overarching goal of the sanctions plan is to exert unprecedented pressure on the ICC and force it to withdraw the arrest warrants. Israel has already filed an appeal with the court, which it hopes will provide the ICC with a face-saving exit. 'We will bring the court to its knees and then negotiate the closure of the case,' a senior Israeli source said. 'Our appeal will give them a way to climb down from the tree top they ventured to.' In parallel, Israel is pursuing diplomatic efforts to convince the United Nations Security Council to request a suspension of the arrest warrants, citing broader political interests and the promotion of peace. Senior Israeli officials claim Khan acted improperly in issuing the ICC arrest warrants, alleging the decision was influenced by personal allegations of sexual harassment against him. According to these officials, Khan issued the warrants two days before a planned visit to Israel in an effort to deflect attention from the accusations. Background on the ICC arrest warrants In November, the ICC rejected appeals submitted by Israel and issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Mohammed Deif, the Hamas military commander who has reportedly already been killed, a claim that remains unconfirmed by Hamas. The court accuses Netanyahu and Gallant of criminal responsibility for the following offenses: As co-perpetrators of the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare. Crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts. As civilian superiors, for the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against civilian populations. Foreign minister responds Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar addressed the arrest warrants during a diplomatic visit to Italy, emphasizing Israel is not a signatory to the Rome Statute and is therefore not under the jurisdiction of the ICC. Sa’ar described the court’s actions as violating fundamental legal principles of jurisdiction and complementarity, accusing the ICC of undermining Israel's right to self-defense. > During his meetings, Sa’ar highlighted the recent appointment of Nawaf Salam, the former president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), as Lebanon’s prime minister. Sa’ar noted Salam had previously referred to Israel as an 'enemy' and had presided over a case brought against Israel by South Africa alleging genocide. 'What kind of justice can Israel expect from these judicial bodies under such circumstances?' Sa’ar asked. 'Israel is committed to international law, but this is a mockery and politicization of international judicial institutions.' Italy's foreign minister and justice minister assured Sa’ar that the Italian government has received legal advice confirming immunity for Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu, during visits to Italy. They further explained that their position on immunity is grounded in the Vienna Convention. This situation underscores the intensifying geopolitical tensions between Israel, the United States and international judicial institutions, as well as the broader implications for global diplomatic and legal norms. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qsnwhd1e	2025-01-15T12:23:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/29/rJDFwVPXJx/rJDFwVPXJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Gazans celebrate cease-fire deal, Hamas terrorists join crowd	We are here and will remain here,' armed Hamas member says; 'We will rebuild and Gaza will be more beautiful than ever,' says one resident of the Strip Gazans on Wednesday evening celebrated the news that a cease-fire agreement has been struck that will not only bring about the release of hostages but an end to the fighting that they hope will be permanent and bring an end to the war after much of the Gaza Strip has been destroyed and most of its residents displaced. The first phase of the deal will see an increase in humanitarian aid and the return of many from the northern areas of the Strip to their homes. Hamas claimed victory in a statement and said the cease-fire deal is 'a turning point in the struggle on the way to the ultimate goal of liberation.' Some of the Hamas supporters chanted 'We are Mohammed Deif's people,' referring to the slain head of the Hamas military wing, killed in an Israeli strike last August. In Khan Younis, Hamas terrorists joined the celebrations with their guns raised. 'We are around and will remain around,' one said. Others raised the Palestinian flag and one woman vowed that Gaza would be rebuilt. 'It will be more beautiful than ever, we will rebuild and rehabilitate. That is our achievement,' she said. Hamas's communications office came out with a statement calling on people to avoid trouble until the cease-fire is in effect, perhaps hoping to avoid a mass return of displaced residents to the north where many of their homes were destroyed.

Biden announces deal from White House: 'My diplomacy never ceased...	Outgoing president says that 'this deal would have to be implemented by the next team,' referring to the Trump administration; 'I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice because that's what American presidents do' U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday from the White House that Israel and Hamas e reached a cease-fire and hostage deal that will end the fighting in Gaza and 'surge humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians.' 'I can announce a cease-fire and a hostage deal has been reached between Israel and Hamas,' Biden said at the White House. The deal was reached after 15 months of suffering, he said, and will be followed by a surge of humanitarian aid in Gaza. 'Fighting in Gaza will stop, and soon the hostages return home to their families,' Biden said. 'I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council. It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran — but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done,' he said. 'Even as we welcome this news, we remember all the families whose loved ones were killed in Hamas’s October 7th attack, and the many innocent people killed in the war that followed. It is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin,' Biden also said. > When asked how much credit Trump's team should get for this deal, given Trump has already claimed credit, Biden said 'This is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May. Exact. And, we got the world to endorse it.' In a nod to and a dig at the incoming Trump administration, Biden said: 'This deal would have to be implemented by the next team. So, I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice because that's what American presidents do.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skfuhthwkx	2025-01-15T10:39:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/08/ry1csPX4kl/ry1csPX4kl_0_170_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

33 hostages released in 6 weeks, women and children first: These ...	At least 3 hostages will be released each week during the 42-day cease-fire as the IDF gradually withdraws from central Gaza and displaced persons return to the north; For each kidnapped civilian, 30 terrorists will be released, and for each female soldier 50; Negotiations on the second phase of the deal will begin by the 16th day After long and arduous negotiations, an agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas Wednesday evening on a deal in which 33 hostages, both living and dead, will be returned to Israel from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip. The list of hostages to be released includes all women still in captivity, civilians and soldiers, all children (Ariel and Kfir Bibas) and all men over the age of 50 who are still in captivity. These are the details of the deal that are known so far: As part of the agreement, a six-week cease-fire will come into effect, during which the IDF will gradually withdraw from the central Gaza Strip, and displaced Palestinians will be allowed to return to the north. During this period, Israel will release 30 terrorists in exchange for each kidnapped civilian, and 50 terrorists for each female soldier released. First, the women and children will be released, followed by men over the age of 50. The release of those kidnapped by Hamas will be spread out over 42 days, six weeks, with at least three hostages being released each week. As part of the agreement, by the end of the first phase, Israel will release from prison all female terrorists held since October 7, 2023, as well as male terrorists under the age of 19 who were arrested since the outbreak of the war. In total, between 990 and 1,650 terrorists are expected to be released, with the final number depending on the number of live hostages who return as part of the deal. Negotiations on the second phase of the agreement, guaranteed by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, will begin by the 16th day of the first phase. The second phase is expected to include the release of all remaining hostages, including soldiers, and to ensure a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and a full IDF withdrawal from it. The third phase is expected to include the return of all remaining hostages and the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza under the supervision of Egypt, Qatar and the UN. After final handshakes and after the last-minute crises were resolved , an Israeli and an American senior official announced Wednesday evening: 'The crisis has been resolved - there is an agreement.' The Egyptian channel Al-Qahera Al-Ekhbariya also reported that an agreement had been reached 'following the efforts of the mediators, after hours of hard work.' In order to approve the deal, the political-security cabinet will convene Thursday morning at 11:00, and immediately afterward a government meeting will be held, at the end of which the list of prisoners who will be released as part of the agreement will be published. The IDF is preparing to return the hostages, and the name given to the operation is 'Wings of Freedom.' Approval of the deal requires a simple majority so, despite the opposition of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who maintains a certain ambiguity, and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, it is expected to be approved. In light of the developments, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar cut short his state visit to Italy and is returning to Israel. After the agreement is approved, the public will be given time to petition the High Court of Justice against the deal and the list of terrorists who are expected to be released. The Israeli negotiating delegation, led by Mossad head Dedi Barnea, is expected to remain in Doha Wednesday night to complete the talks on implementing the agreement, and to finalize the list of prisoners who will be released as part of the deal, including terrorist murderers. Now, a series of technical details remain to be finalized, and only upon the delegation's return to Israel will it be possible to convene the cabinet, so that a postponement during the government meeting is possible. Although, according to various reports and according to the details of the agreement that have been revealed, there will be a complete withdrawal of IDF forces from the Gaza Strip, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that: 'In light of Prime Minister Netanyahu's firm stance, Hamas backed down on its demand at the last minute to change the deployment of forces on the Philadelphi Corridor. However, there are still a number of clauses in the hostage-ceasefire deal that have yet to be finally agreed upon,' and 'the details will be finalized tonight.' > The prime minister's spokesman, Omer Dostri, also noted that 'the reports of a 'withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor' are a complete lie. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not given up a millimeter of Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor.' US President-elect Donald Trump, who said in recent weeks that if a deal is not reached before his inauguration 'there will be all hell to pay,' was quick to offer his congratulates on the agreement. 'We have a deal for the hostages in the Middle East. They will be released shortly. Thank you,' he posted on his Truth Social platform. Trump then published another post, in which he promised to work together with Israel and U.S. allies to ensure that Gaza 'never becomes a safe haven for terrorism.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hymymfsvyl	2025-01-15T10:08:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/Sy00vM6END1x/Sy00vM6END1x_0_227_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

'We have a deal for the hostages in the Middle East. They will be released shortly. Thank you. Trump said the agreement could only have been reached because of his election as president. 'It signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies.

We must declare a state of mental health emergency for Israel’s ...	Mati Kochavi has touched hearts worldwide with Eva.Stories, conducted business in the Gulf long before the Abraham Accords, connected with key Middle Eastern leaders and became a billionaire; now he tackles Israel’s child mental health crisis and his AI-based pediatric care project aims to deliver early intervention, blending technology with human therapists for critical support What does care for children with developmental challenges have to do with enhancing sports broadcasts, protecting oil facilities in Gulf countries, a media project to commemorate the Holocaust, reducing anxiety in adults and creating smart cities? At first glance, there’s no connection. But for Mati Kochavi, it all boils down to one thing: information. More precisely, collecting, analyzing, understanding, presenting and using data that constantly flows from the Internet, social media, satellites and sensors. His goal is to turn information into knowledge. And with knowledge—processed through powerful artificial intelligence tools—you can more or less do whatever you like; protect, inspire or heal. Today, Kochavi’s focus is on integrating AI into pediatric medical care, but he says his ultimate aim is nothing less than revolutionizing the world. 'I’m fighting for the future of humanity,' he tells me. Subtlety is not his style. If the name Mati Kochavi, 62, sounds familiar, but you can’t quite place it, you likely last encountered him in 2019. That’s when the Israeli entrepreneur and billionaire captivated public attention with Eva.Stories. Created and produced with his daughter, Maya, the project chronicled the life of Eva Heyman, a 13-year-old girl murdered in the Holocaust, through a series of 70 Instagram Stories based on her diary. Three years later, Kochavi—splitting his time between New York for work and his home in Caesarea—teamed up with his daughter once again to create The Story of Equiano, the true account of an African boy abducted into slavery, this time told through TikTok. Both projects combined have reached over half a billion views and won numerous awards. Kochavi was inspired to create Eva.Stories after encountering data collected online that highlighted a lack of interest—and presumably knowledge—about the Holocaust among young people. 'What’s happening today, with the rise of antisemitism among the younger generation, doesn’t surprise me,' he says. 'We already saw it back then, but no one cared.' Despite living in the United States for more than 30 years, Kochavi still deeply cares. He considers himself fully Israeli. 'I’m Israeli, my children and grandchildren are Israeli, my home is in Caesarea, my language is Hebrew. I travel the world because my life is global. I don’t employ people in Israel, but I’ve been active and involved in dozens of different social initiatives over the years, especially now, when the country and its society are in the eye of the storm.' One of these initiatives is his dream to build the best kindergarten in Israel for the children of Kibbutz Nir Oz when they return home. 'That’s my dream,' Kochavi says. What’s your take on what the country is going through? 'When there’s so much chaos, conflict and instability, it’s obvious things aren’t working well. It’s poorly managed. Israeli politics is violent; dramatic decisions are made by a razor-thin margin—it’s political bullying. We’ve lost our sense of empathy. This didn’t just happen over the past year. It’s a process. The social contract in Israel is eroding.' You live in Caesarea, not far from the prime minister. You’ve seen the protests. 'We must not erode democracy in Israel—it will lead to dramatic harm to the Israeli economy. There are processes at play that are hard not to notice: a decline in democracy, rising corruption, bad things are taking place. A corrupt country with deep inequalities cannot succeed. No chance. Every investor and every businessperson working with or in Israel needs to know that its institutions—courts, banks, the central bank, the state comptroller and others—are independent and strong. This year, the Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to a researcher who demonstrated the direct link between economic growth and the independence and strength of institutions. Investors go where there’s intellect, innovation and solutions, and these require a democratic environment to thrive. One of the biggest problems we face today is the severe damage done to our democracy.' 'Citizens from all social strata and every part of the country must demand a new social order,' says Kochavi, 'one that prioritizes their economic and personal well-being. The public deserves excellent education systems, compassionate healthcare, a fair tax system, a just judiciary and law enforcement that does not compromise in the face of violence. Israeli politics must offer the public an optimistic vision. As of now, that’s not happening.' 'Close and personal relationships with key Middle Eastern Arab leaders' Despite his many ventures in media and gaming, Kochavi hasn’t abandoned his core field: using information for defense and security purposes. He was among the first Israelis to do business with the United Arab Emirates, and reportedly with Saudi Arabia as well, during 2006–2014—long before the Abraham Accords. His work included securing oil facilities and other sensitive sites, signing contracts to convert planes into reconnaissance aircraft in Greece and installing an array of cameras and sensors across Dubai, turning it into a smart city—one that is especially recorded and monitored. In a small and ironic twist of history, the system Kochavi, an Israeli, installed ended up helping Dubai’s police identify Mossad agents who assassinated the terrorist Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in early 2010. Security cameras captured members of the hit squad renting a room, walking around in tennis gear and more, leading to a diplomatic crisis between Israel, the UK, Australia and the UAE. On top of this, Kochavi employed numerous generals and high-ranking security officials in his defense companies, reportedly paying them handsomely. This drew attention from Israeli media and even criticism from a few anti-Israel websites, which labeled him a spy. He even has an entry on the whistleblower site WikiSpooks. So, what’s the story here? 'I can’t go into much detail because everything is highly sensitive, but every deal had to be approved by the Israeli defense establishment,' says Kochavi. 'I wasn’t involved in cyber operations—everything was about information, sensors and innovative ways to perceive reality in order to protect critical infrastructure. All the projects in the Gulf revolved around these areas.' He clarifies that he didn’t do business in Qatar. What about arms trading? 'No. Categorically and absolutely not. I consider it morally wrong, akin to drug trafficking. I’m also not impressed by those developing spyware and marketing it globally. I worked exclusively with open-source tools. 'As for employing generals and high-ranking officials, there’s nothing unusual about that. In Israel, it got attention because I brought in security experts, but at the same time, I also hired experts across many fields. That’s all there is to it. In any case, this is all in the past, and I’ve imposed silence on myself regarding this topic to avoid causing any disruptions to more important matters. For me, those years shaped my understanding of the region and its potential. I met a population that was completely different from the stereotypes I had in my mind.' Alongside his economic ventures, Kochavi cultivated close and personal relationships with several key Arab leaders in the Middle East. 'I’ve met most of the region’s leaders and have very close, intimate relationships with them. But back then, I was unique. Today, that’s no longer the case; there are many Israelis doing business there and building relationships. Regardless, Israel’s relationship with the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia has the potential to be a regional and global game-changer. If we can establish ties that go beyond security, it will have a tremendous impact on Israeli society. 'These are nations led by relatively young, innovative and calculated leaders. Yes, they have immense oil and gas reserves, but money alone is no guarantee of power or success. Often, it’s a recipe for destruction. Venezuela has oil and gas, so does Iraq. You need intelligence and leadership. 'Even though they sit on vast energy reserves, they understand they can’t rely on that alone. That’s why they’re investing in areas like artificial intelligence and energy. The transformation of the UAE into a global hub for trade and commerce was planned 35 years ago. Just think of the courage it took to sign an agreement with Israel. It’s a leadership decision that leaves me in awe.' Do you think the Trump administration will sustain the momentum? 'There’s potential here for a big regional surprise. Saudi Arabia is a central axis in the Islamic world and the Middle East. It used to be said that the Middle East is a tent with two poles: one is Saudi Arabia, and the other is Egypt. In the arena Israel is operating in, the Abraham Accords and regional cooperation carry tremendous weight. As for what lies ahead, many commentators are confident they know the future. I’m not one of them.' 'You’re talking to someone who struggles with very serious mental issues' Today, it seems almost obvious that immense amounts of data circulating globally can be harnessed for knowledge and insights, but Kochavi was ahead of the curve, one of the first to see its potential. To understand how he arrived at his current focus on pediatric care, it’s worth tracing his journey. After growing up in Haifa and completing military service in Unit 8200 ('I had a brilliant military career that ended after a year in the reserves'), Kochavi moved to the U.S. in the early 1990s. 'I was torn about whether I wanted to be a historian like my father and brother (both history professors). At university, I researched the correlation between Isaac Newton’s scientific and theological thinking. But ultimately, I made a dramatic decision to leave. I wanted independence and security. A core part of my worldview is that you can’t rely on governments, no matter which ones. You need to be able to provide yourself with security and independence.' In the United States, where Kochavi continues to work to this day (without American citizenship—he says, 'I enter the U.S. just like you, standing in the long line'), he met Stephen Ross, a Jewish-American real estate mogul with a fortune estimated at tens of billions of dollars, and began working for him. While working in real estate, Kochavi recalls, 'I identified the emerging field of data analysis and started a small company focused on security—but only through data. Today, everyone does it, but we were among the first to realize how data can help identify threats. We didn’t deal with fences and guards, but with protection through behavior.' Behavior-based protection involves identifying anomalies in regular behavioral patterns. For example, a person flying from the U.S. to Israel via Nigeria without any family or business ties there—an anomaly worth noting. 'We didn’t analyze data solely in terms of counterterrorism,' Kochavi explains. 'I was interested in how you collect data to provide insights into spatial reality. We tried to understand why traffic jams happen, predict disasters and natural phenomena, monitor the development of health conditions or manage a large port—it was all about data.' In the years following the 9/11 attacks, the field of homeland security skyrocketed, and for Kochavi, who was already deeply involved, it brought significant opportunities—and success. Later, Kochavi founded AGT International, which grew into a massive company with deals worth billions of dollars. He expanded not only his business ventures but also the methods of data mining, adding a new ingredient to his data 'recipe': sensors that measure the human body in addition to those that monitor the environment. This field is known as the 'Internet of Things.' > 'The concept behind AGT,' Kochavi says, 'was that we live in two worlds—the physical and the digital—and to create a complete picture, you need the interaction between them. What interested me was understanding human behavior through technology.' Around AGT International, Kochavi built a network of companies that explored various fields of data generation and utilization, such as cyber, media, gaming and personal training. For example, he equipped UFC fighters (and their gloves, the ring and their trainers) with sensors, models during Fashion Week (including Elon Musk’s mother, a former model whom he describes as 'a very nice woman') and even bulls in rodeo competitions. The data was broadcast in real time to enhance the audience’s experience. Kochavi also mined the darkest corners of the Internet to create Dark Net, an innovative documentary series he developed with his other daughter, Adi. Released in 2016, it highlighted the dangers of the digital world. He also identified rising antisemitism online, which led to the creation of Eva.Stories, and more. 'Everything,' Kochavi says, 'was part of studying and understanding human behavior.' Kochavi’s various ventures have performed quite well, allowing him to continue operating without bringing in outside investors. His companies are always private. This is why his net worth remains unknown, and he, of course, doesn’t disclose it. However, estimates suggest he is a billionaire. You could have made much more if you went public. 'You’re talking to someone who struggles with very serious mental issues. I value privacy, which is why I don’t give many interviews. I want a quiet life, which is why I don’t take my companies public. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to do that. For me, the most important dimension is freedom.' 'Revolutionizing the future of young generations in Israel and around the world' It’s possible to trace how Kochavi’s journey in data collection and utilization—from satellites and sensors to social media and gaming—took him from defense to focusing on pediatric care. 'You can see there’s a very clear narrative,' Kochavi confirms. 'At first, it was about understanding the physical environment. Then we said: OK, let’s focus on something even more important than the environment—the human being.' At first, his work aimed at entertainment, later shifting toward care. 'It was all part of the learning process. Even back then, I told people: eventually, we’ll use this knowledge to understand children and help them. But you can’t put sensors on children. Then we thought: wait, there is a sensor that every child has—the phone.' Around that time, artificial intelligence burst onto the scene. For Kochavi’s companies, which dealt with analyzing massive amounts of data, AI fit like a glove. Unsurprisingly, he’s excited. 'The world is changing. Technologies merging with new knowledge spark revolutions. We’re at a crossroads that will reshape the future. Artificial intelligence will create a new world order—a new economic order, a new social order. Despite the dangers and challenges it presents, AI has the potential to drive extremely significant changes. To me, its greatest power will be in providing personalized support for every child’s development and health during the critical stages of their life.' Don’t you think your perspective on artificial intelligence is overly utopian? 'Granted it’s heading in other directions as well, but I ask myself what good I can do with AI. Countries that use artificial intelligence wisely will be able to significantly improve public health—and at lower costs. AI can dismantle the social order where people in central Israel get more than those in the periphery. You’re right about the dangers, but there are also aspects that can positively influence the future of humanity, and I don’t think we should be ashamed to say that.' This is where Kochavi’s latest project, Korro AI, comes into play. Like Eva.Stories, Korro is aimed at children and accessed through a phone screen, but the similarities end there. Korro is an AI therapist—or, to put it more elegantly, an AI-based therapeutic platform designed to support children’s motor, cognitive and emotional (primarily) development through interactive gameplay. The company is launching in Israel, the United States, and soon in other countries. Two of Korro’s applications are already in use in Israel. The first is a relatively limited feature on Clalit Health Services’ app under its Clalit Active program which is aimed at reducing stress and anxiety in adults through breathing exercises, movement and mindfulness. While there are plenty of similar apps, what sets Korro apart is its integration of real-time metric analysis, such as breathing patterns and heart rate, offering tailored feedback and guidance to the user during the session. I tried it. It’s incredibly calming and effective. During the seven-minute session, I felt less inclined to wish for a meteorite to crash into Earth and end it all. Few things are more important than easing, even slightly, the immense stress weighing on the Israeli psyche these days. After all, we’re all tense, anxious and depressed. It’s comforting to have something—someone, even—that truly pays attention to how we breathe, even if it’s artificial intelligence. Most importantly, I found myself wanting to return to it again and again. 'The current events are profoundly affecting children in Israel,' says Kochavi. 'We must declare a state of mental health emergency for Israel’s children. The ability to provide early intervention and rapid treatment for such a large number of children requires artificial intelligence—there’s no other way. The knowledge we have today about human development, especially during the critical years up to age 17 when the brain is still shaping, is enormous. Our job now is to apply it and reach every single child, everywhere. 'And what’s happening in the meantime? According to official statistics, one in four children in the United States faces developmental, motor or mental health challenges. I don’t know the exact numbers for Israel, but it’s clear there’s an issue. We are treading carefully on this sensitive ground. 'In my view, future generations will consider us a primitive society for failing to fully understand the significance of these critical years. After all, what’s missed during this decisive time is extremely difficult to fix later—if it can be fixed at all. Here, we have an opportunity to introduce an AI therapist at the most crucial stage. The potential is immense. Technology will set us free.' Maccabi Health Services is already offering a more comprehensive application of Korro designed for children with motor issues. The app has been in use for some time as part of a pilot program involving a few dozen children, and it will soon roll out on a broader scale. I tried it as well, and as far as I can tell, it’s excellent. Korro integrates several advanced capabilities. The first is highly sophisticated image recognition technology, which analyzes thousands of parameters. The phone essentially watches you with a keen eye, examining every tiny movement of every facial muscle, while factoring in sweating, breathing, heart rate, posture, movement and more. From this data, it produces detailed assessments. The second capability is a powerful AI engine that constantly updates with the latest expert knowledge. 'We’ve downloaded insights from some of the world’s leading minds in mental health and child development,' Kochavi explains. 'It’s as if I’m bringing the world’s top pediatric specialist to the bedside of every child, everywhere, to examine them.' The third feature is the ability to generate, in real time, customized activities, exercises and games tailored to the patient, which adapt and progress with them. The fourth is producing detailed reports for therapists and parents. This app, I felt, truly sees you. 'We’re building something here with the goal of revolutionizing the future of young generations in Israel and around the world,' says Kochavi, pointing to data showing that combining Korro with human therapy yields impressive results and ensures continuity of care. Pathos makes me slightly skeptical, so I called Hila Moshayev, national director of occupational therapy at Maccabi Health Services and a child development expert. She told me that dozens of Israeli children and therapists have been using the app for about five months, and the results have been excellent. The children are enthusiastic about the app and use it at home, the therapists are pleased with the reports and the parents are seeing progress. She added that in recent months, Korro has proven invaluable for providing remote care to displaced children, helping to maintain uninterrupted treatment. The app also strengthens the bond between therapist and child by encouraging the child’s independent progress. 'The child’s interaction with a human therapist is critical,' Kochavi emphasizes. 'Treatment must be hybrid. Under no circumstances can children be treated without a human therapist, and there is no intention to change that.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1hwfirvjx	2025-01-15T08:49:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/B1115Y2tcLyx/B1115Y2tcLyx_0_185_1811_1020_0_small.jpg

Putin, 'acts of air terror' and the secret message from the White...	Six months after packages burst into flames at airports and warehouses in Poland, Germany and England, the Polish prime minister accuses Russia of plotting 'acts of air terror' around the world Russia planned 'acts of air terror' against Poland and other countries, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Wednesday after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. The Polish premier's statement came two days after the New York Times reported that the U.S. last year had sent an urgent warning to Moscow after American intelligence agencies said a Russian military unit was preparing to send explosive packages on cargo planes to the U.S. The message to the Russians was that if there is a mass casualty disaster in the air or on the ground, the U.S. will consider Russia as an accessory to terror. Security officials have said that parcels which exploded at logistics depots in Europe were part of a test run for a Russian plot to trigger explosions on cargo flights to the United States. The explosions occurred in depots in Britain, Germany and Poland in July. Russia has denied involvement in the incidents and Tusk did not mention them specifically. 'I will not go into details, I can only confirm the validity of fears that Russia was planning acts of air terror, not only against Poland, but against airlines around the world,' Tusk told a news conference. He did not say what acts he was referring to or elaborate on the contents of the information. The Russian embassy in Warsaw and the Russian foreign ministry did not reply to requests for comment on Tusk's statement. > The Kremlin has dismissed previous Western claims that Russia sponsored acts of sabotage and attacks in Europe. The pro-Western Polish government under Tusk has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia and has accused Moscow of promoting a hybrid war against Warsaw and others as revenge for their support of Kyiv. Poland claims that Russia and its ally Belarus are working to intensify the migrant crisis on the EU's eastern borders hoping to spread division in the union. According to the New York Times, the White House's warning did reach Putin, and administration officials say it has had its effect, with the wave of package detonations in Europe currently halted. However, it is unclear whether Putin has ordered a halt to the operation and for how long. Officials also told the newspaper that Russia may be using the time to build better explosive devices that will be easier to evade detection during testing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj4ahubpje	2025-01-15T08:15:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/ByQ00BcbS1e/ByQ00BcbS1e_0_111_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

UN rights chief urges reconciliation process in first Syria visit	U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk called on Wednesday for a Syrian national reconciliation process to ensure justice for crimes committed over the past five decades of iron-fisted rule by the Assad family. In the first visit ever by a U.N. rights commissioner to Damascus, Turk met with the head of Syria's new administration, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and with victims of crimes the conflict. 'Transitional justice is crucial as Syria moves forward,' Turk told reporters in Damascus. 'Revenge and vengeance are never the answer. Instead there needs to be a fully nationally-owned, healing, truth-telling and reconciliation process.' He said such a process would address 'past wrongs that have been committed by all actors in Syria over the past five decades', the period during which Assad and his father Hafez before him ruled over Syria. Turk said his office had been remotely documenting evidence of crimes in Syria since war broke out in 2011 and that it would work with other U.N. agencies to address them. He said some Syrians were still unable to return home due to 'demographic engineering' that had stripped their land and property rights. 'The extent of the atrocity crimes truly beggars belief.' The commissioner also called for the international community to urgently reconsider and lift sectoral sanctions in Syria, which he said were impacting all Syrians.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skifgprvyg	2025-01-15T07:21:10-08:00

Trump State Dept nominee Rubio promises US-focused foreign policy...	Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio promised a robust foreign policy focused on American interests at his nomination hearing on Wednesday for secretary of state under President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. A China hawk and staunch backer of Israel, the 53-year-old Rubio is expected to comfortably win confirmation by the full Senate. Democrats backed him as soon as Trump announced his nomination to become the top U.S. diplomat, a sharp contrast with some more controversial nominees who drew skepticism even from Trump's own party. In his opening statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he has served for 14 years, Rubio said he sees a world in chaos where it will not be easy to restore order. 'But it can and will only happen if it is built on a simple foundational element - a strong and confident America engaged in the world based on our national interest before all else,' he said in prepared remarks. Rubio has strongly backed Israel. Last year, he said he would not call for a ceasefire in Gaza and believed Israel should destroy 'every element' of Palestinian terror group Hamas. 'These people are vicious animals,' he added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkgsourv1e	2025-01-15T06:49:26-08:00

Erdogan demands Israeli withdrawal from Syria, warns of 'unfavora...	Turkish president says Israel's 'aggressive actions' must end immediately, calls Gaza cease-fire 'opportunity for lasting peace and stability across the region' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday demanded that Israel cease its 'aggressive actions' toward neighboring Syria, and withdraw its forces or it will cause 'unfavorable outcomes for everyone.' 'The aggressive actions of the forces attacking Syrian territory, Israel, in particular, must come to an end as soon as possible. Otherwise, it will cause unfavorable outcomes for everyone,' Erdogan said in his address during a group meeting of his Justice and Development Party. Senior Israeli officials stated last week that Israel will need to maintain a 15-kilometer 'security buffer' inside Syrian territory, where the IDF will ensure a presence to prevent forces loyal to the new regime from launching rockets toward the Golan Heights. Additionally, Israel plans to establish a 60-kilometer 'zone of influence' within Syria, allowing for intelligence control to monitor and mitigate emerging threats in the area. The Foreign Ministry said it rejects Erdogan's threats and said in a statement that it would advise the Turkish preident to avoid making such threats and that Israel would continue to protect its borders. Erdogan also addressed the ongoing negotiations for a hostage release deal and a cease-fire, stating, 'With the achievement of a cease-fire in Gaza, where genocide has been ongoing for 15 months, a significant opportunity will arise for lasting peace and stability across the region. We are closely monitoring the cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas and hope to receive positive news soon.' > The Turkish president also stated that Ankara had the power and ability to 'crush' all terrorists in Syria, including Islamic State and Kurdish militants while urging all countries to 'take their hands off' Syria. Ankara has said the new Syrian administration must be given an opportunity to address the YPG presence but also threatened to mount a new cross-border operation against the militia based in northeast Syria if its demands are not met. 'Regarding fabricated excuses like Islamic State, these have no convincing side anymore,' Erdogan said, referring to the U.S. position that the YPG was a key partner against Islamic State in Syria and that it plays a vital role guarding prison camps where the Islamist militants are kept. 'If there is really a fear of the Islamic State threat in Syria and the region, the biggest power that has the will and power to resolve this issue is Turkey,' he said. 'Everyone should take their hands off Syria and we, along with our Syrian siblings, will crush the heads of Islamic State, the YPG, and other terrorist organizations in a short time.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gnx4sp1l	2025-01-15T05:46:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/29/BJ4fBbk8ke/BJ4fBbk8ke_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg
Hamas has given green light to Gaza deal, Israeli official says	Palestinian official says terror group responded positively to mediators’ proposal, predicting deal could be signed soon; Netanyahu's office counters, saying Hamas yet to respond; negotiation teams will brief Netanyahu as government readies for Cabinet meeting Hamas has given the green light to a hostage deal, a senior Israeli official told Reuters on Wednesday. However, the Prime Minister’s Office tempered expectations, saying, 'Hamas has yet to provide a formal response.' The government and Security Cabinet will convene on Thursday to address the developments. Pro-Hamas Qatari newspaper The New Arab reported that Hamas leadership in Doha met with leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine to present the final draft of the Gaza cease-fire agreement. 'The resistance factions' stance on the draft is unified and positive,' a Palestinian source told the paper. The report also noted that mediators have received maps detailing the IDF’s withdrawal and presence in Gaza during the agreement’s initial phase. The official announcement is expected to take place in Cairo, contingent on all parties’ approval. > Meanwhile, a senior Palestinian official told Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Mayadeen that 'Hamas has responded positively to the mediators’ final proposal. The cease-fire agreement is expected to be signed tonight or tomorrow,' the official added. Israeli officials have stressed the importance of the next 24 to 48 hours, with one describing it as a 'now or never' moment. 'If a deal isn’t finalized within this timeframe, the momentum could be lost,' another official warned. Israel has dismissed Hamas’ claims, circulated in Arab media, that Israel is delaying the agreement, calling them an attempt to exert last-minute pressure for concessions. Israeli sources said these accusations also reflect internal divisions within Hamas leadership in Gaza. Negotiators in Doha are reportedly making final refinements to the deal, with sources saying, 'The teams are focused on perfecting the language of the agreement, but we are still waiting for Hamas’ formal response. For now, all we’re seeing are smokescreens.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ukybhdkl	2025-01-15T05:11:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/07/H1WZmxMN1x/H1WZmxMN1x_0_0_3000_2053_0_small.jpg

Hamas accused of stalling hostage deal, Palestinians shift blame ...	Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar approves proposed hostage deal in principle, Wall Street Journal reports; Palestinian source accuses Israel of withholding key details, including withdrawal maps Arab media reported Wednesday morning that Hamas has accused Israel of introducing new conditions that complicate finalizing a deal to release hostages held in Gaza. Israeli officials swiftly denied the claims, with a senior Israeli source calling them 'Hamas lies aimed at evading responsibility for the deal.' According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, citing Arab sources, Mohammed Sinwar, the brother and apparent successor of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, has agreed in principle to the terms of the proposed hostage-prisoner exchange deal. This agreement reportedly came just hours after Hamas publicly announced for the first time that the deal was in its 'final stages.' Despite Sinwar's reported approval, a Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations told Lebanon’s Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen network that Israeli actions are disrupting progress on a cease-fire agreement. The source claimed Israel has not provided a military withdrawal map for Gaza, nor details on the management of the Rafah border crossing and the entry of aid trucks. 'Israel has also failed to outline a prisoner swap mechanism or clarify how the wounded will be evacuated for treatment,' the source said. 'While there is general Israeli consent, these critical details are delaying the agreement and the start of a cease-fire.' Sky News Arabic, citing unnamed sources, reported that new Israeli conditions could derail the negotiations, including a demand to maintain a 700-meter military presence inside Rafah and insistence on veto power over the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released. Negotiators from both sides remain engaged in talks in Doha, Qatar. On Tuesday, a senior Hamas official told Reuters that the group has yet to provide its response to mediators, claiming Israel has not submitted maps outlining the withdrawal of its forces from Gaza. Israeli officials have denied this claim. Separately, CNN reported Wednesday that the release of Palestinian prisoners will occur in six stages. The first five stages are expected to include the release of 100 to 120 Palestinian detainees in exchange for three Israeli hostages per stage. The sixth stage will reportedly be the largest, involving the release of more than three Israeli hostages. Palestinian Prisoner Authority spokesman Taher Shariteh told CNN that this final group of prisoners will include individuals who were released as part of the 2011 deal for the release of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit but were later rearrested by Israel. 'Some of them are serving life sentences,' Shariteh said. > Arab newspapers highlighted the ongoing negotiations for a Gaza cease-fire, with varied takes on the status of the discussions. The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar described the deal as 'delayed but not collapsing.' Qatar’s pro-Hamas newspaper The New Arab reported that negotiations are 'focused on implementation mechanisms.' London-based Al-Quds Al-Arabi claimed the cease-fire agreement is 'in its final stage,' adding that 'the Israeli military is preparing to withdraw from the Rafah crossing.' Saudi daily Asharq Al-Awsat reported: 'The Gaza cease-fire is nearing completion, awaiting official announcement.' The Palestinian Health Ministry has reportedly begun preparations to receive prisoners expected to be freed under the proposed exchange deal. Hospitals and their directors have been instructed to prepare facilities accordingly. A letter issued by the Palestinian Authority read: 'Ahead of the prisoner exchange and the return of our freed detainees from Israeli prisons, immediate efforts are underway to prepare and equip internal medicine and surgical clinics to provide the necessary medical care for our brothers.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told members of the Hope Forum representing families of hostages: 'I am prepared for a prolonged cease-fire if it ensures the return of the hostages. It’s a matter of days or hours. We await Hamas’ response, after which implementation can begin immediately.' Netanyahu added: 'Hamas has not yet responded. Everything being reported now is speculation.' He also commented that when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump assumes office, 'the rules of the game will fundamentally change. Every cease-fire violation will face a harsh and unprecedented response.' As negotiations continued in Doha overnight, Israeli airstrikes targeted dozens of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad sites across Gaza. Among the targets were senior operatives and terrorist concentrations in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. The IDF said that approximately 50 terrorist sites were struck over the past 24 hours. Hamas acknowledged for the first time that significant progress had been made in the negotiations, with the group declaring that 'the freedom of our heroic prisoners is near.' Hamas also called on Palestinians to escalate confrontations with Israeli forces 'in response to the increasing crimes against our people, holy sites and prisoners.' A Hamas source told CNN that the group is 'very close to an agreement' with Israel, while another told Reuters that progress had been made on key issues, though gaps remain. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hym8ugrwjg	2025-01-15T02:18:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/rkFoCnYByl/rkFoCnYByl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

In first, Israel Prison Service to equip guards with body cameras to record prisoners' physical and medical condition prior to their release In preparation for the release of Palestinian security prisoners as part of the emerging hostage deal with Hamas, the Israel Prison Service will equip guards with body cameras to ensure transparency and prevent false claims regarding the detainees' physical condition. This move is part of an innovative pilot program, guided by IPS Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi, to document prisoners’ health status before their release and maintain organizational accountability. The cameras will record every stage of the release process, providing clear and accurate documentation of prisoners' physical condition in real time. IPS head of security and operations Avichai Ben Hamo emphasized that the program is a vital step toward increasing transparency with the public and external parties while ensuring the security and order of the prison staff. 'We want to ensure the release process is carried out professionally and accurately, and to prevent any challenges to the integrity of the process,' Ben Hamo said. > Meanwhile, the government informed the Supreme Court that 3,464 detainees from the Gaza Strip are currently held in Israeli prisons, and 151 detainees have been released for various reasons. This update came following a petition filed by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. According to CNN, the release of Palestinian prisoners will occur in six phases. The first five phases will involve the release of 100 to 120 prisoners per phase, in exchange for three hostages each time. The sixth phase, the largest, will include the release of prisoners involved in the 2011 deal for the release of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. These individuals, some of whom were re-arrested by Israel after their release, are serving life sentences. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkyq0xrpjx	2025-01-15T01:48:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/BJKq4vN41x/BJKq4vN41x_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Radical pro-Hezbollah imam to address Trump inauguration	In historic first, imam to join pastor and rabbi in delivering prayers at presidential inauguration; choice of Husham al-Husainy sparks controversy over past statements, including support for Hezbollah. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign has unveiled the official schedule for his inauguration festivities, which will span three days in Washington, D.C. The celebration will include traditional military displays, inaugural balls, a performance by country music star Carrie Underwood, and tickets priced at $1 million for an exclusive candlelit dinner with the president and first lady. For the first time in U.S. history, the presidential inauguration will feature an invocation by an imam, alongside a pastor and a rabbi. Trump has chosen Imam Husham al-Husainy of Dearborn, Michigan, to deliver the prayer. Al-Husainy, who represents the Iraqi-American community, has faced scrutiny for past statements that critics describe as anti-Israel and extremist. In a televised debate with a Christian pastor, al-Husainy once remarked that the Quran foretells 'good news' of an impending attack on Israel and predicted Muslims would 'enter Jerusalem and kick the Jews.' Al-Husainy has also publicly defended Hezbollah, a group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States. During a 2007 interview on Fox News’ Hannity, host Sean Hannity pressed al-Husainy to acknowledge Hezbollah as a terrorist group. Al-Husainy refused, saying, 'That's your interpretation. Hezbollah is a Lebanese organization.' When pressed further, he asserted, 'There’s a biblical meaning to Hezbollah—people of God.' The imam’s participation in a pro-Hezbollah rally in Dearborn in 2006 has also drawn criticism. At the event, he appeared on stage holding a picture of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and reportedly wished death to the Saudis over their involvement in Yemen, calling them 'agents of the Jews.' Al-Husainy has also previously mourned the death of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2020. A Facebook post attributed to him expressed condolences over Soleimani’s death, further fueling controversy. The Middle East Forum, a conservative think tank focused on radical Islam, described al-Husainy as a 'radical, pro-Hezbollah Shia imam' with 'a significant history of extremism.' The inclusion of al-Husainy in Trump’s inaugural proceedings has sparked debate, with critics questioning the message it sends about the administration’s stance on extremism and its approach to Middle Eastern issues. So far, neither Trump’s campaign nor al-Husainy has commented on the criticism. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s17iiervyg	2025-01-15T01:23:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/SyeGMiS4wJx/SyeGMiS4wJx_169_0_995_560_0_small.jpg
Saudi-Israeli normalization a 'huge priority,' says Trump envoy	Incoming National Security Advisor Mike Waltz identifies normalization between Jerusalem and Riyadh as key objective that will change the region; Waltz outlines vision for demilitarized Gaza and clarifies initial hostage deal does not mark end of war Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor for the Trump administration, has declared that achieving a peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia is a 'huge priority' for the incoming administration. Waltz emphasized the need to 'eliminate these terrorist organizations,' secure the release of hostages, and make progress toward Riyadh. 'Let’s call it what it is: the next phase of the Abraham Accords,' he said in an interview on the popular American podcast Call Me Back. Waltz described the potential Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization as 'a tremendous historic region-changing agreement.' Waltz also suggested that Iran played a key role in igniting the recent war through its proxy, Hamas, to derail progress. 'This is why I firmly believe that Iran lit the fuse—Hamas—to blow everything up,' Waltz said, referencing the escalation before October 7. 'The sides were very close, and that’s the goal: get our people out, eliminate these terrorist organizations, and start focusing on economic and political solutions.' Speaking to podcast host Dan Senor, author of Start-Up Nation and a prominent American businessman, Waltz made it clear that 'all options are on the table' when it comes to Iran and its nuclear program. He reiterated President Trump’s firm stance against allowing Tehran to possess nuclear weapons, stating, 'President Trump will not tolerate Iran holding nuclear arms.' > Waltz, widely regarded as an experienced and serious figure in the new administration and a strong supporter of Israel, warned of the dire consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran. 'If you think the region is unstable, violent, and at war now, imagine it under a nuclear umbrella controlled by Iran,' he said. He highlighted Iran’s proxies, from the Houthis and Hezbollah to Hamas and militias in Syria and Iraq, and noted Iran’s repeated threats to annihilate Israel. 'We must take this very seriously,' he added. 'Every American should understand that any kind of nuclear confrontation in the region would be catastrophic for the entire world.' Addressing the future of Gaza after the hostage negotiations, Waltz said the territory must be completely demilitarized, and Hamas must have no role in its governance. When asked about the fate of hostages not included in the initial deal, Waltz expressed his determination: 'These poor individuals—Israelis, Americans, and citizens of various other nations—are in tunnels under the worst imaginable conditions. They are being used as human shields and subjected to horrific abuse. We will do everything we can to bring them all home, alive or deceased, to ensure they receive a proper burial.' When Senor asked if the hostage deal signaled the end of the war, Waltz dismissed the notion. 'Hamas may hope so, but we’ve made it clear: Gaza must be fully demilitarized, Hamas must be dismantled so it cannot regroup, and Israel has every right to defend itself. Those goals remain unchanged.' Waltz added that the majority of Israelis support the hostage deal and credited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s leadership for advancing it. Reflecting on past obstacles, Waltz said Hamas previously believed it would receive support from Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'One day, the full story will be told about what I consider one of the most extraordinary covert operations in modern history,' he said, referring to Israel’s actions that weakened Hezbollah’s capabilities and leadership. Discussing the broader regional implications, Waltz highlighted how dismantling Hamas and weakening Iranian influence could open the door for Lebanon to break free from Tehran’s grip and even destabilize Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria. 'This cascade of positive effects could lead to the most promising situation the region has seen in decades,' he said. Waltz criticized the Biden administration’s handling of the situation and suggested it emboldened Hamas. He pointed to protests on American college campuses supporting Hamas and U.S. policy decisions that he described as undermining Israel. 'Every time Hamas saw news of these anti-Israel demonstrations or statements from Washington that criticized Israel, they believed sacrificing their own people to turn global opinion against Israel was worth it,' he said. Waltz also noted Vice President Kamala Harris’s boycott of Netanyahu’s speech to Congress and other perceived slights as factors that played into Hamas’s hands. Finally, Waltz underscored the Trump administration’s commitment to ensuring Hamas and similar groups have no future role in Gaza. 'Hamas, ISIS, and al-Qaeda have no place in governance. We must eradicate this cancer, not just for Israel’s sake but for the Palestinian people too. We will never achieve a stable future or a truly peaceful region until this threat is removed.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1h002ysvkl	2025-01-15T00:24:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/12/SkRUpPefke/SkRUpPefke_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Two Israeli soldiers seriously wounded by explosive in West Bank	Hours after Israeli strike killed six Palestinians in Jenin, IDF military jeep hits explosive device in neighboring Kabatiya; 2 soldiers from Kfir and Menashe Brigades severely hurt, reservist sustains minor injuries Two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded overnight when their military jeep hit an explosive device in the Palestinian West Bank town of Kabatiya, the IDF said Wednesday. A reservist soldier from the Kfir Brigade sustained minor injuries. The injured were evacuated to a hospital for treatment, and their families were notified. Hours earlier, an Israeli Air Force strike in Jenin killed six Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The operation, carried out jointly by the IDF and the Shin Bet, also left several others injured. > Anwar Rajab, spokesperson for the Palestinian security forces, condemned the airstrike, calling it a 'premeditated intervention designed to undermine security and thwart efforts to restore stability.' He accused Israel of intentionally disrupting national initiatives aimed at protecting Palestinians. Last month, the Palestinian security forces launched a crackdown on members of the Jenin Battalion, a local armed group affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad. More than 280 terrorists were arrested on charges including shooting at Palestinian Authority forces, illegal arms possession and collaborating with hostile foreign entities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryrr11lrvkg	2025-01-14T23:44:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/SJ4OeR2A8Jl/SJ4OeR2A8Jl_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Iranian official alleges Israel sabotaged nuclear equipment with ...	Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif claims explosives found in centrifuge platforms bought for Tehran’s nuclear program; President Massoud Pezeshkian warns Iran will react to any attack on its nuclear facilities; 'We do not fear war' Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's vice president for strategic affairs and former foreign minister, has accused Israel of embedding explosives in centrifuge components acquired for Tehran's nuclear program in what he described as an undisclosed attempt by Israel to sabotage Iran's nuclear infrastructure. In a statement reported by the opposition-linked Persian-language media outlet Iran International, Zarif said, 'Our colleagues procured a centrifuge platform for the Atomic Energy Organization, only to discover that explosives had been implanted within it.' Zarif did not specify when the alleged incident occurred. The claim follows a series of reported acts of sabotage targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities, including a 2021 explosion at the Natanz centrifuge plant, which Tehran labeled as 'nuclear terrorism.' While Iran has not fully detailed the incident, Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement. Zarif highlighted the security vulnerabilities created by international sanctions on Iran, which he said forced the country to rely on intermediaries for acquiring sensitive equipment. 'Instead of sourcing equipment directly from manufacturers, sanctions compel us to work through multiple intermediaries,' Zarif explained. 'If Israel infiltrates even one intermediary, they can plant anything, as they did in this case.' In response to the incident, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard reportedly confiscated communication devices and conducted extensive security checks to prevent recurrence. Iran’s Civil Aviation Authority also banned electronic devices, including cellphones, on commercial flights. 'This is one of the many damages caused by sanctions,' Zarif added. 'Beyond economic losses, they have created significant security risks.' Zarif compared the situation to a Mossad operation in Lebanon last September, where 12 Hezbollah operatives were killed and thousands injured after pagers rigged with explosives by Mossad detonated across the country. The following day, walkie-talkies used by the terror group also exploded, resulting in 20 more fatalities and 450 injuries. A Mossad operative speaking to CBS’s 60 Minutes revealed details of the operation. '[T]hose people without hands and eyes... are walking proof of our superiority all around the Middle East. 'We want them to feel vulnerable,' he said. The operative hinted that Israel has 'moved on to the next thing' in its intelligence efforts. > The report also highlighted the U.S. response to Iran’s ballistic missile strikes on Israel in October. The Biden administration imposed additional sanctions on six entities involved in Iranian oil trade and six Iranian vessels. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the time, 'These measures aim to disrupt revenue streams that the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program, develop missiles, support terrorist proxies and perpetuate conflict across the Middle East.' Pezeshkian: Attack on nuclear sites will be to the detriment of all actors Iranian President Masoud Pezhkian said in an interview with NBC on Tuesday that while Iran does not seek war, it will respond decisively to any attacks on its nuclear facilities, particularly under the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. '[N]aturally enough, we will react to any action. We do not fear war, but we do not seek it,' he said, adding: 'I solemnly hope that this will not transpire because it will be to the detriment of all the actors, not only and merely us.' He dismissed allegations that Iran is building nuclear weapons, claiming such accusations are being used as pretexts for aggression. Pezhkian also rejected claims that Iran’s influence in the region has weakened following setbacks to its 'axis of resistance' allies. '[C]omparing to last year inside the country, we’re more coherent. We’re more robust. We have better participation. We have a more solid security in the country,' he said. On efforts to secure peace, Pezeshkian added, 'We do whatever we can in order for peace to prevail in the region.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryb6v1hvyg	2025-01-14T23:12:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2019/04/25/9207651/9207651_0_39_981_552_0_small.jpg
Hostage deal Phase II explained: What’s next and why the silence?	Concerns mount for families of 65 hostages excluded from Phase I of the deal; their fate hinges on Israel and Hamas navigating significant obstacles to finalize agreements that will shape Gaza’s post-war future, a complex process fraught with challenges What Israel vigorously denied just a week ago is no longer possible to deny: If there are no last-minute surprises, then Israel and Hamas are closer than ever to another hostage deal - which will include a list of 33 living and dead Israeli hostages in its first phase, and only later, apparently, all of the hostages. This leaves the families of the 65 hostages who were left out of Phase I, which was defined as a 'humanitarian exchange' - and from which hostage Youssef Ziyadne, whose body was returned to Israel in an IDF operation, was certainly removed. Amid hopes for the return of 33 hostages in Phase I, families have valid concerns that Phase II may not be implemented. With over a year passing between previous deals and negotiations like those for Gilad Shalit taking more than five years, fears of delays are justified. And while some talk unrealistically about releasing the hostages without releasing terrorists from prison, in practice this is clearly not the case - and when you add to this the heavy prices that Phase II entails for Israel, a very large diplomatic maneuvering space is needed for it to ultimately be implemented. On the surface, and although much is still hidden from view regarding the details of the outline, it is already clear that throughout Phase I, the IDF will remain in the buffer zone in the Gaza Strip, will hold positions on the Philadelphia Corridor, and will evacuate the Netzarim Corridor only while activating a screening mechanism for Gazans who wish to return to the northern Gaza Strip. Alongside this, it is clear that the phase also includes comprehensive and extensive humanitarian aid. However, Phase II, which includes the end of the war, effectively constitutes the beginning of 'the day after' in the Gaza Strip - and therefore the list of demands that Hamas presented in the past regarding it has repeatedly crossed all of Israel's red lines. The terrorist organization's main demand for the release of the 65 Israeli and foreign hostages, which are its last bargaining chip, is to end the war. This is a complete end, a 'sustainable peace' without reservations, within the framework of which Israel will fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip and allow billions of dollars from other countries to pour into its reconstruction. In addition, Hamas is expected to demand the release of a larger number of prisoners for each soldier not included in the Phase I outline - while it also defines the young civilian men as 'soldiers'. The terrorist organization, which wants to present some achievement for the murderous surprise attack it carried out and which also brought disaster to Gaza, is expected to demand that Israel also release more 'heavyweight' prisoners in Phase II. These include, for example, Palestinian leaders such as Marwan Barghouti or Hassan Salameh - a friend of Mohammed Sinwar and a senior member of Hamas' military wing, who is serving 46 life sentences. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part, has repeatedly reiterated in recent months that he will not agree to an end to the war without achieving all of its goals, which include the return of all the hostages - but also the collapse of Hamas' rule. Defense Minister Israel Katz even demanded that the IDF present him with a 'plan for defeating Hamas' if the hostages are not released, and claimed that any talk of 'the day after' is irrelevant now, since no other force will replace Hamas as long as the terrorist organization maintains its military strength. However, the IDF, on orders from the political echelon, refrains from operating in areas in the Gaza Strip where hostages are believed to be present, and it is unclear how the terrorist organization can be eliminated without presenting alternatives that will rule the Gaza Strip the day after. According to Yaron Blum, who was the country's coordinator of prisoners and missing persons between 2017 and 2022, one of the main problems with the talks is Israel's avoidance of discussing 'the day after.' Another challenge expected to surface during Phase II, and possibly even during Phase I, is Hamas' use of cynical tactics in negotiations. As seen in the past deal, the group may introduce 'scapegoats' during implementation, forcing Israeli decision-makers into difficult dilemmas and potentially undermining trust. Israel has prepared for this by retaining significant leverage in Phase I, including control of the buffer zone in Gaza and the Philadelphi Corridor. However, these levers will diminish during Phase II. To ensure the release of all hostages, it is crucial that Hamas has something to lose, such as tying Gaza's full rehabilitation to the completion of the process. A third phase guaranteeing this linkage has already been proposed as a solution. Blum highlights another potential lever: While Hamas’ internal leadership focuses on surviving and maintaining control in Gaza, its external leadership seeks to preserve its presence in Qatar and Turkey. If the U.S. applies pressure on these countries to expel Hamas operatives, it could destabilize the organization’s external operations. This, in turn, might force Hamas’ internal leadership to accept an agreement, even if it significantly weakens its position in Gaza. The obstacles in the way and the open questions One of the main difficulties the mediators encountered was the goal declared by each side - which means that the outline for ending the war must allow both Israel and Hamas to declare 'victory.' In other words, if the unexpected does not happen, and Hamas does not back down from its demand to end the war, the question arises of what guarantees Israel will receive that the terrorist organization will indeed not take an active part in governing Gaza. In addition, Israel's security demands must also be met: From the government's perspective, the war must end with no more force in the Gaza Strip that poses a threat to it. Opponents of this approach, including within the defense establishment itself, argue that those who were abandoned should first be returned to the country - and that the super-strategic goals should not be attempted at their expense. The IDF claims that they will know how to deal well with a complete withdrawal. Blum described the concept well: 'The Gaza Strip is not going anywhere, and it will be possible to return to fighting. Hamas will give us the circumstances to do so.' So far, the prime minister and many of his ministers have not agreed to this. In any case, even assuming that the parties agree to go to phase two, which, as stated, includes a return to sustainable calm and a cessation of military operations, the question arises as to what will happen when the participants in the massacre begin to move in the Strip - and Israel will have intelligence on their locations? It could be the Gaza Brigade Commander, Izz ad-Din Haddad or Rafah Brigade Commander Mohammed Shabana, or even Mohammed Sinwar, who replaced his brother Yahya as the leader of Hamas in Gaza. It is clear to every Israeli that these people are mortal, but Hamas is expected to demand that Israel not be able to harm its people. > Another question is how Israel will prevent Hamas from regaining power, and how extensive the mandate it will receive for this will be. In Lebanon, for example, the IDF still attacks Hezbollah targets from time to time on various grounds. It is unclear to what extent Hamas will agree to such Israeli involvement after the end of the war, or whether Israel will act in parallel with the process of releasing the hostages in a way that could lead to its arrest. Post-war Gaza and Saudi Arabia In an attempt to overcome this, the mediators are trying to present an alternative to Hamas rule 'the day after.' But while Hamas and Islamic Jihad have ostensibly agreed to the establishment of a committee of Gazan technocrats to run the enclave, under the control of the Palestinian Authority, it is precisely Chairman Mahmoud Abbas who refuses. Fatah says that they will not cooperate with such a committee, since they claim it is Hamas' way of returning to power - by placing figures identified with it in key positions. In addition, and since Hamas' military power has not been completely eliminated, and the terrorist organization is not expected to agree to disarm, it could pose enormous difficulties for any government that takes its place. All of this leads to the obvious conclusion that in order to embark on Phase Two and the 'day after,' Israel needs to be granted a certain degree of security freedom in the Gaza Strip, something Hamas has so far refused. It may allow a committee not on its behalf to run Gaza, and relinquish its position as the dominant organization, but as mentioned, this will not completely prevent its strengthening, nor will it allow Israel the security calm it expects. But despite all this, the issue of the 'day after' in the Gaza Strip has another axis: Saudi Arabia is not expected to normalize its relations with Israel as long as the war continues. It is also expected to demand a 'path' to a Palestinian state, and an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip - along with agreements regarding the Palestinian Authority's rule there - could serve as an anchor for it. In addition, if Israel agrees to a Saudi and Emirati presence in the Gaza Strip, these countries could help enforce the ceasefire outline and also prevent the rise of Hamas. Last week, the United Arab Emirates had reportedly agreed to participate in the management of Gaza temporarily, along with the U.S. and other countries, and to take care of matters of governance, security, and reconstruction of the destruction - and also to send forces at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. However, in a letter recently sent by coalition members to Netanyahu, they demanded that Israel not rely on any foreign entity - and not allow another force to replace the IDF in Gaza. All of the problems mentioned here have been addressed in recent weeks by Minister Ron Dermer, among others, who is trying to reach an understanding with the Trump administration regarding what will happen if various scenarios materialize. Israel officials say that while the Biden administration did not provide Israel with full backing, and more than once limited it in armaments, with Trump things are expected to be easier; the assessment is that if the new U.S. president sees that Hamas is not behaving properly and is violating the agreement, then the IDF will have the green light to 'enter into it,' but here too these are only estimates, and right-wing figures recently protested the 'pressure' that Trump is reportedly exerting on Israel to reach an agreement. So what do brokers do? Arab mediators and media outlets are careful to emphasize Phase I in their references to the deal, and for good reason. The U.S., Egypt, and Qatar believe that the first phase is the hardest 'opening blow,' which will lead to a dynamic that will knock down the obstacles on the way to a final end to the war. Therefore, they prefer to 'get the parties pregnant' - and discuss the most complex issues during a lull in the war, during which hostages will be released from time to time. Blum supports this approach and says that despite all the problems, 'we should not talk about Phase II, but rather motivate the other side to agree to Phase I. This will create a relationship of trust between the murderous terrorist organization and Israel, which must release all 98 hostages - four of whom have been there for about 11 years.' He explains that in the first phase, there are international guarantees, and estimates that 'the parties will begin to talk at a low intensity, out of a desire not to blow up the talks.' At the same time, Egypt is trying to accelerate the agreements between Fatah and Hamas, in order to present a suitable alternative government that can rehabilitate the Gaza Strip without the funds flowing en masse into the production of weapons. According to a report in the Qatari Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed in November, Cairo is actually working against Hamas on two parallel axes: the first is the axis of negotiations, and the second is an axis that focuses on intra-Palestinian reconciliation talks, believing that the success of its efforts in Gaza depends on achieving an intra-Palestinian agreement and establishing a committee to govern the Strip. In addition, sources involved in the negotiations believe that if Donald Trump accepts the Gaza Strip without war, he will not allow Israel to easily renew it. In light of his aggressive rhetoric in recent days, it does not seem that the president-elect will easily give up on the release of the remaining 65 hostages - especially since continuing the war would jeopardize normalization with Saudi Arabia, which is out of the question for him. However, there is a major caveat to this: this is a president whose steps are almost impossible to predict, and certainly not to rely on. It is also unclear what Trump's people promised Netanyahu, and whether the prime minister agreed to a 'small deal' because he believes that the Republican president will achieve much more for him later. Returning to uncertainty 'There have never been negotiations like this, in any respect,' says attorney Uri Slonim, who was the advisor on captives and missing persons to eight defense ministers in the past, and even managed the negotiations for the release of the missing navigator Ron Arad. According to him, the fact that the government is linking the release of the hostages to the dismantling of Hamas is also unprecedented, and therefore it is very difficult to estimate what will happen in the second phase. 'There are so many additional components to these negotiations, such as the unique circumstances in which they were conducted during fighting or the scope of the prisoners. War is a dynamic thing, and things can change on the ground in a second.' Blum, meanwhile, suggests that the country do everything it can to free the hostages and not blow up the agreements. 'We've created a situation where the Iranians are not in the region, and they will have a problem transferring funds to Hamas,' he said. 'The isolation of the terrorist organization helps us, and there's also the mediators' fear of Trump and our desire to start off on the right foot with him.' Therefore, he concludes: 'If they do sign Phase I, I will be optimistic, because the momentum will be in our favor.' In any case, the IDF is preparing for all possibilities - a full or partial withdrawal - and also for the possibility of staying and resuming fighting after Phase I. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkku2bedjl	2025-01-14T21:28:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/06/SyyLDgKLkg/SyyLDgKLkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

South Korean investigators arrest impeached President Yoon in ins...	South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection allegations, with the embattled leader saying he agreed to comply with what he called an illegal probe to avoid 'bloodshed.' His arrest, the first ever for an incumbent South Korean president, is the latest head-spinning development for one of Asia's most vibrant democracies even though the country has a history of prosecuting and imprisoning former leaders. Since lawmakers voted to stand him down after his short-lived declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon has been holed up at his hillside residence, guarded by a small army of personal security that blocked a previous arrest attempt. A defiant Yoon said he submitted himself for questioning to avoid any violence after more than 3,000 police officers marched on his residence to arrest him from the early hours of Wednesday. 'I decided to respond to the CIO's investigation - despite it being an illegal investigation - to prevent unsavory bloodshed,' Yoon said in a statement, referring to the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) that is heading the criminal probe.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byvdy64p1x	2025-01-14T20:39:58-08:00	
We are dealing with the devil'	Col. (ret.) Amit Assa on the hostage-for-ceasefire deal: 'You can't deal with the devil if you want to kill him' Israel must approach any deal with Hamas with extreme caution because 'we are dealing with the devil,' said Col. (ret.) Amit Assa, a former member of the Israeli Security Agency. 'We have to understand that this is a terror organization.' Assa emphasized that any agreement allowing Hamas to remain in control of Gaza would be 'bad for Israel.' He explained that Israel entered this war with several objectives, including releasing the hostages and annihilating Hamas. According to Assa, these two goals are inherently at odds. 'You can't deal with the devil if you want to kill him,' Assa stated. 'These two goals are getting more and more against each other. And when we see a deal to release hostages, it means directly not achieving the other goal of defeating Hamas.' While Assa acknowledged the significance of securing the hostages' release, he pointed out the broader implications of such agreements. 'So Israel perhaps does need this hostage deal to bring about a sense of unity, of solidarity, not leaving anyone behind,' he concluded, 'but there is a cost to this deal.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by2tiivwkg	2025-01-14T18:11:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/03/SkovRIH8yx/SkovRIH8yx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Is this the breakthrough Israel's hostage families have been wait...	ILTV’s Shosh Bedrosian spoke to hostage family members and shared her insights in the studio As a hostage deal gets closer, ILTV’s Shosh Bedrosian spoke to hostage family members and shared her insights in the studio. Lidar Grave-Lazi: What does it mean to these families? Bedrosian: It's just surreal to think we're actually at this point after more than a year—way more than a year—since we saw the first agreement happen in November of 2023. For the families, hearing this news, of course, it's been a game of ping-pong. For them, they hear updates, you know, from this month, this month, and now we're finally to this point where it seems as if there's some finalization going on with this deal. I've gotten close with a few of these families. They have told me it is not a deal until they get that phone call. Specifically, one of those hostage families is the family of Omri Miran. His wife has been fighting significantly to get him back home. She told me, the minute I get that phone call is the minute I know that he is on his way back. Of course, we don't know the conditions of these hostages, so there are challenges ahead. Grave-Lazie: What do the families of the hostages want to see when it comes to a deal this time around? Bedrosian: They want to see all hostages, alive and dead, as part of this deal. Some families say all the hostages don't have to come out at once in the first phase of this deal, but they want to see a plan that includes every single hostage coming home, whether they walk out or whether they're brought back to Israel for a proper burial. Here’s what some hostage families have to say: 'We’re waiting. But me personally, I don’t believe anything until I am going to see them at the border,' said Ifat Kalderon, cousin of Israeli hostage Ofer Kalderon. 'Everybody can say whatever they want.' 'I'm hopeful that this time it's going to happen and we're going to see 98 people back home,' said Shay Dickmann, cousin of Carmel Gat, who was killed in captivity.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkp6xjvwyg	2025-01-14T17:59:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/ByVPfTE4vke/ByVPfTE4vke_0_5_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Pro-Palestinian group files arrest warrant against senior IDF off...	The request for the arrest warrant is against IDF Major General Ghassan Alian The Hind Rajab Foundation, a pro-Palestinian organization known for targeting IDF soldiers abroad through legal campaigns, has filed a request in Italy for an arrest warrant against IDF Major General Ghassan Alian. Alian serves as the head of the military's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) and is accused by the group of committing war crimes. The organization announced it had submitted cases to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and informed Italian authorities of Alian's presence in Rome, demanding his immediate arrest. Alian is among the most senior IDF officers targeted by the foundation to date. The group alleges that Alian oversaw the total blockade of Gaza and accuses him of 'weaponizing famine' and targeting civilian infrastructure in acts they claim amount to genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The Hind Rajab Foundation further stated that under international law, Alian has no immunity, and Italy is obligated to act swiftly. They claim that the ICC has already issued warrants for similar crimes against other Israeli officials, alleging that Alian directly supervised policies amounting to such violations. Alian, an Israeli Druze officer in the IDF, has been instrumental in overseeing the distribution of millions of tons of humanitarian aid, including food and medicine, into Gaza as head of COGAT. 'Targeting the man responsible for facilitating humanitarian aid into Gaza—it doesn’t get more ridiculous than this,' commented a senior Israeli official. This legal campaign is the latest in a series of actions aimed at Israeli military officials, further highlighting the ongoing conflict between pro-Palestinian organizations and the Israeli government.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h15s6cnvyx	2025-01-14T17:32:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/09/SyGGQbpWJx/SyGGQbpWJx_0_7_680_383_0_small.jpg
Exclusive: Mike Evans reveals Trump's expected vision for Israel ...	Donald Trump will present a new model for the Palestinians based on peace for peace, not land for peace' Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump will solve the Palestinian refugee problem, allow Israel to exert sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, and support Israel in an attack against Iran – at least according to one of his most trusted faith advisors, Mike Evans. Evans, who emphasized that he does not speak for the president—'but I know him extremely well'—will be in Israel next week to celebrate the inauguration with an event at his Friends of Zion Museum. In a phone interview, Evans told ILTV News that 'there is only one refugee crisis that has been going on for decades and decades, and that's the Palestinians. It needs to end, and I believe it will end under Donald Trump.' Evans, one of the first evangelical Christian leaders to meet with Saudi leadership about normalization with Israel years before the Abraham Accords were signed, told ILTV that more moderate Muslim countries are 'losing their tolerance for terrorism.' As such, he believes they'll back a plan to bring peace and prosperity to the region if delivered by a strong leader like Trump. Trump has already touted peace with Saudi Arabia as a key goal for his upcoming term, aiming to build on the Abraham Accords, which established peace agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. However, Saudi Arabia has recently made several statements about its expectation of a Palestinian state in exchange for peace with Israel. Israel, on the other hand, has made it clear that a Palestinian state, by full definition, would be an existential threat to its security. In February, the Knesset Plenum passed a resolution with a large majority objecting to unilateral international recognition of a Palestinian state. Then, in July, the Knesset passed a resolution altogether rejecting Palestinian statehood, even as part of a negotiated settlement. But Evans believes this is because the right deal is not yet on the table. 'Donald Trump will present a new model for the Palestinians based on peace for peace, not land for peace,' Evans said. 'Gaza needs healthcare. They need governance. You have to build everything from zero, including reeducating the people for zero tolerance for terror,' Evans explained. 'Any plan would have to last at least three to five years and be extremely detailed to change all the dynamics in Gaza. But I believe it will happen. And I believe that Trump wants autonomy for the Palestinians.' Evans said this autonomy would not constitute a state but resemble the 'Puerto Rico' model, which former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman outlined in his recently released book, One Jewish State: The Last, Best Hope to Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. In this model, Palestinians would become state citizens, receiving essential Israeli national services while maintaining municipal self-rule and empowerment. There would be no Palestinian army, just as Puerto Rico does not have an army. Citizens would not vote in national elections, similar to Puerto Ricans. 'Puerto Rico is prospering and doing fantastic,' Evans maintained. 'It will be more like the Puerto Rico model. But for that to happen, there has to be peace for peace.' He stressed that Palestinians are not inherently radical; they have become radicalized by their terror leaders. There are around 160,000 Palestinian Americans, according to the 2023 American Community Survey, and Evans said, 'They are wonderful American citizens. They are happy. They are not radical. Why? They have not been 'Islamized'. All Palestinian people deserve dignity.' Under this new model suggested by Evans, annexation of Judea and Samaria would follow. 'I believe Donald Trump will support sovereignty over Judea and Samaria,' Evans stated. He based his assumption on Trump's choice of evangelical leader and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has long supported Jewish sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, often referred to by Christians as the biblical heartland. 'Donald Trump was elected twice because of the evangelical base in America,' Evans said. 'There are 52 million Bible believers who believe this is biblical land, and they believe if you take it from Israel, you'll go back to Genesis 12:1-3.' In Genesis 12:1-3, God gives Abraham the land of Israel and says He will make the Jews a great nation. 'I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you,' the verses conclude. Evans explained that many evangelicals interpret this to mean they would be cursed if the land changed hands. To move forward, Evans stressed that Israel must finish dismantling Hamas in Gaza. He noted that Trump has warned that Hamas would have 'hell to pay' if all 98 hostages are not returned home. Current deals only work in phases and do not ensure the immediate release of all those held by Hamas. Evans said he believes Trump 'will give Israel enormous support to finish the job in Gaza. There won't be anything holding them back.' Similarly, Evans believes Trump will support Israel in an attack against Iran. Because Trump 'is an antiwar president,' Evans said he does not believe the U.S. will take part in the attack or enter Iran. 'But he will provide everything conceivable for the State of Israel to do the job and finish it with Iran.' 'Iran is the ground zero for all Mideast terror,' Evans continued. 'Israel will have a blank check from Donald Trump to end it.' Despite Trump's sometimes unpredictable nature, Evans said that when it comes to terrorists, 'it is simply a case of good and evil, and he considers the terrorists evil.' Evans has maintained a close relationship with Trump over the past four years and with several members of his previous cabinet. The event he is holding with ILTV News at the museum on January 20 will celebrate the inauguration and bring together key thought leaders to discuss what they believe will be the incoming president's first steps. In preparation for the event, Evans launched a new campaign featuring giant billboards across Israel congratulating President Donald Trump on the start of his term as President of the United States. The message on the billboards reads: 'Congratulations Donald Trump. Israel loves you.' Evans ran a similar campaign in November 2024 when Trump was elected president, reaching audiences worldwide. Another significant campaign took place in May 2017 during Trump’s visit to Jerusalem, featuring 220 billboards across Israel. 'Donald Trump is the same Donald Trump' who supported Israel in his first term, Evans stressed. 'I believe the future for Israel over the next four years will be bright.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ierynvje	2025-01-14T16:43:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/15/SkGmg9EvJe/SkGmg9EvJe_0_20_850_479_0_small.jpg

Nine Democratic lawmakers, led by Vermont Senator Peter Welch, sent a letter to the U.S. State Department demanding clarification regarding the investigation into the circumstances of the death of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, the Turkish-American citizen who was killed by IDF gunfire during riots near Nablus in September.

The phases, the numbers and the conditions | This is the emerging...	Some 33 hostages, including the two Bibas children, are expected to be released in the first phase of the cease-fire deal, which will last 42 days - while Israel will release about 1,300 terrorists; The IDF is expected to remain on the Philadelphi Corridor and withdraw in phases to a buffer zone; In addition, the IDF is expected to leave the Netzarim Corridor and displaced persons will be able to return to the northern Gaza Strip Amid the exchange of accusations between Israel and Hamas regarding the delays in the emerging hostage deal, feverish talks to advance the agreement continue Tuesday night. In an effort to reach the finish line, the negotiations are expected to extend well into the night. The emerging outline consists of several stages, and includes a cease-fire, the release of hostages in phases, and also changes in the deployment of IDF forces in the Gaza Strip. The negotiations, which have been going on for many weeks, are being conducted under complete secrecy, among other things to prevent political pressure; but in recent days, apparently due to the narrowing of the gaps between the parties, many reports have begun to surface regarding their details. According to the outline, in the first stage, 33 hostages will be released. The list that Israel passed to Hamas included 34 hostages, hostage Youssef Ziyadne, whose body was recovered by IDF soldiers from the Gaza Strip last week, was removed from it. According to Israeli estimates, most of the hostages on the list are alive - but there is no complete certainty about this. Israel has effectively given up its demand to receive a list of live hostages - and continues to move forward with a deal without it. In the first phase of the deal, the women and the Bibas children are expected to be released. After that, female soldiers will be released, then adults over the age of 50, and those who have been defined as wounded and sick. The release is supposed to last throughout the entire first phase - over 42 days. On the 16th day of the first phase, discussions will begin on implementing the second phase of the deal. The agreement is divided into three phases, and on Monday night political sources said it may be reduced to two. During the second phase, the rest of the live hostages are supposed to be released from captivity, possibly along with the dead. After the first phase, 65 hostages are still expected to remain in Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip. Among the hostages are 36 who are defined as dead, 7 foreigners, and 22 Israeli hostages who are defined as alive. After the announcement of agreement, the deal will be submitted for approval to the Political-Security Cabinet and the government. After that, the government secretariat will publish the list of Palestinian prisoners who will be released, and the public will be given time to submit petitions against the releases to the High Court. The law states that the public will be given at least 48 hours before the implementation. The deal is expected to have majority approval in the government. In the first phase of the agreement, approximately 1,300 terrorists are expected to be released. However, since Israel does not know which of the hostages released in the first phase is alive, it is not certain that all 1,300 terrorists will be released, and the numbers could change depending on the fate of the hostages released in the first phase. Israel is demanding that terrorists with blood on their hands be exiled and not allowed to return to the West Bank, meaning that they will be exiled to the Gaza Strip, Qatar or Turkey. In the first stage, the Nukhba terrorists who were captured in Gaza will not be released. According to a Saudi report, which has not been verified by any other source, Hamas also demanded the release of the body of the terrorist organization's leader, Yahya Sinwar. A political source responded that: 'That won't happen, period.' In terms of the IDF's presence on the ground, the forces are expected to remain on the Philadelphi Corridor in the first phase, and withdraw in phases to a buffer zone to ensure that Hamas implements the deal. The IDF is supposed to leave the area of the Netzarim Corridor, which effectively separates the northern Gaza Strip from the south, and this will allow displaced Gaza residents to return to the northern Gaza Strip after undergoing security checks - the nature of which was not specified. The families of the hostages received an update from the Hostages Directorate Tuesday evening, which stated that, throughout the last few hours, consultations, situation assessments and integrative staff work required by the state for the negotiations have continued at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, a situation assessment was held by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his team with Defense Minister Israel Katz, the heads of the defense establishment, and the negotiating team in Doha. 'The negotiations are intensive, discussing details that require a conclusion, and are continuing and will continue tonight,' the Prime Minister's Office said. Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fox claimed Tuesday evening that the current deal 'is the same deal as May 27.' 'I was there in all the forums that discussed the deal,' he said. 'The current deal was rejected by Hamas for six months and even now it has not yet been approved by them. During all this time, if a positive answer had come from Hamas, it would have had a majority in the cabinet and the government. The Prime Minister did not change his position one millimeter. The only factor that thwarted the deal - Hamas.' Fear of hostage families: The second phase will not materialize In the shadow of the expectation for the return of 33 hostages in the first phase, families of hostages who are not included in the list fear that the second phase will not be implemented. On the surface, and although much remains to be seen regarding the details of the outline, it is already clear that throughout the first phase the IDF will remain in the buffer zone in the Gaza Strip, will hold positions on the Philadelphi Corridor and will evacuate the Netzarim Corridor, only while implementing a screening mechanism for Gazans who wish to return to the northern Gaza Strip. Alongside this, it is clear that the phase also includes comprehensive and extensive humanitarian assistance. However, the second phase , which includes the end of the war, effectively marks the beginning of the 'day after' in the Gaza Strip - and therefore the list of demands that Hamas has presented in the past regarding it has repeatedly crossed all of Israel's red lines. The terrorist organization's main demand, in order to agree to the release of the 65 Israeli and foreign hostages, which are its last bargaining chip, is to end the war. This is a complete end, a 'sustainable peace' without reservations, within the framework of which Israel will fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip and allow billions of dollars from other countries to be poured into its reconstruction. In addition, Hamas is expected to demand the release of a larger number of prisoners for each soldier not included in the outline in the first phase - while it also defines the young men as 'soldiers.' The terrorist organization, which wants to present some kind of achievement for the murderous surprise attack it carried out and which also brought disaster to the Gaza Strip, is also expected to demand that Israel release more 'heavyweight' prisoners in the second phase, including, for example, Palestinian leaders such as Marwan Barghouti, or Hassan Salameh - a friend of Muhammad Sinwar and a senior member of Hamas' military wing, who is serving 46 life sentences. To this must be added another problem of the second phase, which will probably emerge in the first phase: The terrorist organization is conducting the negotiations in a cynical and cruel manner and, as was the case in the previous deal, it is expected to try to introduce 'scapegoats' during the implementation of the agreement. These could present decision-makers in Israel with unbearable dilemmas, and create a dynamic of distrust that will blow up the talks. > Israel prepared for this in advance, and therefore during the first phase it will retain significant leverage over Hamas – such as remaining in the buffer zone in the Gaza Strip and in Philadelphi, but in the second phase these leverages will slowly fade, and in order for all the hostages to be released during this process it is necessary to ensure that Hamas has something to lose. Such a situation can be created, for example, through the third phase, which has already been discussed – and which guarantees the full rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip only after the release of the last hostage. One of the main difficulties the mediators encountered Is the goal declared by each side - which means that the outline for ending the war must allow both Israel and Hamas to declare 'victory.' In other words, if the unexpected does not happen, and Hamas does not back down from its demand to end the war, the question arises of what guarantees Israel will receive that the terrorist organization will indeed not take an active part in governing Gaza. In addition, Israel's security demands must also be met: From the government's perspective, the war must end with no fighting force in the Gaza Strip that poses a threat.

This is how Israel has prepared for return of hostages from Gaza,...	Israeli authorities already briefed social workers on the support process, with special emphasis on addressing sexual assault cases; Health Ministry will focus on psychological care, while Justice Ministry will handle prisoner releases and petitions to High Cour to stop them, while Israel Prison Service will prevent victory displays such as those seen during the 2011 Shalit deal Since the reports emerged regarding the progress of negotiations for a hostage deal, all relevant authorities have been preparing for the potential return of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza for the last 466 days. The Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry has been conducting repeated briefings for social workers to prepare them for the reception and support of the hostages upon their return. These briefings were held even though no official instructions have been received from the Hostage Administration or the Prime Minister’s Office. Should the deal come to fruition, security forces will be the first to receive the hostages and provide them with initial physical and psychological assistance. They will then be transferred to hospitals, where social workers from the Health Ministry and the hospitals will offer further support. In addition to medical examinations, the returning hostages will begin a gradual process of coping with their prolonged captivity under Hamas. They will receive professional help tailored to their individual needs, depending on their condition and willingness to share their experiences. Upon returning home, each released hostage will be assigned a social worker who will address all their needs and assist in their rehabilitation. Social workers already know who they will be supporting, and they have detailed files about the hostages, including information on where they were abducted from, whether they lost close relatives, and their backgrounds prior to the October 7 massacre. According to officials, social workers have also been briefed on how to address possible cases of sexual assault during captivity. There is also an understanding that the mental health of the hostages expected to be released will be significantly more challenging than those who returned after 50 days of captivity in the previous deal in November 2023. > The Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry emphasized that 'we see the care and rehabilitation of the hostages and their families as a national mission and a professional commitment of the highest priority, and we have been preparing over the past year for their return, relying on the accumulated experience from previous hostage receptions. Our professional teams, including social workers and treatment personnel, are ready to ensure the best possible support. Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of the Public Health Division at the Health Ministry, told Ynet that the health system has learned a great deal from previous hostage releases. 'We must understand that the conditions here are truly different. People are arriving after over a year in captivity, and it’s a completely different world. But the lessons learned from the previous reception process will serve us.' 'The Ministry of Health led the effort to receive the injured at hospitals during the previous round, and we learned a lot from that,' she added. 'It’s important to see what other health or welfare issues arise over time, as not everything surfaces in the first days of hospitalization, so long-term follow-up is also crucial. We are preparing.' Regarding what has been learned from previous release rounds, the senior official in the Health Ministry stated: 'It’s important to ensure they are surrounded, to protect them from the media, from all kinds of curious individuals who want to talk. They need privacy. We must also make space for their families and those they want to be with. Additionally, there must be room for necessary medical tests to ensure proper health checks such as vitamins, minerals, and any nutritional deficiencies. We need to monitor and understand what needs to be tracked.' Preparing for opposition to releasing terrorists Meanwhile, the State Attorney’s Office is preparing draft responses for potential petitions to the High Court of Justice, anticipating legal challenges to prevent the release of terrorists. The Pardon Department of the Justice Ministry is completing the necessary forms and requests for clemency for the security prisoners. This is all being done to ensure the swift completion of the deal with Hamas. Accordingly, officials from the Attorney General’s office are expected to reach out to families affected by terrorist attacks – victims of terrorist organizations – to allow them to pursue legal appeals if they wish to challenge the release of a particular terrorist who harmed them. Senior legal sources indicate that the deal with Hamas is expected to be approved by the High Court of Justice quickly, likely without delving into the specifics of individual cases. Instead, the Court will likely rule that such decisions are 'non-justiciable,' meaning they involve supreme political and security considerations where the court refrains from intervening. Officials from the Pardon Department, the High Court Division, the Israel Prison Service (IPS), the Military Prosecution, and other security bodies have already started meeting to implement the expected government decision on the prisoner release framework. Once the deal is signed, a 'release order' will be prepared for each prisoner. The Justice Ministry is preparing to publish the names of the released prisoners on its website to allow families of the victims 48 hours to file an appeal. Prisoners sentenced by civilian courts will receive a pardon from the government and the President. 'There's no going back to the Shalit Deal' Alongside the preparations for receiving the hostages, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) is preparing for the transfer of security prisoners expected to be released from Israeli prisons as part of the deal. IPS Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi recently instructed to step up preparations for this operation. The list of released prisoners will be made public only after the deal is signed. It is already clear that some of the prisoners to be released will be those convicted of severe offenses and sentenced to multiple life terms. Based on lessons from the past, the IPS has decided that prisoners will not be allowed to extend their hands during the transfer in buses, aiming to prevent scenes like those that remain burned in the public memory from the 2011 deal to recover IDF soldier Gilad Shalit, when several released prisoners made victory signs. The current plan is that the prisoners will be transferred in buses with tinted windows or without upper windows. 'The victory signs from the buses during the previous prisoner release 14 years ago will not happen again,' according to an IPS official. The preparations also include security for the transportation of prisoners in armored convoys from various prisons across the country to the Ofer facility, where the release will take place. IPS special units, including the Masada unit and other security teams, will be part of the security operation. Furthermore, the IPS is preparing to receive prisoners currently under the control of the IDF and transfer them to its custody until their release. Another key concern is preventing the newly released prisoners from sending messages to their fellow inmates who will not be released. Israel Prison Service Chief Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi expressed concern over the possibility of riots in prisons after the deal is completed. The fear is that prisoners who are not included in the release lists may feel they have nothing to lose and could challenge the system, attempting to disrupt order in the prisons. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjgpmrnwjx	2025-01-14T12:28:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/24/rJipur0E6/rJipur0E6_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

IDF launches airstrike on Jenin in West Bank	An Israeli Air Force aircraft attacked the terrorist stronghold, a month after Palestinian security forces launched an operation against Islamic Jihad there. In a joint operation, an Israeli Air Force aircraft attacked the Palestinian city of Jenin in the West Bank on Tuesday night, the IDF and Shin Bet spokespeople announced. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, five people were killed and two were injured in the attack. In December, Palestinian Authority security forces launched an operation against members of the Jenin Brigade, affiliated with Islamic Jihad. The operation was somewhat successful, and its members arrested more than 280 terrorists accused of shooting at Palestinian forces, possessing and trafficking weapons, and colluding with hostile foreign elements who financed them. > This week, Palestinian Authority security forces spokesman Anwar Rajab announced at a special press conference held in the Jenin municipality, the arrest of 'outlaws' affiliated with the Jenin Brigade, including suspects who received funds from Iran. However, the security forces are having difficulty gaining the trust of the residents of Jenin and the nearby refugee camp, who have complained about the conditions and the 'siege,' as they put it, imposed by the PA security forces. At the same time, Israel did not shower much praise on the activities of the security forces, and an Israeli security source told Reuters news agency that 'they have a great desire to carry out security operations - but their capabilities are poor.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjgg0s4d1x	2025-01-14T12:04:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/rJeNBnBEPJe/rJeNBnBEPJe_0_311_474_267_0_small.jpg
Biden to lift U.S. designation of Cuba as state sponsor of terror...	U.S. President Joe Biden will relax sanctions targeting long-time foe Cuba days before Donald Trump takes office in a broad set of steps on Tuesday that he expects to lead to release of political prisoners in Havana. As part of the steps, Biden is reversing several hardline restrictions put in place by Trump, his predecessor and the president-elect. Those steps include notifying Congress of plans to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism and undoing a Trump order that had restricted some financial transactions with some military and government-tied Cubans, according to a senior administration official. Biden was also set to suspend the ability of individuals to use U.S. courts to make claims for potentially confiscated property in Cuba following Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, the official said.

Tactically pushed back and strategically defeated: With Trump's return to the White House, Kyiv braces for a shift that may work against it; Putin is already preparing for a meeting with Trump, and it’s unclear whether he has any interest in ending the war with the president-elect on his side Less than a week before President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House, and amid reports from both sides that efforts are underway to organize a summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin in the coming weeks, uncertainty looms over Ukraine due to the complex and challenging situation on the frontlines of the war. Currently, Russian forces control more than 18% of Ukraine’s sovereign territory, including Crimea. Russian military units continue to make consistent advances in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the western Donetsk region, capitalizing on the Ukrainian army’s severe shortage of personnel, particularly experienced fighters, and its struggle to defend a long front line. For some time now, Ukrainians have grown increasingly doubtful of their ability to reclaim territories occupied by Russia. Kyiv also fears that Russian forces may expand their occupied areas, especially as the expected Trump administration seeks to bring an end to the war or freeze the conflict. Recently, Russian forces have advanced south of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, an important logistical and transportation hub, and appear to be attempting to encircle it. Russian advances have also been reported in the Luhansk region. Despite pressure from the Washington administration, Ukraine continues to refuse to draft young men aged 18 to 25 into the military. Currently, men between the ages of 25 and 60 are being recruited, with many of the soldiers over the age of 43, highlighting the severe shortage of experienced fighters. > While awaiting Trump’s return to the White House and the possibility of negotiations to end the war, Ukrainians are working to increase international support. On Friday, a regular meeting of NATO defense ministers took place at the Ramstein base in Germany, which is used by both NATO and the U.S. Air Force. Ukraine is not a member of the military alliance, but President Volodymyr Zelensky attended the gathering. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov also attended, stating that Ukraine's priorities for 2025 will be stabilizing the frontlines and strengthening defense capabilities. In addition to the Biden administration’s announcement of an additional $500 million in military aid to Ukraine, other nations in the forum pledged to continue providing military support, including air defense systems and drones. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin emphasized that the coalition supporting Kyiv throughout the war 'must continue to stand by Ukraine and strengthen its position for the eventual possibility of negotiations that will, at some point, bring an end to Putin’s monstrous war.' It is still unclear whether the forum will continue to meet after Trump is inaugurated on January 20, and a new administration takes office in the U.S. Retired General Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy on Ukraine, said in a television interview last week that: 'People need to understand, Trump is not trying to give anything to Putin or the Russians. He is trying to preserve Ukraine’s sovereignty and ensure it, and he will do so fairly and honestly.' Kellogg also stated that Trump intends to try to end the war within 100 days of entering the White House. This declaration sounds very optimistic, perhaps overly so, given the vast differences between the two sides. At this point, it’s unclear whether Putin, who currently has the momentum on his side, has any real interest in ending the fighting, especially if he believes that Trump will significantly reduce U.S. aid to Ukraine. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skl1qn4vkx	2025-01-14T10:52:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/07/H1BPotqZyg/H1BPotqZyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
French Socialist Party raises threat of backing no-confidence vot...	The French Socialist Party, whose support Francois Bayrou's minority government has been trying to secure for weeks, on Tuesday raised the threat of backing a no-confidence vote against the government later this week. The Socialists, who voted down previous budget proposals in December in conjunction with far-right lawmakers and thereby precipitated the fall of Michel Barnier's government, have made concessions on the 2023 pension reform a condition for support. Earlier in the day, during a speech to Parliament, Bayrou opened the door to renegotiating the disputed pension reform but Faure said this was not good enough. 'We will back a no-confidence vote, unless we get a clear response to our demands,' Faure told the TF1 evening news bulletin on Tuesday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sybnsevdkl	2025-01-14T10:30:35-08:00

Kill every last member of Hamas': Trump defense secretary nomine...	Pete Hegseth, a Fox News anchor with no political experience, will soon be in charge of the Pentagon; In a Senate hearing, Hegseth sided with Israel, saying: 'I robustly support the state of Israel and its existential defense' Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense, arrived for a Senate hearing Tuesday. Members of Trump's future Cabinet are required to attend a hearing and answer questions from lawmakers, who are then expected to vote on and formally confirm the appointment. Hegseth's hearingbefore the Senate Foreign Relations and National Security Committee was stormy and lasted hours. It dealt with controversies surrounding the politically inexperienced Hegseth, including his drinking habits and his relationship with women in the shadow of a complaint of sexual assault. Hegseth, a former Fox News anchor, is said to have been chosen as Trump's nominee because the president-elect liked his television appearances. He responded to most questions at the hearing with attacks on the 'leftist' media, or with religious-sounding answers such as: 'I failed at many things in my life, and Jesus saved me.' Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense is 44 and a former captain in the U.S. National Guard. He has extensive combat experience, and served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and other places. Hegseth became friends with Trump during the years he worked at Fox News, when hosted him on his show. The choice of the inexperienced Hegseth stunned not only the Pentagon, but also Trump's advisers. Quite a few Republicans reacted rather coolly to the choice of someone who had combat experience in the field, but not in government management, certainly not a huge department like the Department of Defense. Hegseth is known for his staunch opposition to women serving in combat, and has previously accused the U.S. military of lowering standards to allow women to join combat units. In a recent book, Hegseth railed against initiatives in the military designed to make it more diverse and equal. The defense secretary-designate also questioned whether U.S. Chief of Staff Charles Brown was chosen for the position because he is black. 'I don't believe you are qualified for the position,' Democratic Senator Jack Reid, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and National Security Committee, told Hegseth. At the Senate hearing, Hegseth said he would consider removing women from combat roles, and would also change the military's policy on combating climate change. He avoided committing to resigning if he were caught drunk while serving as defense secretary, and did not answer the question of whether he would follow Trump's order to shoot protesters in the legs. During the hearing, Hegseth was asked if he defined himself as a Christian-Zionist, and he replied: ''I am a Christian and I robustly support the state of Israel and its existential defense and the way America comes alongside them as their great ally.' He also said that 'I support Israel in destroying and killing every last member of Hamas.' He added that the United States should distance itself from 'the complications of the Middle East' and concentrate on 'the threats coming from China and the Indo-Pacific region.' The committee, which has a Republican majority, will next vote on whether to forward Hegseth's nomination to a vote of the entire Senate. > Trump himself, who has been following the hearing with incessant social media posts, will become the 47th president of the United States on Monday afternoon. Unlike his term as the 45th president, this time when he takes office the U.S. system of checks and balances will not hinder him since both the House of Representatives and the Senate have Republican majorities. Trump promises to sign hundreds of executive orders on his first day in office and launch his promised campaign of revenge. According to a report by the Associated Press, senior officials in the incoming administration have already begun investigating long-time civil servants on the White House National Security Council. They are checking who these people voted for in the last election and whether they posted on social media against Trump. At least some of those employees have already started packing their belongings, after receiving indications that they will not remain employed in the new administration. Meanwhile, the office of former first lady Michelle Obama announced that she does not plan to attend the ceremony where Trump will replace Joe Biden. Husband Barack Obama will attend the ceremony, as will former presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton, accompanied by their wives. Elon Musk -Trump's close associate, who will hold an official position in the incoming administration, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos will sit on the main stage at the ceremony. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skbm3xnpyx	2025-01-14T10:02:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/BJ94qf7NP1g/BJ94qf7NP1g_0_136_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Nawaf Salam, who has been designated as the new Prime Minister of Lebanon, has resigned as a member of the International Court of Justice, said the ICJ on Tuesday. Salam's term as head of the ICJ had been due to end in early February 2027. Earlier this week, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun summoned Salam to designate him prime minister after most lawmakers had nominated him, dealing a big blow to Hezbollah, which accused opponents of seeking to exclude it.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syxlcxvdkx	2025-01-14T09:35:22-08:00

Both my hands are extended to everyone,' Lebanon's PM-designate ...	Nawaf Salam, who has been serving as presiding judge at the International Court of Justice,, reaches out to Hezbollah, says time for 'a new chapter' in Lebanon 'rooted in justice, security, progress and opportunities'; But possible sectarian rift could ruin everything Lebanon's Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam said on Tuesday his hands were 'extended to everyone,' in a gesture to Iran-backed Hezbollah, that accused opponents of seeking to exclude it by nominating him for the post. President Joseph Aoun formally designated Salam, who has been serving as presiding judge at the International Court of Justice, to form the next government on Tuesday, after he won the backing of a majority of lawmakers the previous day. Salam's nomination has reflected a dramatic shift in the power balance in Lebanon, a result of the heavy blows dealt to Hezbollah in last year's war with Israel, compounded by the ousting last month of its Syrian ally Bashar Assad. It follows last week's election of Aoun, the former head of the Lebanese army who has U.S. and Saudi support. Speaking after the meeting, Salam said he was committed to rebuilding from last year's war between Israel and Hezbollah, and that it was time for 'a new chapter' in Lebanon 'rooted in justice, security, progress and opportunities.' Reconstruction 'requires the full implementation of (U.N.) Resolution 1701 and all provisions of the cease-fire agreement and the imposition of the enemy’s complete withdrawal from the last occupied inch of our lands', he said, referring to Israel. Hezbollah had wanted outgoing Prime Minister Najib Mikati to keep the job, and believed this had been secured under the terms of a political understanding by which its lawmakers endorsed Aoun as president last week, Hezbollah sources say. But Salam emerged with the endorsement of 84 out of parliament's 128 lawmakers, among them Christians, Druze and Sunni Muslim MPs, including both Hezbollah allies and opponents. Another sectarian rift possible Hezbollah and the allied Shi'ite Amal Movement, which together hold all seats in parliament reserved for Shi'ite Muslims, endorsed nobody, and have indicated they do not intend to join Salam's government. This raises the prospect of a fresh sectarian rift - unless he can convince them otherwise. Salam said he supported unity and was against exclusion. 'This is my sincere call and both my hands are extended to everyone,' he said. Aoun, in comments published on the presidency's X feed, said Salam's nomination was 'a democratic process' while appearing to acknowledge Hezbollah's concern, saying that 'if one group is broken, all of Lebanon is broken.' Hezbollah had long held decisive sway over such appointments, its role underpinned by the powerful arsenal which critics say has undermined the state and unilaterally dragged Lebanon into regional wars. Under Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, the presidency goes to a Maronite Christian, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament must be a Shi'ite. > Salam said he would work for justice for victims of the 2020 Beirut port explosion. No senior official has been held to account for the blast, which killed at least 220 people and arose from the detonation of hundreds of tonnes of ammonium nitrate. He also said he would work for justice for depositors whose savings have been frozen inside the Lebanese financial system since it collapsed in 2019, the result of decades of corruption and waste by the ruling elite. 'We have wasted many opportunities to build the state. Enough wasted opportunities,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1iicmndyg	2025-01-14T08:39:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/13/ByplcCGwke/ByplcCGwke_0_135_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

US designates extreme right-wing 'Terrorgram' network as terroris...	The U.S. imposed sanctions on an extreme right-wing online network, designating the 'Terrorgram' collective a terrorist group and accusing it of promoting violent white supremacy. The U.S. State Department said in a statement that it had designated the group, which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site, and three of its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. The State Department said the group has motivated and facilitated attacks and attempted attacks by users, including a 2022 shooting outside an LGBTQ bar in Slovakia, a planned attack in 2024 on energy facilities in New Jersey and an August knife attack at a mosque in Turkey. The action freezes any of the group's U.S. assets and bars Americans from dealing with it. The leaders targeted on Monday with sanctions were based in Brazil, Croatia and South Africa, according to the statement. Telegram in a statement on Tuesday said: 'Calls to violence have no place on Telegram's platform. Telegram's Moderators removed several channels that used variations of the 'Terrorgram' name when they were discovered years ago. Similar content is banned whenever it appears.' In September, U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two alleged leaders of 'Terrorgram', saying they used Telegram to solicit attacks on Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people and immigrants with the aim of inciting a race war.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rylh5mewyg	2025-01-14T08:12:28-08:00

Trump says will create 'External Revenue Service' to collect from...	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday he will create a new department called the External Revenue Service 'to collect tariffs, duties, and all revenue' from foreign sources. Trump said in a social media post he would create the department on Jan. 20, the day he will be inaugurated as president for a second term. 'Through soft and pathetically weak trade agreements, the American economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves. It is time for that to change,' the Republican said in a post on Truth Social. 'We will begin charging those that make money off of us with trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share.' Trump has pledged to impose big tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners - Canada, Mexico and China - including a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico until they clamped down on drugs and migrants crossing the border. He has also vowed impose tariffs of 10% on global imports into the United States, along with a 60% tariff on Chinese goods - duties that trade experts say would upend trade flows, raise costs and draw retaliation against U.S. exports.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjfg5fvpyg	2025-01-14T08:09:54-08:00	
Blinken says deal closer than ever, ball in Hamas' court as prepa...	U.S. secretary of state says if Hamas accepts the deal it is ready to be implemented, and he believes a cease-fire will be reached; Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad delegation arriving in Doha, and Saudi report says Red Cross preparing for transfer U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday said that negotiators were on the brink of an agreement on a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal, adding that parties are awaiting final word from Hamas. 'It's right on the brink. It's closer than it's ever been before. But, right now, as we sit here, we await final word from Hamas on its acceptance, and until we get that word, we'll remain on the brink,' Blinken said during an event at the Atlantic Council. 'The ball is now in Hamas’ court. If Hamas accepts, the deal is ready to be concluded and implement it. I believe we will get a ceasefire. Whether we get there in the remaining days of our administration, or after January 20, the deal will follow closely the terms of the agreement that President Biden put forward last May and that our administration rallied the world behind,' he said. Blinken added that post-war Gaza should be under the control of the Palestinian Authority but with interim roles for foreign players and the United Nations. 'We believe that the Palestinian Authority should invite international partners to help establish and run an interim administration with responsibility for key civil sectors in Gaza,' Blinken said, revealing a long-awaited plan for post-war Gaza as his term ends. 'You have to look at what would be enduring and what would make sure that the program doesn’t come back. So one of the things you have to assess is: If that were to happen, would Iran simply rebuild and rebuild even deeper underground in a place that would be even harder to get to?' Blinken responds. Blinken also criticized both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. 'Israelis must abandon the myth that they can carry out de facto annexation without cost and consequence to Israel’s democracy, to its standing, and to its security,' he said. He pointed to rapid settlement expansion, stating that 'Israel is expanding official settlements and nationalizing land at a faster clip than any time in the last decade while turning a blind eye to unprecedented growth in illegal outposts.' Blinken also expressed concern over rising settler violence, adding: 'Violent attacks by extremist settlers against Palestinian civilians have reached record levels.' The Americans are very active in behind-the-scenes negotiations, and are supporting the talks with a strong presence that includes the CIA team, Biden's envoy Brett McGurk, and Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff. Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad, which is also holding hostages, announced that a senior delegation from the organization would arrive in Doha Tuesday night to participate in the talks on the hostage deal. The Saudi television channel Al-Hadath reported Tuesday evening, citing sources, that in the Gaza Strip, 'hostage-takers have begun to be transferred to safe places in preparation for the implementation of the agreement.' It was also reported that 'Hamas has begun dividing the hostages into groups in preparation for their release.' In addition, the report said, 'some disputes between Israel and Hamas have been resolved, and Israel has agreed to the request not to re-arrest prisoners after their release. In addition, an agreement was reached to stop all future attacks on Hamas leaders.' The Qatari channel Al-Arabi reported, citing Egyptian sources, that 'the authorities responsible for operating the Rafah crossing have received official notices calling on them to prepare for its opening within days.' According to the report, 'Israel will evacuate the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing when the cease-fire agreement comes into effect.' > The Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed noted, citing Palestinian sources, that the IDF had begun dismantling infrastructure it had built on the Netzarim Corridor in preparation for the hostage deal. According to the report, 'local eyewitnesses in Gaza said that military transport vehicles entered the Netzarim Corridor, one of the important strategic points in the Strip, and began the process of dismantling military towers in the west of the corridor.' The Saudi television network Al-Arabiya added that 'coordination has begun with intermediaries and the Red Cross regarding the transfer of the hostages.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rpwznv1x	2025-01-14T08:07:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/19/S1kqhlbj0/S1kqhlbj0_0_0_565_310_0_small.jpg

Supreme Court rejects Palestinian Authority appeal to overturn te...	Court ruled that PA directly finances terrorism through payments to terrorists and their families and, therefore, overturns claim the law intends to bring about the PA's economic collapse After the Palestinian Authority petitioned the Supreme Court last year and requested to overturn a law which allows victims of terrorism to demand compensation from the entity that finances it, Supreme Court Justice and Acting President Isaac Amit rejected the PA's petition on Monday. Amit ruled that 'we will begin and say what is absent from the petition but deserves to be said: The Palestinian Authority pays terrorists and members of their families significant amounts of money and benefits, in close connection with the criminal acts of terrorism they committed.' Amit also ruled that 'even if the law is based on a political motive, this does not lead to its repeal.' Justice Khaled Kabub and Justice Yael Wilner also joined Amit in the decision. In May, the Palestinian Authority petitioned the Supreme Court to strike down the Compensation for Terror Victims Law (Exemplary Damages), enacted in 2024 by the Knesset. The law establishes entitlement to compensation in tort claims filed against a perpetrator of a terrorist act, a person determined to be liable for an act of terrorism, or an entity that supports the perpetrator. The law states that if the act of terrorism caused the death of a person, his heirs will be entitled to compensation. It was also determined that the compensation will be paid in addition to any other compensation awarded in a tort claim filed due to the same act, and that the damages will not be deducted from any amount paid by the state or one of its institutions to the injured party or his next of kin. According to the Palestinian Authority, the laws should be scrapped due to their 'inappropriate purpose and the disproportionate harm to the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian residents,' in violation of Israel's obligations under international law. It was claimed that another hidden purpose is to bring the Palestinian Authority to economic collapse 'and to undermine its sovereignty in order to complete the annexation of the West Bank to Israeli territory.' According to the PA, there are approximately 180 claims pending against it for compensation for acts of terrorism. The PA further argued that the Knesset does not have the authority to enact a law intended to apply extraterritorially to the assets of another sovereign, and that the laws violate basic legal rules and change the law of torts. Amit rejected the PA's petition and cited in the ruling a quote from his ruling in an earlier case, where he noted that 'the PA's compensation policy is disgusting. It is intolerable. The heart shrinks and rejects it. The eye feels its sting strongly. The metaphorical sting of the eye joins the pain and anguish of the heart and soul of the families of the victims of terrorist attacks and we cannot list them because they are many.' The ruling shows that the Palestinian Authority's payments to terrorists and members of their families amount to hundreds of millions of shekels each year. 'The reason why the law applies to the Palestinian Authority and defines it as a 'terrorist rewarder' lies in its own actions and its policy of paying salaries and benefits to terrorists and members of terrorist families,' Amit stated. 'In enacting the laws before us, the legislator sought to deter those involved in committing terrorist acts and those who approve of these acts, and to establish arrangements that benefit their victims. It would have been better if the need for their enactment had not arisen in the first place, but unfortunately this is not the case. For a number of reasons, we found that there is no constitutional basis for interfering with the law challenged in the petition, even though they deviate from the normal tort laws,' he added. Amit further ruled that the PA 'claims a violation of its rights, but the alleged violation stems from its actions and its choice to pay money and benefits to murderers stained with the blood of innocent Israelis. The Palestinian Authority has the option of choosing a different path and to cease its policy that rewards and encourages carrying out terrorist acts.' Compensation does not depend on disability The law stipulates that the heirs of a person killed as a result of an act of terrorism will be entitled to 10 million shekels, while a person injured by an act of terrorism and permanently disabled will be entitled to 5 million shekels. This means that the punitive compensation that can be awarded for a single event will reach tens of millions of shekels. The PA pointed out that there are approximately 180 lawsuits pending against it, in which hundreds of injured parties are suing, so that the amount of liability that could be imposed on it could reach billions of shekels. Imposing these amounts on the Palestinian Authority carries with it political and security implications. It is not without reason that different positions were heard during the legislative process regarding certain aspects of the law. Compensation also established at a uniform level of 5 million shekels, regardless of the degree of disability, contradicts the basic principles of tort law, but in the constitutional context this is not a reason to repeal this part of the law. > Attorney Dr. Asaf Posner, who represented the families of the victims in the proceedings demanding compensation, noted that 'the Supreme Court's decision should put an end to the claims of the Palestinian Authority, which is trying to evade providing compensation for criminal acts of terrorism. The plaintiffs say they hope that the state will quickly transfer funds to the victims who have already succeeded in their claims. We hope there will be no obstacles for the transfer of the funds approved by the claims, the Knesset, and now the Supreme Court.' Attorney. Ravid Sharon, who represents victims of terrorism, stated that 'the fact that the state is investing efforts in economic warfare on terrorism is bearing fruit. As someone who represents clients who were targeted by terrorists and their aides, including the Palestinian Authority, I see how economic warfare is beneficial in reducing the encouragement of terrorism.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1rqby4pyg	2025-01-14T06:35:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/11/26/H1hTqD6cv/H1hTqD6cv_0_0_1024_577_0_small.jpg

ICC prosecutor tells court to reject Israeli appeal on Gaza war p...	After Israel suggests conflict of interest by Karim Khan, the ICC prosecutor responds to the Israeli objections to the investigation into the 13-month war in Gaza, advising the judges to reject the claims The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has told judges that Israeli objections to the investigation into the 13-month war in Gaza should be rejected. Karim Khan submitted his formal response late Monday to an appeal by Israel over The Hague-based court's jurisdiction after judges issued arrest warrants last year for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister, and Hamas' military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Gaza. The embattled Israeli leader, who is also facing corruption charges in his home country, called the arrest warrant 'a black day in the history of nations' and vowed to fight the allegations. Individuals cannot contest an arrest warrant directly, but the state of Israel can object to the entire investigation. Israel argued in a December filing that it could look into allegations against its leaders on its own and that continuing to investigate Israelis was a violation of state sovereignty. The ICC was established in 2002 as the permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the world's most heinous atrocities: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression.

US agencies warn of potential New Orleans copycat attack	The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned of a potential public safety threat from violent extremists who might try to copy the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people. The warning comes a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. 'The FBI and DHS are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory attacks due to the persistent appeal of vehicle ramming as a tactic for aspiring violent extremist attackers,' the agencies said in a statement. Early on New Year's Day, more than a dozen people and a dozen others injured about when a man rammed a rented pickup truck into a crowd of revelers along Bourbon Street in New Orleans. The man who carried out the attack was a U.S. Army veteran who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State and appeared to have made recordings condemning music, drugs and alcohol.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk5qkxew1g	2025-01-14T05:08:07-08:00	
Head of hostage NGO believes US journalist Tice still in Syria	The head of an American organization focused on hostage releases said on Monday he believes U.S. journalist Austin Tice was still being held in Syria by people loyal to toppled leader Bashar al-Assad. Speaking to Reuters in Damascus, Nizar Zakka said he believed Tice was being held by 'very few people in a safe house in order to do an exchange or a deal.' Zakka, a Lebanese businessman with U.S. permanent residency who was held in Iran for four years until 2019 on charges of spying, is the president of Hostage Aid Worldwide. He has traveled to Syria multiple times following Assad's ouster by rebels on Dec. 8 in a bid to track down Tice, a former U.S. Marine and a freelance journalist who was abducted in 2012 while reporting in Damascus on the uprising against Assad. Zakka said his group's own investigation had revealed Tice was still in Syria, and that 'a lot of progress' had been made in his hunt in recent weeks. But he added that Syria's new rulers, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), had not provided much assistance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjwlklnd1x	2025-01-14T05:07:01-08:00	
The first time I dared to dance again opened my mind': Helping N...	As Israel grappled with the shock of the events of October 7, Nova festival survivors and their families faced a series of challenges for which there was no institutional support. Stepping in to help were New York’s Jewish community, which has donated over 10 million shekels to various organizations and initiatives aiding in the recovery process. 'Without them we would be in a completely different place,' says Nova Tribe co-founder Naama Shmulevitz 'At first, I couldn’t even leave the house,' recalls Orian Shtaif, a survivor of the Nova Festival massacre. Like many others who endured the horror, Shtaif emerged physically unscathed but deeply emotionally scarred. 'I was in a very dark place,' she says. 'I couldn’t even begin to understand what post-trauma meant, what trauma was, or what I had experienced there.' The loss of trust in her surroundings, combined with overwhelming emotions, left her struggling with negative thoughts. It was the UJA-Federation of New York that stepped in to support Shtaif and other survivors. The philanthropic organization quickly backed several initiatives established in the aftermath of October 7, including Nova Tribe, a group founded by the festival’s organizers. 'The Jewish Diaspora was there for us from the start,' says Naama Shmulevitz, one of Nova Tribe's founders. 'We formed an incredible bond built on mutual trust. Their support allowed us to expand our activities—community days, wellness events, and social workshops. It wasn’t just financial assistance; it was a genuine partnership. Without the New York Federation (UJA), we would be in a completely different place.' UJA’s contribution to Nova survivors is part of a broader, massive aid effort for those impacted by the war. To date, more than 10 million shekels have been allocated to support organizations working with Nova survivors and their families. These funds have helped establish therapeutic farms focused on mental health and healing, fund community events, and launch rehabilitation programs for survivors, their families, and bereaved families. 'This is an unprecedented event that the world has never seen before,' says Gabriel Sod, Director of Government Relations at UJA Federation New York. 'Hundreds murdered, dozens taken hostage at a festival. How do you even respond to something like this? It forced us to think differently, to look for creative solutions. If there’s one defining feature of the Nova community, it’s exactly that—creative, socially innovative entrepreneurs who, just days after the massacre, approached us with groundbreaking ideas to support the survivors.' Still living through the trauma One such initiative is SafeHeart, a program dedicated to supporting survivors. As Efrat Atun, the organization’s CEO, explains: 'Our organization was founded by people who had already been providing emotional support at parties for years. We began operating on October 7 itself. We set up a website and reached out to those who attended the festival to connect them with therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers. Within two weeks, 500 volunteers were assisting 2,500 individuals.' 'At first, we thought we were only here for a short time, like damage control,' Atun continues. 'By mid-October, we realized we had misread the situation. This terrorist attack happened on October 7 but, in many ways, is still ongoing. People are still living through it. That’s when we decided to formally establish the organization.' 'Beyond providing individual support,' says Gabriel Sod, 'we quickly understood that the cornerstone of our strategy with the festival survivors had to be the community—not just the survivors themselves, the bereaved families, and the survivors' families, but also the community as a whole. Just days after October 7, the festival organizers set a goal: ‘We will dance again,’ and began a journey of healing and rebuilding the community. We knew our role was to help them accomplish this goal.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The support from the Jewish Diaspora enabled not only an immediate response but also the development of long-term solutions. 'Our donors in New York understood that this is a commitment extending beyond the immediate crisis—it’s an ongoing partnership.' As Atun explains: 'UJA-NY is our most significant partner. Since December and January, we’ve been in close contact. They not only provided financial support but also connected us with additional foundations, the government, and strategic partners. They helped us establish retreats and group processes for survivors and their families, showing them they are not alone.' To date, SafeHeart has supported around 3,000 survivors and 500 family members, with over 1,000 individuals currently receiving ongoing therapy. Over the past year, more than 26,000 hours of therapy have been provided. 'The first time I dared to dance again, after a period when I couldn’t even listen to music, it opened my mind,' says Shtaif. 'I realized that it’s okay not to feel okay. I have people I can rely on, and the strength comes from the community.' Still, despite extensive efforts, many survivors face a long road to recovery. 'Most survivors have not yet returned to their routines,' emphasizes Atun. 'They need continued support from both the community and the state. We are committed to standing by them and ensuring they are not alone. The trauma is still very raw. We’re deeply concerned and understand how much work lies ahead and how much the survivors still need us.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjl1vjvd1l	2025-01-14T04:29:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/02/r1Jli14L1x/r1Jli14L1x_0_131_1504_847_0_small.jpg

Katz introduces Haredi exemption law waiving service for most unt...	Security minister briefs Knesset committee without IDF representatives, shows plan to draft 50% of the ultra-Orthodox men eligible for service after seven years; mother of fallen soldier in protest march calling for equal draft for all The Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, chaired by MK Yuli Edelstein, convened with Defense Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday to be briefed on the proposed draft exemption law for the ultra-Orthodox sector. After nearly six months of closed-door negotiations among coalition leaders, Katz didn’t introduce a draft of law as promised but presented 'principles to achieve the goal of significantly increasing the number of yeshiva students serving in the military, while regulating the status of those engaged in full-time Torah study.' Katz, who attended the meeting without IDF representatives, said he came to present principles for 'advancing a framework to integrate tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox individuals into meaningful service in the IDF, while ensuring conditions that respect their lifestyle. This aims to alleviate the burden on reservists and active-duty soldiers.' In addition to integrating the ultra-Orthodox, Katz said that he would not promote a law with the principle of 'preserving the Jewish Torah world,' which he views as 'a central foundation of our existence as a people and as a Jewish state in the Land of Israel. Katz outlined a main goal of drafting 50% of 19-year-olds from the ultra-Orthodox community, with a gradual timeline for achieving this. According to the IDF's projections, 4,800 ultra-Orthodox men would be drafted in the first year, increasing to 5,700 in the second year, with incremental increases each year thereafter. However, the IDF has previously said that it would have no limitation on absorbing additional soldiers starting in 2026. Despite this position, when asked when the draft rate for ultra-Orthodox youth would reach 50%, Katz responded it would only occur in the seventh year, which means that most ultra-Orthodox men of draft age would be exempt from military service until 2032 at the least. Katz also said that to ensure compliance with the goals, 'unlike previous arrangements, this law proposes economic sanctions for failing to meet the annual targets.' He said sanctions would apply to all yeshivas for students eligible for military service. 'Those not studying would be carefully scrutinized and sanctioned — not just the yeshivas, as was not the case previously.' Katz's proposal suggest that only partial and economic sanctions would be imposed. 'If we fail to meet the targets, we’ll introduce a new law to impose all necessary sanctions.' Meanwhile sources in the ultra-Orthodox parties said they would not support a bill that included sanctions imposed on those who do not enlist. Amid ultra-Orthodox protests against the bill, senior rabbis have voiced strong opposition to IDF enlistment, including a former chief rabbi who urged followers to discard draft orders. Addressing this opposition, Katz said, 'Is integrating the ultra-Orthodox into security and the economy necessary? Absolutely. Is it possible? Only by consent.' Two hours before the committee convened, Laly Dery, the mother of Sgt. First Class (res.) Saadia Yaakov Dery, who was killed on June 20 last year in Gaza led a protest march from the military cemetery in Jerusalem to the Knesset, in protest of Kat's proposed bill.

Warning: Iranians bait Israeli civilians abroad, to kidnap them	The National Security Council reveals Iranian officials reach out to Israeli, hoping to lure him to Dubai and abduct him; following investigation, NSC concludes Iran plans to harm Israelis abroad The National Security Council warned Israelis on Tuesday that hostile actors were pretending to be various organizations, and luring Israelis to travel to foreign countries where they would be harmed or abducted. Following an Iranian attempt to lure an Israeli businessman to the United Arab Emirates, the National Security Council has released a warning to the public that Tehran was increasing its efforts to harm to Israeli citizens abroad. Intelligence sources in the National Security Council discovered that Iranian officials contacted an Israeli businessman on Telegram, posing as the Persian department of the Saudi television network Al-Arabiya, to lure him to meet with them in Dubai. In addition, it was discovered that the same officials sent Israeli links and malicious files to gain access to his phone, without his knowledge. The businessman reported the suspicious incident to the National Security Council, and the organization conducted an investigation that revealed that terrorist elements were behind the attempt. The National Security Council noted that 'this is another manifestation of the continuing threat of Iranian terrorism against Israelis in Israel and around the world.' 'The incident highlights the potential risk in contacting unknown entities that make unusual offers online. Particularly when the request is accompanied by requests for personal details, information about movements abroad and/or sending files, including sending links and emails.' the National Security Council said. The council explained that to prevent and reduce the risks, 'the Israeli public must maintain privacy on social networks and avoid sharing details such as phone numbers, real-time location and future plans.' The organization also noted that providing these details will help terrorist elements gather important information about the potential targets, improve the nature of the offer, and ensure the success of their mission to harm Israelis. > The National Security Council asked the public to report any suspicious behavior by unknown parties from abroad, especially when traveling outside the country. If any concern arises that you have been exposed to a threat from terrorist elements, it is recommended to inform the local security services of the country in which you are staying, and then the National Security Council's travel warning center. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skmd2nmvkg	2025-01-14T03:15:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/rJZXd5QPye/rJZXd5QPye_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Iran, Europeans meet on nuclear program, report	Iran's deputy foreign minister says in a post that talks were serious, frank, and constructive adding there was agreement that negotiations for a deal should resume Talks held in Geneva between Iran, Britain, France and Germany will see dialogue continue regarding Tehran's disputed nuclear program, Iran's official news agency reported on Tuesday. 'The talks were serious, frank, and constructive. We discussed ideas involving certain details in the sanctions-lifting and nuclear fields that are needed for a deal,' Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran's deputy foreign minister for international and legal affairs, wrote on X on Monday. 'Sides concurred that negotiations should be resumed and to reach a deal, all parties should create and maintain the appropriate atmosphere. We agreed to continue our dialogue,' he added. The talks held on Monday followed earlier discussions in November. At that time, an Iranian official told Reuters that finalizing a roadmap with Europeans would 'put the ball in the U.S. court to revive or kill the nuclear deal.' In 2018, the U.S., led by then-President Donald Trump, exited Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with six major powers and re-imposed harsh sanctions on Iran. That prompted Tehran to violate the pact's nuclear limits, with moves such as rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output. Indirect talks between U.S. President Joe Biden's administration and Tehran to try to revive the pact have failed.

I forced Netanyahu to reject earlier deals,' Ben-Gvir reveals	National Security Minister says he no longer has the deciding votes to compel the prime minister to reject a hostage release deal as he had done before, calls on Smotrich to join his resignation; Netanyahu previously rejected claims of political considerations National Security Council Itamar Ben-Gvir said on Tuesday that he had prevented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from accepting previous attempts at securing a hostage release deal but was currently outnumbered in the coalition. He called on Finance Minister Bezalel Smortrich to join him in threatening resignation from the coalition to block the prime minister's intention to accept a deal now. 'In the past year, through our political strength, we succeeded in preventing such a deal from being made, time and again,' he said. Since Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and his New Hope faction joined the coalition, Ben-Gvir's Otzman Yehudit Party had lost its leverage to force his view on the government. Netanyahu had previously rejected claims that he had refused proposals for a deal that would have seen hostages released, out of political considerations and fears that his government would be toppled and directed blame for the failure of negotiations, on Hamas. 'The pending deal is terrible, I know its details well,' Ben-Gvir said in a long post on X. 'It includes the release of hundreds of murderous terrorists from prison, the return of Gazans to the northern part of the Strip, the withdrawal of the IDF from the Netzarim Corridor and the renewed threat to the residents of the Gaza border area.

Hardened terrorists that Hamas demands in exchange of hostages	Terror group names some of the most notorious Palestinian terrorists serving sentences in Israel that must be released when a deal is agreed As part of the ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal, Hamas has submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it demands to have released from Israeli prisons. At this stage, it's unclear who will be released under the pending agreement, but Hamas is demanding the release of senior terrorists serving life sentences. According to an unverified Saudi report, Hamas also demanded the inclusion of the body of its assassinated leader, Yahya Sinwar, in the deal. However, an Israeli source said that 'this won’t happen.' While the terror group has requested a significant number of prisoners with blood on their hands who were sentenced to life imprisonment for murderous attacks, these are some of the most notorious prisoners Hamas is asking to be released: Abdullah Barghouti: A Hamas terrorist who was one of the commanders of the organization's military wing in the West Bank. Barghouti is currently serving 67 life sentences, an unprecedented punishment in Israel. Hamas failed to secure his release in the Gilad Shalit release deal in 2011. Marwan Barghouti: Served as the Fatah movement’s secretary-general in the West Bank and was arrested on April 15, 2002. Barghouti orchestrated terrorist attacks in which five Israelis were killed and many others injured. In 2004, he was sentenced to five consecutive life terms and an additional 40 years in prison. Ahmed Saadat: secretary-general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the planner of the assassination of Minister Rehavam Ze'evi in 2001. Saadat is considered a popular and significant figure in Palestinian society. Israel refused to release him in the Shalit deal. Ibrahim Hamed: Hamed was the 'mastermind' behind 90% of suicide bombing attacks during the Second Intifada between 2000 and 2005. He served as the commander of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades in the West Bank at the time. In his role, he planned and organized numerous attacks against Israelis, including severe suicide bombings. He has been wanted by Israeli security forces since 1998. Abbas al-Sayyed: The principal planner of the 2002 Passover massacre in Netanya. He was sentenced to 35 life terms for the murder of Israelis.

Head of the International Court of Justice is named Lebanon’s new...	Salam is chosen by 84 deputies in the Lebanese legislature over just 9 for Hezbollah's candidate Mikati and has the support of Saudi Arabia and Western countries Lebanon’s new president has asked prominent diplomat and jurist Nawaf Salam to form the country’s new government after Salam was named prime minister by a large number of legislators Monday. The move apparently angered the Hezbollah group and its allies. Salam is currently serving as the head of the International Court of Justice and his nomination was made by Western-backed groups as well as independents in the Lebanese parliament. Salam has the support of Saudi Arabia and Western countries as well. Hezbollah legislators abstained from naming any candidate for the prime minister’s post. Salam’s nomination is seen by many as a glimpse of hope after the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war that left 4,000 people dead and more than 16,000 wounded and caused destruction totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. The war stopped in late November when a U.S.-brokered 60-day truce went into effect. Shortly after Salam won majority backing from legislators, some people celebrated in the streets of Beirut with fireworks amid hopes that his nomination and last week’s election of army commander Gen. Joseph Aoun as president would help release billions of dollars of investments and loans by foreign donors. Salam will have a difficult mission ahead of him following the truce with Israel that caused widespread destruction in the Mediterranean nation and weakened the Iran-backed Hezbollah. He will also have to work on getting the small nation out of its historic five-year economic meltdown. In past years, Hezbollah has repeatedly blocked Salam from becoming prime minister, casting him as a U.S.-backed candidate. 'We will see their acts when it comes to forcing the occupiers to leave our country, bringing back prisoners, reconstruction' and the implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war, the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc, Mohammed Raad, said after meeting with Aoun. Raad added that Hezbollah extended its hand last week by electing Aoun and they were hoping to meet an extended hand from the other side, 'but this hand was cut off.' Last week’s election of Aoun as president and Monday’s nomination of Salam is likely to lead to a flow of funds from Western and oil-rich Arab nations to Lebanon to help in the reconstruction process. Tens of thousands of Lebanese have lost their savings since the country’s banking sector crashed as a result of the economic crisis. Neither Aoun nor Salam are considered part of the country’s political class that is blamed for widespread corruption and mismanagement over the past decades that exploded in October 2019 into one of the world’s worst economic meltdowns in more than a century. Lebanon has been run by a caretaker government for more than two years and Aoun was elected after a 26-month vacuum in the president’s post. After a day of consultations between Aoun and legislators, Salam got the backing of 84 deputies, while outgoing Prime Minister Najib Mikati received nine votes. Thirty-four legislators from the 128-member legislature abstained. Shortly after the results came out, Mikati called Salam to congratulate him and wish him luck with the new job. Antoine Shoukeir, the presidency’s director general, told reporters after the consultations that Salam now is prime minister-designate, adding that he is currently outside Lebanon and should be back in the coming hours. A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday at the presidential palace in Beirut’s southeastern suburb of Baabda between Aoun, Salam and parliament Speaker Nabih Berri after which he will start the process of forming a new Cabinet. It was not immediately clear whether Salam plans to resign as head of the ICJ. 'My voice is for Nawaf Salam because my voice is for Lebanon and no one else,' independent legislator Paula Yacoubian told journalists after meeting with Aoun. Salam, 71, is a member of a prominent Sunni Muslim family from Beirut and his late paternal uncle, Saeb Salam, was one of the Lebanese leaders who fought for the country’s independence from France and later served several terms as Lebanon’s prime minister. Salam’s cousin, Tammam, also served as prime minister for two years starting in 2014. Salam holds a doctorate in political science from France’s prestigious Sciences Po university as well as a doctorate in history from France’s Sorbonne University. He also has a Master of Laws degree from Harvard Law School. Salam has worked as a lecturer at several universities, including the American University of Beirut. In 2007, he was named Lebanon’s ambassador to the United Nations, where he served for 10 years. In 2018, Salam was elected as a judge on the ICJ and in February last year he was elected as president of the court becoming the first Lebanese citizen to hold the post. Salam is married to journalist Sahar Baasiri, who for many years was a columnist at Lebanon’s leading An-Nahar daily. Baasiri has been serving since 2018 as Lebanon’s ambassador to UNESCO.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjeb7uxwje	2025-01-13T20:46:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/13/B1KEcCfPyx/B1KEcCfPyx_0_165_1857_1045_0_small.jpg
Trump reveals hostage deal nears end 'there's been a handshake'	U.S. president-elect says in an interview that he believed an agreement was imminent, 'perhaps by the end of the week' warning that if the deal is not struck 'there would be trouble 'like never seen before' U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he believed there was a handshake between parties in the negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Doha and that the talks were nearing the end. 'I understand there’s been a handshake and they’re getting it finished and maybe by the end of the week, but it has to take place,' he says.

Prof. Benny Miller: 'It’s good that Trump is becoming the American President, because I think now the chances of deliberation of the hostages is much greater than it was before' A second phase of a hostage-for-ceasefire deal, potentially securing the release of more of the 98 hostages still held in Gaza, is likely under U.S. President Donald Trump, according to Prof. Benny Miller, an international relations expert from the University of Haifa. Speaking to ILTV on Monday, Miller explained that Qatar and Egypt are deeply concerned about Trump taking office, given their heavy reliance on U.S. security support. They fear Trump may penalize them if it appears they are not applying sufficient pressure on Hamas.

Israeli, Danish FMs clash over UNRWA	Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar: 'We don’t have any trust in an organization that demonstrated that its personnel were involved in terrorism' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar and Danish Foreign Minister Lars Rasmussen clashed Monday on whether the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) could effectively be replaced in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. The United Nations agency is slated to cease operations at the end of the month. At a joint press conference, Sa’ar stated that Israel is committed to ensuring the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. 'There are more organizations, UN agencies, NGOs, and countries participating in this effort,' Sa’ar said. 'We don’t have any trust in an organization that demonstrated that its personnel were involved in terrorism, were infiltrated by Hamas, and that its installations were used as command and communication centers for Hamas.' Sa’ar explained that Israeli legislation passed last year prohibits the country’s authorities from engaging with UNRWA and bars the agency from operating within Israel. The legislation effectively mandates the termination of UNRWA’s activities in the region. Rasmussen countered, saying that he and Sa’ar 'do not see eye to eye' on the matter and affirmed Denmark’s 'steadfast support' of UNRWA, contributing around $75 million annually. 'There have been, and perhaps to some extent still are, problems linked to individuals within the organization of UNRWA,' Rasmussen said, noting that all parties should work hard to address these issues. However, he added, 'We cannot see any alternative to UNRWA, at least not in the short-term perspective. If you look at the West Bank, I think UNRWA is the second-largest employer. 'In order to ensure that we have the needed infrastructure to provide for the Palestinians in the region—the West Bank, Gaza, and the surrounding countries—with access to healthcare, education, etc., we do not see any alternative.' Israel accused several UNRWA employees of participating in the October 7 massacre against Israel and alleged that others had ties to the terror organization. Sa’ar hosted Rasmussen at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem on Monday. The two leaders began with an extended private meeting, followed by discussions with their respective teams, and concluded with a joint press conference. The visit largely focused on the hostage-for-ceasefire deal, regional security concerns, and opportunities for economic and technological collaboration.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjasqwxvje	2025-01-13T19:48:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/14/BkqwnDmPke/BkqwnDmPke_0_204_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Col. Richard Kemp: 'My name was found on an al-Qaeda death list i...	Former British commander details his thoughts on fighting for Israel on the global stage, geopolitical threats and the world's anti-Israel stance Col. Richard Kemp, a British Army veteran, is one of Israel's most cogent and effective spokespersons who stood by the country since the war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023. Talking to Ynet on Monday, he said this came at a significant price for him: 'I had many threats made to my life for my support of Israel.' Kemp served in active duty from 1977 to 2006, during which time he held the position of an infantry battalion commanding officer. His tenure included leading Operation Fingal in Afghanistan from July 2003 to November 2003. Following his retirement, Kemp, in collaboration with Chris Hughes, authored 'Attack State Red,' a book detailing the 2007 Afghanistan campaign carried out by the Royal Anglian Regiment, including their initial deployment. He also wrote the British forces' doctrine on dealing with suicide bombings. 'My name was found on an al-Qaeda death list in Syria a few years ago. Very rarely does a day go past without me receiving on social media severe threats against me and my family as well as a result of my support for Israel,' he said, adding these threats don’t worry him but are rather a compliment knowing he’s prodding in the right way to show the truth. 'The IDF, Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Defense in Israel have been doing an extraordinary job in a very demanding and complex situation.' 'I'm attempting to tell the truth about a situation that's so often distorted in the Western media, particularly on social media. If anything, it will encourage me even more to continue supporting Israel.' 'The key to the conflict is Iran' Kemp, who kept fighting for Israel following Hamas’ attack, made it clear Israel is the victim in the current war. 'But it's not just a war against Israel. It's also a war against the West. It's striking against all of our Western values. When you look at protests in the UK and in the U.S. and other countries, which actually support Hamas, they may not say they do, but the practical effect is to support Hamas.' When asked about his advice to Israeli leaders amid the war, Kemp said: 'I don't think Israel's leadership needs my advice. As far as I can see, the IDF, Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Defense in Israel have been doing an extraordinary job in a very demanding and complex situation.' 'I do believe that the key to the conflict is Iran,' he added. 'Iran has been severely damaged by the partial destruction of Hezbollah, the partial destruction of Hamas and the loss of Syria, all of which are down to Israeli actions. I think now it's the next major target really for Israel's offensive should be directly against Iran itself.' 'I think we're going to see much more of a Turkish-motivated proxy war accelerating against Israel from Syria.' Speaking on the war at large and the Iranian threat, Kemp also stressed that Turkey’s attempts to establish itself in Syria are also a cause for serious consideration and concern: 'I think Turkey has gained immense strength as a result of the fall of [Bashar] Assad.' 'You'll have a really negative jihadist state on your doorstep and that state of course is supported by Turkey that will be should I say the HTS the organization that's now largely in control of Syria is supported by Turkey. They will be a major player in Syria and Turkey of course is a supporter and Sponsor of Hamas maybe they will replace Iran as the main supporter of Hamas and other anti-Israel Jihadist groups in the region.' 'I think we're going to see much more of a Turkish-motivated proxy war accelerating against Israel from Syria,' he warned. As fighting ramps up across all fronts, action against IDF soldiers is taken out of the battlefield and into courtrooms by anti-Israel organizations like the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) trying to prosecute Israeli soldiers for alleged war crimes. 'This is partly a product of weakness in Western governments for actually standing up and telling the truth about what's been going on in Israel.' 'Western governments like Britain and the U.S. know exactly what Israel's doing, yet they also do criticize Israel for infringing human rights and carrying out unnecessary killings. That, of course, fuels the anti-Israel sentiment, which also directly supports and encourages Hamas and targeting Israeli soldiers as part of that,' Kemp said. 'The game will change when Trump comes into the White House' 'I think it's incumbent on Israel to use whatever diplomatic means it can to try and combat any legal action in Western countries, but also down to Western governments,' he added. Kemp also believes that the current hostile environment toward Israel will change once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump enters office next week: 'In many ways, the game will change when Trump comes into the White House.' 'Although the Americans have been extremely supportive of Israel since this war began, they've also in many ways have hampered Israel's efforts by placing numerous restrictions on them, applying a partial arms embargo on Israel and effectively preventing Israel from carrying out some of the actions it needs to carry out. I hope that situation will change when Trump comes into the White House, freeing Israel to be more aggressive,' he explained. 'I think it's incumbent on Israel to use whatever diplomatic means it can to try and combat any legal action in Western countries.' 'For example, we've just seen a bill pass in Congress to sanction the International Criminal Court for its egregious arrest warrants against your prime minister and former defense minister. I'm slightly optimistic on that front from January 20,' Kemp added. Meanwhile, Kemp is concerned with the state the UK is heading toward as topics of grooming and gang rape cases cause heated national debate across the country about its immigration policy. 'We've had decades of pedophile rape gangs of victims sometimes as young as 11, 12-year-old white girls in Britain being targeted by street rape gangs, mainly by Pakistani men, but also Pakistani women assisting in procurement.' 'That's mainly as a result of political correctness and prioritizing a fear of inciting or causing racial tensions as a result of identifying the reality of these Pakistani rape gangs in the UK, prioritizing that over actually stopping it from happening and bringing justice to the offender. Hopefully, we're going to see that causing much more effective action against these rape gangs,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Kemp added that the British public is now waking up to these issues and taking a stand against them. 'It's not just the current British government, but successive British governments have been afraid to tackle this. And by doing so, they've actually encouraged the continuation of these horrible events, which are probably the worst atrocity that has occurred in the UK since the Second World War.' 'Even now the Labour government that's in power has refused to launch what's been demanded, which is a full-scale national inquiry into the problem overall, which affects many different parts of the UK. Hopefully, sufficient pressure will be applied to them now to force their hands.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjxzxkmwyx	2025-01-13T13:23:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/13/rJN0011Jmvke/rJN0011Jmvke_104_0_963_542_0_small.jpg
There are nights we'll never forget': Up close with the Arrow ai...	Exclusive: Serving 24-hour shifts in vault-like rooms across the country, 136th Battalion soldiers face the ballistic missile threat against Israel at all times The soldiers serving at the Arrow missile defense interception center located at an Air Force base in central Israel liken their role to that of a goalkeeper in soccer: excelling throughout most of the game yet receiving attention primarily for the goals conceded. This metaphor reflects over a year of multi-front warfare, during which the system has successfully intercepted missiles launched from across the Middle East. Still, many Israelis focus on the failures such as Iran’s ballistic missiles hitting Israel in the attacks in April and October 2024. 'The Arrow system is the best in the world at intercepting ballistic missiles of this kind, especially given that no other system has faced such heavy barrages and achieved interception rates like ours,' said Lt. Col. Eyal Frankel, commander of the 136th Arrow Battalion. 'Yet, as with any defense system, there are cases where it doesn’t succeed. Defense isn't airtight and we must always assume some threats will slip through. We use multiple defense systems to maximize interception chances, but sometimes it still doesn’t work.' How's morale after such incidents? 'Whether the failure is due to human or machine error, not completing the mission is tough. But we train our personnel to handle failure and understand it’s part of the job. Sometimes missiles fall because we decide not to defend certain areas. 'That decision isn’t natural for us — we can’t bear to see a missile hit. We have discussions to prepare the team for future challenges. It’s part of being a defender, like a goalkeeper who has to cope with conceding a goal.' The Arrow interception center is one of the most classified sites in Israel, where life-and-death decisions have been made daily since the war began on October 7. While Israelis scramble to bomb shelters in their pajamas during nighttime sirens, rows of uniformed personnel sit in front of dozens of screens, surrounded by radios, lights and constant beeping. Ultimately, one person decides when, where and how to press the button to intercept a ballistic missile launched thousands of kilometers away, often from Yemen or Iran. Operators undergo two years of training and then work grueling 24-hour shifts, sometimes longer. 'Nice to meet you, I’m R. from Ashdod,' says a 21-year-old lieutenant wearing glasses perched on her nose. Describing her role, she says, 'I’m an interception officer. All of us have combat training — I was a combat soldier before coming here. I’ve since completed training that qualifies me for all the roles, from field operations to this position. 'We sit here for hours, making tough, high-stakes decisions. We’re responsible for intercepting ballistic missiles that leave the atmosphere. The system includes Arrow 1 and Arrow 2 and we work directly with other defense systems like Iron Dome and David’s Sling.' Why is combat experience necessary for this role? 'We have just seconds to make challenging decisions and it requires a combat mindset — knowing what it’s like to be called into action and function in combat within moments. It’s combat, even if it’s through a screen. It’s stressful but also exhilarating.' What’s exhilarating about it? 'Intercepting a missile over my home in Ashdod and then calling my parents to ask how they’re doing.' The Arrow battery commander, Maj. L., shared: 'A few weeks ago, missiles were launched toward my home in Rishon LeZion, where my wife and baby live. From the moment the missile is launched and we receive the alert, we know exactly where it’s headed to strike. It’s more stressful than exciting. 'After my shift, I called my wife the next morning to ask how she was, and she replied, ‘You’re calling now? It happened in the middle of the night.’ I laughed. She, like many civilians, doesn’t understand what goes on behind the scenes and how much human involvement is behind every system decision — from the field to R. here operating the button.' Sitting nearby is Lt. A. from Nes Ziona, also an interception officer. 'We’re experiencing events that haven’t happened in decades,' he says. 'My dad is a commander here on the base, also part of the system. What I’ve done in my relatively short service, he hasn’t done in 20 years. We’re not happy about the situation but it’s meaningful to be part of this.' A historic night The Arrow system is a layer of Israel’s comprehensive air defense, which protects the skies from drones, missiles and rockets. The system is built on several layers: Iron Dome handles short-range targets and aerial threats, David’s Sling intercepts longer-range rockets and cruise missiles and the Arrow systems are designed to counter long-range ballistic missiles. During the war in Gaza, it intercepted launches from Iran, Yemen, Syria and beyond. Entrance to the interception center requires removing any device that could be exploited by the enemy — mobile phones, smart watches, earphones, even the Ynet photographer’s camera. Walking through the fortified rooms, resembling safes, leads to a dimly lit control room filled with darkened screens. On the surface, it seems like an ordinary room, but Lt. Col. Frankel explains that the site is so classified they had to prepare it specifically ahead of the journalists’ visit. 'Don’t be disappointed,' he asks. On shift, the room hosts a commander and four interception officers seated at a row of computers. Behind them sits a reservist and Frankel proudly points to her: 'She’s been with us for a long time, a mother of children who enlisted to support the system and hardly spends nights at home. Do you see the level of sacrifice here and how critical manpower is?' The control room is responsible for implementing decisions handed down from the political and military leadership. These include protocols on which missile to launch, where to intercept and which areas are prioritized for protection. 'These decisions come from much higher up following detailed discussions and they change hourly, not even daily,' Frankel adds. In a nearby room, a group of technicians in blue overalls manages the technological systems. From fixing a faulty computer button to addressing a technical issue with a deployed battery, someone must resolve problems immediately, as delays could impact an entire launch. 'There are many more rooms here,' the commander continues without elaborating. 'On the night of the first Iranian attack, this place was packed to capacity. It was a historic moment. Dozens of people, including senior commanders, were called in to operate all these computers. People think this system is purely technological. They don’t realize how much it depends on human input.' A nationwide unit A tour outside the Arrow interception center reveals the quintessential image of an Air Force base: a pastoral, pristine and meticulously maintained compound. Senior officers live with their families just minutes away from some of the most operationally critical rooms in the Middle East. Yet, the tension is palpable and the quiet is almost unnerving. Everyone is always on edge, always busy. Every uniformed individual seems to be heading somewhere on a mission. 'I'm Eyal Frankel, 41 years old, a father of four and battalion commander since August 2023, two months before the war,' he introduces himself. 'I've been serving in the Arrow system since 2004, growing through every role along the way.' Beside him sits his deputy, Maj. A, 31, and a father of two. He also lives on the base but barely sees home. 'I took on the role last August,' he shares. 'I didn't grow up in the Arrow system but in Iron Dome. As part of the development process for deputy commanders and battalion leaders, we wanted to give them exposure to other weapons systems. 'The goal is to provide knowledge and learn from another system to become better commanders. This required me to learn Arrow from scratch, go through certifications and training and do it quickly — unlike soldiers who grow up in the system.' Beyond interception, Arrow soldiers bear another responsibility — issuing alerts to civilians. 'To succeed, we need to master many professional domains,' Lt. Col. Frankel explains. 'A ballistic missile traveling from a distance carries hundreds of kilograms of explosives. It's simple physics: for it to reach Israel, it must go through certain processes while airborne. 'The result is that the missile arrives with fragments and debris, which makes it a significant challenge to intercept the relevant part of the missile mid-air.' The unit isn’t confined to just one base. The launchers, detection equipment, soldiers, technicians and support staff are spread across various points nationwide, from north to south. Divided into launch divisions, they’re equipped with mobile command and control vehicles and other resources to provide optimal protection. 'Right now, you're in a nice site, but that's not how it works in reality,' Frankel adds. 'To deploy effectively, you need to move constantly to adapt capabilities to the evolving scenario. The mobility of detection and launch systems creates a lot of fieldwork — day, night, weekdays, weekends, rain or heat. It's a massive challenge, especially for reservists who've been under emergency call-ups since the war began. It’s a complex operation.' One key figure in ensuring the unit functions smoothly is Capt. S., 25, the battalion’s logistics officer. 'I’m a base-and-housing child,' she admits. 'My father is an Air Force officer and a retired lieutenant colonel. We just ate together in the dining hall. At headquarters, we support all the unit's sites nationwide. 'I don’t have a predictable day—not even the next hour. During the war, the unit doubled in size and we need to meet the needs of both regular and reserve forces — from lodging and gear like vests and helmets to transportation and all operational vehicle logistics. Without the drivers, we couldn't sustain the mission of providing protection 24/7. I might be in the north at 8 a.m. and in Eilat by dawn the next day. That’s what this entire war period looks like for us.' Hours upon hours of debriefings A missile launched from Yemen or Iran can reach Israel within about 10 minutes. During this brief time, detection systems must identify it and map out its threats. Within these moments, countless decisions need to be made. The Arrow 3 interceptor targets distant, high-altitude threats, requiring launch decisions within seconds. 'You sit in front of a blank screen for an hour, two hours, 24 hours, a week, a month, even 20 years before the war, during which nothing happens. Then, in real-time, you have to be at peak readiness,' says Lt. Col. Frankel. 'It's always on your mind. You go to sleep at 3:00 a.m., knowing you might need to jump into action and perform at your best within seconds. If it's stressful for civilians, imagine what it's like for those managing the interception process.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Missiles launched from distant countries leave the atmosphere and even when intercepted, fragments can still fall toward Israel,' he continues. 'That’s why we must protect civilians even after a successful interception of the missile’s relevant components.' How do you feel about instances where missiles hit despite efforts? Maj. A: 'Events like these actually boost our motivation because they highlight the importance of what we do daily. In any case, after every success or failure, we conduct a series of debriefings. We spend hours analyzing what happened and how to improve next time. There’s no moment of rest.' What were the most significant events of the war? Lt. Col. Frankel: 'On October 3, we had the Arrow’s first operational interception in the Yemen front. Just like the Iranian nights of April 14 and October 1, we’ll never forget it. And it wasn’t just us — everyone involved in the defense industries and those responsible for developing this weapon over the decades was moved to tears. 'That missile turned out to be not so threatening because we proved we were ready. Seeing all the training and professional expertise materialize during nights of operational success is a unique feeling. If it weren’t about dangerous missiles, we might even enjoy it.' 'It’s not like we want missiles to be fired at Israel, but when it happens and succeeds, it’s a source of immense pride and satisfaction. The first time it happened, there was great excitement among those on duty at the interception console. 'But since then, we’ve gone through a lot. We all take part in these interceptions, whether it’s the technician or the soldier pressing the button. It’s the joint effort of many people that makes it work. 'We prepared for an attack from Iran and Yemen on October 7 too. We deployed defenses before we even believed it would happen. Now, we’re preparing for other threats we hadn’t even dreamed of.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy3beemvjx	2025-01-13T12:55:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/Hkl002uhTU1l/Hkl002uhTU1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israel estimates most hostages on Hamas list of 33 are alive	Number of Palestinian prisoners to be freed depends on confirmed number of living hostages, with Hamas’ Nukhba terrorists excluded; convicted murderers will be exiled; Israel plans to hold Philadelphi Corridor during first 42-day phase of deal Israeli officials acknowledged Monday night that they remain uncertain about the precise number of Hamas prisoners, out of an expected 1,300, to be released in a looming hostage deal. Israel has effectively withdrawn its demand for a list of living captives from Hamas, which has yet to provide such documentation. The initial release of 33 hostages includes women, children, elderly individuals over 50 and the injured or ill, none of whom have been declared deceased. However, officials caution that some may not be alive, leaving the criteria for the initial release phase unresolved. Israeli estimates suggest that most of the 33 captives, including female soldiers, civilians and children, are likely alive. The agreement outlines a phased release schedule over 42 days, beginning with women and children, followed by female soldiers. Although the deal is structured in three stages, Israeli officials believe it may be condensed into two. The first phase includes a 42-day cease-fire, with discussions on subsequent phases expected to begin on the 16th day. Israel aims to finalize and announce the agreement as early as Tuesday. Preparations are underway in the Prime Minister's Office for expedited approval. Once the deal is ratified by the Cabinet and the government, the list of prisoners to be released will be published, allowing the public less than 48 hours to submit appeals to the Supreme Court. Officials hope to implement the agreement this week, ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Diplomatic sources expressed cautious optimism, describing the negotiations as 'at a very advanced stage.' However, a senior official warned that 'we are not yet at the final closure phase. We hope there will be agreement on the deal’s components, but this does not depend on us.' A source familiar with the talks told Reuters that the agreement is 'closer than ever.' Negotiators are set to hold another round of talks Tuesday morning to finalize details. Expected participants include Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, Biden envoy Brett McGurk and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al-Thani. Hamas commandos will remain behind bars; murderers will be exiled The senior Israeli official said that members of Hamas’ elite Nukhba forces captured in Gaza will not be released in the initial stages of the deal. Convicted murderers who are freed as part of the agreement will not return to the West Bank but will instead be exiled to Gaza or abroad, with Qatar and Turkey emerging as potential destinations, according to reports in Arab media. Diplomatic sources said that 'significant assets,' including geographic leverage and prisoners, will be reserved for subsequent negotiations until all hostages—alive and deceased—are returned. They noted that while a similar number of prisoner releases was discussed in May, Hamas at the time had proposed returning only a small number of living hostages. 'Recently, Hamas has shown movement,' the officials added. Despite Arab media reports suggesting otherwise, Hamas has yet to provide a definitive response to the draft proposal presented to both sides. 'We will update the public periodically in the next 24 hours,' officials said. 'Progress has been made on the overall agreement formula in coordination with mediators and both U.S. administrations—outgoing and incoming. The Middle East has undergone significant changes in recent months, including the weakening of the Shiite axis and Hamas' diminished capabilities. These shifts, along with Trump’s incoming presidency, have created optimal conditions for a deal. The timing is highly sensitive.' The senior official revealed that the U.S. presented a proposal in April, to which Hamas did not respond. On May 5, 2024, Hamas submitted its counterproposal, claiming it did not hold 33 hostages. It took until June 11 for Hamas to respond to an Israeli proposal following President Joe Biden’s speech on May 27. The response included 29 amendments, signaling an unwillingness to finalize a deal. 'At that time, Hamas refused to engage in negotiations,' the official said. 'The shift began after we eliminated Yahya Sinwar and severely damaged the Shiite axis and Hamas’ broader strategy to ignite the Middle East.' Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that the Prime Minister’s Office is promoting a narrative that the current deal mirrors an agreement Hamas rejected and derailed between May and July 2024. According to the narrative, Hamas was now forced into acceptance due to military pressure, the disintegration of its resistance alliance, and its lost hope that the Biden administration would compel Israel into a cease-fire. 'The agreement is reasonable,' Ben-Yishai said, 'but Gal Hirsch, Israel’s hostage coordinator, emphasized that it could not have been achieved earlier.' Gradual withdrawal Israel will maintain a buffer zone within Gaza during a potential cease-fire as part of the emerging agreement, Israeli officials said. However, the specific depth of the buffer zone within Gaza remains undisclosed. While Israeli forces will not withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor near the border with Egypt, they will permit displaced Gazans to return to northern Gaza, effectively ceding control of the former Netzarim area. The return of displaced persons will be conducted under security arrangements and inspections designed to prevent the movement of weapons and armed terrorists into northern Gaza, officials said. 'At the end of the deal, the IDF will remain deployed in the buffer zone,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that Israel's withdrawal from Gaza would be 'gradual, not immediate, to ensure Hamas fulfills its commitments.' Separately, Israel is preparing adjustments to its humanitarian aid policy for Gaza, irrespective of the deal. 'We are working on a solution to remove humanitarian aid from Hamas' control,' the senior official said. 'This is a critical component of Hamas' governance capabilities, and we're engaged in a long-term campaign. Solutions will take time.' U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed cautious optimism on the negotiations. 'We believe we are close to finalizing the deal,' Sullivan said. 'Whether it will close remains to be seen in the coming days and weeks, but I believe we're close. Gaps are narrowing, and issues are being resolved one by one. This is due to several factors: Israel has achieved its objectives in Gaza, and Hamas has suffered catastrophic losses. While nothing is guaranteed, I believe there’s a good chance we’ll reach the finish line.' The Israeli government is expected to approve the deal, despite opposition from the far-right Religious Zionist and Otzma Yehudit parties. Both parties have expressed intent to vote against the agreement but have not issued ultimatums or threatened to leave the coalition. All Likud ministers and ultra-Orthodox party members are anticipated to support the deal, forming a likely majority of 28 ministers in favor versus six opposing votes from the dissenting parties. Netanyahu is holding security consultations with defense officials to finalize details of the agreement and determine the timing for presenting it to the government for approval. Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs is engaging with political figures to garner support for the deal. Netanyahu’s aides believe the political hurdles can be surmounted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkki61qp1l	2025-01-13T11:08:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/r18Ig3bPyl/r18Ig3bPyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Sometimes, just being there for them is enough': Volunteers help...	Lior and Ruti, both 19, recount their experience of meeting with children who endured Hamas captivity, returned home and now face fear and trauma on the road to recovery 'Do you want to see what a dead person looks like?' the little girl asked as she played outside. She then lay on the ground and demonstrated. A single moment of innocent play turned into a painful reminder of the trauma she endured during the 52 days she was held captive by Hamas in Gaza. In November 2023, as part of the first hostage deal, 37 children who were abducted on the morning of October 7 returned home. According to a recent Health Ministry report, they returned thin, frightened and bearing physical and psychological signs of abuse. On average, they lost 10% of their body weight, with one case reaching 18%. But the deepest scars are those that are unseen. Lior Lixenberg and Ruti Suliman, national civic service volunteers with the Aminadav organization, are there to listen, process and help the children rebuild their lives. Through their work with the Lending a Hand Foundation, they guide the children step by step in their complex journey toward recovery. 'Everyone carries something from their time in captivity,' Lior says. 'For each child, it manifests differently. For some, the post-trauma only emerges now, a while after their return.' From the oncology ward to captivity Lior and Ruti plunged into deep waters. They’re only 19, in their second year of national service. During their first year, they accompanied children with cancer hospitalized in oncology wards, but nothing could have prepared them for their encounter with the children who survived captivity. The cultural differences, they say, added to the challenge — they’re religious, while most of the children are secular, born and raised in kibbutzim. Yet, sometimes, the differences forge the strongest connections. 'At first, it was unimaginable,' Lior recalls of the initial meetings. 'We heard the stories about the war, the abductions, and captivity and suddenly we saw these children in front of us. Now, we’re like their friends. They share everything with us.' How is supporting children who survived captivity different from supporting children with cancer? Lior: 'When you enter an oncology ward, you can see the illness and pain on the patients — the symptoms of the disease are visible. With children who survived captivity, it’s often hard to tell that something is wrong at first. Only when you delve deeper — into their homes, their private spaces — do you truly uncover their pain, their sense of loss and the trauma they’ve endured.' ‘Looking into their eyes, even in the hardest moments’ Their role might sound simple: playing with the children, helping with homework and spending time with them. But beneath this simplicity lies an entire world of responsibility. They've become like big sisters — figures who aren’t children but aren’t too much older either, people the children can trust and feel safe with. What qualities does it take to fulfill your role? Lior: 'You need a high level of empathy, listening skills, patience and stability.' Ruti: 'Emotional intelligence is crucial — to know how to respond to every situation, to look into their eyes even in the hardest moments. You have to think twice before reacting and act thoughtfully.' The children’s daily lives are a constant journey between moments of light and sudden darkness — between innocent play in the yard and memories that surface unexpectedly, between healthy laughter and an empty gaze that suddenly appears. Lior and Ruti navigate these emotional shifts, guiding the children step by step back to life. How does a typical day with the children look? 'Our meetings are usually in the afternoon or evening, when the children aren’t in school,' Lior explains. 'Each session lasts about four hours. Sometimes, we leave the house with them; other times, we stay in. There are families we visit weekly and others less frequently, depending on their needs.' The children and their families’ new reality is like an invisible minefield, with triggers hidden around every corner — Arabic subtitles on TV, a passing car or even a meal at a restaurant. Any of these can instantly bring the children back to their moments of terror in captivity. 'We’re learning to recognize the triggers,' Ruti shares, 'and we know how to help them cope. Sometimes, just being there for them is enough.' At first glance, they look like any other children — playing, laughing, fighting over toys. But beneath the surface lies a deep trauma that sometimes emerges at the most unexpected moments. 'When you meet the children, they seem normal and typical,' Lior shares. 'Only when they start talking and opening up do you realize their sense of loss and see the depth of their trauma. 'Once, I went to the park with a little girl and she came across a sign about the hostages. She stopped to kiss her father's picture. She only knows her father through the photos she sees. It was very painful to see.' Small victories For the children’s families, their presence is a ray of light amid the darkness. Many families lost loved ones in the October 7 massacre. Some fathers remain in captivity, while others have parents or family members who were abducted and later released or who survived the massacre but lost other relatives. Amid this complex reality, with additional children in the family and parents facing their own trauma, the volunteers are a constant they can hold onto. 'They’re so grateful for the help we provide their children,' Ruti says. 'Even amid their overwhelming challenges, they always find time to say thank you. You can feel how much they appreciate us. Families with relatives still in captivity even take time to express their gratitude. They open their doors to us which is no small thing.' Amid this enormous challenge, Ruti and Lior look for small victories. Sometimes it’s a smile that wasn’t there yesterday, other times it’s a game that lasts a little longer than usual. One story that left a mark on them is of a boy who returned from captivity. 'He was withdrawn at first, afraid to leave the house,' Lior recalls. 'When we first visited him, he was shocked that we came just for him. Now, he eagerly awaits our visits. It might seem like a small change, but it’s everything for us.' The fact that hostages remain in Gaza makes recovery even harder. 'It rattles everyone,' says Ruti. 'Some of them still have family members in captivity so they can’t fully heal. But we see the small victories — a child who smiles more, a teenager who dares to step outside, a family starting to talk about the future. That gives us hope.' The work with children who survived captivity is an enormous emotional challenge, even for the young volunteers. They hear harrowing stories, witness deep pain and sometimes the line between caregiver and patient blurs. 'It affects us deeply,' Ruti admits, 'but not during the meetings. Sometimes, it all surfaces afterward. We live with this 24/7, but we don’t let it in during the sessions.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The young women themselves receive regular psychological support. They share an apartment with two other national service volunteers who also work with children who survived captivity, which may be their greatest source of strength. 'We have to take care of ourselves to keep helping,' Ruti says. 'Living together helps us hold on. We understand each other without words.' In a few months, their service will end, but the children’s journey back to life is far from over. 'A few days ago, a mother told us, ‘We’re able to keep going because of you,’' Lior shares. 'These words give us the strength to keep going, even when it’s hard.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ry00ix2fp1l	2025-01-13T10:25:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/08/B1MfCGS38yg/B1MfCGS38yg_0_452_1200_675_0_small.jpg
IDF deploys 162nd Division to Beit Hanoun amid Gaza offensive	Decision follows intense combat in northern Gaza, where IDF forces managed to overrun one of Hamas' remaining battalions early in the war Following the intensified fighting in Gaza’s Beit Hanoun, which resulted in the death of 10 Israeli soldiers, the IDF has decided to transfer responsibility for the area from the 143rd 'Gaza' Division to the 162nd Division, currently engaged in operations in the neighboring town of Jabaliya. Senior military officials acknowledged errors in the initial division of sectors within the Gaza Strip, where the division was tasked with handling Beit Hanoun alongside the buffer zone along the border, Rafah and the Philadelphi Corridor. The 162nd Division will receive reinforcements to concentrate efforts against Hamas' Beit Hanoun Battalion. The battalion, previously regarded as one of the weaker units within the terror organization, was easily overrun by the 162nd Division at the start of the war and later by the 252nd Reserve Division. However, the battalion's operatives have since adapted, now engaging in guerrilla warfare that has claimed the lives of 10 IDF soldiers since the 143rd Division launched a brigade-level operation to clear the town in the past two weeks. This comes while the IDF is stretched thin, operating simultaneously in Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, the Jordanian border and Gaza. All fronts are active, with forces operating beyond the border fences in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. The military urgently requires additional standing forces and is currently calling up approximately 70,000 more reservists, though this remains insufficient given the extensive challenges. Over the weekend, the IDF reported four Nahal Brigade soldiers were killed by a powerful explosive device while traveling along a road in Beit Hanoun that was supposed to be fully cleared and secured. According to an initial investigation, a Hamas terrorist cell took advantage of stormy weather last week to plant an explosive alongside a military logistics route in Beit Hanoun. Such routes are typically secured early in large-scale operations, serving as logistical pathways once cleared of enemy presence and under constant security. Although the route was deemed secure, the terrorists managed to emerge unnoticed—possibly from a previously undiscovered tunnel—plant the device and remotely detonate it. A day earlier, eight soldiers were injured in various degrees in an explosion in Jabaliya. Troops in Beit Hanoun have uncovered over 30 explosive devices over the last two weeks. However, when devices go undetected, as in recent incidents, the toll has been devastating. The explosive detonated on Saturday was standard-issue and linked to Hamas. In another severe incident last week, where three soldiers were killed in another blast, the explosive is believed to have contained unexploded IDF ordnance found by terrorists, a recurring concern. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The remaining terrorists are also turning the rubble of destroyed buildings to their advantage. Exploiting the extensive destruction and the assumption by forces that bombed or demolished buildings are free of enemy presence, they use the ruins as cover to advance and launch attacks. Forces in Beit Hanoun are now required to learn from each incident, advancing more cautiously and meticulously searching for signs of hidden explosives during their offensives. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1s1006mdjl	2025-01-13T10:14:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/Syx00q3zWD1x/Syx00q3zWD1x_1_167_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Israel releases 2024 terrorism report: 1,866 terror acts, 134 kil...	Annual report reveals 16,300 rockets fired at Israel, causing 55 deaths and 699 injuries; 399 hostile aircraft incursions and 132 shooting attacks documented The National Information Directorate in the Prime Minister’s Office published its 2024 summary report on terrorism Monday, detailing a year of significant violence that left 134 people dead and 1,277 injured. The report documented attacks originating from seven fronts: Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and the West Bank. The report found that 41 fatalities resulted from shooting attacks, including 13 hostages murdered in Hamas captivity. Nine individuals were killed in stabbing incidents, and six in vehicle-ramming attacks. The year saw 132 shooting attacks, leaving 108 injured, including 23 with severe injuries. In 41 stabbing attacks, 28 were wounded, while 26 vehicle-ramming incidents caused 86 injuries. The year marked a surge in rocket fire, with approximately 15,400 rockets fired from Lebanon and 700 from Gaza, leading to 55 deaths and 699 injuries. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: October was the deadliest month, with over 6,900 rockets launched during intense fighting with Hezbollah. According to the report, there were 399 hostile aircraft incursions, 1,246 stone-throwing incidents, 89 bomb placements and 140 firebombings. Over 610 fires caused by rockets and drones scorched over 92,000 acres, including 55,000 acres in northern Israel. The deadliest month was October, which saw 37 fatalities and 294 injuries, followed by July with 22 deaths and 96 injuries; and August with 20 deaths and 71 injuries. Compiled with data from the IDF, Shin Bet, Israel Police and other agencies, the report consolidates information on attacks within Israel’s borders. Unlike the Shin Bet’s report, which includes thwarted attacks, this report focuses solely on executed attacks. It is distributed to Israeli public diplomacy bodies for international advocacy and legitimacy-building efforts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjuj8tfdkl	2025-01-13T09:59:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/07/rJc7k958yg/rJc7k958yg_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Why is a Christian mother of six risking it all to stand with Isr...	Rev. Hayley Ace is in Israel on a solidarity mission. She says: ‘If Israel fails, the West will fail’ Rev. Hayley Ace has been threatened by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hamas agents in London. She has been harassed on the street for wearing a Jewish star necklace—though she is not Jewish—and attacked on social media for standing up for Israel. Despite these threats, Ace, a mother of six living in London, arrived in Israel last week to stand in solidarity with the Jewish people. 'I think my faith is a huge factor,' Ace told ILTV News. 'I trust God with my life and safety, and I feel like I am doing God’s work.' While she acknowledged taking necessary precautions, she said her faith gives her the strength to continue, knowing that what she is doing is 'really important.' 'Fear should never be a reason to stop us from doing what is right,' Ace continued. 'Remember, there are almost 100 hostages held underground in the hands of terrorists. If we cannot be bold for them, we fail them… We have to be brave.' Read related stories: What do Christian Zionists need to do to support Israel? Christian Zionists defy war to stand with Israel at Feast of Tabernacles Holy Land exodus: Why Bethlehem’s Christians are vanishing Ace is one of London’s most well-known Christian activists for Israel. She is the founder of Christian Action Against Antisemitism and was named among the 50 Christian Allies for Israel last year. Ace arrived in Israel on Thursday to create content aimed at fighting the propaganda war and inspiring her network of Christians—what she calls the 'silent majority.' She will remain in Israel until the 20th. This is her second trip; her first visit was part of an influencers’ trip organized by the World Zionist Organization last year. However, that trip was just five days long and focused primarily on touring the destruction in Israel’s south so participants could bear witness. This time, her itinerary is packed. It includes visits to war-affected sites, meetings with Israeli political and military leaders, encouraging soldiers on army bases, and exploring the Old City and other Christian sites significant to her faith. On Thursday, Ace spent the day with 9-year-old Ben Carasso, the 'Spokeskid of Israel.' Following the events of October 7, Ben felt compelled to help his country by sharing Israel’s story with the world through the eyes of a child. Over the past 16 months, Ben has appeared on various media channels, speaking fluent English to explain what being a kid in Israel is like. He shares experiences such as what goes through a child’s mind during a rocket attack and how families adapt their daily routines during wartime. Ben also has friends who have lost loved ones in border communities, relatives who were kidnapped, and family members serving in the army reserves. Ace discovered Ben’s videos and invited him to London last year. Together, they hung posters of the hostages across the city alongside a Muslim pro-Israel influencer and created content to raise awareness. Ben described Ace as 'amazing' in his interview with ILTV News. 'To see people like Hayley come to Israel and help us—there are no words to explain such things,' Ben said. He acknowledged that it has become increasingly challenging for supporters to stand up for Israel due to the loud anti-Zionist rhetoric. However, people like Ace make a meaningful difference. Ben added that it was inspiring to see Israel through Ace’s perspective. He explained that many people label Israel as an apartheid or colonial state, but walking through the Old City with Ace, she witnessed Israel’s diversity with her own eyes. Ace explained that her support for Israel is 'multi-layered.' First, she has a strong sense of justice and cannot stand bullying and slander, which she believes the world is directing toward Israel. Second, she is originally from New Zealand and a member of the Maori Christian sect. Therefore, she understands what it means to be an indigenous people. 'The Jewish people are the indigenous people of Israel, and I want to stand with them,' she said. Finally, she pointed to her religious convictions, noting that God gave the Jewish people an everlasting covenant to live in Israel. As a devout Christian, she said she believes in the Bible and God, emphasizing that 'everlasting means everlasting.' Ace believes that Israel is fighting a war for humanity. 'If Israel fails, the West will fail,' Ace told ILTV News. 'Israel is fighting an evil that wants to target everyone who does not agree with their ideology of radical Islam.' She added, 'Anyone who loves freedom, who stands for feminism, who stands with the LGBTQI+ community, who stands for goodness and decency should be standing with Israel.' Ace also highlighted Israel’s unique position as the safest place for Christians in the Middle East. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, there are 180,300 Christian citizens in Israel, comprising about 1.8% of the population. Over the past year, the Christian community has grown by 0.6%. In contrast, a recent report from the Jerusalem Center for Strategic and Foreign Affairs revealed a sharp decline in the Christian population in Palestinian Authority-controlled areas, attributing the decrease to violence, weak law enforcement, and religious coercion. In 1922, Christians made up 11% of the population in these regions. Today, they account for less than 1%. In Gaza, the Christian population has dropped from 5,000 before Hamas seized power in 2007 to just 1,000 as of October 2023. Bethlehem reflects these troubling trends. In 1950, Christians made up 86% of the population in Bethlehem and its surrounding villages. Today, that number has dwindled to approximately 10%. 'I feel I have been positioned to be a voice of truth to fight against the lies,' Ace said. 'I came here to create content to counter all of those slanderous lies, like occupation, apartheid, genocide.' Ace’s visit is also about solidarity. 'I want the people of Israel to know that there are those of us in the world who see exactly what is going on and truly love you and stand with you,' Ace added. 'We want to stand in front of you and say, ‘If they come for the Jews, they have to go through us first.’'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1yb4kbwje	2025-01-13T09:26:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/r1H8Iy11Pke/r1H8Iy11Pke_0_667_1200_676_0_small.jpg

Anti-Israel group seeks arrest of top Israeli general in Italy	Hind Rajab Foundation files ICC arrest request for Major General Ghassan Alian for alleged weaponization of famine in Gaza The Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), known for its legal campaigns against IDF soldiers abroad, has filed an arrest request in Italy against IDF Major General Ghassan Alian, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). The foundation alleges Alian is in Italy 'secretly' and claims this marks the first time it has targeted an Israeli general of his rank with such legal action. Dyab Abou Jahjah, founder and leader of HRF, revealed on the television program Democracy Now that the organization has filed a case in the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Alian. 'We have filed a case against him at the ICC, asking for any existing arrest warrant to be activated or for a new one to be issued,' Abou Jahjah said. 'We also informed Italian authorities, urging them to fulfill their obligations under their own statute since they have jurisdiction and Alian does not possess immunity.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The HRF has accused Alian of overseeing policies they describe as war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the blockade of Gaza and targeting civilian infrastructure. The organization claims these actions amount to genocide, citing a total embargo on essential goods and alleged destruction of hospitals and other civilian facilities. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the HRF wrote, 'Major General Ghassan Alian, head of COGAT, is currently in Rome. Alian oversaw the total blockade of Gaza, weaponizing famine and targeting civilian infrastructure in acts amounting to genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.' The group further accused Alian of 'publicly dehumanizing Palestinians as 'human animals,' reflecting the intent behind his policies.' The HRF stated that Italy, as a signatory to the ICC's Rome Statute, is obligated to act immediately to detain Alian. 'With no immunity under international law, Italy must take swift action,' the group said, adding that the ICC has issued arrest warrants in the past for similar allegations against Israeli officials. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkkagampke	2025-01-13T08:31:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/02/15/ByEFdLOsjT/ByEFdLOsjT_0_0_1300_731_0_small.jpg
5 IDF soldiers killed in northern Gaza, 8 severely wounded	CPT Yair Yakov Shushan, SST Yahav Hadar, SST Guy Karmiel, SST Yoav Feffer and SST Aviel Wiseman of Nahal Brigade's elite reconnaissance unit killed in combat The IDF announced Monday evening that five soldiers from the Nahal Brigade's elite reconnaissance unit were killed during intense combat in the northern Gaza Strip. Eight additional soldiers were severely injured in the same incident, marking one of the deadliest days for the brigade since the ground offensive began. The fallen soldiers are Captain Yair Yakov Shushan, 23, a decorated squad commander, from Ma'alot-Tarshiha; Staff Sergeant Yahav Hadar, 20, from Kfar Tavor; Staff Sergeant Guy Karmiel, 20, from Gedera; Staff Sergeant Yoav Feffer, 19, from Herzliya; and Staff Sergeant Aviel Wiseman, 20, from Poria Illit.

His father, Mickey, is a commander of a local emergency squad and a martial arts instructor in Ma'alot. The Shushan family recently mourned another loss: a relative, Staff Sergeant Ori Yitzhak Iluz, was killed in a terrorist attack on the Egyptian border in June 2023. In Herzliya, Mayor Yariv Fisher paid tribute to Staff Sergeant Feffer, calling him 'a courageous fighter and a beloved son of the community who sacrificed everything to protect us.' He added, 'Yoav was not only a neighbor but also an integral part of our community—a principled and humble young man full of dreams. Herzliya and our community have lost a true hero.' The local council of Kfar Tavor expressed condolences for Staff Sergeant Hadar, remembering him as a dedicated youth movement member and an avid lover of the outdoors. 'Yahav grew up in Kfar Tavor and was active in the youth movement. He loved the open spaces, often exploring them on his dirt bike. He was cherished by his friends and community,' the council stated. The tragic loss comes amid reports of progress in negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bknnupmwke	2025-01-13T08:18:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/13/ry1900aGPJl/ry1900aGPJl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Russia and Iran to sign strategic partnership pact on Jan. 17, Kr...	Iranian officials reportedly making clandestine trips to Moscow seeking Russian help with Islamic Republic's nuclear program as negotiations with West may resume Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian will hold talks in Russia on Jan. 17 after which they will sign a long-awaited comprehensive strategic partnership pact, the Kremlin said on Monday. The agreement comes as the Islamic Republic nears a breakthrough point to becoming a nuclear state. In its announcement, the Kremlin said the two leaders will discuss options for further expanding ties between Moscow and Tehran, including in the trade and investment, transport and logistics, and humanitarian spheres. Putin and Pezeshkian will also talk about regional and international issues, it added. Russia's announcement comes hours after a report appeared in the London Times about Iranian officials traveling on diplomatic missions to Russia to bolster its military capabilities. According to the report, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's close advisor Ali Larijani held secret trips to Moscow to meet with senior officials there in an effort to secure Russia's help for Iran's nuclear program and for its aerial defenses, after having been damaged in the Israeli attacks late last year. According to the Times, Western intelligence sources said Tehran was requesting Russian assistance in matters related to its nuclear program after years of cooperation that included the supply to Iran of nuclear fuel for a 1,000-megawatt light-water nuclear power reactor. One source said that since Russia was dependent on Iranian drones in its war on Ukraine, there was concern that it would be willing to cross red lines, previously observed, regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Times report comes as Iran was preparing to resume negotiations with the so-called E3 group - the UK, Germany and France in Geneva, to reach a new nuclear deal. One such meeting was scheduled for Monday and the paper said that its revelation of the secret meetings held by Iranians and Russians, would likely raise more concern over Iran's real intentions, in the West. Russia has cultivated closer ties with Iran and other countries hostile towards the U.S., such as North Korea, since the start of the Ukraine war. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in October that Moscow and Tehran intended to sign the strategic partnership pact which would include closer defense cooperation.

Iran announced on Monday that it has received a new shipment of 1,000 UAVs, in what can be considered a signal to Israel and the United States should they be considering an attack on its nuclear facilities after U.S. president-elect Trump takes office. The Iranian Tasnim news agency said the drones have been deployed to different sites around the country. They have the capability of traveling to a distance of over 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) and cause severe damage. They have the ability of autonomous flight and can penetrate advanced defense systems and will not only increase Iran's ability to defend its borders but also attack targets at a great distance. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hko5iqgdyg	2025-01-13T05:54:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/11/H1xMHJ5UJkx/H1xMHJ5UJkx_0_179_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Our prisoners freedom is near,' Hamas says; members of coalition...	The terror group confirmed for the first time that progress had been made in hostage deal talks; first phase to release 33 hostages for a six-week Gaza ceasefire and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners; Lapid offers PM safety net against opposition in government Hamas confirmed on Monday that there was significant progress in negotiations with Israel. 'The freedom of our heroic prisoners is near.' The terror group also called on Palestinians to escalate confrontations with Israel, citing 'increasing crimes against our people, our holy sites, and our prisoners,' a spokesperson for the military wing of the terror group said. After reports that a deal was nearing completion, members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition voiced their opposition to any deal that would include the withdrawal of troops from Gaza and the release of hardened terrorists from Israeli jails. In a letter to Netanyahu, coalition law makers and parents from the right-wing group of families of hostages said they had serious concerns over Israel's security in case a deal is agreed. They demanded that IDF troops remain in Gaza including in Rafah and the Netzarim Corridor, displaced Gazans not be allowed to return to the northern parts of the Strip and that all hostages be returned in one phase. Earlier Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in a post on X that the pending agreement would be catastrophic for Israel's national security. 'We will not be part of a capitulation deal that would include the release of arch-terrorists, stop the war and dissolve its achievement won in blood, while sacrificing the lives of many hostages,' he said in his post. 'This is the time to continue in full force, conquer and purify the entire Strip and finally take control of the humanitarian aid from Hamas and open the gates of hell until Hamas is defeated and all the hostages returned.' Support for a deal came from the Ultra-Orthodox Agudath Israel movement part of the United Torah Judaism faction in Netanyahu's coalition. They called on the prime minister to disregard political considerations and agree to a cease-fire deal. 'It is an undisputed moral and national duty to return the hostages home,' they said. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said he would provide Netanyahu with a safety net of support needed to agree to the deal. Lapid said he was told by a Qatari official that Hamas was keen for an agreement. 'I told Netanyahu my offer of votes, holds and he does not need Ben-Gvir and Smotrich to agree to it.' According to reports, the proposed deal's first phase would involve the release of 33 hostages in exchange for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza and the release of approximately 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. This group reportedly includes 48 individuals re-arrested after being released in the 2011 Shalit deal, 90 women, 150 to 200 prisoners serving life sentences, about 350 minors under 19, and around 560 elderly and ill detainees. Additional terms of the first phase reportedly under discussion include: Providing Israel with a list of living hostages. Relocating Israeli forces outside populated areas in Gaza. Allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, subject to third-party vehicle inspections. Reopening the Rafah crossing for humanitarian aid and permitting the exit of patients for medical treatment. The deal's second phase would commence a week after the first phase is implemented, with the release of remaining hostages in exchange for a negotiated number of Palestinian prisoners and a second six-week ceasefire. Negotiators would also address broader arrangements aimed at ending the war and facilitating an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. If an agreement is reached on the second phase, the third phase will focus on rebuilding Gaza and establishing its governance framework. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sources close to the negotiations emphasized the complexity of the process, noting that talks encompass all 98 hostages held by Hamas and other factions. 'The first phase is naturally the focus as it sets everything in motion,' one source said. 'Efforts are being made to maximize the number of hostages released alive.' Key issues still under discussion include the situation in northern Gaza, the Philadelphi Route, and the security perimeter. Decisions about the fate of high-profile prisoners—whether they will return home or be exiled to a third country—also remain unresolved. 'The hostages' condition is a critical factor,' one insider explained. 'Achieving a deal hinges on resolving these outstanding issues.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkdsdymdke	2025-01-13T04:32:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/03/H10EohEh0/H10EohEh0_0_5_1417_798_0_small.jpg

Tanker hit by Houthis salvaged, Red Sea disaster averted	A risky operation to salvage an oil tanker attacked by Houthi terrorists in the Red Sea and avert what could have been one of the largest oil spills in recorded history has been completed, British maritime security company Ambrey and Greece have said. The 900-foot Greek-registered MT Sounion, carrying 150,000 tonnes of crude oil, was struck by several missiles and drones and caught fire on Aug. 21, triggering fears of an oil spill that could cause catastrophic environmental damage in the area. Months later, the vessel has been declared safe and its cargo has been removed, said Ambrey, which led the salvage operation. In mid-September, Sounion, which was hit 58 miles off the Yemeni coast, was towed to a safe location 150 miles to the north by a flotilla of seven salvage vessels escorted by the European Union's naval force Aspides. Extinguishing the fires on board took three weeks in difficult climate conditions, Ambrey said, and the vessel was later towed north to Suez for her cargo to be removed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk1g00umv1e	2025-01-13T02:26:01-08:00

Eliyahu Revivo of Netanyahu's ruling Likud party reacts during Knesset committee meeting to the father of a hostage who says the prime minister should be arrested by the ICC for crimes against his own people as well 'If you go on like this, you will ensure your son remains in Hamas dungeons for years,' A father of one of the hostages held in Gaza was told on Monday, by a member of the ruling coalition. Eliyahu Revivo, a lawmaker from Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party and a member of the Knesset Constitution, Law, Justice Committee shouted at Yehuda Cohen, whose son Nimrod was abducted to Gaza during the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7, after he said Netanyahu should be arrested by the International Criminal Court (ICC) not only for crimes against Gazans but for his crimes against IDF soldiers. Cohen said that if the threat of arrest would push the prime minister toward accepting a hostage release deal, he would recommend it. Revivo then turned his ire at a relative of slain hostage Carmel Gat who told him to stop yelling at a father of a hostage. 'Who do you think you are?' Revivo asked. Cohen warned of the government once again foiling the chance for a hostage release deal and opting for a 'murderous ideology, such as settlements and the killing of soldiers' over saving lives. 'Rather than sanctifying life, they are sanctifying death,' he said. 'We heard what [Finance Minister Bezalel] Smotrich said.

Biden officials who resigned over administration support for Isra...	13 officials from the State Department, the White House, and the U.S. military have so far resigned; In interviews some reveal the extent of American support to Israel after October 7 in terms of weapon deliveries, claiming to have been silenced by top brass The prestigious American news magazine '60 Minutes' devoted an episode on Sunday evening to the several resignations in the U.S. State Department in protest of the Biden administration's support for Israel's war in Gaza. According to the investigation, since the beginning of the war a record number of formal reservation requests have been submitted, a tool created during the Vietnam War to allow employees to express opposition to government policy. A total of 13 officials from the State Department, the White House, and the U.S. military have resigned in protest over the government's support for Israel. Hala Rharrit, an ex-diplomat who quit in protest shared her story. 'I would show images of children that were starved to death,' she said. 'In one incident, I was basically berated, 'Don't put that image in there. We don't want to see it. We don't want to see that the children are starving to death.' She said the U.S. had become a target in the Arab world due to its support for Israel since the October 7 massacre. According to Rharrit, who served in the State Department for two decades, when she presented harsh images of children affected by bombs in department reports, she was met with fierce opposition from senior colleagues: 'I would show the complicity that was indisputable. Fragments of U.S. bombs next to massacres of mostly children. And that's the devastation,' she told the camera, reliving moments that broke her. Ultimately, she was told that her reports were no longer needed, and she resigned from her position in public protest. Andrew Miller, who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Israel-Palestinian affairs, also spoke out publicly against American policy, but chose to do so after his resignation last June. Miller, who was considered the most senior member of the Biden administration to resign and criticize support for Israel, said that there were no clear red lines for the IDF's use of American weapons. According to Miller, the message conveyed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the Biden administration was that he was the one in the driver's seat, that American support would always be there, and that he could take it for granted. Miller also said that Biden refrained from setting clear limits for Netanyahu, beyond a general call for compliance with international law. 'There were general expectations, but no specific red lines were given beyond the usual language of compliance with international law,' he noted. Miller criticized the use of the 2,000-pound (908 kg) American bombs which led to numerous civilian casualties. He questioned Israel's alleged use of these bombs to target one or two people in densely populated areas. While he says it is reasonable to assume that Israel used American weapons in violation of international law during its operations in Gaza, he states there was no evidence that Israel was committing genocide. He also said the reports' findings were biased because the Americans rely on Israel to get information from the ground. He added that although the U.S. believes that Israel acted inappropriately, it has gained the benefit of the doubt because Americans hold respect for the IDF's reports. Another interviewee on the show, Josh Paul, who served as a State Department administrator and signed off on major arms deals, pointed to the direct connection between the Israeli Air Force's attacks and the American arms industry. 'There is a linkage between every single bomb that is dropped in Gaza and the U.S. because every single bomb that is dropped is dropped from an American-made plane,' he said. Paul, who resigned 10 days after the war began. He described an atmosphere in which there was no room for debate or discussion, and that decisions to transfer weapons to Israel were made with explicit instructions from the highest levels of the White House. He claimed there was no room for discussion. 'This came from the president, from the secretary and from those around them,'' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The White House declined to comment directly on the investigation, but senior administration officials said the policy was designed to prevent a wider war in the Middle East. They said cutting off aid to Israel could have encouraged its enemies, including Hamas and Hezbollah, to escalate the situation.

Qatar delivers 'final draft' of hostage deal to Israel, Israeli o...	Finance Minister Smotrich says pending agreement is catastrophic for Israel's security, a capitulation that he could not support; official says Israel negotiating for the release of all 98 hostages and working to maximize the number of live captives in 1st phase Mediator Qatar has handed Israel and Hamas a 'final' draft of a cease-fire and hostage release agreement designed to end the war in Gaza, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters on Monday. A breakthrough was reached in Doha after midnight following talks between Israel's spy chiefs, President-elect Trump's Middle East envoy and Qatar’s prime minister, the official said. Officials in Israel denied receiving the draft and said the final agreement is dependent on Hamas. 'we are very close to a deal but it is all in the hands of Hamas,' an official said. Sources with knowledge of the details of the deal said there are a number of outstanding matters that could determine whether an agreement is reached. 'It is to do with the situation in northern Gaza, the Philadelphi corridor, the mile wide stretch along the border and the question of how many prisoners are released and who had veto power over that, including the release of convicted murderers and whether they would return home or be exiled,' according to a source. The sources said the condition of the hostages is above all considerations. 'The negotiations are about all 98 hostages held by Hamas and the other Gaza factions. The first phase of the deal is in the spotlight for obvious reasons because that is the beginning of the entire process and agreement on that is near but the negotiations are over all of them, without exception,' a source said. 'The first phase will include the release of 33 hostages and there is a massive effort to maximize the number of live hostages in that group.' Meanwhile, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he could not support the deal. In a post on X he said the pending agreement is catastrophic for Israel's security. We will not be part of a capitulation deal that would include the release of arch-terrorists, stop the war and dissolve its achievement won in blood while sacrificing the lives of many hostages,' he said in his post. 'This is the time to continue in full force, conquer and purify the entire Strip and finally take control of the humanitarian aid from Hamas and open the gates of hell until Hamas is defeated and all the hostages returned.' Earlier, a Palestinian Authority source told Ynet on Monday morning that Qadura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee, who is responsible, among other things, for the issue of terrorists held in Israeli prisons, 'went to Qatar to meet with the negotiating team and prepare the list of Palestinian prisoners who will be released as part of a hostage deal.' Fares claimed Sunday that more than 3,000 Palestinian prisoners will be released in the first phase of the deal. This could be indication of further progress in the talks to secure a cease-fire and hostage release deal. The Israeli delegation to the talks, including Mossad Chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar and IDF representative Major General Nitzan Alon, remained in Qatar, where negotiations were underway with the participation of U.S. President Joe Biden's envoy Brett McGurk and Steve Witkoff, who is president-elect Donald Trump's Mideast envoy. Biden spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday just eight days before the U.S. president is set to leave office. The two leaders discussed the efforts underway to reach a deal to halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave and free the remaining hostages there, the White House said in a statement. The Prime Minister's Office said after the call that Netanyahu briefed the president on the mandate given to the Israeli delegation to advance the release of hostages. U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance told Fox News Sunday in an interview taped on Saturday that he expects a deal for the release of U.S. hostages in the Middle East to be announced in the final days of the Biden administration, maybe in the last day or two. The talks in Qatar are being held under media silence but, according to a report in the Saudi Arabian Alhadath channel, one of the main outstanding questions is to where some of the Palestinians prisoners that would be freed in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages would be exiled. Turkey and Qatar have been raised as possibilities but there were previous reports that Iran could also be an option, although it was not currently mentioned, according to the Saudi report. The Asharq channel in Saudi Arabia said the deal being advanced is based on the May 27 proposal and would include three stages. In the first stage 34 hostages would be released in exchange for a six-week cease-fire and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. According to the sources quoted in the report, among them are 48 prisoners who were previously freed in the 2011 deal to release IDF soldier Gilad Shalit and were arrested again, 90 women, 150 to 200 convicted terrorists who had been sentenced to life in prison and 560 elderly or sick prisoners. Outstanding questions in the first stage are the identity of the hostages that would be released from captivity, the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas, the return of displaced Gaza residents to areas they evacuated - after inspection by a third party, reopening of the Rafah border crossing to allow humanitarian aid deliveries, and removal of sick people and humanitarian cases for medical treatment outside Gaza. The second phase would begin one week after the first and would include the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners and a second six-week cease-fire. At this stage, negotiations would begin on the end of the war and an IDF withdrawal of troops. According to the sources, the third phase would be negotiated if the second phase is agreed and that would include the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip and how it would be governed.

Knesset to approve 1 billion shekels for massacre victims, but it...	Some families will still fall through the cracks: Mother of Nova survivor says she is supporting her son who cannot hold a job but is not due to receive any government assistance; Head of NGO assisting families: 'It is a moral duty,' to provide adequate funds The Knesset Labor and Welfare Committee is expected on Monday to approve 1 billion shekel to fund assistance to victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. The final agreement offers a one-time sum ranging from 7,180 shekels to 28,720 shekels, based on certain criteria and a refund of rehabilitation costs totaling up to 30,000 shekels. Members of family of survivors who were witness to the events, most residents of the city of Ofakim, and adults whose parents were killed in the massacre could fall through the cracks and receive very little or no compensation. The existing law does not recognize family members who were witness to the massacre by phone or text or those who were already recognized as victims of terror attacks. The funds allotted to cover the needs of those impacted by the massacre are insufficient to cover the costs of medical and emotional rehabilitation and care. Osnat Hasson, the mother of Nova survivor Elad who represented the parents of survivors of the festival, said she is not eligible for government funds despite the support she has been giving her son. 'I cannot work full time, and most of the parents of survivors are in the same position,' she said. 'My son now depends on me and cannot hold down a job.' She said the government should take responsibility and recognize her family and others like it as victims and provide a respectable and adequate response. > Efrat Eton, who heads the 'Secure Heart' non-profit, has been providing emotional support for Nova survivors and their families. She said the government has caused fights among families that were impacted instead of learning the different needs and providing appropriate responses. 'It is wrong that some survivors who want to rehabilitate would be given disability compensation while others who witnessed their loved ones' trauma and have been providing them with support, are ignored,' she said. 'This is a moral duty and in the national interest.' Residents of Ofakim, living in the quarter that was overrun by the terrorists on Oct. 7 were allotted only a few thousand shekels. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk8jx4zwjl	2025-01-12T23:14:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/11/rklRO1h6vR/rklRO1h6vR_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
As deal seems ever closer, head of Palestinian prisoners affairs ...	Qadura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee, to prepare the list of Palestinian prisoners to be released if a cease-fire an hostage release deal is reached; Claims 3,000 would be freed from Israeli jail in the first phase A Palestinian Authority source told Ynet on Monday morning that Qadura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee, who is responsible, among other things, for the issue of terrorists held in Israeli prisons, 'went to Qatar to meet with the negotiating team and prepare the list of Palestinian prisoners who will be released as part of a hostage deal.' Fares claimed Sunday that more than 3,000 Palestinian prisoners will be released in the first phase of the deal. This could be indication of further progress in the talks to secure a cease-fire and hostage release deal. The Israeli delegation to the talks, including Mossad Chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar and IDF representative Major General Nitzan Alon, remained in Qatar, where negotiations were underway with the participation of U.S. President Joe Biden's envoy Brett McGurk and Steve Witkoff, who is president-elect Donald Trump's Mideast envoy. Biden spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday just eight days before the U.S. president is set to leave office. The two leaders discussed the efforts underway to reach a deal to halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave and free the remaining hostages there, the White House said in a statement. The Prime Minister's Office said after the call that Netanyahu briefed the president on the mandate given to the Israeli delegation to advance the release of hostages. U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance told Fox News Sunday in an interview taped on Saturday that he expects a deal for the release of U.S. hostages in the Middle East to be announced in the final days of the Biden administration, maybe in the last day or two. The talks in Qatar are being held under media silence but, according to a report in the Saudi Arabian Alhadath channel, one of the main outstanding questions is to where some of the Palestinians prisoners that would be freed in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages would be exiled. Turkey and Qatar have been raised as possibilities but there were previous reports that Iran could also be an option, although it was not currently mentioned, according to the Saudi report. The Asharq channel in Saudi Arabia said the deal being advanced is based on the May 27 proposal and would include three stages. In the first stage 34 hostages would be released in exchange for a six-week cease-fire and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. According to the sources quoted in the report, among them are 48 prisoners who were previously freed in the 2011 deal to release IDF soldier Gilad Shalit and were arrested again, 90 women, 150 to 200 convicted terrorists who had been sentenced to life in prison and 560 elderly or sick prisoners. Outstanding questions in the first stage are the identity of the hostages that would be released from captivity, the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas, the return of displaced Gaza residents to areas they evacuated - after inspection by a third party, reopening of the Rafah border crossing to allow humanitarian aid deliveries, and removal of sick people and humanitarian cases for medical treatment outside Gaza. The second phase would begin one week after the first and would include the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners and a second six-week cease-fire. At this stage, negotiations would begin on the end of the war and an IDF withdrawal of troops. According to the sources, the third phase would be negotiated if the second phase is agreed and that would include the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip and how it would be governed.

Is the war against Hamas in Gaza over?	Dr. Gerald Steinberg says some argue Israel could agree to a ceasefire now and still respond later The war against Hamas in Gaza is far from over, according to Dr. Gerald Steinberg, CEO of NGO Monitor. Speaking to ILTV, Steinberg noted that the recent casualties in Gaza demonstrate that Hamas still has significant ground-fighting capabilities. This, he explained, complicates any potential ceasefire-for-hostage deal aimed at ending the war. However, Steinberg acknowledged that some argue Israel could agree to a ceasefire now and still respond later if new weapons are uncovered or Hamas carries out further attacks. 'There are going to be a lot of questions about the details of any deal,' Steinberg said. He emphasized the importance of U.S. pressure on Qatar to cease funding Hamas as part of any ceasefire agreement. If that pressure is successful, Steinberg said, 'we’ll get a deal.'

Mideast expert: Iran cares less about the Houthis	Benny Sabti says the Houthis operate independently and are a low priority for the Iranian regime The Iranian regime does not prioritize the Houthis, according to Benny Sabti, an Iranian researcher for the INSS. Speaking to ILTV, Sabti explained that Iran cares less about the Houthis compared to its other proxies. While the regime has supplied the Houthis with weapons for many years, it largely trusts them to operate independently, without Iranian interference. 'It’s not like Hezbollah or the Iraqis, or maybe even the Syrian regime or proxies that they interfere with all the time,' Sabti said. 'The Houthis are so far away that they also care less about them.' Sabti added that any strikes involving the Houthis—whether they are launched toward Israel or target the Houthis themselves—ultimately serve Iran's interests. 'It’s just a good and positive point for Iran. The more we are occupied with the Houthis, it’s good for Iranians,' he said.

24 dead and rising: Wildfires continue to rage through Los Angele...	More than 12,000 buildings have been destroyed and the fire has spread across about 160 square kilometers; About 150,000 remain evacuated from their homes, and the outlook for the future is worrying: Strong winds will resume this week, making firefighting operations more difficult The death toll from the massive wildfires raging in and around Los Angeles has risen to 24, with at least 16 others still missing. According to the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, eight people were killed in the devastated Pacific Palisades neighborhood and 16 in the Eaton neighborhood. Authorities expect the death toll to rise as the search continues. Officials said they expected that figure to increase as teams with cadaver dogs conduct systematic grid searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing. The fires, which spread over more than 160 square kilometers, have destroyed more than 12,000 structures, including homes and apartments, and have also damaged vehicles. The disaster affects a region of about 13 million residents, with about 150,000 still under evacuation orders. Officials said last night that most evacuation orders will not be lifted until high wind warnings are removed. In addition to the evacuees, tens of thousands of California residents are experiencing power outages due to the fire. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday, with sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph) and gusts in the mountains reaching 70 mph (113 kph). The most dangerous day will be Tuesday, said weather service meteorologist Rich Thompson. Fire fighting crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes nearly 1,400 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed sending firefighters to Los Angeles on Sunday night, instructing the country's interior minister to 'prepare for the possible participation of Ukrainian rescuers in the fight against the fires in California.' In a video posted by Zelensky, he said that 'the situation there is extremely difficult, and Ukrainians can help Americans save lives.' He later added that '150 firefighters are already ready.' The fire broke out nearly a week ago on Tuesday, and despite relatively calm winds that have allowed firefighters to begin to gain control of the fires in recent days, the outlook for the future is worrying and predicts a resumption of strong winds during the week, in an area that has not seen rain in more than eight months. According to estimates, the fires in Los Angeles are already among the most expensive in U.S. history, and the investment bank J.P. Morgan estimates the economic damage at about $50 billion . AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on the weather and its impact, predicts that the economic damage could reach $135-$150 billion. The investigation into the incident revealed serious failures in emergency infrastructure. California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered an independent investigation to understand why a 10-million-gallon water reservoir was shut down and many fire hydrants were not working. 'This is very disturbing,' he said. 'We need answers to ensure that this never happens again and that all resources are available to us to fight these catastrophic fires.' Los Angeles Fire Chief Christine Crowley sharply criticized the city’s leadership, alleging a lack of funding for the firefighting system. 'When a firefighter goes to a hydrant, we expect there to be water there,' she said. The flames consumed schools, churches, a synagogue, libraries, bars, restaurants, banks and historic sites, as well as Will Rogers' Western Farmhouse and another historic mansion built in 1887. The Walt Disney Company announced a $15 million donation to recovery and relief efforts. California fire officials say the cause of the fires remains unclear and that an active investigation is underway, but U.S. media reported last week that arson investigators are involved in the investigation of the fire in the Palisades neighborhood, which was the first in a wave of fires and caused enormous destruction. It is already being described as one of the largest natural disasters in Los Angeles history. The pictures from Los Angeles speak for themselves. Where the homes of celebrities and movie stars once stood, what is now mostly visible are ruined buildings, burned trees jutting out from the rubble, and isolated mansions left exposed on all sides. The Pacific Palisades neighborhood has been used extensively for filming movies and television shows. The neighborhood, which was established about 100 years ago as a religious commune, quickly became highly sought-after due to its beauty and proximity to nature - a long stretch of coastline, rugged cliffs and green valleys - as well as to the city center. The average price of a house there was $4.6 million. Among the buildings demolished in the upscale neighborhood were the homes of celebrities such as Billy Crystal, Jeff Bridges and Paris Hilton. Palisades High School, which appeared in films such as 'Carrie' and 'Friday the 13th,' was completely destroyed. The Real Inn Malibu seafood restaurant, a favorite of Jerry Seinfeld and Cindy Crawford, also was destroyed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1qhi7gvye	2025-01-12T21:08:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/rJSQEZ11P1g/rJSQEZ11P1g_0_193_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Report from Hostage Square: Serious developments in ceasefire neg...	Dr. Mazen Abu Siam mourns deaths of Youssef and Hamza Ziyadne: 'The family waited for 15 months with great hope that their sons were alive' After the discovery of Youssef Ziyadne's death, forensic tests have now positively identified his son, Hamza Ziyadne, as deceased. The father and son were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, 2023, during the attack on southern Israel. Their bodies were found in a tunnel near Rafah, Gaza, with Hamza's death confirmed on January 10. The Ziyadne family, who waited in hope for 15 months, were devastated by the news. They, along with many other families, have demanded the Israeli government take immediate action to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 'The family waited for 15 months with great hope that their sons were alive,' said a family friend, Dr. Mazen Abu Siam. 'On the day before yesterday, when the list of hostages to be released was published, Youssef's name was on it. So the hopes were high, but the disappointment was bigger. Currently, the family is very calm but is very angry with the government and decision-makers who have stalled in forging the deal, not only for their sons but for the sake of all the hostages.' Reports indicate serious developments in ceasefire negotiations. While progress has been slow, a Hamas spokesperson claims a deal is imminent. Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and Mossad Chief David Barnea are directly involved, signaling the gravity of these talks. U.S., Qatari, and Egyptian mediators are facilitating efforts, raising hopes of securing a ceasefire and the release of hostages. With the clock ticking towards U.S. President-elect Trump’s inauguration, families, officials, and citizens continue to press for a resolution. The call for the return of hostages is louder than ever. For now, all eyes are on the negotiators and the government as the fate of these innocent lives hangs in the balance.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk8jbxfpkg	2025-01-12T20:52:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/11/Hyd1AHgwye/Hyd1AHgwye_0_59_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Believe it or not, not everything is related to Palestinians'	Comment on L.A. wildfires: 'It’s time for the world to wake up and stop tolerating the anti-Israel bullies' Los Angeles, California, continues to face tragic and deadly fires that have claimed the lives of at least 16 people, destroyed over 12,000 buildings, and displaced more than 150,000 Californians. Additionally, there is no power for over 90,000 residents in the area. As over 1,400 firefighters battle the ongoing blaze caused by the strong, dry Santa Ana winds, there have also been reports of arson and mass looting of evacuated homes. One of the worst fires, the Palisades Fire, has ravaged over 5,000 buildings and homes in the area. Yet, miraculously, Kehillat Israel, a local synagogue, managed to survive the fire. Now, the synagogue is not only serving as a symbol of hope in the neighborhood but also as a refuge for evacuees. In fact, the Los Angeles Jewish community is stepping up across the city, hosting meals and welcoming evacuees from all over. Unfortunately, not everyone is responding to the fires with the same generosity and support. Almost immediately following the outbreak of fires in California, anti-Israel activists, organizations, and even states began comparing the LA fires to the situation in Gaza, with some even celebrating the fires. Social media posts expressing sympathy for the people in LA who have lost their homes were riddled with comments not only attempting to make the story about Gaza but, in many cases, celebrating the devastation in LA. HTS, the Islamist group that overthrew Assad in Syria, made a post claiming the fires were 'justice,' while social media influencers like Khaled Safi implied the fires were payback for Gaza. Official regime media from the Islamic Republic of Iran also praised the fires, calling them God’s revenge for Gaza and Lebanon. Meanwhile, celebrities like Jamie Lee Curtis also made crude comparisons. Shortly after the fires broke out, notorious anti-Israel group Code Pink posted a video lobbying in the U.S. Congress about alleged connections between the wildfires and what they called the 'Gaza genocide.' Because apparently, nothing in the world can happen without it being about Palestinians. Climate change, Black Lives Matter, women’s rights, the Olympics, COVID-19, LGBTQ+ rights, even Christmas—Palestinian activists have attempted to hijack every single one of these issues to make themselves the focus, with no regard for the suffering or needs of others. Believe it or not, not everything is related to Palestinians. Not everything that takes place needs to be hijacked to make Palestinians the center of the world. This is not solidarity; it’s disrespect. Showing support for tragedies around the world means nothing when it’s only used to advance an agenda. It’s time for the world to wake up and stop tolerating the anti-Israel bullies who are harassing not only Jewish communities but virtually all of society in the West today.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjpimmgpjx	2025-01-12T20:24:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/09/BJfypSQ6Ukl/BJfypSQ6Ukl_0_303_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

16 dead in Los Angeles wildfires: When the flames reach me, will ...	Glued to fire-tracking apps, watching red skies from bed and hearing firefighting helicopters overhead—the city braces for another wave of fires fueled by strong winds On Thursday afternoon, massive plumes of smoke rose over the hills opposite my home, growing into monstrous clouds by evening. The Watch Duty app buzzed incessantly, warning about the fire’s relentless march toward us, crossing the hills and threatening the residential neighborhoods of Encino, Tarzana and Sherman Oaks. I try to avoid the nerve-wracking news, yet it’s impossible to resist checking the app, which provides a real-time glimpse of the fire’s terrifying advance. As of now, only 11% of the Pacific Palisades fire has been contained. The winds, expected to intensify, loom as a dangerous force, threatening to spread the blaze even further. On Friday night, I lay in bed, staring at the fiery red skies and the eerie yellow glow of the flames in the distance. A helicopter circled overhead, valiantly dropping water to combat the inferno. I fell asleep, clinging to the hope that by morning, firefighters would gain some control over the advancing blaze. The mood in Los Angeles is one of mounting frustration. Everyone points fingers at the same culprits: Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom. Since taking office two years ago, Bass slashed $118 million from the firefighting budget. Newsom, for his part, reduced funding for wildfire response and forest resilience by over $100 million. In a state infamous for its annual wildfire disasters, such cuts feel utterly reckless. My cousin, who spent nearly 40 years living in Pacific Palisades, lost her home. Another cousin lost hers in Malibu. Not everyone in these neighborhoods is a millionaire. Many lived there long before the areas became havens for the wealthy. John Carr, 65, stayed behind to save his house in Pacific Palisades, built by his parents in 1960. 'Some things in life are worth fighting for,' he said. 'If I lose this house, I won’t be able to afford to build another.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Thanks to Carr’s bravery, his house and the two homes next door were spared. As I try to imagine whether I would have the courage to stay and fight for my own home if the fires came closer, I can only hope I never have to make that choice. On Saturday morning, I woke up to a massive gray cloud overhead—but thankfully, the flames had not yet reached us. Six months ago, many insurance companies in Los Angeles canceled wildfire coverage, deeming it too risky. This left numerous homeowners without insurance, while others are uncertain how much their policies will actually cover. Either way, it won’t be 100%.

Zelensky says ready to exchange N. Korean soldiers for Ukrainians...	Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday Kyiv is ready to hand over North Korean soldiers to their leader Kim Jong Un if he can organize their exchange for Ukrainians held captive in Russia. 'In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be more. It's only a matter of time before our troops manage to capture others,' Zelensky said on the social media platform X. Zelensky said on Saturday that Ukraine had captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk region, the first time Ukraine has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the nearly three-year-old war last autumn. Ukrainian and Western assessments say that some 11,000 troops from Russia's ally North Korea have been deployed in the Kursk region to support Moscow's forces. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied their presence. Zelensky has said Russian and North Korean forces had suffered heavy losses.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skaooc11wkl	2025-01-12T10:45:12-08:00	
Israeli Druze leader travels to US to rally support for Syrian Dr...	Amid fears of civil war in Syria and the rise of HTS chief Ahmad al-Sharaa, the Druze community resists disarmament and demands international intervention to address rights violations and ensure stability in southern Syria amid growing tensions Amid fears of a civil war in Syria following the fall of Assad’s regime and the rise of jihadist rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, minority communities, particularly the Druze, are increasingly concerned about their safety and future in the country. The Druze fear persecution if they do not comply with al-Sharaa’s new mandates, which include revising Syria’s school curriculum to emphasize Islamic teachings and Quranic studies, even for non-Muslims. Furthermore, the new leadership in Syria has refused to appoint a Druze governor in Sweida, the largest Druze-majority region in the Middle East, located in southwestern Syria. Instead, Ahmad Ouda, who is held responsible for the deaths of over 200 Druze during 2017 clashes—primarily in the village of Hader—has been appointed to oversee Druze areas. In light of these developments, Druze residents in Sweida have refused to disarm and surrender their weapons to al-Sharaa’s forces, which are essentially a rebranded version of the Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist organization, which has a history of carrying out attacks in Druze areas. The Druze have also blocked the entry of new regime police forces into their regions until their rights and status are secured. Before ascending to power, al-Sharaa made public statements against the Druze, declaring, 'They are Muslims who have lost their way and must be brought back to the right path.' Such remarks have alarmed the Druze minority, who remain deeply skeptical of the new Syrian leader’s assurances. Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, is actively working to protect the Druze in Syria and ensure their safety amid growing instability. Sheikh Tarif has traveled to the United States, where he has met with senior international leaders, including UN Secretary-General António Guterres, to discuss the plight of the Druze in Syria and Lebanon due to the current volatile situation. During his visit to Washington and New York, Sheikh Tarif held meetings with U.S. senators, congress members, senior officials from both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Mike Herzog and Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon. He also addressed a prominent think tank focused on Middle Eastern issues. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following their meeting, Ambassador Danon said: 'I thank Sheikh Tarif for his significant visit to the U.S. The Druze community is an inseparable part of Israeli society. We are doing everything in our power to assist them and ensure their safety both in Israel and abroad. We will continue to work on the international stage to guarantee their well-being.' Sheikh Tarif emphasized the need for international awareness and intervention, saying, 'The uncertainty in southern Syria necessitates international involvement and monitoring. Stability in Syria cannot be achieved without ensuring the stability and historical rights of Druze communities.' During the meetings, Sheikh Tarif also raised the issue of Israeli captives held in Gaza, urging greater involvement from the UN. Secretary-General Guterres reaffirmed his commitment, emphasizing that the hostages should be released unconditionally as a top humanitarian priority. He noted that he carries a token from the captives’ families as a constant reminder of the issue. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjc3kwzw1x	2025-01-12T10:15:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/17/BkW3ELrJHyg/BkW3ELrJHyg_198_45_1061_597_0_small.jpg
Biden calls for immediate cease-fire in call with Netanyahu, Whit...	Eight days before leaving office, US president urges PM to secure hostage deal before Trump’s inauguration; Netanyahu updates Biden on Israel’s Doha delegation, as VP-elect JD Vance projects progress soon U.S. President Joe Biden spoke on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said, as U.S. officials race to reach a Gaza hostage and cease-fire deal before Biden leaves office on Jan. 20. Biden and Netanyahu discussed efforts underway to reach a deal to halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave and free the remaining hostages there, the White House said in a statement after the two leaders spoke by telephone. Biden 'stressed the immediate need for a cease-fire in Gaza and return of the hostages with a surge in humanitarian aid enabled by a stoppage in the fighting under the deal,' it said. Netanyahu updated Biden on progress in the talks and on the mandate he has given his top-level security delegation now in Doha in order to advance a hostage deal, Netanyahu said in a statement. The two leaders also discussed 'the fundamentally changed regional circumstances following the cease-fire deal in Lebanon, the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, and the weakening of Iran's power in the region,' the White House said. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN's State of the Union earlier on Sunday that the parties were 'very, very close' to reaching a deal, but still had to get it across the finish line. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He said Biden was getting daily updates on the talks in Doha, where Israeli and Palestinian officials have said since Thursday that some progress has been made in the indirect talks between Israel and Hamas. 'We are still determined to use every day we have in office to get this done,' Sullivan said, 'and we are not, by any stretch of imagination, setting this aside.' He said there was still a chance to reach an agreement before Biden leaves office, but that it was also possible 'Hamas, in particular, remains intransigent.' During their call, Netanyahu also thanked Biden for his lifelong support of Israel and 'the extraordinary support from the United States for Israel's security and national defense,' the White House said. Israel launched its assault in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance told Fox News Sunday in an interview taped on Saturday that he expects a deal for the release of U.S. hostages in the Middle East to be announced in the final days of the Biden administration, maybe in the last day or two. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, a staunch supporter of Israel, has strongly backed Netanyahu's goal of destroying Hamas. He has promised to bring peace to the Middle East, but has not said how he would accomplish that. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqxg9zvkg	2025-01-12T10:02:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/14/B1ebI4BtxR/B1ebI4BtxR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Decorated IDF soldier dies in motorcycle crash during Thailand va...	Rotem Yaish, a Givati Brigade soldier who served for a year in Gaza and previously awarded a presidential citation for excellence, killed in motorcycle accident while vacationing with his family in Koh Samui Rotem Yaish, an IDF soldier who received a presidential citation for his distinguished military service, was killed in a motorcycle accident in Koh Samui, Thailand, on Friday during a family vacation. Yaish, who enlisted in the Givati Brigade in December 2021, had recently completed his compulsory military service and served in the reserves during the war in Gaza. The eldest of three siblings, Yaish was remembered as a dedicated and accomplished soldier. His mother, Tahel, shared in 2022 her pride on the day he joined the army: 'We hugged him, encouraged him and spoke about this new chapter in his life with great excitement.' A year later, the family’s pride grew as Rotem was honored by President Isaac Herzog at Israel’s Independence Day state ceremony. At the time, Yaish expressed his joy about his role as a commander in the military: 'I’m heading to the front lines now with my soldiers, and I’m proud to serve.' When asked whom he told first about his award, he replied, 'My mom.' To him, being Israeli meant 'coming home in uniform and mutual responsibility.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the war in Gaza, Yaish served for over a year, enduring grueling combat operations and losing comrades. He completed his service and continued to serve in the reserves. Rotem’s uncle, Dror, eulogized him on Facebook: 'For the past year and a half, you fought in Gaza. We prayed, worried, and feared the words ‘cleared for publication.’ Every incident made us hold our breath, hoping it wasn’t you. You lost friends, soldiers under your command, and commanders. But you came out of Gaza like a lion, leaving behind a generation of soldiers you led.' Dror recounted the family’s joy just a week prior when Rotem and his loved ones embarked on a dream vacation to Thailand. 'The pictures you sent showed how much you were enjoying yourselves. But on Friday, just an hour before Shabbat, the phone didn’t stop ringing. Then the news came—Rotem was gone. We’re heartbroken and in shock.' Yaish’s body will be brought back to Israel later this week for burial. He leaves behind his parents and two younger siblings. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rktxvuzvkl	2025-01-12T08:39:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/HJV5UEbw1x/HJV5UEbw1x_0_63_449_253_0_small.jpg

Riots erupt in Italy after police kill Egyptian teen; synagogue a...	Protests erupted in Rome and Bologna after police footage shows scooter chase ending in death of Rami El-Gamal, who fled routine stop; in Bologna, activists target synagogue with Molotov cocktails and fireworks while scrawling 'Justice for Gaza' on nearby wall The death of Rami El-Gamal, a 19-year-old of Egyptian origin, in late November has ignited violent protests across Italian cities, with outrage mounting against police. The unrest has also spilled over into antisemitic violence, with the Jewish community in Bologna falling victim to targeted attacks. The incident that sparked the turmoil began on Nov. 24 in Milan's Crosto neighborhood. El-Gamal and his friend, 22-year-old Tunisian-born Fares Bouzidi, were riding a scooter late at night when police attempted a routine stop. The pair fled, reportedly because Bouzidi lacked a valid driver’s license, and El-Gamal may not have had proper identification. A high-speed chase ensued, spanning eight kilometers (five miles) until the scooter crashed, killing El-Gamal. Initial reports framed the incident as an accident, but newly released surveillance footage depicted police repeatedly ramming the scooter before it toppled. Recordings from the police patrol car captured officers hurling insults at the pair and one officer urging another to 'hit them.' After the crash, officers allegedly threatened a bystander, Omar, who had filmed the chase, demanding he delete the footage. The footage, which surfaced last week, reignited public anger, leading to violent demonstrations over the weekend. Protests escalated in Rome and Bologna, where masked demonstrators clashed with police, damaged property and injured several officers. In Bologna, rioters also targeted the city’s synagogue. Bologna Mayor Matteo Lepore expressed solidarity with the Jewish community, calling the attack 'shocking and unacceptable.' The president of Bologna’s Jewish community, Daniele De Paz, described the attack as deliberate, with rioters hurling Molotov cocktails and homemade explosives while shouting threats. Graffiti reading 'Justice for Gaza' was scrawled near the synagogue, and pro-Palestinian groups were reportedly among the rioters. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The synagogue attack drew sharp criticism of local authorities, with Jewish leaders accusing the city of leniency toward escalating pro-Palestinian violence. Bologna’s recent decision to display a Palestinian flag at city hall has also been met with backlash. Politicians weighed in, with right-wing leaders defending the police and condemning the protests while left-leaning figures criticized alleged police misconduct. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni denounced the violence, expressing 'deep concern' over the riots and attacks on institutions. The unrest has left Bologna’s historic center resembling a war zone, with widespread damage and heightened tensions gripping the country. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skczllwpkx	2025-01-12T07:11:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/BkAvxQWP1l/BkAvxQWP1l_0_134_1280_720_0_small.jpg

German far-right AfD heads for elections with support from Musk	Tech billionaire says AfD is Germany's only chance for survival; Alice Weidel elected party candidate for chancellor calls for deportation of immigrants Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party kicked off its election campaign after a two-hour delay caused by left-wing protesters who demonstrated outside, clashing with police. The two-day event that started on Saturday is being held in the town of Riesa in the eastern state of Saxony, a stronghold of AfD, now the second largest political party, according to polling. Alice Weidel was chosen as the party's candidate for chancellor in the elections scheduled for February 23. The Afd platform is to be revealed in the conference. It will call for diminished support for Ukraine in its war against the Russian invasion, a demand that Germany leave the EU, and the resumption of nuclear energy production along with harsher laws restricting immigration. Weidel had called for a mass deportation of immigrants from Germany, even those who were already German citizens. Weidel is considered an outsider in the male dominated party. She is a lesbian who is raising two children in Switzerland with her partner, an immigrant from Sri Lanka. She received huge support recently from American tech billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk in posts on his platform X. He said only the Afd would be able to save Germany. In an online chat with Musk, Weidel said Hitler had come from the left-wing and that the AfD was in no way connected to him. When pushed into a corner by Musk, she expressed support for Israel's right to exist and defend itself. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Afd has been encouraged by political events in neighboring Austria where the ruling coalition, formed to block the participation of the far-right Freedom Party, fell and the president tasked the former Nazi party with forming a new government. Weidel is unlikely to become chancellor in the next elections although events in Austria could signal that all options are open. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rji3igbdkx	2025-01-12T03:29:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/BJXdk11Wvkl/BJXdk11Wvkl_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Palestinian senior official claims more than 3,000 terrorists to ...	The man responsible for the Palestinian prisoners issue makes a rare statement: All children and women in Israeli prisons will be released, along with dozens of terrorists from the Shalit deal Qadura Fares, head of the Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Committee who is responsible for the terrorists held in Israeli prisons, made a rare statement on Sunday amid reported progress in the hostage negotiations. According to him, in the first phase of the deal, 25 hostages will be released in exchange for the release of 48 terrorists who were released in the Shalit deal and have since been re-imprisoned; about 200 terrorists who were sentenced to life imprisonment; as well as about 1,000 other prisoners - including all the children, women and sick people held in Israeli prisons. In an interview with the Palestinian news agency Ma'an, Fares claimed that estimates indicate that the actual number of Palestinian prisoners to be released will be much higher, more than 3,000. Israel insisted on including additional Israeli hostages on the list, including wounded soldiers. However, Israel would have to release more terrorists serving life sentences for hostages who do not meet the 'humanitarian' category. On Saturday, a senior political source told Ynet ahead of the senior delegation's departure for Qatar that the discussions are about the release of 33 hostages, according to the list of 34 that was revealed last week - which no longer includes Youssef Ziyadne, whose body and the body of his son were recovered from a tunnel in Gaza. 'We are discussing a list of 33 hostages, all of whom need to return both alive and dead. This is the first stage of the deal,' he said. According to him, 'The negotiations are about everyone, the living and the dead, and deal with the transition from one stage to the next and how we discuss the second stage, with the understanding that 98 hostages need to be brought home. Today, too, there was a discussion on the key points because this is one of the components of the deal.' While Israel claims that discussions are ongoing on the issue of prisoners to be released, Fares noted that all terrorists who are to be released, except for those sentenced to life, are supposed to return to their homes, whether in Israeli territory, Gaza or the West Bank. The terrorists serving life sentences will probably be deported to Qatar, Egypt or Turkey. On Saturday, in a conference call with the envoys of outgoing President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to send a senior delegation to Qatar. The delegation will include Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon and the prime minister's political advisor Ofir Falk. In the meantime, cabinet members are almost completely excluded from the talks on the deal. On Sunday, after U.S. President-elect Trump conveyed a message through his envoy to the Middle East that he wants to see a deal formed by January 20, the date of his inauguration, Minister of National Missions Orit Strook said in an interview: 'Trump does not want a terrible deal like the one that is on the table to be under his name. Many soldiers will pay with their lives and what we see now is nothing, all the effort to clean up the Gaza Strip will go to waste. Such a deal is a clear victory and a reward for terrorism.' Yehuda Cohen, the father of kidnapped soldier Nimrod Cohen, said that 'Strook's words are shameful, atrocious words. Instead of speaking on behalf of Trump as if he were your friend in the Religious Zionist Party, and instead of continuing to rant about continuing a futile fight at the expense of the lives of IDF soldiers and the suffering of the hostages, including my son, let the minister with the unnecessary office take stock of all the horrific events that have occurred since October 7, 2023 and resign and stand trial'. Sharon Sharabi, brother of hostages Eli Sharabi and the late Yossi Sharabi, told Ynet on Sunday that 'these upheavals that we have been experiencing for 15 months cannot be explained in words. What is happening in Doha right now is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to return the hostages, both alive and dead. It is time to make courageous decisions to return as many of our people as possible from there. If we wait a little longer, we will have no one to bring back.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to him, the families of the hostages are meeting with parties involved in the negotiations. 'Everything that is happening right now, and this uncertainty, does not foreshadow the return of the hostages home. Both Israel and Hamas have learned from each other.' 'Both sides understood that a prolonged cease-fire is crucial, but this deal will also return the values of the State of Israel and the hostages home. I have had enough disappointments. Ultimately, after 15 months, this is a colossal failure. We should have paid the price long ago. Perhaps the geopolitical changes are affecting Hamas,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjl11pmwpyg	2025-01-12T03:18:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/rkNTNl11DJg/rkNTNl11DJg_0_0_660_372_0_small.jpg

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called on allies on Sunday to honor all promises to supply Ukraine with weapons, including those to counter Russian air attacks. Zelensky said that over the past week Russian forces had launched hundreds of strikes on Ukraine and nearly 700 aerial bombs and over 600 attack drones were used. Ukrainian air defenses downed 60 out of 94 drones launched by Russia overnight, the air force said on Sunday. It said that 34 drones were 'lost,' in reference to Ukraine's use of electronic warfare to redirect Russian drones. 'Every week, the Russian war continues only because the Russian army retains its ability to terrorize Ukraine and exploit its superiority in the sky,' Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app. He called on Ukraine's allies to fulfil agreements already made.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy6ha7zpjg	2025-01-12T02:58:15-08:00	
This young visionary is educating woman and children in tribal Pa...	Educator Najeeb Ullah provides access to knowledge and skills in Pakistan’s tribal areas along the Afghanistan border devastated by conflict and terrorism after being inspired by his own struggle Over the past decade, Pakistan’s tribal areas along the Afghanistan border have endured the scars of conflict and terrorism. These regions, once besieged by relentless violence, became a focal point of Pakistan’s military campaign against armed groups, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The crackdown on militant strongholds escalated hostilities, forcing millions to flee their homes in one of Asia’s largest internal displacements. Entire communities were uprooted, and educational institutions were reduced to rubble, leaving a generation grappling with despair and lost opportunities. Amid this backdrop of destruction and fear, a young visionary from Mohmand District, Najeeb Ullah, chose a different path – one of hope and resilience. In 2014, at just 17 years old, he launched the region’s first-ever Mashaal library to restore access to education in his conflict-ridden homeland. The word 'mashaal,' meaning 'torch' in Pashto, symbolizes illumination in the darkest times – a fitting metaphor for Najeeb’s mission. A bold beginning Najeeb, who pursued a master’s degree in conflict and peace studies from the National Defense University in Islamabad, was inspired by his own struggles. 'In 2014, while traveling to Peshawar to purchase books for my grade 12 exams, I realized how inaccessible education had become for students in war-torn areas,' he recalled. That moment of clarity drove him to collect books and establish a library, enabling economically disadvantaged students to continue their studies. Despite limited resources, Najeeb’s determination prevailed. What began as a small library has since evolved into a community cornerstone. By 2021, he expanded his efforts to establish the region’s first children’s library. In January 2024, he launched the Mashaal Skills Center for Women, a modest operation housed in the veranda of his mud home, around 14 miles northwest of Peshawar. This center equips women with skills like sewing and crafts, empowering them to overcome cultural and economic barriers. Libraries that inspire Today, Najeeb’s two libraries serve as vital hubs of learning. Thousands of books now line their walls, offering students the chance to pursue education despite the absence of functioning schools. In 2015, he introduced an innovative mobile book delivery service using two motorcycles, ensuring that even students in remote areas could access reading materials. 'Countless women benefit from this service,' Najeeb shared, emphasizing the importance of reaching those most affected by conflict. Najeeb’s long-term vision is ambitious: to create what he hopes will be 'the world’s largest library of its kind' and establish a university for women that offers free education. Reflecting on his journey, he said, 'The library is a beacon of hope and knowledge for the youth in my area, guiding them away from fear and toward mental development.' Empowering women through teaching skills The Mashaal Skills Center has already transformed the lives of over 100 women and girls, including widows and orphans, in just one year. 'The trainees are now sewing clothes, designing unique garments, and even crafting purses from woolen threads. This has unlocked new opportunities for economic independence,' Najeeb explained. He envisions the center as a catalyst for change, providing women with tools to break cycles of poverty and ignorance. 'By equipping women with essential skills, we are creating a ripple effect of progress and dignity,' he said. Voices of change The impact of Najeeb’s initiatives resonates deeply within the community. Shafi Ullah, a postgraduate scholar from Mohmand, credited the Mashaal Library with enabling him to complete his education after years of disruption. 'Hundreds of young people, including myself, have relied on this library to continue learning in the absence of schools,' he said. Arshad Khan, a tribal leader from Mohmand, highlighted the broader need for such centers across Pakistan’s tribal belt. 'Libraries and study centers are essential for rebuilding the social and educational fabric destroyed by years of conflict. They provide children with constructive activities, steering them away from terrorism,' he said. The skills center has similarly empowered women. Sana Gul, a schoolteacher from Mohmand, shared how the Mashaal Mobile Library helped her complete her education without defying tribal customs. 'I went on to secure a government job and now dedicate myself to teaching girls with the same passion that once paved the way for my own education,' she said. A call for support Experts agree that grassroots efforts like Najeeb’s are vital for the region’s recovery. Rehmat Mehsud, an Islamabad-based analyst on tribal affairs, noted: 'Mashaal projects have tangibly impacted underserved communities by offering education and skill development. These initiatives fill critical gaps in areas where government support is lacking.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Mehsud called for greater federal and provincial backing for youth-led initiatives, emphasizing their potential to foster resilience and stability in conflict-affected regions. 'By recognizing and funding such efforts, the government can inspire others to contribute, promoting sustainable development and social harmony,' he said.

This young visionary is educating woman and children in tribal Pa...	Educator Najeeb Ullah provides access to knowledge and skills in Pakistan’s tribal areas along the Afghanistan border devastated by conflict and terrorism after being inspired by his own struggle Over the past decade, Pakistan’s tribal areas along the Afghanistan border have endured the scars of conflict and terrorism. These regions, once besieged by relentless violence, became a focal point of Pakistan’s military campaign against armed groups, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The crackdown on militant strongholds escalated hostilities, forcing millions to flee their homes in one of Asia’s largest internal displacements. Entire communities were uprooted, and educational institutions were reduced to rubble, leaving a generation grappling with despair and lost opportunities. Amid this backdrop of destruction and fear, a young visionary from Mohmand District, Najeeb Ullah, chose a different path – one of hope and resilience. In 2014, at just 17 years old, he launched the region’s first-ever Mashaal library to restore access to education in his conflict-ridden homeland. The word 'mashaal,' meaning 'torch' in Pashto, symbolizes illumination in the darkest times – a fitting metaphor for Najeeb’s mission. A bold beginning Najeeb, who pursued a master’s degree in conflict and peace studies from the National Defense University in Islamabad, was inspired by his own struggles. 'In 2014, while traveling to Peshawar to purchase books for my grade 12 exams, I realized how inaccessible education had become for students in war-torn areas,' he recalled. That moment of clarity drove him to collect books and establish a library, enabling economically disadvantaged students to continue their studies. Despite limited resources, Najeeb’s determination prevailed. What began as a small library has since evolved into a community cornerstone. By 2021, he expanded his efforts to establish the region’s first children’s library. In January 2024, he launched the Mashaal Skills Center for Women, a modest operation housed in the veranda of his mud home, around 14 miles northwest of Peshawar. This center equips women with skills like sewing and crafts, empowering them to overcome cultural and economic barriers. Libraries that inspire Today, Najeeb’s two libraries serve as vital hubs of learning. Thousands of books now line their walls, offering students the chance to pursue education despite the absence of functioning schools. In 2015, he introduced an innovative mobile book delivery service using two motorcycles, ensuring that even students in remote areas could access reading materials. 'Countless women benefit from this service,' Najeeb shared, emphasizing the importance of reaching those most affected by conflict. Najeeb’s long-term vision is ambitious: to create what he hopes will be 'the world’s largest library of its kind' and establish a university for women that offers free education. Reflecting on his journey, he said, 'The library is a beacon of hope and knowledge for the youth in my area, guiding them away from fear and toward mental development.' Empowering women through teaching skills The Mashaal Skills Center has already transformed the lives of over 100 women and girls, including widows and orphans, in just one year. 'The trainees are now sewing clothes, designing unique garments, and even crafting purses from woolen threads. This has unlocked new opportunities for economic independence,' Najeeb explained. He envisions the center as a catalyst for change, providing women with tools to break cycles of poverty and ignorance. 'By equipping women with essential skills, we are creating a ripple effect of progress and dignity,' he said. Voices of change The impact of Najeeb’s initiatives resonates deeply within the community. Shafi Ullah, a postgraduate scholar from Mohmand, credited the Mashaal Library with enabling him to complete his education after years of disruption. 'Hundreds of young people, including myself, have relied on this library to continue learning in the absence of schools,' he said. Arshad Khan, a tribal leader from Mohmand, highlighted the broader need for such centers across Pakistan’s tribal belt. 'Libraries and study centers are essential for rebuilding the social and educational fabric destroyed by years of conflict. They provide children with constructive activities, steering them away from terrorism,' he said. The skills center has similarly empowered women. Sana Gul, a schoolteacher from Mohmand, shared how the Mashaal Mobile Library helped her complete her education without defying tribal customs. 'I went on to secure a government job and now dedicate myself to teaching girls with the same passion that once paved the way for my own education,' she said. A call for support Experts agree that grassroots efforts like Najeeb’s are vital for the region’s recovery. Rehmat Mehsud, an Islamabad-based analyst on tribal affairs, noted: 'Mashaal projects have tangibly impacted underserved communities by offering education and skill development. These initiatives fill critical gaps in areas where government support is lacking.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Mehsud called for greater federal and provincial backing for youth-led initiatives, emphasizing their potential to foster resilience and stability in conflict-affected regions. 'By recognizing and funding such efforts, the government can inspire others to contribute, promoting sustainable development and social harmony,' he said. A legacy of hope Najeeb Ullah’s journey is a testament to the transformative power of education and determination. Despite the challenges posed by terrorism, poverty and deeply rooted cultural barriers, his efforts have ignited hope in a region long overshadowed by despair. Through libraries and skill centers, Najeeb is not only rebuilding lives but also shaping a brighter future for Pakistan’s tribal areas – one book and one skill at a time.

The rate of HMPV infections in northern China is declining, Chine...	The rate of infections with the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in northern China is declining, a health official said Sunday, amid some international concern over a potential pandemic. HMPV, which belongs to the same family as the respiratory syncytial virus, causes flu or cold-like symptoms including fever, cough and nasal congestion. 'The human metapneumovirus is not a new virus, and has been with humans for at least several decades,' said Wang Liping, a researcher at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, during a press briefing by China's National Health Commission. 'At present, the rate of positive cases in human metapneumovirus detection is fluctuating, and the rate of positive cases in northern provinces is declining, and the rate of positive cases among patients aged 14 and below has started to decline,' she said. Concerns surfaced in recent days over a surge in HMPV infections in northern China after images circulated online of hospitals overrun with masked patients. The World Health Organization said it has not received reports of unusual outbreaks in China or elsewhere.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjrujmzvkx	2025-01-12T01:57:46-08:00

Pro-Palestinian online campaign claims Hamas rapes did not happen	Prosecutor purposely misquoted in propaganda effort says Hamas terrorists and Gazans who invaded Israel on Oct. 7 raped young women and murdered them, sometimes the during the act; says any distortion of this fact is a lie Palestinian propagandists distorted the words of an Israeli prosecutor, who was until recently a member of the team prosecuting Hamas sexual crimes on October 7, to claim there had been no rapes during the massacre. Moran Gez said in an interview with Ynet's sister publication Yedioth Ahronoth that it was hard to prosecute the rapes and sexual assault committed by the terrorists because many of the victims of the atrocities did not survive and therefore could not come forward. 'Unfortunately, we have no victims. They were either murdered or some of those who were raped chose not to come forward to share what had happened,' she said. She said women's groups also had few recorded testimonies although they were approached by parents asking what they can do when their daughter was a victim of those crimes. Although there is evidence of rapes and sexual assaults, the difficulty in trial is attributing the atrocity to a particular perpetrator. 'I would lower expectations,' Gez said. 'I know there is a desire in the public and I understand the need when dealing with such heinous crimes, but most of the cases may not meet the standards of the courts for convictions. Soon after the interview was published, posts appeared on social media claiming the accusations of rape were a 'mistake,' or a 'joke.' A journalist who has hundreds of thousands of followers led a campaign of denial of the rape accusations, using the interview and the fact that no charges were filed, as 'evidence' that no such crimes were committed. Gez said she was astounded at the post. 'Hamas terrorists raped young Israelis and murdered them, even while the rape was still going on,' she said. 'Amid such trauma, women who were raped by the terrorists and residents of Gaza who followed them across the border, could not muster the courage to report the ordeal. Any other interpretation of my words is nothing more that cheap propaganda that ignores the fact that Hamas terrorists committed war crimes. The only appropriate punishment for them, in my view, is death.'

IDF intensifies West Bank operations despite decreasing number of...	The hunt for the terrorists from the attack in the village of Al-Funduq continues throughout the weekend; Despite decrease in number of attacks, the IDF intends to increase its activity its intensity After the deadly attack last week, in which three people were murdered, the situation assessment in the West Bank has not changed but is definitely at an important milestone. The IDF Central Command is continuing the hunt for the terrorists who carried out the attack, with the understanding being that they came from the northern West Bank. On Friday, the IDF operated with special units in the heart of the Kabatiya camp. Eight wanted individuals were arrested, and the homes of the three terrorists who carried out the attack in the Al-Funduq were mapped. The terrorists' time is limited, and the circle around them is tightening. At the same time, and despite the decrease in the number of attacks, the Central Command agrees that the scope of operations must be increased even further, with an emphasis on the northern area of the West Bank. The Head of Central Command, Major General Avi Bluth, is allowing brigades to operate relatively freely in the West Bank with offensive operations. Security sources explained that a certain change had occurred following the IDF attacks in the Jordan Valley area. The IDF has attacked the area with special forces and the Air Force in operations that lasted for days. The security establishment notes the change that has occurred in the region, similar to the Nablus area, which also underwent a change after the counter-terrorism operation. However, at the same time, the same sources explain that the work is far from over and there are still terrorist infrastructures that are being attempted to be established in those areas. In the days following the terror attack, questions were raised about the security coordination that the IDF maintains with the Palestinian Authority's security mechanisms. Although the PA security personnel operate in the West Bank, some voices in the government call for the dissolution of the PA. Despite the 'lone wolf' terrorism Israel experiences by Palestinian civilians who occasionally take a knife or an axe and set out to carry out a terror attack, the security establishment notes that the Palestinian people have not joined the war through an intifada similar to previous operations. The Palestinian restraint must be taken into account despite calls to wipe out Jenin as was heard by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Despite the general decrease in numbers of cases, daily terrorism actions such as throwing Molotov cocktails still takes place in the West Bank. And yet, the West Bank is a deceptive region. Bluth, who also visited the families of Master Sgt. Elad Yaakov Winkelstein, Rachel Cohen and Aliza Reiss over the weekend, who were murdered in the horrific attack, agrees that offensive activity should be increased in the coming weeks. Security sources explain that the IDF should not act based on intelligence and in a targeted manner, but rather seize an area like the Nur a-Shams refugee camp or the Jenin camp, surround it, conduct house-to-house searches and confiscate weapons. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Several months ago, the Central Command carried out such activities, which began with a massive counter-terrorism operation in Jenin. Although the forces relied on intelligence, the IDF raided locations without indications and found weapon caches in civilian areas. In the coming months, the Central Command must increase its activity in the heart of the refugee camps, make use of diverse attack patterns, and increase the pressure on the terrorist battalions in the northern West Bank. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry6nhgzpke	2025-01-12T01:28:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/11/yk14219449/yk14219449_1_33_965_544_0_small.jpg

A truck driver reported that his vehicle was stolen in Tiberias and, after a manhunt, the 23-year old suspect was located in a cave on the side of a mountain and completely naked, after hiding his clothes under leaves A 23-year-old man from Lod was arrested last week on suspicion of stealing a truck in Tiberias. During his escape attempt, he hit other vehicles and injured other passengers. After searches, which began following a report by a truck driver who claimed that his vehicle was stolen while he was unloading goods, the Northern District police were shocked to find the suspect inside a cave, on a mountainside, completely naked. His detention has been extended until Monday. Watch the footage of his arrest: The incident occurred on January 8, when the police received a report from a truck driver who had come to unload goods claiming that his vehicle had been stolen after he had left it parked outside. Shortly after, civilians reported traffic accidents involving a truck that had driven onto a sidewalk, hit vehicles and caused minor injuries to several people. The truck was found abandoned in an open area and the suspect disappeared from the scene. Police began searching the mountainside near where the truck was found. About an hour after the searches began, while the police were searching inside a cave, they identified a suspicious man, completely naked, who refused to identify himself, pretending to be an Arab and claiming that he did not speak Hebrew.

ISIS plot to bomb Shiite shrine in Damascus thwarted	Operation led to four arrests and the seizure of weapons, ammunition, grenades, communication devices and cash [Idlib] - Syria’s Ministry of Interior confirmed on Saturday that it had thwarted an Islamic State (ISIS) bombing plot targeting the Sayyida Zainab shrine on the outskirts of Damascus, a revered site for Shi’ite Muslims. A security official from the Ministry of Interior told The Media Line that the operation led to four arrests and the seizure of weapons, ammunition, grenades, communication devices, and cash. According to the intelligence source, who requested anonymity, the General Intelligence Directorate’s specialized counter-ISIS division, working alongside the Public Security Directorate in rural Damascus, arrested four individuals implicated in the plot before they could detonate the explosives. He added that 'security forces are conducting regular sweep operations across several Syrian provinces to track remnants of the ousted regime, fugitives involved in various crimes, and ISIS militants.' The Ministry of Interior reiterated its stance against terrorism, affirming that it will not tolerate any terrorist activities within Syria. It vowed to act decisively against any group attempting to exploit instability in certain areas of the country to carry out attacks, with particular focus on combating ISIS.

Guerilla warfare and IEDs exact a price in Gaza's Beit Hanoun	Latest fallen soldiers killed in a powerful explosion on a logistical road cleared and secured by IDF forces; Terrorists likely used an undiscovered tunnel nearby; Beit Hanoun offensive aims to allow safe train travel to Sderot As of Sunday morning, 11 IDF soldiers were killed in the Beit Hanoun area of central Gaza in the past two weeks. The Hamas battalion there, considered the weakest in the terrorist army, has, since the military began its latest offensive there, reverted to guerilla warfare. On Saturday, Sergeant Major (res.) Alexander Fedorenko, Staff Sergeant Danila Diakov, Sergeant Yahav Maayan and Sergeant Eliav Astuker were killed when a remote explosive device was detonated. Initial investigation revealed that the terrorists took advantage of the bad weather on Tuesday night to place the powerful device on the side of the road that has been used as a logistical route since the start of the operation, after it was cleared from enemies and while tight security measures were in place there. The road has been in use by the forces, but no one saw the terrorists approach it. There may be an underground tunnel that had not been discovered nearby, where explosives could be placed and remotely detonated. In the explosion, five other soldiers were hurt, two of them seriously. In a suspected friendly fire incident that ensued, a mass casualty event was announced. Unlike neighboring Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun does not have a significant city center to conquer. The local population was evacuated leaving only the remaining terrorists, so the IDF's mission is mostly to destroy structures, and not only those that are near the border with Israel. The mission is to allow the resumption of train travel to Sderot safe from anti-tank missile fire, and to protect Kibbutz Erez from attack. The troops found more than 30 explosive devices in Beit Hanoun in the past two weeks, but those who have not been identified, have caused heavy casualties. In another explosion last week, three IDF soldiers were killed and the military was investigating whether the Hamas terrorists used explosives from IDF bombs, to make their device. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The terrorists in Beit Hanoun use destroyed buildings in the city to their advantage, as the troops consider them cleared from enemy forces.

Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office confirms wildfire de...	Teams conducting systematic grid searches with cadaver dogs looking for bodies of victims; tens of thousands of people remained under evacuation orders, more than 12,000 homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles burned The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office confirmed the death toll from the wildfires ravaging the area has risen to 16 and the cases remain under investigation. Five of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire, and 11 resulted from the Eaton Fire, the coroner’s office said in a statement Saturday evening. The previous number of confirmed fatalities was 11, but officials said they expected that figure to rise as cadaver dogs search leveled neighborhoods and crews assess the devastation. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing. Firefighters raced to cut off spreading wildfires before potentially strong winds return that could push the flames toward the world famous J. Paul Getty Museum and the University of California, Los Angeles, while new evacuation warnings left more homeowners on edge. A fierce battle against the flames was underway in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities not far from the Pacific coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill. Firefighters on the ground used hoses in an attempt to beat back leaping flames as thick smoke blanketed the chaparral-covered hillside. At a briefing, CalFire Operations Chief Christian Litz said a main focus Saturday would be the Palisades Fire burning in the canyon area, not far from the UCLA campus. 'We need to be aggressive out there,' Litz said. County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath said the LA area 'had another night of unimaginable terror and heartbreak, and even more Angelenos evacuated due to the northeast expansion of the Palisades Fire.' Light breezes were fanning the flames, but the National Weather Service warned that strong Santa Ana winds — the nemesis of firefighters — could soon return. Those winds have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around to city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months. The fire also was threatening to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley. The hunt for bodies continues The grim work of sifting through the devastation continued Saturday, with teams conducting systematic grid searches with cadaver dogs, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna. He said a family assistance center was being established in Pasadena, and he urged residents to abide by curfews. 'We have people driving up and around trying to get in just to look. Stay away,' he said. The fires have consumed about 56 square miles (145 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. Tens of thousands of people remained under evacuation orders and new evacuations were ordered Friday evening after a flare up on the eastern side of the Palisades Fire. Since the fires first began Tuesday just north of downtown LA, they have burned more than 12,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles. No cause has been determined for the largest fires, and early estimates indicate the wildfires could be the nation’s costliest ever. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. Rays of kindness amid the devastation So many volunteers showed up to help at donation centers Saturday that some were being turned away. That was the case at a YMCA in the Koreatown neighborhood. By late morning, cars with would-be helpers were also being turned back from the Santa Anita Park horse racing track, where donations of necessities were being accepted. At the race track Friday, people who lost their homes could be seen sifting through stacks of donated shirts, blankets and other household goods. Altadena resident Jose Luis Godinez said three homes occupied by more than a dozen of his family members were destroyed. 'Everything is gone,' he said, speaking in Spanish. 'All my family lived in those three houses and now we have nothing.' Officials warn against returning to burned homes Some residents have been venturing back to see what can be salvaged after wildfires destroyed their homes, sifting through rubble for keepsakes. But officials on Saturday urged them to stay away, warning that the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials. 'If you’re kicking that stuff up, you’re breathing it in,' said Chris Thomas, a spokesman for the unified incident command at the Palisades Fire. 'All of that stuff is toxic.' Residents will be allowed to return, with protective gear, after damage teams have evaluated their properties, Thomas said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water. 'When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to be water,' she said. Progress made on fighting the Eaton fire Firefighters for the first time made progress Friday afternoon on the Eaton Fire north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 7,000 structures. Officials said most evacuation orders for the area had been lifted. LA Mayor Karen Bass, who faces a critical test of her leadership as her city endures its greatest crisis in decades, said several smaller fires also were stopped. The level of devastation is jarring even in a state that regularly confronts massive wildfires. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry118jgxvke	2025-01-11T20:49:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/12/SkeAI7RgDyg/SkeAI7RgDyg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

U.S. officials signal hope to secure hostage deal in Qatar	Netanyahu approves senior Israeli delegation to leave for Doha talks with Hamas after discussion with American envoys; Israel's Security Cabinet members excluded from negotiations Officials in U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration on Saturday expressed slightly less skepticism about the ongoing negotiations for a hostage deal with Hamas compared to their previous remarks in recent days. They noted progress in the talks, attributing the shift to the arrival of Biden’s Middle East envoy, Brett McGurk, in Qatar. The current goal is to finalize a deal before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Trump’s incoming Mid-east envoy Steve Witkoff, who made an unexpected visit to Israel after staying in Doha, conveyed the same message regarding the expected timeline for the hostage deal. The aligned statements from both the Biden and Trump administrations clarify to Hamas that there is no difference in the American position. Last week, members of Biden's team had expressed skepticism about the possibility of reaching a deal soon. This, however, appears to have changed, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Mossad Director David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, Maj. Gen. (res) Nitzan Alon and Diplomatic Adviser Ophir Falk to travel to Doha 'to advance negotiations for the release of the hostages.' The decision, following multiple delays of the Israeli delegation’s departure to Qatar, was made during a conference call between Netanyahu, Witkoff and McGurk. After a brief stay in Israel and a meeting with Netanyahu, Witkoff returned to Doha, where the senior Israeli delegation is also expected to arrive. 'This time, there’s optimism and it feels closer than ever,' a senior Israeli official said, but added, 'We’ve been at this point in the past.' Meanwhile, members of the Security Cabinet have reported being entirely excluded from the negotiations for the hostage deal.

Iran holding war games as it faces Israel tensions, Trump's retur...	Drills are part of two-months-long exercises in which the elite Revolutionary Guards defended key nuclear installations in the country Iran was holding air defense exercises on Saturday, state media reported, as the country braces for more friction with arch-enemy Israel and the United States under incoming U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. The war games take place as Iranian leaders face the risk that Trump could empower Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's nuclear sites, while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its oil industry through his 'maximum pressure' policy. 'In these exercises... defense systems will practice the fight against air, missile and electronic warfare threats in real battlefield conditions... to protect the country's skies and sensitive and vital areas,' Iranian state television said. Saturday's drills are part of two-months-long exercises launched on January 4 which have already included war games in which the elite Revolutionary Guards defended key nuclear installations in Natanz against mock attacks by missiles and drones, state media said. Iran's military has said it was using new drones and missiles in the exercises and released footage of a new underground 'missile city' being visited by Guards Commander-in-Chief Major General Hossein Salami. Iran has recently suffered setbacks in Lebanon after Israeli attacks against Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the toppling of Tehran's ally President Bashar Assad in Syria last month. But Salami warned, in a speech carried by state TV about a 'false sense of delight' among Iran's enemies, saying Iran and particularly its missile forces were stronger than ever. While Iranian officials have downplayed Iran's setbacks, an Iranian general, Behrouz Esbati, who was reportedly based in Syria, said in a speech circulated on social media that Iran had 'badly lost' in Syria.

IDF names four soldiers killed in Gaza blast	Sergeant Major (res.) Alexander Fedorenko, Staff Sergeant Danila Diakov, Sergeant Yahav Maayan and Sergeant Eliav Astuker were killed after a remote explosive detonated in Beit Hanoun; five additional soldiers injured, two in serious condition The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Saturday that four soldiers were killed in battle in Gaza’s Beit Hanoun after an explosive device detonated near their vehicle. They are: Sergeant Major (res.) Alexander Fedorenko, 37, from Bat Yam, a Heavy Truck Driver in the 79th Battalion, 14th 'Machatz' Brigade; Staff Sergeant Danila Diakov, 21, from Ma'ale Adumim, a soldier in the 931st Battalion, Nahal Brigade; Sergeant Yahav Maayan, 19, from Modi'in, a soldier in the 931st Battalion, Nahal Brigade and Sergeant Eliav Astuker, aged 19, from Ashdod, a soldier in the 931st Battalion, Nahal Brigade. The troops were killed by the detonation of a powerful explosive device targeting a command vehicle. The unit was traveling along an administrative route in Beit Hanoun, where the brigade has been operating in recent weeks. Five additional soldiers were injured in the incident, including two in serious condition. The route was supposed to be under full operational control, having been cleared at the start of the operation in the city, located west of Sderot. The unit traveled along the route in an unarmored Humvee, accompanied by other light vehicles in the convoy, including one carrying the deputy commander of the Nahal Brigade who was unharmed and led evacuation efforts. During the incident, terrorists opened fire at the unit in the field, though it’s possible the fire was a result of friendly fire. The scene was declared a mass-casualty event.

Terrorists use West Bank mosques to attack soldiers, IDF reports	Troops operating in Jabaliya and Tulkarm encounter terrorists exploiting mosques for cover, weapons storage and mounting attacks against forces The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Saturday that forces operating within the West Bank’s Jabaliya and Tulkarm encountered terrorists making use of several mosques and other civilian buildings in the area to mount attacks against troops, risking civilian lives in the process. 'Terrorist activity in Judea and Samaria persistently takes place within civilian infrastructures, including mosques, hospitals, medical centers and educational institutions,' the IDF said in a statement. According to the military, three main mosques were identified as being used by terrorists in Jabaliya and Tulkarm: Jabriyat Mosque and Khalid Ibn al-Walid Mosque in Jenin, and the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Mosque in Tulkarm. 'During counterterrorism activity conducted in the area of Jenin on 19.11.2024, terrorists opened fire at IDF soldiers from inside and near the Jabriyat Mosque, using it for cover,' the IDF reported. 'The following morning, soldiers returned to the mosque to search it and found a shooting range on the lower floor of the mosque, a training area and shooting positions overlooking the forces and the area adjacent to the mosque. Dozens of bullet shells were located next to every window, left from the gunfire carried out the night before.' 'During the same operational activity, an IAF aircraft identified a large number of armed terrorists firing at IDF soldiers using the Khalid Ibn al-Walid Mosque as cover.' The military added that during operations in Tulkarm, 'an IAF aircraft identified terrorists throwing explosive devices at IDF soldiers from the roof of the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Mosque.'

Netanyahu approves Israeli delegation to leave for Qatar to advan...	Mossad and Shin Bet chiefs will lead delegation alongside military officials; decision comes following prime minister's meetings with U.S. officials Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a situational assessment meeting on Saturday regarding Israeli hostages held by Hamas and instructed Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon and Diplomatic Advisor Ophir Falk to travel to Doha 'to continue advancing a deal for the release of the hostages.' The announcement was issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, which also noted that the meeting included Defense Minister Israel Katz, senior defense officials and representatives of the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations. Meanwhile, according to sources familiar with the details, 'approximately 90% of the terms for the hostage deal have already been agreed on,' following days of discussions in Qatar. The main point of contention in the talks reportedly revolves around the transition from Phase A (the 'humanitarian' phase) to Phase B of the deal. Hamas, for its part, has refused to provide lists of hostages and has expressed skepticism about the fulfillment of U.S. promises under the incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Trump, however, has declared that if the hostages are not released by his inauguration on January 20, 'all hell will break out.'

Israel's difficult year in Hollywood	Israeli actors suffer from pro-Palestinian attacks, festivals were either canceled or kept low-profile and Israeli series premieres of Israeli series that were either postponed or kept under the radar Meir Fenigstein, founder and director of the Israel Film Festival in Los Angeles for more than 30 years, was hoping to fill the cinema halls again after the COVID pandemic and its consequences. But then October 7 happened, and it was clear that the festival had to be postponed. 'I thought the war would last two months, tops', said Fenigstein shortly before the opening. 'I postponed it to December, then to March, and when I realized that the war was not going to be over soon, I postponed it to November.' After quite a bit of work, and under a lot of pressure, the Israeli Film Festival in Los Angeles opened with a special screening of Israel's official submission for the Best International Feature Film at the 97th Academy Awards, 'Come Closer' by Tom Nesher. But despite a smooth opening ceremony, the theaters were less keen to cooperate with Israeli work. 'A certain theatre agreed to screen the films, as long as there was no advertisement for the festival outside the hall. Not even one. I could advertise a specific film, but people wouldn't know that it was part of the Israel Film Festival. Even in the lobby of the theater, it was impossible to place anything to suggest that a festival took place inside. 'The owner of the venue told me, 'I want to have the least attention. Inside the theater, you can do whatever you want, but outside - nothing.' They're afraid that frequent visitors to this theater will say, 'Since you're having an Israel film festival, we won't come here anymore. You are traitors.' More difficult and unpleasant Like any other part of our lives, Israeli culture was treated in different ways since October 7. At first, it was surrounded by a sense of mourning and shock. A few months later, when it began to recover a little and tried to break out, it encountered a cultural world that was in part devoid of empathy, partly hostile, and in part refrained from any involvement in what was happening in the Middle East. As a result, it was one of the most difficult years ever for Israeli culture abroad. This holds true for Israeli art and literature, as well as for Israel's most popular cultural export industry – cinema and television, in Hollywood. Hollywood does not boycott Israeli cultural creation, nor has it become antisemitic all of a sudden, as it has a problematic history of antisemitism long before October 7. It can't be claimed that Israeli actors will no longer work in Hollywood. But this year everything has been more difficult, unpleasant, and sometimes heartbreaking. In the first days that followed October 7, the American show-business, Jews and non-Jews alike, stood 100% with Israel. Bono's documentary, dedicating a song in his Las Vegas concert for Israel's 'beautiful kids' massacred at the Nova music festival, was perhaps the best cultural 'Hasbara' moment for Israel in recent years. Later, the support trend shifted. But there is a difference between the attitude prevalent in the world toward Israeli arts and that of the U.S. in general, and certainly Hollywood in particular. Pro-Palestinians will assert that the U.S. film industry still takes Israel's side, and by and large, they are not wrong. The fierce reactions to the Oscar acceptance speech that director Jonathan Glazer made, where he attacked Israel, claiming that 'the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation,' clearly showed that anti-Israel sentiment is rejected by most in Hollywood. 'What happened this year is that the boundaries between Jews and Israelis were blurred after October 7,' says an Israeli actor who works in Hollywood. 'It affected the entire Jewish community in the U.S., which realized that this massacre was against Jews, not just against Israelis, and many Jews in Hollywood were appalled by it. That's why I think that our situation in the industry is safer than what people might think. On the other hand, a younger generation is growing up here, which is much more diverse, racially and ethnically, and the images that have been coming in from Gaza all year were very difficult. They are soon to be the decision-makers here, and I think that when that time comes, it will be more challenging for us here.' The signs of this hardship could be noticed already in the reactions made by certain Hollywood creators not long after October 7. The Writers Guild of America (WGA), for example, maintained complete silence after the horrific October 7 massacre occurred in Gaza border communities; it was a deafening silence, especially in light of the fact that many of its members are Jewish. Dozens of them, however, published a very sharp letter of protest against the union, signed by Jerry Seinfeld, Sacha Baron Cohen, Eric Roth, Matthew Weiner and James Patterson, among others. In terms of the top decision-makers, from studio owners to producers and super-agents, Hollywood is still full of Jews who support Israel. 'I have not faced any problems this year,' says a Jewish executive in the industry. 'On the contrary, I have only received messages of support.' Those who experienced hardship were Israeli creators and actors, because they were judged by their country of origin – and sometimes just by their Jewishness – and paid a price for the pride they took in their origin. Gal Gadot illustrated a fairly accurate picture of the situation in an online conversation with Israel's President Isaac Herzog held at an event to officially launch the 'Kol Ha’am' - Voice of the People - initiative, aiming to promote global Jewish unity. '15 years ago, when I started off, being an Israeli here was something that people were impressed and excited about,' Gadot said. 'I’m not saying that this is not the case today, but now it’s charged, things have changed. I often find myself in awkward situations, having to maintain complex and unpleasant conversations.' Gadot has been experiencing it personally on social media since her breakout role as 'Wonder Woman', but she’s already a big enough star to survive this period without much damage. It’s been much harder for other Israeli actors, though. 'I was at an audition where one of the examiners said straight to my face, ‘The images of what Hamas did on October 7 are haunting me, but I can’t justify anything you do to the Palestinians under the leadership of this prime minister,’' says an Israeli actor. 'I didn’t answer him. It’s better not to say anything now, and rather keep your head down, hoping this wave passes.' The one who’s receiving substantial backlash these days is Israeli actress Noa Cohen, who plays the titular character in Netflix’s film 'Mary'. Pro-Palestinian activists are sharply criticizing director DJ Caruso for choosing a Jewish Israeli actress to play the role of the mother of Jesus, who was herself a Jewish woman living in Israel. 'Not only did the cast lack Arab or a Palestinian representation, but the one playing the role of Mary is Israeli,' protested an X user. Another user wrote: 'The fact that they are casting an Israeli as Mary is profoundly offensive. They are erasing the Palestinian history.' Also, the casting of Israeli actress Shira Haas as the new Marvel superhero 'Sabra' in the Captain America film sparked outrage among pro-Palestinian organizations, prompting Marvel studios to announce it would 'take a new approach with the character Sabra.' There were also reports online claiming that anti-Israel sentiment, induced by the Gaza war, impacted the design of the new character. Some were concerned about the developments, but the new trailer that was recently released included hefty screentime for the character of Haas, and provided some relief in the industry.

It’s not easy to get accepted to the festival, and when it happens, it provides networking opportunities. For some films, it opens the door to widespread distribution and a chance to win the awards granted in Hollywood, for others it opens the door to more modest venues, and sometimes acceptance into such festival brings mainly a sense of relief. That’s what director Shemi Zarhin felt when he heard that his beautiful and human film 'Bliss' was accepted into the festival held in September. This is the second time that a film by Zarhin has participated in Toronto, the previous time being in 2015 with the film 'The Kind Words'; this time he was a bit surprised, given the harsh year for Israeli works worldwide. 'We are known in Toronto,' says Zarhin. 'In a normal situation, I might have expected to be accepted, but this time we were preparing ourselves for a rejection. Even the announcement of the film's acceptance into the festival was postponed until the very last minute, probably to avoid protests as much as possible.' What was the experience like there? 'There were demonstrations during the screenings, both inside and outside the hall. People shouted that 'the film was funded by a state committing genocide'. This was also happening when three or four Palestinian films were being screened at the festival. There was a lot of security. The atmosphere was different than in our previous visit, but the film was screened calmly and beautifully, and the reactions were good, and we left feeling more relaxed.' 'It's true that it's been difficult to be an Israeli filmmaker this year, and usually the representation of Israeli films at festivals is greater, but there is still some hope', added Zarhin. After the screening of 'Bliss' in Toronto we were invited to festivals around the world; I hope this will break the curse,' Zarhin said, anticipating that 'next year will be better for all of us.' The Scripted Israel Conference, which aims to forge connections between Israeli creators and Hollywood TV industry figures, also provided some hope. This year, the closing event, like the previous time, was held at the at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, and it centered around a special screening of the first episode of 'One Day in October', which deals with October 7 massacre. Like the old festival, the relatively new conference also went through a difficult path, certainly more complex than the first year. 'The first conference, held two years ago, celebrated an Israeli television industry that is considered one of the best in the world, certainly in terms of market size and language. We felt like we were the most popular there,' say Tchelet Semel and Daniel Susz, co-founders of the conference. 'The truth is, even back then the attitude toward Israel of more elite circles, like the art world and film festivals, was very different compared to the television industry – where money talks, and where Israel produced 'hits'. The timing also played in our favor, the streamers flourished and the most watched series were international. And now, two years later, we are in a completely different world – both in terms of the industry, and of course, in terms of the situation in Israel.' What does this mean? 'Two years ago we could approach people asking them to invite their colleagues to the conference, and they would be happy to come. Now we turned to specific people, we didn't even try to approach those we knew would refuse, and we used the connections that Israel already had in Hollywood. It's sad, because we want to bring people from the outside, that's actually our goal, to connect the Israeli industry to the U.S. industry here. Last time the conference took place in a shared workspace, and part of the fun was that people could mingle and get to know each other. This year we had to create sterile spaces and make sure that nothing would make the attendees feel uncomfortable.' Despite the difficulties, the conference hosted 56 companies, but Semel and Susz cannot disclose who showed up. 'Unlike last time, now we can't disclose details about the companies and agencies we met. There is a very big difference between people and brands. People are with us, but brands have a hard time connecting with Israel right now - so things had to be done privately. There were also cancellations, people turned pale and apologized, but they had no other choice, the brand wanted nothing to do with us. 'The industry these days is depressed, fearing to take risks. In such a climate, one can do almost nothing. We held our event feeling panic at first, but later we were encouraged to see that things were moving forward, and deals were made. The big question is whether what happened this year was a coincidence induced by the Gaza war or whether there is really a trend of change in Hollywood, along with the generation change, taking into account that those who will run the industry in the future are less fond of Israel.' Shula Spiegel, who co-produced with Dana Eden the successful TV series 'Tehran' attended the conference and left it optimistic. 'I wouldn't say that Israeli content is popular right now, but it's an industry that works for the long run. 'We're getting offers from Netflix until 2026, so there's no need to be worried. I didn't feel like we were being rejected, but many of the participants were Jewish, so maybe that had a bit of an impact on the atmosphere, which was much better than I anticipated. We received only compliments on what we were doing, and the offers I brought started rolling.' Delay after delay The ones who took a serious blow were the Israeli TV series. The Hebrew-language TV series 'Bros,' created by Israelis Hanan Savyon and Guy Amir was acquired by Netflix, scheduled to launch in October 2023. The release was inevitably postponed, and finally went on the air quietly and without a marketing campaign. More than a year ago Netflix also acquired the rights to Israeli TV series 'Border Police', created by Meni Yaish, starring comedian Shalom Michaelshvili and singer Shlomi Shabbat, but it has not yet been distributed for broadcast worldwide as previously planned. Another series that has been significantly delayed was 'Tehran', by Apple TV+ and Israel’s Kan public broadcaster. The third season of the award-winning espionage thriller was supposed to air in March, but Apple vetoed it due to the ongoing war, until it was finally aired in early December. Even before they announced that there would be no more delays, Spiegel was not much bothered: 'We can understand that. I didn't feel like they were turning their backs on us, the fact is that we are already writing the fourth season. The appreciation and respect for the Israeli industry has not changed. Our successes are being acknowledged, and we know that we are professionals, but it has been a difficult year for everyone, including us.' Figures in the industry explain that it is difficult to market Israeli works today. 'It’s very, very challenging, certainly a series like ‘Tehran,’' says a senior executive at a major streamer. 'It’s hard to promote it right now. I know that there's a new season of ‘Fauda' in progress, and I hope that by the time it’s ready for international broadcast, all of this will be behind us.' But if you ask Adam Berkowitz who was co-head of the television department at leading entertainment and sports agency Creative Artists Agency (CAA), and later founder of Lenore Entertainment Group, thinks that Israel has no particular problem in Hollywood. Berkowitz works with many of the world’s leading television producers, writers, and directors. He has been instrumental in packaging and selling critically acclaimed Israeli series including 'Losing Alice' to Apple TV+, 'Fauda' to Netflix and 'Rehearsals' to Hulu. When asked if there is an increase in pro-Palestinian impact on Hollywood, he laughs. 'There’s nothing like that. There’s a problem with foreign content in general now, it’s not related to Israeli content. Everyone is looking for material in English.' So, is this just Israeli paranoia? 'It's true that there is a problem with film festivals, and it’s more challenging to sell shows that feel political, but it’s not something that can’t be overcome. It’s an industry that has its ups and downs, but I’ve sold many Israeli series, I’m about to sell more, and I don’t think there’s any reason to worry.' Separation between Judaism and Israel If there’s one thing Hollywood has been careful to do this year, even more so than before, is to separate Judaism from Israel, even artificially if necessary. This is particularly evident in the Netflix hit 'Nobody Wants This.' The comedic drama about the romantic journey of a young rabbi and a beautiful, non-Jewish woman, 'Nobody Wants This' perpetuates Jewish stereotypes in a way that somehow can be acceptable, but it is very careful not to mention Israel in any family or ceremonial scenes. It’s a complete misrepresentation of Jewish life in America, especially in the last year, but Hollywood has always had a hard time dealing with Jewish representation, even regardless of Israel, and this year has only aggravated the problem. The difficulty was particularly apparent when The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences opened last fall. The acknowledgement of the contribution of the Jewish immigrants who founded Hollywood was conspicuously absent. It would have looked very bad any year, but this year in particular. After extensive criticism, the Museum opened a new permanent exhibit titled 'Hollywoodland: Jewish Founders and the Making of a Movie Capital'. It took less than two weeks until it was met with blowback, stating that the content of the exhibition was antisemitic, and the museum was forced to make exhibit changes, eliminating the 'phrasing that may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes.' But perhaps the most notable case in which Judaism, antisemitism, and support for Israel have mingled was that of actress Julianna Margulies, star of 'The Good Wife.' Margulies has become one of the most outspoken activists in the fight against antisemitism in Hollywood this year, and she had great influence because of her affiliation to the liberal side of political spectrum. She attacked, among others, the pro-Palestinian protesters, saying that a large portion of them were blacks, and they should embrace the Jews because in the civil rights movements, the Jews were the ones who walked side by side with the blacks. She also attacked pro-Palestinian LGBT protesters in a statement that caused a huge uproar, for which she eventually apologized. Seven months after Margulies stood up for Israel, it was announced that she will not return to Apple TV+‘s ‘The Morning Show’ for Season 4. Sources at Apple TV + said that the decision was made before her controversial comments. Either way, coincidentally or not, Margulies is appearing on Broadway – far away from Hollywood. One thing everyone agrees on is that Hollywood knows how to distinguish the difference between support for Israel and what people think of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In May, super-agent Ari Emanuel, who inspired a character on the TV series 'Entourage', received an award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Emanuel who is one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood took advantage of the event to express support for the war against Hamas, but also to deliver harsh criticism of Netanyahu. 'Netanyahu doesn’t want a peaceful solution, and it’s become clear that getting to a political solution and Netanyahu remaining in power are irreconcilable paths', stated Emanuel. 'As for his responsibilities to keep the people of the State of Israel and Jews across the globe safe, he has obviously failed spectacularly. But he has succeeded wildly in using division to stay in power. For the good of Israel, he should go.' Those remarks by Emanuel drew both applause and boos, as well as some departures from the gala. But ultimately, the event proves a very central point for American Jews – no matter what they think of the government or its leader, criticizing Israel is still considered taboo. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sjhqk8kukg	2025-01-11T08:08:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/19/B1x9J00JcMJx/B1x9J00JcMJx_475_330_840_473_0_small.jpg

Syrian intelligence says it thwarted Islamic State attack on Shi'...	Foiled attack stokes fears that ISIS was hoping to stage a comeback in Syria; new rulers say will protect religious minorities 'in all their diversity' Syria's Intelligence Directorate foiled an attack by the Islamic State group on the Sayeda Zeinab shrine in a Damascus suburb, a site of mass pilgrimage for Shi'ites, state news agency Sana reported on Saturday. It said members of the cell were arrested before they could detonate an explosion inside the shrine. The foiled attack will stoke fears that Islamic State is hoping to stage a comeback in Syria following the fall last month of President Bashar al-Assad. Some Syrians and foreign powers have worried that the country's new leaders, who are from the Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that forced Assad out on Dec. 8, may impose strict Islamic governance on a country with numerous minority groups such as Druze, Kurds, Christians and Shi'ites. But the announcement by Syria's de facto government that it thwarted an attack targeting Shi'ite Muslims comes amid reassurances it will protect religious minorities. 'The General Intelligence Directorate is utilizing all its resources to confront all attempts to target the Syrian people in all their diversity,' an intelligence official told Sana. Islamic State, the Sunni Muslim militant group, has claimed previous attacks in and around the shrine, including last year and a bombing in 2017 that killed at least 40 people. The granddaughter of the Prophet Mohammad, Sayeda Zeinab is venerated by Shi'ite Muslims and the mosque and shrine 10 kilometers south of Damascus attracts Shi'ite pilgrims from around the region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Defense of the shrine had been a rallying call during Syria's 13-year civil war that drew Shi'ite militiamen from around the region to back former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. But Assad's ouster last month significantly diminished the position of Shi'ite forces in Syria, including Iran and the Tehran-allied Lebanese group Hezbollah. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjaehjxpkx	2025-01-11T03:49:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2013/03/03/4492333/4492333_0_0_800_600_0_small.jpg
