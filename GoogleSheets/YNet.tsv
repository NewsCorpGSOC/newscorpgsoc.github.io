Syria's transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan are expected to discuss a joint defense pact in Ankara on Tuesday, including establishing Turkish airbases in central Syria and training for Syria's new army, four sources familiar with the matter said. NATO member Turkey has long backed Syria's armed and political opposition to ousted leader Bashar al-Assad, who was toppled in late December in a lightning offensive spearheaded by Sharaa's forces.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rymnxokkkx	2025-02-04T02:02:28-08:00	
Snuck inside checkpoint and surprised soldiers: IDF probes deadly...	Investigation finds terrorist, armed with an M16 and two magazines, snuck in before dawn and opened fire on soldiers exiting post; at least 10 Israelis injured in attack The IDF's Initial findings from the investigation into the deadly shooting attack at the Tayasir checkpoint in the West Bank on Tuesday, in which at least 10 were injured with two in critical condition, revealed that the incident began inside the checkpoint's pillbox. According to the investigation, the terrorist approached on foot, wearing a military vest equipped with an M16 rifle and two magazines. He infiltrated the post overnight, ambushing soldiers at dawn, just before 06:00 a.m., as they prepared for inspections. The checkpoint, manned by 11 reservists and a commander, came under heavy fire. The first soldier exiting the pillbox was immediately opened fire at the entrance of the post, followed by another. A prolonged close-range gunfight ensued, with the terrorist firing from the pillbox entrance while soldiers returned fire from inside the rooms and guard posts.

A military drone monitored the terrorist from the air but he was ultimately eliminated by ground forces. Following the attack, Palestinians reported two Israeli airstrikes on the nearby village of Tammun. The IDF described the incident as 'very severe' and said it would learn the necessary lessons from the attack. 'We will draw conclusions,' a military official stated. The checkpoint is staffed by a reserve battalion that lost a soldier to an explosive device in the nearby village of Tammun two weeks ago, during which the battalion commander was also seriously wounded. Its role is to monitor the movement of Palestinians in the area. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1alcdjkkx	2025-02-04T01:57:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/SkdqFH1Kyg/SkdqFH1Kyg_0_176_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

I didn’t see sunlight': Freed Thai hostages recall harrowing Gaz...	Five Thai hostages freed after 482 days in captivity shared accounts of confinement, survival and hope; families, some traveling to Israel for emotional reunions, celebrated their release The five Thai hostages released from Hamas captivity during the third hostage handout in the cease-fire agreement with the terror group spoke to Thai media about their time in Gaza. Their family members, who waited 482 days for their return, began their journey to Israel on Monday to reunite with their loved ones. Pongsak Tanna recounted being abducted on the morning of October 7, together with Bannawat Seathao, who was also released in the deal. 'The two of us were together. We were kidnapped from different places but were put in the same vehicle. They brought two more people from elsewhere. We didn’t all meet. We were locked in a room the entire time, never went outside, didn’t see sunlight and didn’t see stars. 'Occasionally, we saw the light of a vehicle passing by the window. We showered once every four or five days and there was a guard with us 24 hours a day,' he said. He added that later, an Israeli hostage was also held with them in Gaza. In an interview with the Bangkok Post, Tanna described his release from captivity in Gaza as 'a rebirth.' He said that life in captivity was extremely difficult, but he never lost hope that he would one day be freed. He shared that thoughts of his family, especially his 15-year-old daughter whom he hadn’t seen for more than seven years, gave him the strength to survive. Seathao said, 'From the day I was kidnapped, I missed home in Thailand. We forced ourselves to eat just to survive and return home. We encouraged each other.' He expressed gratitude to the Thai people for not giving up, for continuing to care about them and for demanding their release. Thailand’s Labor Minister Phipat Ratchakitprakarn spoke from Bangkok with the freed hostages, who are currently being treated at Shamir Medical Center in Israel. He told Thai media the hostages are expected to be discharged from the hospital on February 11. He added that their return date to Thailand has not yet been set but promised to personally welcome them upon their arrival at the airport. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to the freed hostages, during their captivity, they longed to eat 'Som Tam' salad with fish sauce — a dish made from strips of green papaya, sometimes served with shrimp and crabs. They have already managed to enjoy this popular Thai dish since their release. Wiwatchot, younger brother of Watchara Sriaoun, and Kami, the mother of Surasak Lamnau, left their home in Udon Thani province on Monday, heading to Bangkok and continuing on to Israel. The province’s deputy governor accompanied them to the capital, where they were issued passports and entry visas to visit their relatives who survived captivity in Gaza. Wiwatchot, whose brother was photographed after his release with injuries to his mouth and missing front teeth, said, 'The whole family is happy' that he is traveling to meet him. 'Our parents are waiting in Thailand for Watchara to come home,' he added. Lamnao’s mother shared how she waited for her son for over a year, expressing her longing for his return even as some claimed he had been killed. She continued to believe her son was alive. Thai media also reported that the Social Security Administration is expected to pay the freed hostages approximately $15,500. In addition, they will receive a monthly payment of around $780. This information was confirmed by the Thai Ministry of Labor. The five hostages came to Israel from rural provinces in northern and northeastern Thailand and had worked in border communities from which they were abducted. The five released Thai hostages are Sathian Suwannakham, Pongsak Thenna, Bannawat Seathao, Watchara Sriaoun and Surasak Lamnau. Despite their release, five other foreign hostages remain in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydtw81yyl	2025-02-04T01:13:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/04/rkE003pLyYye/rkE003pLyYye_0_20_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Elon Musk targets 'apocalyptic' closure of US humanitarian aid ag...	The move, supported by Trump and opposed by Democratic lawmakers, could disrupt billions in global aid with critics calling it illegal and dangerous U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said it would lock U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) workers out of their headquarters in downtown Washington DC for a second day on Tuesday as it moved to shutter the agency, prompting two Democratic senators to vow to block confirmations of State Department nominees in protest. Monday's lockout added to the chaos that has consumed the agency, which distributes billions of dollars of humanitarian aid around the world, since Trump ordered a freeze on most U.S. foreign aid hours after taking office on January 20. USAID has been targeted for closure by billionaire Elon Musk, who has been tasked by the president with downsizing the federal government. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump was considering merging USAID into the State Department and had 'entrusted Elon to oversee the efficiency of this agency.' A group of Democratic lawmakers, cheered by dozens of furloughed agency employees and contractors, held a protest in front of the USAID headquarters, which was shut to the employees on Monday, according to an internal email. Another internal email went out late on Monday, telling employees at the agency's headquarters and a second site in Washington to work remotely again on Tuesday, adding to concerns voiced by staff members and lawmakers. 'We don't have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,' said U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin, speaking outside the building. Senators Brian Schatz and Chris Van Hollen said they would block confirmation of Trump's nominees for State Department positions under rules that allow them to hold up nominations even if the Republican majority of the chamber want them to move forward. 'We have control over the calendar for nominees,' said Van Hollen. 'We will do everything we can to block State Department nominees from going forward until this illegal action is reversed.' 'Against the law' Hundreds of USAID programs covering billions of dollars worth of lifesaving aid across the globe came to a grinding halt after Trump on January 20 ordered a freeze of most U.S. foreign aid, saying he wanted to ensure it is aligned with his 'America First' policy. If USAID were put under the State Department, it would likely have dramatic consequences for the distribution of aid from the United States, the world's largest single donor. Musk has been increasingly critical of USAID, calling it a left-wing agency unaccountable to the White House. Musk critics say his accusations are often lodged without evidence and may be ideologically driven. The rush of events has underlined Musk's powerful role in setting Trump's agenda. Last week, Musk's team at the Department of Government Efficiency gained access to the most sensitive payment systems at Treasury and locked some employees out of their agency's computers. At USAID, two senior security staff were put on leave after refusing to provide classified documents to DOGE employees on site over the weekend. Since then, dozens of USAID career staff have been put on leave. Three sources familiar with the matter said that USAID personal services contractors, who carry out the bulk of the work in the agency's humanitarian bureau, have also been locked out of their government accounts. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Some USAID staff waved signs as the lawmakers spoke, including one that read: 'USAID saves lives.' Democrats have argued that eliminating USAID's independence requires an act of Congress. Trump told reporters on Monday that he did not believe that was necessary. 'I love the concept (of USAID), but they turned out to be radical left lunatics,' Trump said. Rubio becomes acting USAID head U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting head of USAID, calling the agency 'completely unresponsive' and accusing the staff there of being 'unwilling to answer simple questions' about programs. 'If you go to mission after mission and embassy after embassy around the world, you will often find that in many cases, USAID is involved in programs that run counter to what we're trying to do in our national strategy with that country or with that region. That cannot continue,' Rubio said. He informed Congress in a letter of the looming reorganization of the agency, saying some parts of USAID might be absorbed by the State Department and the remainder may be abolished. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said she found Rubio's notification 'wholly insufficient on the law and devoid of any rationale for the drastic, abrupt action the administration has taken, with no prior notice to Congress.' In fiscal year 2023, the United States disbursed, partly via USAID, $72 billion of aid worldwide on everything from women's health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. It provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024. And yet it is less than 1% of its total budget. The State Department issued worldwide stop-work directives after Trump's freeze order, with the exception of emergency food assistance. Experts warned that the move risks killing people. Since then, dozens of USAID career staff have been put on leave. Three sources familiar with the matter said that USAID personal services contractors, who carry out the bulk of the work in the agency's humanitarian bureau, have also been locked out of their government accounts. 'Without PSCs, there is no longer functionally a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance in USAID. The waivers from Secretary of State Rubio for emergency food and other urgent assistance are a smokescreen and farce if there is no one to make the awards happen,' a USAID official said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00tk8jkye	2025-02-04T00:46:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ByRmw30Oke/ByRmw30Oke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Will Netanyahu give in on the Palestinian state issue?	They say that Israel has to discuss a pathway to the creation of a Palestinian state... A pathway is a thing with gravel, it's not very significant Peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is once again on the table, but part of the Saudi criteria includes a pathway to a Palestinian state. Former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren said this is something Israel could potentially agree to. 'They don't say that Israel has to discuss the creation of a Palestinian state,' Oren told ILTV. 'They say that Israel has to discuss a pathway to the creation of a Palestinian state. Now, if you ask me, a pathway is a thing with gravel, it's not very significant.' He noted that while Saudi Arabia is not a democratic government, it still has to consider public opinion. The kingdom must demonstrate to its people that, in exchange for making peace with Israel, it is taking action on the Palestinian issue. 'I think that Netanyahu would agree to discuss a pathway,' Oren said. 'He might even agree to some symbolic Palestinian Authority presence in Gaza on the day after, but his government won't, and he'll have a hard time—not only with the far-right wing of his government but perhaps with elements within his own Likud party.' However, Oren believes Netanyahu could return to his government and argue that the issue is important to Trump, whose support is crucial for Israel’s national security.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjdxvujy1l	2025-02-04T00:01:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/08/19/HJyL5E9GD/HJyL5E9GD_0_38_1000_563_0_small.jpg

Israel faces driest winter in over a century	Despite the severe drought, desalination and water management efforts are preventing any immediate drinking water shortages Israel is experiencing its driest winter in more than 100 years, with only 55% of the annual average rainfall recorded so far, according to the Water Authority. Despite the severe drought, desalination and water management efforts are preventing any immediate drinking water shortages. The last similar dry spell was in 2009. The Sea of Galilee, Israel’s main freshwater reservoir, barely rose this winter, and the Jordan River’s flow is at its lowest since 1960. The only significant rainfall came from one heavy downpour in the Carmel region, pushing local precipitation above average. More rain is expected Wednesday and Thursday, with up to 50 millimeters forecasted, but experts say it won’t be enough to change the overall trend.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryexmu1fjx	2025-02-03T23:41:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/03/04/S18eFneJn/S18eFneJn_0_176_1024_577_0_small.jpg

Iran working on secret 'shortcut' to nuclear bomb, report says	International outlet reports U.S. intelligence data delivered from Biden to Trump's administration suggests Iranian scientists working on clandestine plan to expedite development of a nuclear warhead Amid tensions between Tehran and Washington and former U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, 'We need to apply more pressure to Iran until they stop doing the activities that they’re doing.' In an interview with Fox News, he added, 'They’re [Iran] trying to ultimately get to a nuclear weapon.' Meanwhile, The New York Times reported on Tuesday that new intelligence on Iran’s nuclear program has convinced U.S. officials that a secret team of scientists in Tehran is exploring new development options. Sources said this intelligence was gathered in recent months under former U.S. president Joe Biden’s administration and passed to incumbent President Donal Trump's incoming national security team. The assessment warned that Iranian engineers and scientists are seeking a 'shortcut' to turn their growing stockpile of nuclear fuel into a functional weapon within months. U.S. officials still believe Iran, led by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, has not yet decided to build a nuclear weapon but suspect it may consider doing so as a deterrent against a potential U.S. or Israeli strike. According to the American outlet, Iran has the knowledge to develop a crude nuclear weapon using an outdated but faster method. Such a weapon wouldn’t be small enough for a ballistic missile and would likely be unreliable, making it less suitable for an immediate attack. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, officials warned that Iran could quickly develop a basic device, conduct a test and declare itself a nuclear power. While such a weapon might not be effective against Israel, it could serve as a deterrent. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump are set to discuss the Iranian threat in their meeting set for Tuesday. About a week and a half ago, Trump said 'it would be nice,' if the Iran issue could be resolved without Israel attacking its military facilities. When asked if he would support an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, Trump said, 'I won’t answer that question.' In a previous Fox News interview, Trump stressed that Iran 'cannot have nuclear weapons.' The Financial Times recently reported that Trump was open to diplomatic solutions before increasing pressure on Tehran. A former senior Israeli official told the paper, 'I don’t see the Trump administration using force early on without at least trying other approaches. That doesn’t align with his stance that wars started under Biden and that he’s going to end them.' Iran has signaled its willingness to negotiate, though analysts believe any talks would be difficult for both sides. Iran’s Vice President Mohammad Mokhber recently said at the Davos Forum that he hopes Trump will be 'more serious, more focused and more realistic' in dealings with Tehran. He acknowledged the economic burden of sanctions but denied Tehran’s involvement in the activities of Hamas, Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthis, saying, 'We’ve never had proxies.'

After 15 months of captivity, Bibas family still awaits reunion	As Yarden reacclimates to life, his family have no answers to offer him about the fate of his wife Shiri and two sons, Kfir and Ariel; Members of the Bibas family now demand answers from the government On Monday evening, the Bibas family gave a statement to the press from Sheba Medical Center, two days after Yarden Bibas was released from Hamas captivity, while his wife Shiri and their children Ariel and Kfir remain in Gaza, with serious concerns for their safety. At the beginning of the statement, Yarden’s sister, Ofri Bibas Levy, said: 'We endured 484 days of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty, and now Yarden is home. Yarden is here and we’ve rediscovered what we already knew — how strong and amazing he is. 'We’ve learned how he survived hell with his sensitivity and humor, which are so characteristic of him. We look at him, hug him, and still can’t believe he’s here. He’s adjusting and learning about everything that happened. There’s a lot of information to process, some of it difficult to handle.' According to Ofri, 'Yarden says he was moved between many locations during his captivity, held in harsh conditions, with food often scarce and poor hygiene. He was exposed to little sunlight for long periods. Yarden also discovered that he and his family are no longer anonymous. He has realized how loved he and his family are. It moves him, but it’s not easy to cope with.' Ofri also referred to Shiri, Kfir and Ariel. She said, 'Yarden’s journey to recovery has only just begun, and it’s clear it won’t be complete until his family — Shiri, Ariel and Kfir — are home. My brother is back, but my sister-in-law and my nephews are not. 'Yarden asks about them, and I have no answers for him. I demand that the prime minister and the negotiation team provide us and him with answers. Our journey will not be complete until we have certainty about Shiri and the children’s fate and until all 79 captives are home.' Ofri also sent a message to Shiri and the children, who are still in captivity: 'We miss you so much and are waiting for you, now together with Yarden. I appeal to the prime minister and the ministers: you made the right decision in favor of the agreement. 'The price is heavy, but there is no price for life, freedom, and security. Today, negotiations for the next phase are supposed to begin. The challenges are great, but the commitment is clear—to bring everyone back, the living for recovery and the fallen for burial.' Later, Dana Silverman Seaton, Shiri’s sister, who rarely speaks out in public, also gave a statement. 'Two days ago, I finally managed to breathe a little after 15 months of hell in which I lost my parents, my friends, and my younger and only sister, Shiri, who was kidnapped along with my nephews Ariel and Kfir and her husband Yarden to Gaza,' she said. 'I am so happy I got to hug Yarden, hear his voice, and look into his eyes again,' she added. 'Yarden has only one question: Where are Shiri and the children? Three-quarters of our hearts are still held in captivity and until they return, we will remain incomplete. We will no longer accept uncertainty—we demand answers. We demand them back. It is the state’s duty to us after everything we’ve been through.' According to Dana, 'Shiri and her children were in their kibbutz, still wearing their pajamas, as the entire country and the world saw, and the state failed to protect them. It is the responsibility of the government and the state toward Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir, toward Yarden, toward me, toward our entire family, and toward every citizen who looks and asks whether the State of Israel knows how to protect its citizens. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I appeal to the Prime Minister and the members of the government: complete the deal in all its stages until the last captive is home. Do not let extreme voices derail the agreement,' she concluded. 'This is what distinguishes us from our enemies. Bring everyone back—the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial.' Earlier, relatives of Keith Siegel, who was released from captivity alongside Yarden and Ofer Kalderon on Saturday, also gave a statement. Keith’s daughter, Shir, said: '484 days of hell have passed for my father. A year and four months in the darkest, scariest place on earth. 'He says he was held in inhumane conditions by cruel terrorists who abused him mentally, physically, and emotionally. He barely saw daylight, was starved for long periods, and lost significant weight. He says he was held in harsh isolation conditions and sometimes lost hope of ever returning home.' After Shir spoke, Aviva, Keith’s wife, who was released in the previous deal in November 2023, also spoke. She thanked the Prime Minister and the negotiation team for their 'brave decisions,' as she put it, and added that Keith’s return highlights the urgency of bringing back all the captives. 'There are still 79 captives in Gaza. Everyone deserves to come home. All their families deserve to feel what we are feeling now.' Aviva thanked President Donald Trump for 'saving his life' and also thanked former U.S. president Joe Biden for 'supporting the family throughout the process.' After Yarden returned from captivity, the Bibas family said: 'Yarden is home. A quarter of our hearts has returned to us after 15 long months. Words cannot describe the relief of holding Yarden in our arms, hugging him, and hearing his voice. Yarden is home, but the home is incomplete.' 'Yarden is a father who left the shelter to protect his family, survived captivity heroically and returned to an unbearable reality. We continue to hope and call for the return of Shiri, the children, and all the captives. Please continue to amplify their voices and the urgency of their return. Help us echo this louder than ever. For Yarden and for everyone. We won’t stop until everyone is home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1tzxscoye	2025-02-03T21:01:26-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/Bk5jGcs00Je/Bk5jGcs00Je_253_6_595_335_0_small.jpg

Gaza, the day after the war; four options for rule of the Strip	There is no doubt Hamas maintains its control over Gaza including policing, food distribution and more despite Israel's goal to remove it; some in Israel urge for mililtary control and settlements; PM must chose between ruling Gaza and normalization with Saudi Arabia The images of armed Hamas terrorists during the release of hostages in Gaza, leave little doubt. After a year and five months of war, Hamas, although weakened, is in full control of the Gaza Strip and the lives of its residents, despite Israel's declared goal to destroy the terror group and prevent it from ruling over the enclave. The future of Gaza will likely be discussed on Tuesday in the meeting of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump and may be connected to a larger deal that would include a normalization of ties with Saudi Arabia. For now, there are four possible options for who would rule Gaza after the war, each of them complex and critical for Israel and the civilians in Gaza. Hamas continues to rule the Strip Despite Israel's objections, Hamas may maintain its rule over Gaza. The terror group has thousands of armed members, a police force and a security agency. It also has local municipal workers already busy clearing some of the rubble from the destruction caused by the war. Until the cease-fire most of them avoided being affiliated with Hamas but since the truce was announced, they returned wearing their uniforms. Maintaining Hamas rule over Gaza may make rebuilding the strip more difficult. The mammoth task would require years and a flow of foreign donations. Hamas has been discussing the establishment of a civilian management committee run by Palestinian technocrats and members of the Palestinian Authority (PA) but refused any possible dissolution of its military wing. The terror group has been attempting to copy the Hezbollah model in Lebanon where the Iranian proxy was both a political party that had a seat at the cabinet table and also a military force. This would not be acceptable for the PA. A continued Hamas rule over Gaza poses a threat to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government because it had vowed to prevent any future that leaves Hamas the ruling power across the border. In fact, Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners have called for Israeli military control of the entire Strip and the establishment of settlements there. Israel conquers Gaza and established a military rule Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Israel to conquer Gaza. According to the cease-fire agreement, Israeli troops who are still deployed to the Netzarim Corridor in the center of the Strip and the Philadelphi Corridor to the south, will have to withdraw on day 22 of the deal from Netzarim and 20days later from Philadelphi. The release of all of the hostages named in the first phase of the deal relies on the pullback of troops. If Netanyahu decides not to move on to the second phase of the deal and orders the IDF to resume the war, he may also task the military with civilian matters such as the distribution of food and the collection of garbage. This would be detrimental to Netanyahu's efforts to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia and would require the backing of the United States, under the Trump administration. Trump said he wanted the war to end and all of the hostages to be returned. Palestinian Authority rule over Gaza The PA is considered the only alternative to a Hamas rule in the Strip but is opposed by Israel. Netanyahu has tried to avoid any Palestinian rule there and even denied that the PA had any role in the administration of the Rafah border crossing into Egypt, despite evidence to the contrary. The PA is weak in the West Bank and has failed in its military operations against Iran backed terror groups in Jenin and elsewhere. The PA insists they alone would rule the Strip after they were violently ousted by Hamas in 2007, but if they would be able to, remains in doubt. Israel tried to enlist local clans to take on the responsibilities of a civilian government but failed. The defense minister Yoav Gallant also tried to divide Gaza into several dozen sectors to be individually managed, but that has failed as well. According to a report in the New York Times, the role filled by the PA I Rafah could indicate that Netanyahu was backing down in his opposition under pressure from Trump and the Gulf states and may allow it to take on more responsibilities, perhaps in cooperation with international forces or 'contractors.'

Thus far there are only 100 people assigned to the job and other than Egypt and Qatar no other Arab county has chosen to participate. But in Israel there are those who are hoping and planning for an influx of foreign forces who would take control and fill governing positions. Israeli officials quoted in the New York Times said the use of foreign forces could expand, with the support of Saudi Arabia and the UAE but they would demand guarantees that a Palestinian state would be advanced or the agreement of the PA for their involvement. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s18myacoyl	2025-02-03T13:30:50-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/BJlDkHodkg/BJlDkHodkg_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu, Musk meet in Washington DC to discuss AI developments	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met in Washington with tech mogul Elon Musk, who also serves as the head of the Government Efficiency Department under President Trump. During the meeting, they discussed ways to strengthen cooperation between Israel and the United States in the field of artificial intelligence. The meeting was also attended by David Sacks, who oversees the areas of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence in the administration. This marks Netanyahu's third meeting with Musk, who hosted him at the Tesla factory in California about a year and a half ago and visited Israel after October 7.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj1ad2c001l	2025-02-03T12:45:33-08:00	
Freed Palestinian terrorists go from jail to luxury hotel	The former prisoners now reside at Al Masa Hotel in Egypt’s new administrative capital, where they have access to a gym, café, and snooker rooms; As Egypt grapples with a severe economic crisis, some are asking: Who is footing the bill? On Jan. 25, following the release of four IDF lookouts—Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, and Daniella Gilboa—from Hamas captivity in Gaza, Egypt swiftly prepared to receive 70 Palestinian prisoners, many serving life sentences or lengthy prison terms, who were exiled as part of a ceasefire agreement. According to the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Egyptian sources said some of the released prisoners would remain in Egypt for the duration of their exile, while others would later relocate to other destinations in the Arab world and Europe. However, based on images and footage of their accommodations, it is unclear why they would be in any hurry to leave Cairo. The prisoners were welcomed at the opulent Al-Massa Hotel ('The Diamond'), located in Egypt’s newly constructed administrative capital east of Cairo. Their reception was lavish, attended by senior figures from Hamas’ political bureau and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. According to Al Jazeera, hundreds of people gathered outside the hotel, chanting 'Allahu Akbar' in support of the released prisoners despite the heavy security presence. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Reports suggest negotiations were ongoing to determine the prisoners’ long-term residences, with Cairo described as merely a 'transit point.' However, images and videos from the event at Al-Massa revealed a grand affair, with the prisoners wearing specially branded hats and scarves for the occasion. Several Arab media outlets also published footage of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal attending the celebration at the hotel. Since the initial reception, no further images have emerged from the hotel, but following the release of Israeli hostages Ofer Kalderon, Yarden Bibas, and Keith Siegel on Saturday, another group of deported Palestinian prisoners arrived in Egypt. The Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that the seven prisoners released that day were also taken to Al-Massa, which is effectively serving as their temporary residence. The paper published additional images and videos of the newly arrived prisoners. There have been claims that the released prisoners were unable to leave the hotel premises, but given the luxurious accommodations, it is unclear why they would want to. Al-Massa is far from a mere 'transit point'—it is a sprawling luxury complex featuring a grand lobby, elegantly designed rooms, restaurants, a large fitness center, a spa, and conference halls. The hotel also boasts a sports club, snooker rooms, a shooting range, a cinema, a café, and even a mosque. Previously managed by the Egyptian military’s engineering division, the hotel was later taken over by Marriott International and rebranded as The St. Regis Al-Massa. According to reports, it was the first hotel completed in Egypt’s new administrative capital. In recent days, social media users have questioned why this particular hotel was chosen to host the released prisoners. Another lingering question remains: who is funding their extended stay? Are Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups footing the bill, or is Egypt—grappling with its own severe economic crisis—covering the costs? >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjacaj0ukx	2025-02-03T12:28:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/03/ryWQuwGCuye/ryWQuwGCuye_0_0_1280_694_0_small.jpg

Torturned, held in inhumane conditions, barely seeing sunlight' ...	Shir Siegal says her father was strengthened by knowledge that Israelis were fighting for he release but disheartened by the division and incitement in the country; says he chose to wrap himself with flag and walk despite pain and weakness Keith Siegal was tortured physically and emotionally, starved and held in inhuman conditions, his family said in a statement on Monday. Siegal who was released from Gaza on Saturday suffered extreme weight loss. Siegal barely saw sunlight, his daughter Shir, said. 'He was held in isolation and often lost hope of ever returning home. 'He was in the darkest and scariest place on earth,' she said. 'My father passed 484 days knowing each moment could be his last, and that the terrorists could execute him if the military pressure increased, as he knew had been the fate of others among the captives. He went through hell that no one would ever be able to understand. Shir said her father chose to wrap himself with an Israeli flag when he returned to Israel and was flown to the Soratzky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. 'He chose to walk, despite the pain and weakness but inside he was broken hearted over what happened to our community on Oct. 7 and what the people of Israel must still endure.' Siegal's daughter said her father drew strength from the public's fight for the release of hostages and from the military's efforts to find and rescue them. 'In contrast he was broken by the violence, the divide and the incitement among Israelis. One of his first questions to us was what could he do to help bring all of the hostages, home?' she said. Siegal asked about what had happened in Kfar Aza, his kibbutz and home from which he was abducted. 'We went over the cruel list of 64 deal and beloved people who were murdered. He could not believe how many of his friends and neighbors were massacred. People from our community who will never return. My father came back to life and is begging us not to miss any more opportunities to save the hostages who are alive and bring those who are dead, to burial.' Shir said she had feared she would never see the moment that her father returned and had often lost hope fearing the worse. She then turned her comments to the families of fallen soldiers who died in the war. 'I am sorry bereavement came to your door so that we receive life. I apologize to civilians, soldiers and members of the security forces who sacrificed their lives for us, for the country and the security of each and every citizen.

Trump's comments came ahead of his Tuesday meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House and as negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire deal were to begin. Netanyahu had not sent a delegation to the negotiations and was reportedly considering removing Mossad chief David Barnea as the head of Israel's negotiating team and replacing him with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.

Smotrich outlines Gaza, West Bank deal breakers before Trump-Neta...	Far-right finance minister says complete destruction of Hamas is a non-negotiable goal before any ceasefire; rejects concessions on the Philadelphi Corridor. stresses security concerns ahead of the Trump-Netanyahu meeting on Gaza and Saudi normalization Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Monday drew the red lines he would not allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cross ahead of his meeting on Tuesday with U.S. President Donald Trump and the start of negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. 'For example, leaving the Philadelphi Corridor is a red line for me,' Smotrich said at the start of the Religious Zionism faction meeting. 'The joy over the return of every hostage is immense and deeply moving for every Israeli and Jew. However, we cannot ignore the price we are paying and the harsh images we are witnessing in Gaza—scenes of Hamas asserting its rule and control, and the cruelty and bloodthirsty hatred of many Gazans who support Hamas.' Smotrich said the war cannot end before Hamas is completely destroyed. 'If, heaven forbid, we do not achieve this, it will only be a matter of time before they regroup and launch the next massacre. We are determined and are preparing for this.' Netanyahu far-right coalition partner threatened to bring down the government if the prime minister proceeds to the next phase of the deal. He said he woudl support a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations but 'they must be based on truth and not on lies, such as the notion that Arabs have national rights in the Land of Israel,' he said. 'Furthermore, they must not come at the expense of the security of Israeli citizens, which includes achieving the objectives of the war: destroying Hamas’ military and governmental power, removing the threat, and returning all the hostages.' Smotrich told his faction that an agreement with Saudi Arabia cannot, come alongside providing hope to the terror-supporting Palestinian Authority or to Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza for the establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the State of Israel.' Earlier, Itamar Ben-Gvir head of the Otzma Yehudit Party who resigned from the government after the cease-fire deal was agreed, calling it a catastrophe, also addressed the Netanyahu-Trump meeting during his faction’s meeting. 'Netanyahu must return with commitments to resume fighting and dismantle Hamas. Without returning to the fight and toppling Hamas’ rule, any other declaration he receives will not change the unfortunate fact that the war’s objective has not been achieved. As long as there is no government willing to dismantle Hamas’ rule, I do not see myself—and Otzma Yehudit will not return—to the government.'

'The decisions we made during the war, combined with the bravery of IDF soldiers, have already changed the face of the Middle East,' Netanyahu continued. 'They have changed it beyond recognition. I believe that through hard work with President Trump, we can change it even more for the better.' 'We can strengthen Israel’s security, expand the circle of peace even further, and bring about a wonderful era we never dreamed of—an era of prosperity, security, and peace through strength. The strength of our soldiers, the strength of our citizens, the strength of Israel, and the strength of the alliance between Israel and the United States,' Netanyahu concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byhibu000yl	2025-02-03T09:56:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/01/rkXCYv7lvR/rkXCYv7lvR_0_115_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Jordan faces regional pressures as King Abdullah prepares for Whi...	Controversial proposal to resettle Gazans outside their territory has drawn strong regional opposition, all while Jordan is dealing with domestic unrest and a strained economy Jordan’s King Abdullah II is set to visit the White House later this month for a high-stakes meeting with US President Donald Trump, the Jordanian royal palace announced Sunday. This will be their first face-to-face discussion since Trump returned to office and revived a controversial idea: relocating Gazans outside their territory, a proposal that has been met with strong opposition from Jordan, Egypt, and other regional actors. Jordan’s firm rejection of Gaza resettlement Trump recently revealed that he had spoken with Abdullah about the matter, urging Jordan to accept some of Gaza’s population. 'I’d love you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess,' he told reporters aboard Air Force One. He left open the question of whether such resettlement would be temporary or permanent, stating, 'Could be either.' Abdullah has strongly rejected the proposal, reiterating Jordan’s long-standing position that Palestinians must remain on their land and obtain their legitimate rights through a two-state solution. During a meeting with European officials in Brussels last week, the king emphasized that Jordan would not support any alternative homeland for Palestinians. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi echoed this stance, as did foreign ministers from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar during a recent meeting in Cairo. In a joint statement, they condemned any attempts to displace Palestinians, forcibly or otherwise. This latest dispute comes as Jordan navigates a complex and evolving regional landscape. Long considered a stabilizing force in the Middle East, the Hashemite Kingdom now finds itself at the center of multiple crises, including shifting US policies, security threats at its borders, and growing domestic discontent over economic conditions. This proposal has further intensified tensions, with critics condemning it as forced displacement. MENA political analyst Dr. Nicolai Due-Gundersen, author of Defending Dictatorships, told The Media Line that while Jordan has historically taken in refugees—including those from the 1948 and 1967 wars, the Gulf conflicts, and the Syrian civil war—it is now at a breaking point. 'Jordan may not be willing to receive further refugees at a time when it is already stretched thin,' he said, citing economic difficulties and high youth unemployment. Jordanian political analyst Amer Sabaileh raised additional concerns, warning that an influx of refugees from Gaza could introduce security risks. 'We have seen how radical groups can exploit refugee crises, and this is a scenario Jordan must be prepared to prevent,' he told The Media Line. He further warned that the pressure may not stop with Gaza. 'Now Jordan is pressured into taking people from Gaza as a first wave. Later, the Trump administration may demand Jordan take in refugees from the West Bank as well. This is simply not manageable.' The case of Ahlam al-Tamimi In a separate development, Hamas’ Al-Aqsa TV reported that Jordan had sought the deportation of Ahlam al-Tamimi, a Palestinian terrorist convicted for her role in the 2001 Sbarro pizzeria bombing in Jerusalem, which killed 16 people, including two US citizens. Tamimi has lived in Jordan since her 2011 release in a prisoner exchange. The United States has long sought her extradition and continues to offer a $5 million reward for information leading to her capture. In 2022, Interpol dropped its warrant for Tamimi’s arrest, but US authorities still consider her a high-priority target. Jordan has not publicly commented on the report from Hamas’ media wing, and it remains unclear whether the government has taken formal steps to extradite her. The Palestinian identity debate in Jordan With nearly 2.2 million registered Palestinian refugees, Jordan holds the largest Palestinian population outside Palestine. The question of Palestinian identity has long shaped Jordan’s domestic politics, but some analysts believe the monarchy has over-prioritized Palestinian advocacy at the expense of national interests. 'Jordan made a huge mistake promoting itself as more Palestinian than the Palestinians,' Sabaileh argued, contending that this approach has led to resentment among Jordanian citizens. Due-Gundersen noted that Jordan’s support for Palestine plays a role in maintaining stability, but warned that agreeing to Trump’s plan could backfire, feeding into the argument that 'Jordan is Palestine'—a narrative the monarchy vehemently opposes. At the same time, Abdullah must manage growing domestic frustrations over Israeli policies while maintaining Jordan’s security cooperation with Israel. 'The king will likely not wish to fully freeze relations with Israel for security and intelligence reasons,' Due-Gundersen explained. However, this balancing act has sparked public protests, particularly among Jordan’s Palestinian population. Security threats at Jordan’s borders Beyond the political ramifications of the Gaza issue, Jordan faces ongoing security threats, particularly from narcotrafficking along its borders. The smuggling of Captagon, an amphetamine widely produced in Syria, has become a growing concern for Jordanian authorities. 'The network of Captagon and weapons smuggling was centralized under [Syrian President Bashar] Assad,' Due-Gundersen explained. 'Weapons smuggling drew more on tribes and networks close to the Syria-Jordan border on both sides.' Jordanian security forces have intercepted nearly 17 million Captagon pills in 2023 alone, highlighting the scale of the problem. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sabaileh emphasized the level of organization behind the drug trade. 'It’s not drug trading, it’s narcotrafficking. When we talk about narcotrafficking, it’s more organized, more sophisticated with local partners. Nobody sends a huge amount of drugs to the borders if you don’t have a local dealer.' Jordan’s next steps As Jordan prepares for King Abdullah’s meeting with Trump, the stakes are high. Abdullah must navigate US pressure while safeguarding Jordan’s national interests and security. The rejection of forced Palestinian resettlement remains a cornerstone of Jordanian policy, but the kingdom’s broader geopolitical and domestic challenges require careful maneuvering. Due-Gundersen predicted that Jordan will likely maintain its role as a buffer state while resisting the relocation of Gaza’s population. 'While it may refuse to take in refugees from Gaza, it still hosts Syrian refugees, and with uncertainty remaining over Syria’s transition, it is possible that aid will continue to flow from various donors to Amman.' Sabaileh, however, cautioned that Jordan cannot rely on external aid indefinitely. 'Nobody wants to see Jordan collapse, but ultimately, its stability depends on the actions of its own leadership and people. Without proactive internal reforms and strategic decision-making, external support alone will not be enough to safeguard the country’s future.' As Jordan charts its course in an increasingly unstable region, the coming weeks will test Abdullah’s leadership, diplomatic skills, and ability to balance competing domestic and international pressures.

Ofer was put through hell in captivity, up until the last moment,...	Calderon tells family of the physical and psychological terror the hostages endure in the hands of Hamas; Cousin says images of joy in first days and hours, misleading, says Ofer drew strength from seeing family members protesting for his release Ofer Calderon who was released by Hamas on Saturday after 484 days in captivity told family members that the hostages endured physical and psychological terror of the worse kind, up until they were released. He said those who remain captive in the hands of the terrorists are in under imminent threat of death, after 38 hostages had already died. Calderon said he was able to see Al Jazeera coverage of the protests demanding his and the other hostages' release and recognized some of his family members. 'It strengthened him. In captivity you hang onto little things and seeing the family fighting for him was everything,' his cousin Eyal told Ynet. 'These things are critical to their survival there,' he said. Calderon's two children Sahar and Erez who were released in the first exchange in November, 2023. His parting words to Sahar were 'Fight for me. I don't want to die in the tunnels.' Calderon was released along with Yarden Bibas and soon after, Keith Siegal was also freed. The three men arrived in Israel walking on their own feet and appearing strong. Eyal warned that the images of the hostages who were freed were misleading. 'We've become experienced after Erez and Sahar's return. At first there is so much joy but very quickly there is an understanding that things are more complex.

He said the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal must not be foiled. 'My fight was to bring Ofer home. Now I will go on fighting for all the others.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1gimprd1g	2025-02-03T06:50:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/S10k9Piukl/S10k9Piukl_167_98_1007_566_0_small.jpg

Set be to released from Hamas captivity, Eli Sharabi faces an exc...	After months in captivity, Eli Sharabi returns to a shattered life—his wife and daughters murdered, his brother gone; His family prepares to support him as he faces unimaginable grief and the challenge of rebuilding his life from scratch 'I'm going through endless, overwhelming days. For the first time, I feel like I understand what the hostages must be experiencing, counting the seconds in the tunnels. When will Eli finally walk out of there on his own two feet?' said Sharon Sharabi, the brother of Eli Sharabi, who is set to be released in the first stage of the deal, and of Yossi Sharabi, who was murdered while in captivity in Gaza. Eli’s wife, Lian, and their two daughters, Yahel and Noya, were murdered on October 7. 'When we found out Yossi was murdered, I said to myself: we failed. When Eli comes home, I’ll say we succeeded,' Sharon explained. 'It’s not just me—an entire nation feels the same way. It feels like all our hearts are bursting with excitement. But alongside that, there’s so much pain. Pain for October 7, for these past 16 months, for the brother Eli lost, for his wife and daughters who are no longer with us. After everything he’s been through, he’s coming back to a completely different reality—a nightmare. Without his wife and daughters, without a home. 'I don’t think there’s any chance he knows Yossi didn’t survive. Maybe he knows about Lian and the girls—maybe some terrorist told him—but not about Yossi. When he comes back and finds out, his world is going to shatter all over again,' Sharon added. 'I don’t know how you prepare for such an insane situation. How do we tell him? When? There are no words that can comfort him after such devastating news. All we can do is hug him, show him that we’re here for him, and never leave his side.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Sharon shared that the first thing he’ll do after Eli comes home is mourn. The second is to help Eli rebuild his life. 'These are my life’s missions,' he said. 'I’m full of faith and hope that Eli will find his way out of this loop of grief and hold on to life. I’ve been listening to testimonies, learning, and processing—it might be similar to what Eli is experiencing. I know I’ll need to be the strong person by his side. Strong, but also sensitive.' Their mother will wait for Eli in Kibbutz Re’im. 'She’s so eager to see her survivor,' Sharon said, adding that he plans to meet his brother at the hospital. 'But this immense excitement is accompanied by a sense of loss. I know Yossi could have been on that same helicopter. We failed as a country in a big way. They were there far too long, and there were opportunities to save lives. The hostages are coming home, and we’re grateful to the politicians who were involved, but the ones who truly paved the way to bring them home were the IDF soldiers who gave their lives, and the bereaved families whose loved ones were murdered by the terrorists now being released. They’re the ones who deserve our gratitude.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkel0b0uyx	2025-02-03T06:00:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/09/SyLWkDsV4ye/SyLWkDsV4ye_0_41_1280_721_0_small.jpg
IDF expands West Bank counter-terror operation, residents flee	Jenin mayor says forces duplicating their offensive on Gaza, warns his city will be abandoned; Tulkarm mayor says Israel changing refugee camps' demographics The IDF has been conducting a counter-terror operation in the northern West Bank for the past 13 days, concentrating on the cities of Jenin and Tulkarm and their surroundings and on the villages bordering with the Jordan Valley. The aim is to destroy terror infrastructure, clear explosive devices on main routes and kill or arrest terrorists. An explosive and weapon-production lab was found and destroyed in Tulkarm and five suspects were detained. At the same time, forces detained terror suspects in Jenin and prepared the surrounding for an extensive stay in the refugee camp. As of Sunday, security forces said 35 people were killed and Palestinian sources said 29 of them were in Jenin while dozens more were hurt. Tulkarm governor Abdullah Kamil said on Monday that half of the city's residents fled. 'Tow hospitals are under siege, soldiers are attacking civilians in their homes, vandalizing and burning houses and destroying furniture in some,' he said. 'Israel is changing the camps' demographics and fighting every Palestinian, not only in the refugee camps.' He accused Israel of taking advantage of the presence of armed militants in villages and towns and that 1,500 families have been displaced from the city. The IDF said it was evacuating uninvolved civilians from the fighting, for their safety. They are allowed to leave through passageways after security checks. Jenin mayor and the governor of Tubas called for international intervention. 'Half the city's neighborhoods have been cut off from water and electricity,' Jenin mayor Mohammed Jerar said. 'The Israeli operation is a repeat of what has happened in Gaza. The city will be abandoned if this goes on.'

Crime cell stole over a ton of medical cannabis from licensed far...	Officers in central Israel arrest group that moved over one ton of medical cannabis to criminal bodies throughout the country while masquerading as legal drug handlers; Health Ministry shuts down licensed farm The Israel Police recently uncovered the theft of over 1.2 tons of medical cannabis from a licensed farm to criminal groups in Israel and arrested four suspects who posed as security guards involved in the crime. The case emerged in early December when central Israel detectives stopped a suspicious vehicle carrying two men with fake security credentials and 300 kilograms (661 lbs) of medical cannabis. The four suspects were indicted and the farm was shut down. The investigation found that the suspects used a sophisticated scheme, posing as security personnel legally transporting the drug while actually delivering the stolen cannabis to a secret warehouse in Azaria, a moshav in central Israel near Ramle, where two other accomplices awaited. Police uncovered five such transfers, totaling 1.281 tons. Due to the severity of the case and public safety risks, Israel Police Central District Commander Deputy Commissioner Yair Hetsroni issued an administrative closure order for the farm, later upheld by the court. The district's legal advisor also contacted the Health Ministry’s medical cannabis unit, which immediately revoked the farm’s license.

Hamas official tells Russia hostage Alexander Trupanov 'will be f...	During visit to Russia, Musa Abu Marzook says Trupanov, abducted from his home in Nir Oz on October 7, will be released 'despite being a soldier' as a gesture to Moscow Senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzook, during a visit to Moscow on Sunday, told Russia's Sputnik network that hostage Alexander (Sasha) Trupanov would be released soon. 'He will be freed in the first stage despite being a soldier,' Marzook said, calling it a gesture to Russia for its stance on the Palestinian issue. Abu Marzook also addressed the case of hostage Maxim Herkin, a Donbas native, saying his release would be decided in the negotiations about the cease-fire deal’s second phase with Israel. 'Hamas is ready to make him a top priority,' he said. Abu Marzook, Hamas' deputy political leader, is leading the terror group's delegation in meetings with Russian officials as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the U.S. for talks on the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Russia's RIA news agency reported that the Hamas delegation was holding talks with senior Russian officials 'as part of Moscow's engagement with key Middle East players, including Israel, Iran, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.' Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov told the news channel Rossiya 24 two weeks ago that Hamas leadership gave Moscow a 'firm commitment' that Trupanov 'will be released alive and well.' He said that 'Alexander Trupanov could be freed from Gaza within three to four weeks,' referring to a framework in which he was among 33 hostages set for release in the first stage as part of the sick and wounded category slated for release. He added that Moscow had information that Trupanov was wounded in Gaza. A day earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered efforts to be intensified to secure the release of Herkin, 36, from Tirat Carmel, who is not on the list of 33 hostages set for release. The previous week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow 'expects the release of hostage Sasha Trupanov from Gaza as part of the deal.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Russia welcomed the agreement and had raised 'the issue of his swift return home in our ongoing contacts with Hamas representatives.' Russia sought obligations from Hamas that Trupanov would be included in the deal. Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov spoke with Abu Marzook and, days earlier, with Hamas' foreign leader Khaled Mashal. Russia said Palestinian officials expressed appreciation for Moscow's efforts to support Palestinian rights and its stance on the issue. The officials were also briefed on cease-fire talks, with Bogdanov urging Hamas to ensure Trupanov's release. Trupanov, 29, an Israeli resident who also holds Russian citizenship, was kidnapped on October 7 along with his mother, Yelena, grandmother, Irina and girlfriend, Sapir Cohen, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The three women were released in the first hostage deal in late November 2023 after 54 and 55 days in captivity. His father, Vitaly, was murdered by a Hamas terrorist. The Islamic Jihad terror group has released several videos of Trupanov in captivity, the most recent about two months ago. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ie0xaojx	2025-02-03T03:42:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/Sk24uZ2v1e/Sk24uZ2v1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Pilots on the ground in the West Bank: The Air Force's surprising...	Pilots joined soldiers in arrest operations in Operation Iron Wall as part of new program; 'The mission of assisting the ground forces has reached a very high level in Gaza and Lebanon - we will continue to train for effectiveness in all sectors,' said deputy squadron commander; Meanwhile, the IDF and Shin Bet plan to expand the use of airstrikes The Israeli Air Force has launched a new program, which is intended to strengthen cooperation between ground forces operating in Operation Iron Wall in the West Bank with pilots and air crew members. The program was initiated by Air Force Commander, Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, and as part of it the deputy commander of the Operation Strike Squadron in the sector participates every few days in arrest operations with ground forces in West Bank villages and cities. The deputy commander of Squadron 109 last week joined a complex operation in the West Bank under the command of the reserve battalion of the 8109th Samaria Brigade. Over the course of a day, the deputy commander of the squadron spent time with the battalion's commanders and fighters, learning up close the combat methods, challenges and threats in the field, and gaining a new perspective on the needs of the ground forces. At the same time, the ground forces commanders were exposed to the depth of the Air Force's operational concept, which contributes to improving operational coordination. The program offers creative solutions to strengthen and deepen air-ground cooperation, drawing lessons from events in the Iron Swords War. 'I arrived at the Samaria Air Force Base to get to know the area and the missions up close, and in the future to better assist soldiers on the ground in any complex event that may develop in the sector,' said the deputy commander of Squadron 109, Major Y. 'The mission of assisting the ground forces has reached a very high level in Gaza and Lebanon, and we will continue to train and practice so that we are effective in all sectors, at all times.' Cooperation between ground forces and air forces has become an indispensable product in the war in various sectors. 'What would have taken hours a few months ago now happens in minutes. The battalion commander in the field knows what he wants to attack, and the target is attacked within minutes,' explains a security source. Operation Iron Wall, for example, began with an opening blow that included air strikes in the heart of the Jenin refugee camp. With the expansion of the operation to Tulkarm, the IDF has continued to use aircraft to attack terrorist cells from the air. In recent years, airstrikes have become a central tool in the West Bank, and are used to thwart fleeing terrorists, prevent attacks, neutralize IEDs, and even strike during ongoing attacks. The Shin Bet and the IDF plan to expand the use of this tool, and over the coming weeks pilots and squadron commanders will stay in various sectors in the West Bank each for 24 hours, in order to improve cooperation with ground forces. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Overnight between Saturday and Sunday, the IDF expanded its activity in the West Bank, alongside the release of Palestinian terrorists as part of the deal to release hostages, and announced the entry of the Bislah Brigade combat team forces into the Palestinian village of Tamun, where IED terrorism has recently begun to develop.

Dramatic footage shows the moment the houses were blown up, and according to the Palestinians, nearly 20 buildings in the Jenin refugee camp were blown up. The operation in Tamun began with a ground maneuver by the forces, with the main focus of the operation being a rapid entry into the village for various purposes of locating, seizing, and entrenching. At the same time, the IDF attacked from the air with an opening strike, followed by the arrival of heavy equipment - excavators and bulldozers - which opened up traffic routes for the ground forces, so that they could begin searching for weapons and arresting suspects. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjp5pm0uyl	2025-02-03T02:19:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rkGag81Tuyx/rkGag81Tuyx_0_204_1280_721_0_small.jpg

The 'Smurfs' who fought for Ofer Calderon's release	Members of cycling group that former hostage was a part of recall their efforts to keep him in their hearts and minds at all times and their short reunion before his arrival at the hospital As former hostage Ofer Calderon arrived at the hospital in Israel, he took a moment to ask the van to stop so he could wave to a group of longtime friends – members of 'The Smurfs' cycling group who had waited 15 months for his return. The group, active for over a decade, dedicated every ride in recent months to his safe return. Unable to stay home at the time of his release, they cycled to the closest point they could reach. 'We're a unique group from all over the country. We've been riding together for 13 years,' said Navit Hermesh, one of the group’s veteran members. 'We meet in small teams and take an annual trip abroad.' Attorney Shai Rave, known as 'Papa Smurf' among the riders, explained: 'During the week, we’re busy with work, but we ride together on Fridays. We have 30–40 members of all ages and we love riding in the Judean Desert, the Gaza border region and the Golan Heights. Our full name is 'The Smurfs: Riders, Reasonable and Mediocre.'' Since the October 7 attack and Calderon's abduction, the group remained focused on that day. 'It's been a troubling time,' Hermesh said. 'The worst part was losing Oren Goldin, the youngest in our group, who was murdered in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. He was the first to leave the gate, leaving behind a wife and twins.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We stay in touch with his family and held a memorial ride for him,' she added. 'When Ofer was kidnapped, it felt like the ground was pulled from under us. We barely rode for six months, focusing instead on keeping his memory alive. Seeing him again felt like our hearts began beating again.' 'We carried signs with Ofer’s name In every ride in Israel and abroad,' Rave added. 'We wrote his name on stones. He was always with us – at work, at home. I have a picture of him in my office. People talk about the families of the victims and hostages, but each of them also has close-knit circles of friends. We felt like Ofer’s family.' 'I had an 'Our heart is held captive' necklace, half of which symbolized Ofer,' Hermesh noted. 'It stayed with me through difficult times and I can't wait to give it to him when we meet.' Calderon was flown to the hospital by the son of a fellow Smurf. 'That’s how we got live updates about his flight,' Hermesh said. 'We planned to meet at a friend's house in Ramat Gan and ride to the hospital. When we arrived at the helipad, the security realized they had no choice but to let us follow the car taking him to the ward. 'When he stepped out of the car, he was only 10 meters away, waving and smiling. I couldn’t hold back — I lay down on the grass. We’re in a completely different place now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skgjll0d1e	2025-02-03T00:51:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rJd311T300yl/rJd311T300yl_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Despite denials, Palestinian Authority is managing Gaza's Rafah C...	Senior officials confirm that Israel has given up its presence at the Rafah crossing, which contributed to delay of the hostage deal; The PA operates the crossing together with international parties, but the government hid this from the public The Rafah crossing has been operating for two days, managed in cooperation with Palestinian Authority officials, contrary to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements. Among the PA officials involved in running the crossing are senior Fatah official who manage it in cooperation with a special European force and with Egyptian security officials who assist in securing the place from Islamist Salafi terrorist elements. Israel is involved for the time being with approving those who cross it, and only in one direction: out of Gaza. Contrary to denials from Netanyahu's office, the official spokesman for the Palestinian Authority police, Louy Izriqat, told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth Sunday that Fares a-Rifi has been appointed to manage the police station at the Rafah Crossing, which opened Sunday. Rifi, a resident of Gaza City, was a police officer in the central governorates of the Gaza Strip on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, and holds a bachelor's degree in law and an advanced degree in police science from the Police College in Yemen. He is considered an active Fatah figure in the Gaza Strip. His brother congratulated him in a post: 'The legitimate Palestinian police are the ones who will control and maintain security at the Rafah crossing under the command of Fares a-Rifi.' The Palestinian force stationed there includes seven policemen and two policewomen, all of whom previously worked on behalf of the PA at the border crossings of the Gaza Strip, and are now returning to work in the same role. The political sensitivity of the issue in Israel is clear to everyone, which is why Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas asked his people not to be interviewed. However, Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth learned that for many weeks now PA officials, in cooperation with Egyptian intelligence, have been in feverish contact with IDF officials, the Civil Administration, the Coordinator of Government Activities, and the Shin Bet in Cairo to prepare the cooperation that led to the opening of the Rafah crossing. The Palestinian Authority began preparations to control the crossing over the past month. The head of the Palestinian Authority's crossings authority Nazmi Mohanna, a resident of Jericho, and the deputy director general of the PA's Ministry of Civil Affairs Ayman Qandil, a Ramallah resident, have been intensively attending meetings with security officials in Egypt in order to open and manage the Rafah crossing. Mahmoud al-Habbash, an adviser to Abbas, said that 'the Rafah crossing will be managed according to the 2005 agreement, that's all.' The 'crossings agreement' concluded between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 2005 stipulates that the Rafah crossing will be managed by the Palestinian Authority, in cooperation with Egypt, and under the supervision of a force from the European Union. According to a senior Palestinian official, the PA was instructed not to mention the new management and procedures at the Rafah crossing so as not to upset Israel. The obstacle to the deal The sensitivity of operating the crossing in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority is twofold, and stems from internal political reasons in Israel. This is one of the internal coalition reasons why the Israeli government and its leader delayed the deal for at least six months, and some argue since the collapse of the previous deal. The first reason: The IDF and security officials have claimed over the past year that there can be no military victory that does not include Israeli rule over all of Gaza, without creating an alternative to Hamas. The professional consensus was that a 'day after' solution must be promoted in the Strip to prevent Hamas rule and that it must include the PA, with international financial and manpower reinforcements. Netanyahu, whether this was his own opinion or fear of the coalition falling apart, claimed that he would not give the Palestinian Authority any foothold, thereby effectively thwarting discussions about the day after. The second reason: As part of the obstacles Netanyahu added to his demands in the deal after the parties were very close to an agreement, he demanded control of the Rafah crossing. 'I and one other minister (Ron Dermer) were the only ones in the war cabinet who prevented the Palestinian Authority from controlling the Rafah Crossing,' he said on one occasion. 'We will not allow the Palestinian Authority to control the Gaza Strip, and we are working to thwart any of its control.' In the hasty press conference he convened in September, after the murder of the six hostages in the Tel a-Sultan tunnel and to explain why he opposed the deal, Netanyahu called the Rafah Crossing and the Philadelphi Corridor 'Hamas' oxygen pipeline,' and declared that Israel would not withdraw from them. The Rafah crossing did not appear to interest Netanyahu until he raised it as one of the obstacles to the deal. On the morning of July 3, intelligence sources estimated that Hamas was going to give a relatively positive answer, though with many more difficulties and insistences. By the evening, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich already knew that 'I would not be surprised if suddenly, after months of refusal, Sinwar responds positively to the offer he received for the deal.' This is to say that everything must be done to prevent the deal, which Israel had proposed. The next day, Sinwar did give the same relatively positive answer that was received by large parts of the negotiating team who thought there was a chance of a breakthrough. Then, suddenly, on July 11, in Netanyahu's speech at the end of an officers' course at the 1st Battalion, nine months after the outbreak of the war, the Israeli presence at the crossing and at Netzarim is mentioned as a condition that Israel will not give up. 'We will not allow weapons smuggling to Hamas from Egypt, first and foremost through Israeli control of the Philadelphia route and the Rafah crossing,' he said. Six months passed, during which many hostages and soldiers died, and a deal was concluded in which Netanyahu withdrew from almost all of the conditions that had sabotaged the previous deal. On January 22, the Arabi-language, London-based Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported that an agreement had been reached on the mechanism for controlling the Rafah crossing - which the IDF took over in May. According to a source in the joint cease-fire monitoring team, 'the parties reached an agreement regarding the management of the crossing on the Palestinian side. It was agreed that it would be managed by the Palestinian Authority, under international supervision and monitoring by the UN.' The Prime Minister's Office denied this: 'The report is not true despite the Palestinian Authority's attempts to create a false impression that it controls the crossing. According to the agreement, IDF forces surround the crossing and no one passes through it without prior control, supervision and approval from the IDF and the Shin Bet.' The statement also said that the 'technical management within the crossing is carried out by non-Hamas Gazans, who are vetted by the Shin Bet, and who have been managing civil services in the Strip since the beginning of the war, such as electricity, water, and sewage. Their work is supervised by the international force EUBAM.' This formulation denies without actually denying the main point and the documents have not been made public. The agreement is vague The appendix to the main agreement states in Article 5 that 'the Rafah Crossing will be ready for the transfer of civilians and wounded after the release of all women (civilians and soldiers). Israel will work to prepare the crossing as soon as possible after the signing of the agreement.' The agreement explicitly states that the forces will only 'redeploy around the Rafah Crossing in accordance with the attached maps.' In other words, the IDF and Israel will not be present at the crossing itself. In addition, it was stated that '50 wounded fighters will be allowed to cross daily, accompanied by three people. Each crossing will require Israeli and Egyptian approval.' It also stated that 'the crossing will be activated in accordance with the discussions that took place with Egypt in August 2024.' The words '50 wounded fighters' refer to 50 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who will leave for Egypt daily, accompanied by three additional people who may also be Hamas members. The agreement stipulates that the lists of those who are to pass, provided by the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry, will be given the day before to Egypt and Israel, who will have to approve them. It is likely that Israel will not let senior Hamas figures leave, but will let everyone else. Fifty Hamas members a day is a lot, even if it is only for the first phase of the cease-fire. At the moment, this is a one-way passage: only from Gaza to Egypt, and not the other way around. Therefore, at least for now, from Israel's perspective a Hamas member who leaves cannot return according to a vague agreement. Israel says that this matter should be discussed as part of the second phase of the deal. It is still unclear how the mediating countries will approach the matter and whether they will also demand the opening of the other direction. The Rafah Crossing was destroyed and burned in the fighting that Israel waged when it entered it in early May. The crossing facilities are unusable, so the mediators, together with the PA, had to bring in several temporary structures to carry out the checks and procedures for leaving Gaza. All of this is happening in the meantime in a way that is hidden from the Israeli public due to political reasons, but as stated in the agreement between Israel and Hamas. But the big question is how long the agreement will last, and whether the parties will be able to reach an agreement on the second phase. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Negotiations regarding the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal are scheduled to begin no later than Sunday, 16 days after the cease-fire came into effect. Senior officials in Israel and the mediating countries expressed serious concern on Sunday that it will blow up. Some fear that in between two weeks and a month Israel will announce that the negotiations - within the framework of which the remaining living hostages are supposed to return and the IDF is supposed to withdraw from the Strip - have run aground and are in fact hopeless because Muhammad Sinwar is making unreasonable demands. These words were echoed over the weekend in a report through channels which says that 'an understanding has formed' in Israel that Hamas will not return the remaining live hostages and therefore Israel will be forced to return to war. Military sources, including those whose work is related to the negotiating team, said that Israel does not have such information. 'Basically, nothing is coming together,' says a senior Israeli official. 'To conclude and finalize the Saudi deal, which will also include an international solution for Gaza and allow Netanyahu to risk dissolving the government, it will take no less than four months. To sign a second phase of the deal in the immediate term, Netanyahu will have to take a risk and take it without all the 'goodies' of a Saudi normalization deal. And that, he will tell Trump, is too big a risk. That's why the deal is destined to explode.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkd00iz0o1l	2025-02-03T00:36:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/B1Je4Ppdyg/B1Je4Ppdyg_0_156_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Musk says shutting down USAID in government efficiency drive	Billionaire Elon Musk, who is heading U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to shrink the federal government, gave an update on the effort early Monday, saying they are working to shut down the U.S. foreign aid agency USAID. Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, discussed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in a Monday social media talk on X, which he also owns. Trump has assigned Musk to lead a federal cost-cutting panel. The conversation, which included former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and Republican Senator Joni Ernst, began with Musk saying they were working to shut down the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 'It's beyond repair,' Musk said, adding that President Trump agrees it should be shut down. USAID is the world's largest single donor. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. disbursed $72 billion of assistance worldwide on everything from women's health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work.

Netanyahu in US as phase 2 hostage release negotiations begin: Th...	From humanitarian aid to the withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor: The prime minister is in Washington and will meet with Mideast envoy Witkoff to begin negotiations for phase two of the deal; Even after the opening of the Rafah crossing and the return of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip, Israel still has leverage in case of future violations by Hamas; This is Netanyahu's schedule for the week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in Washington Sunday night for a week of meetings ahead of the fifth round of hostage releases on Saturday and looking ahead to phase two of the deal. On Monday the prime minister will meet with Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, in what will mark the opening of negotiations for phase two of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Netanyahu's meeting with Trump is scheduled for Tuesday evening (6:00 p.m. in Washington and 1 a.m. in Israel). The meeting was scheduled to take place a few hours earlier, but was postponed at the request of the White House. Sources who work with Witkoff said that watching the feature film about the October 7 massacre while he was in Israel seemed to have had a profound effect on him. He is very involved in the issue of the hostages, and his commitment to the issue is profound. Families of hostages asked to join the prime minister's flight to Washington, but they were refused. Several family members, including Einav Zangauker - the mother of Matan Zangauker - arrived in Washington on commercial flights. Netanyahu is also scheduled to meet with family members of hostages during his visit. On Wednesday, Netanyahu will visit the Pentagon and meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. In addition, Netanyahu will meet with Congressional and Senate leaders, evangelical leaders, and the designated U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, during the week. After, contrary to the agreements, Arbel Yehoud was not released in either of the first two rounds of hostage releases, Israel decided not to open the Netzarim Corridor to allow the movement of Gazans north. After the images of horror from the release of Arbel and Gadi Mozes, in the third round that was brought forward, the release of terrorists from Israeli prisons was delayed and angry messages were sent to the mediators in Israel. The question now is what leverage remains to continue the deal - with 79 hostages still in captivity, and 20 of them scheduled to return during Phase 1 of the deal. Those 20 hostages include 15 men (eight over the age of 50 and seven wounded and sick), the three members of the Bibas family, whose lives are in serious danger, and Avraham Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who have been held captive in Gaza for a decade. Eight of those 20 hostages are no longer alive. Last week, after Hamas's violation of the agreement, preventing the return of the displaced and the updated agreement, Ynet security commentator Ron Ben Yishai wrote that the return of the displaced is not the only significant lever of pressure that Israel has at the present stage. There is the humanitarian aid - the pace of which Israel controls in the Gaza Strip, and if there are blatant violations of the agreement the IDF is still in a position where it can maneuver without difficulty wherever it is needed. After those horrific images in the southern Gaza Strip during the liberation of Arbel and Gadi, Israel sent a harsh message to Qatar and Egypt, announcing that 'it has a great many levers of pressure that it can immediately apply if the scenes are repeated - and not a hair on the head of the hostages will be harmed.' One of the levers of pressure is the Rafah crossing , which opened on Tuesday to allow the exit of wounded Palestinians - most of them from Hamas. Israel could close it in the event of future violations of the agreement. Hamas wanted very much to open the crossing, and this was also one of the reasons that led it to agree to two phases of releasing hostages within 48 hours. In a week, on the 22nd day of the deal, Israel is scheduled to withdraw from the center of the Gaza Strip - including the Netzarim Corridor - eastward to the area along the border. Hamas violations could lead to a change. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another lever of pressure is, of course, the release of the terrorists. For every adult or wounded hostage that Hamas releases Israel will release 30 adult and sick terrorists (who have up to 15 years left in prison). Alongside this, in addition to releasing the terrorists, Israel is also to release 1,000 Gazans who were arrested after the October 7 massacre. Some 111 of them were released on Saturday, and the rest will be released in the following rounds. The agreement stipulates additional clauses, from which Israel may also withdraw - at least partially - in the event of future violations of the agreement. These clauses include: the beginning of the rehabilitation of infrastructure (electricity, water, sewage, communications and roads) throughout the Gaza Strip, and the entry of an agreed amount of equipment necessary for civil defense; facilitating the entry of supplies for the settlement of the displaced - 60,000 caravans and 200,000 tents; and the beginning of the necessary arrangements and plans for the reconstruction of the houses , civilian facilities and civilian infrastructure destroyed during the war in Gaza. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1lefapukg	2025-02-02T20:45:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/H13mrITu1e/H13mrITu1e_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Jewish schools see renewed interest after Hamas massacre, says Ya...	I would say that we see many more people everywhere going to Jewish schools, Jewish synagogues, and community spaces than ever before' The October 7 Hamas massacre brought many Jews closer to their faith, according to Chaya Yosovich, CEO of the Yael Foundation. In an interview with ILTV News, she explained how, following the attack, the Yael Foundation—which funds groundbreaking programs ranging from innovative curricula to educator training and scholarships—took swift action. Within three days, the organization ensured that all its programs had the necessary security measures in place to keep children and families safe. At the same time, while some parents chose not to send their children to Jewish schools out of fear for their safety, many others reconnected with their faith and community. 'I would say that we see many more people everywhere going to Jewish schools, Jewish synagogues, and community spaces than ever before,' Yosovich said. 'They do feel closer.

Will the U.S. take the lead in a future attack against Iran?	ILTV Executive Editor Maayan Hoffman says it is 'unlikely' that America will launch an attack against the Islamic regime Will the U.S. take the lead in a future attack against Iran? This is a question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will likely ask U.S. President Donald Trump during their meeting on Tuesday. However, according to ILTV Executive Editor Maayan Hoffman, it is 'unlikely' that America will launch an attack against the Islamic regime. 'In Trump's inauguration speech, he made it very clear that he wants to be a unifier and a pacifier. He said he wants to be remembered for the wars that America did not enter,' Hoffman explained. 'On the other hand, Trump approved the big bunker busters, the large bombs that Israel would need in order to carry out such an attack.' She said part of the discussion on Iran will need to focus on the timeline. How will Israel and the U.S. coordinate? If Israel is going to attack Iran, should it target nuclear facilities? Should it go after energy infrastructure, such as oil facilities? Or will Israel wait until the U.S. reimposes a series of sanctions against the Iranian regime, potentially empowering the people to rise up and overthrow it?

What happened to the hostages during more than 480 days of captiv...	The testimonies of the freed hostages so far are harrowing—ranging from prolonged isolation to immense physical and psychological abuse Four male hostages are officially home after their release on Saturday. The testimonies of the freed hostages so far are harrowing—ranging from prolonged isolation to immense physical and psychological abuse. Each hostage has their own story, experiences, and traumas. Ofer Calderon, Keith Siegel, and Yarden Bibas are the latest hostages to return home after more than 484 days in Hamas captivity. While all three men miraculously walked out of Gaza on their own two feet, their time in captivity tells a much darker story. According to Israeli media reports, all three men were held in harsh conditions, frequently moved to different locations, and had little food. Keith Siegel, 65, is the first American-Israeli hostage to be released in this deal. Kidnapped from Kfar Aza, reports indicate that Siegel was held in Gaza City with other hostages. He was occasionally kept in tunnels but spent most of his time locked in rooms inside various homes to avoid detection. With barely any food, Siegel—who is a vegetarian—was forced to eat meat to survive. Hamas released a propaganda video of Siegel last April. Reports state that Bibas and Calderon were held together at the beginning of their captivity, brutally beaten by terrorists, locked in cages, and subjected to both physical and psychological abuse. The men say they were held underground and in buildings, frequently relocated, and at times held with other hostages. At the time of Calderon’s release, Hamas dressed him in military clothing, treating him as if he were a reservist soldier. Yarden Bibas, 36, was taken from Nir Oz. He walked out of Hamas captivity without his wife, Shiri, and their two young children, Kfir and Ariel, who remain hostages. According to the framework of the deal, they were supposed to be released on the first day of the agreement, but they remain in captivity. Bibas said he was constantly relocated in Khan Younis and even learned Arabic. According to reports, he endured horrific psychological abuse, including being forced to make a video claiming his wife and children were killed in an IDF airstrike in November 2023. He said his captors constantly spoke about them to torment him. New details have also emerged about released hostage Gadi Moses, who was held alone for his entire 15 months in captivity. He reported that every five days, he was given a single bowl of water and a cup to shower. He lost 15 kilograms during his time in captivity. The five Thai nationals released said they were held in underground tunnels, where they struggled to breathe and were not always given food. Meanwhile, the mother of Emily Damari, who was freed in the first hostage release of this deal, revealed that her daughter was held in UNRWA facilities, where her captors refused to provide her with medical treatment. Damari lost two fingers in captivity after being shot on October 7. The Bibas family released a statement saying that 'a quarter of their heart' has returned home after 15 months, as Yarden comes back to an unbearable reality. They continue to call for the release of Shiri and the children.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1c00pstoyg	2025-02-02T17:24:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/B1yuXpj00yl/B1yuXpj00yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
State witness against Netanyahu files $1.6M lawsuit over alleged ...	Disturbing details: Shlomo Filber alleges severe abuse, including sexual assault and humiliation, during his detention and interrogation, claiming a coerced confession; The state's witness against Netanyahu is also suing over unlawful use of spyware on his phone Shlomo Filber, the state witness in the case against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday filed a lawsuit against senior officials in the law enforcement system. In the lawsuit, he claimed he endured 'abuse and humiliation' during the investigation. The following details might prove disturbing. Filber alleges that he was sexually assaulted during a search of his private areas conducted by a prison officer. The lawsuit, in which he demands over $1.6 million in compensation, was filed against several individuals, including former Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, former State Attorney Shai Nitzan, Deputy State Attorney Liat Ben-Ari, and the prosecutor in the case, Yehudit Tirosh. Filber’s attorneys detailed in the lawsuit: 'During his arrest and interrogation, particularly in the stages leading up to his signing of the state witness agreement, the defendants subjected Filber to seven circles of hell in a severe campaign of abuse. This culminated in a brutal act of sodomy committed by a prison officer at Hadarim Prison the night before he signed the agreement.' According to Filber's lawsuit, the assault, which he also testified about during Netanyahu’s trial, was 'the result of premeditated planning and was deliberately carried out with the involvement of all the defendants, aiming to crush his dignity, humiliate him, and break his spirit.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Filber’s attorneys further argue that the alleged abuse and the humiliating search 'led to the confessions extracted from him and caused him to sign the state witness agreement while in a completely unstable mental state.' They claimed that, during the search, 'he was ordered to completely undress as part of his admission to Hadarim Prison as a detainee. During this process, his naked body was groped by a prison officer, who then committed a brutal act of sodomy against him.' In July of last year, Filber filed a lawsuit for approximately $130,000 against the state and police, alleging invasion of privacy and violation of personal space in the spyware affair. The lawsuit stated: 'Police conducted a covert criminal investigation against Filber, during which they infiltrated his mobile phone using spyware.' Filber and his wife also sued the state, claiming the police used spyware to extract information from both his and his wife’s mobile phones. 'Under the guise of a wiretapping warrant, but in blatant and severe violation of that warrant and in clear breach of the law, the investigating unit used a hacking tool known as ‘The System’ (publicly identified as Pegasus spyware) to infiltrate Filber’s mobile phone and extract a significant amount of personal and private information,' according to the lawsuit. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1xkyd6ojl	2025-02-02T13:59:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/06/29/ryVmZyOFcc/ryVmZyOFcc_0_23_2784_1568_0_small.jpg

Australia on Monday imposed sanctions on extreme right-wing online network 'Terrorgram' as part of its efforts to combat a rise in antisemitism and online extremism, and after similar moves by Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the government's move would make it a criminal offense to engage with 'Terrorgram' and it would also help prevent children from becoming caught up in far-right extremism. 'Terrorgram is an online network that promotes white supremacy and racially-motivated violence,' Wong said in a statement. 'It is the first time any Australian Government has imposed counterterrorism financing sanctions on an entity based entirely online.' Offenders will face up to 10 years in jail and heavy fines, she said. The Australian government has also re-listed and hit other right-wing groups with sanctions including the National Socialist Order, the Russian Imperial Movement, Sonnenkrieg Division and The Base for counterterrorism financing sanctions, Wong said.

Damari returned to the house in Kfar Aza where she was kidnapped and posted on Instagram: 'I came back to my home, to the oxygen I nearly lost, to the place where my nightmares began 485 days ago – and I've closed only part of the circle I longed to complete' On a sofa bearing the sign 'From this home, Emily Tehila Damari was kidnapped,' the freed hostage, who returned to her home in Kfar Aza for the first time, posted on Instagram: 'I'm Back.' Accompanying her on the visit was freed hostage Romi Gonen, who later replied on Instagram: 'My sister from captivity.' Liekwise, IDF field observer Liri Albag, who was released after them wrote in response: 'We will fight for everyone through fire and water.' 'Today I returned to my home, to my apartment, to the oxygen I had that was nearly gone. I returned to the place where all my nightmares began, 485 days ago, and I have closed only part of the circle that I so longed to close,' Damari wrote, adding: 'Like me, there are 79 other hostages who need to complete the circle and are waiting to fill the missing pieces. We must not stop here; we must bring everyone back home – life for the survivors and honor for the fallen. I will feel my true victory only when they all return.' Tom, Emily’s brother, posted an Instagram photo of his sister with Romi Gonen during their visit to Kfar Aza, with a picture of Aviv Baram – a close friend of Emily’s killed on Oct. 7 – visible in the background. 'Emily came today to close a circle – to conquer her personal victory and return to the place where she was kidnapped by the monsters of Hamas. She returned there with her family and accompanied by someone who joined our family and became an inseparable part of it, Romi Gonen. Romi and Emily became one, and it’s so amazing to see,' he wrote. 'Their unspoken understanding, eye to eye – sometimes without uttering a word. There was a moment during this complicated day when my heart truly clenched. Emily and Romi sat on a bench beneath the olive trees by the arms depot, with Aviv Baram’s picture in front of them,' he continued, adding: 'This moment was so complete, yet at the same time so empty. That’s exactly how the prisoner swap agreement feels. It is a great joy to see our captives returning, and a sick feeling in my stomach to see buses of lowly murderers being released. I am so sorry for what you are going through and for the unimaginable loss; I truly hope that as a people we become worthy of them and of you.' Emily, a British citizen, was freed from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip during the first phase of the current swap along with Rumi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher. Immediately upon her release, she became a symbol of bravery after pushing one of the Hamas terrorists out of the vehicle that brought her to the Red Cross pickup point – and during a phone call, she shared a striking victory image with her brother by showing him her severed fingers. Until her release, Emily was the only British citizen held in Gaza and no sign of life was offered during her captivity. On the morning of Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists stormed her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, killed her dog and kidnapped her from the kibbutz young generation neighborhood. Her mother, Mandy, also hid when terrorists broke into their home — and survived after a bullet struck the door lock of the room where she was hiding, jamming it so the terrorists could not enter. About a week and a half before Emily’s release, her mother pleaded, 'Emily, Lolo, if somehow you can hear me, know that we all love you here to the moon and back. Not a second goes by without us thinking of you, praying for you, fighting so you can return home alive.' On Friday, Mandy revealed that her daughter was held at a facility run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. She said she spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, thanked him for his support and assistance, and added that 'Hamas held Emily at UNRWA facilities and denied her access to medical treatment after she was shot twice.' 'It’s a miracle that she survived.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjuyhlau1e	2025-02-02T13:35:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rkdphm6Oke/rkdphm6Oke_0_308_1123_632_0_small.jpg
North Korea criticizes Rubio, says it will respond strongly to US...	North Korea on Monday criticized U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a 'rogue state' in a media interview, saying his comments do not help U.S. interests, state media KCNA said. North Korea's foreign ministry said the country will respond strongly to hostile U.S. provocations, KCNA reported. It is North Korea's first criticism of the Trump administration since President Donald Trump reentered the White House on Jan. 20, Yonhap news agency said. The ministry also condemned United States' new missile defense shield plan, saying that it makes it necessary for North Korea to strengthen its own military power, KCNA reported. Trump last week signed an order that 'mandated a process to develop an 'American Iron Dome,'' a next-generation U.S. missile defense shield against ballistic, hypersonic, cruise missile and other forms of aerial attack.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1rx2paojg	2025-02-02T13:06:34-08:00	
Incoming IDF Chief of Staff: '2025 will continue to be a year of ...	Eyal Zamir, set to become the 24th IDF chief of staff, said Israeli will produce its own weapons and emphasized the need to reduce reliance on foreign arms; He faces major challenges, including Gaza, Iran and integration of ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military The day after his appointment as the next IDF Chief of Staff, Major General (Res.) Eyal Zamir, currently the director general of the Ministry of Defense, delivered his first speech following the announcement of his selection as the intended successor to Herzi Halevi. Despite cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon, 'the year 2025 will continue to be a year of combat,' said Zamir during the Ministry of Defense’s work plan conference. 'The war has proven that we must only rely on ourselves,' said Zamir, who is expected to assume the role of Chief of Staff on March 6. 'We were all raised on the principle that 'The State of Israel will defend itself by itself.' Now, I am telling you that Israel will also produce its own weapons independently, in the face of any threat or scenario. During the war, we restarted production lines that had been shut down, expanded existing production lines, and established new manufacturing capabilities. Reducing our dependence on the world benefits security, the economy and industry. This will also prove itself in defense exports.' The incoming IDF chief of staff added: 'We are in a global arms race – a technological race. In our region, there is no room for mercy. Our neighbors, from Iran to Gaza, from Yemen to Beirut and Damascus, misjudge us. The people of Israel and the IDF are strong. During moments of crisis, a fighting spirit emerges in our people. We must salute the IDF, its soldiers, and its commanders. They saved the State of Israel. The Ministry of Defense provided the IDF with the tools, support and safety net needed to complete its mission. 'During the war, the IDF rose from the depths. Enemies on all fronts were defeated, and their leaders are now buried beneath the rubble. But the campaign is not over, and challenges remain ahead. We must remember the heavy price we paid in lives lost and wounded. The year 2025 will continue to be a year of combat. The Ministry of Defense must continue to build strength and support IDF needs and national security missions.' 'In the coming days, I will conclude my role as director general of the Ministry of Defense,' Zamir said. 'I feel that I am leaving behind a strong, leading and powerful ministry that is focused on its primary mission, which I defined during the second day of the war – providing the military and the defense establishment with the breathing room they need.' He also expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to lead the IDF. 'I want to thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz for their trust in selecting me as the 24th IDF chief of staff,' he said. 'We will show our enemies that they face a determined, powerful, and victorious force, as it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'I will pursue my enemies and overtake them, and I will not turn back until they are destroyed.'' From tank commander to chief of staff Zamir’s appointment as chief of staff still requires approval from the Advisory Committee for Senior Appointments, and final government approval. Assuming these are secured, Zamir, who was already considered the leading candidate, is expected to assume his role next month, following the resignation of outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. With this appointment, Zamir will become the first tank officer to serve as Chief of Staff since David (Dado) Elazar in the 1970s. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Upon entering his new role, Zamir will face significant challenges alongside ongoing combat efforts. These include appointing a new Deputy Chief of Staff and a new commander for the Southern Command to replace Major General Yaron Finkelman, who has retired. Additionally, Zamir will need to oversee the integration of ultra-Orthodox Jews into the IDF, the potential military dismantling of Hamas in Gaza (if the war resumes), and possibly an unprecedented operation in Iran, with U.S. assistance. For quite a while, Zamir has been regarded as the leading candidate to succeed Halevi due to his experience, authority and professionalism, particularly his stance against downsizing the military. Having served for 38 years in various combat and senior command roles, Zamir at 59 will be the oldest chief of staff in IDF history. For comparison, Gadi Eizenkot and Dan Halutz concluded their terms at age 58. Among the roles he has held in the IDF, Zamir served as commander of the Southern Command. In his most recent position, from 2018 to 2021, he was deputy chief of staff under Aviv Kochavi. During this time, he oversaw the implementation of the multi-year Momentum plan and managed all military support for the civilian sector during the COVID-19 pandemic and Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. Before serving as deputy chief of wtaff, Zamir was the military secretary to the prime minister and also served as the chief of staff for the Ground Forces Command. Over the past year, Zamir has been heavily involved in building military capabilities and has maintained excellent relations with the Americans. Among other responsibilities, he oversaw unprecedented arms acquisitions from the United States, including deals for fighter jets and munitions, as well as expanded local production within Israel’s defense industries. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydw2s6001e	2025-02-02T12:58:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BJALMXpdyx/BJALMXpdyx_119_107_932_525_0_small.jpg

Iran secretly building nuclear weapons able to reach Europe based...	National Council of Resistance of Iran reports Tehran is covertly expanding its nuclear weapons program – with a missile range of 1,800 miles – using North Korean designs at facilities disguised as satellite launch sites Iran has allegedly been covertly developing nuclear weapons with a 1,800‑mile range that could reach Europe using North Korean designs, according to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). The Telegraph in Britain reported Sunday that details provided by the NCRI indicate that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is expanding its warhead program at two sites disguised as communication satellite launch facilities. The facilities, controlled by Iran’s nuclear weapons division – the Organisation for Advanced Defence Research (SPND) – are reportedly expediting missile production. Soona Samsami, a U.S. representative of the NCRI, told The Telegraph: 'For over two decades, they have used negotiations and the West's leniency as a means to advance their nuclear weapons program, threatening global peace and stability. Tehran has never been as weak and vulnerable as it is today. The desperate Iranian regime is thus speeding up the development of nuclear weapons. Now is the time to hold the regime accountable for internal killings, regional warmongering and nuclear weapons development.' According to the report, the first warhead base is located about 22 miles from the Iranian city of Shahrud. Experts from the SPND and the IRGC Aerospace Force have been working on a nuclear missile integrated into a Ghaem-100 rocket, capable of traveling 1,800 miles. This range would put targets in Europe –including Greece –and Israel within reach. The Telegraph noted that three rocket launches have already been successfully carried out, with tests for the more advanced Ghaem-105 rocket slated for the coming months. Past tests were masked as satellite launches to obscure their true purpose. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Satellite imagery reportedly shows a concrete platform used in the experiments, with nearby buildings believed to support related research. Another site, about 43 miles southeast of the city of Semnan, is said to be producing Simorgh missiles inspired by North Korean designs, similar to the 18‑meter-tall UNHA‑1 rocket. Much of the work at this site is conducted underground to evade intelligence surveillance, with six new constructions added since 2005. To further conceal the work, the regime has named the facility the Imam Khomeini site, ostensibly an homage to its space governing body, while it is reportedly being used for warhead tests. Images distributed by the NCRI showed extensive ground excavation in the northeastern part of the base in 2019, with concrete foundations installed afterward, while older photos revealed the structure covered in dirt. The NCRI claims that SPND experts have observed an increase in subterranean explosions linked to missile production. Although the press was once allowed on site – where IRGC soldiers in civilian clothing were seen – only a few photos were released, taken by regime workers. Security at both facilities is stringent. Workers arrive in private vehicles from surrounding cities, including Tehran, and are taken by bus from a checkpoint several miles from the main site by IRGC personnel as an additional security measure. Iran's Deputy Minister of Communications and Information Technology and head of the Iranian Space Organization, Hassan Salaria, said last week that Tehran would unveil a number of Iranian satellites and noted that 'by the end of the current Iranian year' two more important satellites would be launched (the Iranian year ends in March, according to the IRNA news agency). He said that Iran has so far launched 24 to 25 satellites into space of various categories. 'Currently, we are designing and building satellites that can operate with an imaging accuracy of up to about two meters, and this process is gradual,' he explained. The Iranian Space Agency on Sunday announced that during a ceremony marking National Space Technology Day, three satellites were unveiled: Nabouk 1, Fars 2, and an improved version of Fars 1. At the same time, as part of the 'Achievements of the Iranian Ministry of Defense' exhibition, and in the presence of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, the Atmad ballistic missile, which has a range of 1,700 kilometers, was unveiled on Sunday. The Iranian president said during the visit: 'Our defense capabilities are so advanced that they do not allow any country to attack Iran.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkmumsaukg	2025-02-02T12:03:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/SkGrpWTdkx/SkGrpWTdkx_0_266_2550_1435_0_small.jpg

With Trump back in White House, Saudi Arabia looks to be major pl...	Saudi Arabia hopes a stronger bond with the US will solidify its influence in the Middle East despite the challenges posed by its controversial standing in the region Now that President Donald Trump is back in the White House, Saudi Arabia hopes to play a greater role in the Middle East. The Gulf nation's leaders aim to restore its glory after four years of tense relations with the administration of former President Joe Biden. Soon after Trump took office, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud announced the kingdom’s intention to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over four years. That figure is higher than the $450 billion Saudi Arabia committed to investing in 2017. Trump told the media he would pressure Saudi Arabia to raise the intended investment to $1 trillion. Saudi Arabia may take him up on that offer if it means obtaining a green light from the U.S. regarding its intended geopolitical strategy. Analysts say Riyadh sees investing in the U.S. as a double opportunity, leading to both economic prosperity and unlimited support from the Trump administration. 'The deals that Saudi Arabia concludes with the United States are deals that benefit both countries,' according to Saudi political analyst Faisal Al-Kaam. 'The previous deal, which was concluded in 2017, led to the transfer of technology to Saudi Arabia and the issuance of special models of the famous F-15 fighter jet, which means that Saudi Arabia also benefited.' Al-Kaam rejected the notion that the investment was a form of tribute to be paid to the U.S. 'This economic and political relationship is long-standing, and the two countries continue to support each other,' he said. 'It is true that during President Joe Biden’s term, the relationship was a little tense, but it quickly returned to normal.' 'Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East regarding influence, size, and economy. It is now the fastest growing among the G20, and it is influential in all decisions in the region,' Al-Kaam continued, highlighting the mutual benefit resulting from a partnership between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Al-Kaam described cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. as 'a simple equation,' but some critics are more skeptical. 'The truth is that Saudi Arabia is paying bribes to the Donald Trump administration to keep them in power,' said Iraqi political analyst Haider Shaheen. 'Otherwise, he will impose sanctions on them or at least marginalize them.' Shaheen said that Saudi Arabia expects its investments to result in the U.S. suppressing those who oppose the kingdom, including the Houthis and the Iranian regime, 'in addition to keeping quiet about Saudi Arabia’s serious violations in the areas of human rights.' Saudi ties with Israel After nearly a year and a half of war, a cease-fire was declared earlier this month between Israel and Hamas. That deal brought conversations about establishing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia back to the surface. Trump has made it clear that he hopes to see the two countries establish ties. In his last term, his administration brokered the Abraham Accords, which established relations between Israel and four Arab nations. Saudi officials have consistently said that the kingdom will not establish peace with Israel until a Palestinian state is declared with East Jerusalem as its capital. 'Various U.S. administrations have tried to pressure Saudi Arabia to start relations with Israel, and the answer has always been that there must be a recognized Palestinian state, and then there will be Saudi-Israeli relations,' said former Saudi diplomat Hassan Barqi. 'This is the opinion that Saudi Arabia says, in secret and in public.' Barqi said that Saudi Arabia would stand firm on this condition, regardless of the October 7 attacks and Trump’s declared intention to resettle Palestinians in other countries. 'Now things are easier. Most of the Hamas leaders have been assassinated, Hamas has lost its power, and it may be easy to establish a Palestinian state according to the conditions of the international community. And there are more countries in the world that recognize Palestine as a state,' Barqi said. 'This is what paves the way for the establishment of a Palestinian state, and President Donald Trump has been convinced of this idea from the beginning.' On the other hand, Aisha Al-Sayed, an Egyptian journalist, dismissed Saudi Arabia’s conditions for normalization with Israel as 'a thing of the past.' 'Saudi Arabia sees that it does not benefit from the Palestinian issue, and its priorities have changed. It only looks at economic and social interests and the desire for development,' Al-Sayed said. 'As for fixed issues such as the Palestinian issue, it will not continue to defend them, and it will sign a peace agreement with Israel within the next four years.' Tense role in the Middle East Saudi Arabia’s relations with fellow Middle Eastern and Arab countries have caused controversy in recent years. When King Salman came to power in 2015, Saudi Arabia changed its regional strategy. Two months after Salman was crowned, Saudi Arabia declared war on the Houthis in Yemen. In 2022, after years of devastating fighting, Saudi Arabia recognized that it had failed to impose control over the Houthis and decided to appease the group. Saudi Arabia also signed a reconciliation agreement with Iran despite years of cold war between the two countries. During the long Saudi-Iranian conflict, a 'fifth column' of Iran-affiliated militias targeted Saudi interests several times, striking numerous military, oil and civilian targets in Saudi Arabia with thousands of ballistic missiles. Relations between Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates deteriorated after Riyadh made several economic decisions that harmed the interests of neighboring countries. Saudi Arabia banned companies without regional headquarters from working on government contracts, which led many companies to withdraw. The kingdom also significantly increased import tariffs from fellow Gulf countries, fanning tensions. For years, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been in conflict, with Saudi Arabia attempting to exert power over its neighbor to the east. In 2017, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt, led by Saudi Arabia, all simultaneously cut off ties with Qatar. Less than four years later, the two countries reached an agreement that did not involve any of the concessions from Qatar that Saudi Arabia had insisted upon. Saudi Arabia failed to resolve the civil war in Sudan, and even after normalizing relations with Bashir Assad’s Syria, it was unable to protect the Syrian leader. Turkey managed to impose Ahmed al-Sharaa, head of the Turkish-aligned Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham group, as the new leader of Syria, and Saudi Arabia was forced to accept the fall of the Assad regime. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Having faced numerous regional challenges, Saudi Arabia is now working to expand its influence through economic interests. The kingdom has signed many economic agreements with Iraq, which is ruled by parties loyal to Iran. It also has economic agreements with Egypt and Oman. Upcoming agreements are expected with Lebanon and perhaps Syria. Saudi Arabia’s influence on African countries remains comparatively weak. 'Saudi Arabia may not appear in the picture, but it is working to solve the region’s problems through its extensive international relations, and this is the secret,' according to Mamdouh Al-Kharif, a Saudi political analyst. 'Its steps are taken in secret to solve the region’s problems and not increase them.' Al-Kharif said that many of the kingdom’s regional strategies will take a long time to come to fruition. 'Gulf relations are witnessing significant growth. There are no fundamental differences, but rather a redrawing of the relationship to be better and sustainable for the future, and so that the differences do not return,' he said. 'As for Saudi Arabia’s relationship with the Arab countries, it is for the growth of this region again and for it to be in a better economic state.' While asserting that 'compatibility' between Trump and the Saudi leadership would lead to the resolution of many issues in the Middle East, Al-Kharif insisted that Saudi Arabia’s role in the region is independent of the US. 'The change in the US administration has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia’s influence, as it had influence even under the administration of former President Joe Biden,' he said. 'Saudi Arabia does not rely on anyone for its influence, but rather on its internal strength, its great diplomacy and its extensive relations.'

Date set for Hassan Nasrallah's funeral, 5 months after assassina...	Hezbollah announces Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral will take place in three weeks, alongside his assassinated successor Hashem Safeddine; Amid internal criticism and weakening influence in Lebanon, the group faces scrutiny as it tries to maintain political power under mounting external and internal pressure The funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the former secretary-general of Hezbollah who was assassinated in September, will take place in three weeks. This announcement was made on Sunday by Hezbollah’s current Secretary-General Naim Qassem during a speech broadcast throughout the country. Alongside Nasrallah, Hashem Safieddine, who was considered a potential successor to Nasrallah but was assassinated a week later, will also be buried. Qassem urged supporters 'not to fire into the air' during the funeral. The slogan for Nasrallah’s funeral, according to Qassem, will be: 'We are committed to the alliance.' Qassem accused Israel of violating the cease-fire and stated that Lebanon must act against it. 'The state of Lebanon is responsible for monitoring and demanding that the countries sponsoring the agreement ensure the enemy’s commitment to the cease-fire,' he said, adding: 'This is not just about violations but also about attacks. The state of Lebanon must act forcefully.' Regarding Hezbollah’s activities, Qassem justified the continuation of the fighting. 'Resistance is a path and a choice,' he said. 'We act according to our assessment at the appropriate time.' He also criticized Washington. 'Since the U.S. considers itself a sponsor, there must be pressure on it to adhere to the agreement,' he said. Qassem claimed there is an international campaign aimed at undermining Hezbollah’s position. 'There is a campaign against us, backed by the U.S., Israel and foreign states, accompanied by internal support, promoting defeat,' he said. He attempted to frame the fighting balance as positive for his organization, adding: 'We did not speak of total victory; this is a battle with gains and losses. Our people understand they won in some areas and lost in others. We speak of a victory tied to resilience, halting the Israeli invasion, and the enemy’s inability to eliminate the resistance.' Announcement of Nasrallah’s funeral date Hezbollah has faced significant internal criticism recently. After the 60-day cease-fire period expired, motorcycle convoys from the organization took to the streets to celebrate 'victory in the war.' They waved Hezbollah flags and chanted slogans in support of the group. This display was poorly received by the Lebanese public. The Amal Movement in Lebanon even prohibited its supporters from participating in the motorcycle convoys. On Friday, another incident occurred involving a Hezbollah motorcycle convoy when a young man struck Hezbollah motorcyclists participating in a funeral procession near the village of Sarafand, close to Sidon. Lebanon’s Al-Jadeed channel reported that it was unclear whether the act was intentional. Footage of the incident was widely shared on social media. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hezbollah’s weakened position within Lebanon has limited its ability to provoke, particularly as it seeks to maintain its political power during the formation of the new government. Lebanon’s new president, Joseph Aoun, and its prime minister-designate, Nawaf Salam, were not Hezbollah’s preferred candidates. All eyes in Lebanon are now on the organization, with some blaming it for the destruction of southern villages and its participation in the war for external motives. Qassem emphasized Hezbollah would continue its path and would not succumb to external pressures. 'The popular liberation is intertwined with the armed resistance and the Lebanese army. In southern Lebanon, they say there is no possibility for Israel to remain and occupy the area,' he said. 'Let everyone know that sacrifices will lead to the liberation of the land. Those with principles do not surrender under pressure,' he declared. Since the strike in Beirut’s Dahieh neighborhood, where Nasrallah was assassinated, the site has become a pilgrimage destination. The location, which served as Hezbollah’s central command, remains a disaster zone and has yet to be rebuilt. Despite the destruction, Hezbollah supporters continue to hold events at the site, with many visiting daily. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjv1cepdkx	2025-02-02T10:59:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/06/HkzHdEad11kg/HkzHdEad11kg_0_0_2200_1513_0_small.jpg
Trump invites King Abdullah of Jordan to formal White House visit	King Abdullah will meet with President Trump on Feb. 11, a week after he meets with Netanyahu; Trump’s controversial Gaza relocation plan faces strong opposition from Jordan, Egypt and other Arab nations, who reject displacing Palestinians as a solution to Gaza’s crisis Jordan’s King Abdullah II has received an invitation to meet with President Donald Trump on February 11. The announcement of the invitation coincided with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s departure for Washington aboard the government-owned Wing of Zion plane for his official visit. Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump on Tuesday. In recent days, President Trump has reiterated his proposal for neighboring countries of Israel, specifically Egypt and Jordan, to absorb residents of the Gaza Strip as part of his 'relocation' plan for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians. Both Cairo and Amman have rejected the idea, but Trump remains adamant: 'They will do it. We do a lot for them – they will do this.' Trump first raised the proposal last week following the second round of hostage releases of the first phase of the hostage deal. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, he described Gaza as a 'massive demolition site' and argued that rebuilding it would require relocating its residents to Jordan or Egypt. He suggested this could serve as a long-term solution rather than just a temporary measure. 'This involves moving 1.5 million people and simply clearing out the entire place,' Trump said. So far, despite early support for the idea among Israeli right-wing factions, strong opposition from Palestinians, as well as from Jordan and Egypt, has made the plan appear unfeasible. It is also unclear how seriously Trump intends to pursue the proposal, as even one of his closest allies, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, has expressed significant doubts about its viability. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On Saturday, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League issued a joint statement opposing Trump’s push for the migration of Palestinians out of Gaza to neighboring countries – a proposal he has repeatedly mentioned over the past week. 'We emphasize that we reject the idea of displacing Palestinians from their land for any reason,' the statement read. It was released following a meeting in Cairo between foreign ministers of several nations and Hussein al-Sheikh, secretary-general of the PLO Executive Committee. The joint statement also expressed the countries’ willingness to work with the Trump administration 'to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, based on a two-state solution.' The representatives said they discussed efforts to support the Palestinian cause and maintain the cease-fire in Gaza. Among the issues raised was the 'mechanism' that would enable the Palestinian Authority to carry out its responsibilities in Gaza. Meanwhile, Qatar’s Al-Araby Al-Jadeed newspaper reported on Sunday, citing an unnamed diplomatic source, that 'Egypt’s task in confronting Trump’s plan will not be easy unless it receives Arab support, given Trump’s insistence on advancing his proposal.' The report also revealed that a senior Trump administration official visited Cairo last week to hold discussions about the plan. According to the report from Doha, Egyptian officials who met with the American representative expressed Cairo’s concerns and warned of potential consequences if Trump’s plan is implemented. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byxs37p00jx	2025-02-02T10:48:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2018/06/25/8617894/8617894_0_0_1300_866_0_small.jpg

As Israel releases hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, debate rene...	Israel’s recent deal with Hamas, which releases hundreds of Palestinian prisoners - including convicted murderers - in exchange for Israeli hostages, has sparked controversy and renewed calls for capital punishment for terrorists amid fears of further attacks Israel has begun releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in recent weeks as part of a cease-fire deal with the Hamas terrorist organization. The scenes of jubilant prisoners receiving a hero’s welcome in Palestinian cities and towns have been received with mixed feelings by Israelis. On the one hand, Israeli hostages being held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, are also being released, but on the other hand, some of the prisoners have been sentenced to life for murdering Israelis, many of them vowing to continue to operate against Israel. The war and the deal between Hamas and Israel have rekindled a debate in the country about the death penalty for terrorists. Throughout the years, there have been several attempts to legislate a bill that would allow capital punishment for terrorist acts, including those committed in the West Bank, which Israel has control over since 1967 under a different legal system. Military law, which is applied to Palestinians in the West Bank, allows the death penalty for convicted murderers. It has never been used as prosecutors have never requested it. The current law in Israel allows for the death penalty on a narrow range of crimes, namely treason, genocide, crimes against humanity and crimes against the Jewish people during wartime. Those in favor of a wider use of capital punishment believe the persistence of terrorist attacks in recent decades can also partly be attributed to the avoidance of using the ultimate punishment. The death penalty was used in Israel twice throughout its history – against a Jew who was accused of treason only to be posthumously exonerated and against Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1962. 'Ideologically, the death penalty has not been handed out because there is no rehabilitation aspect to the punishment,' according to former Magistrate Court Judge Haran Feinstein. Legal experts in the country are divided on whether a specific law mandating capital punishment for terrorist acts would be without petitions to the Supreme Court. Public opinion in Israel is largely favorable toward using the death penalty for convicted terrorists. Some see it as a deterrent against future attacks, especially those intended to stop the kidnapping of Israelis in order to free Palestinian prisoners. There is also frustration among Israelis that their taxes are paying for lengthy prison sentences for Palestinians, including funding university degrees and advanced health care. 'When it will be clear to the murderers that they will be sentenced to death, they will think twice,' right-wing Israeli Knesset member Limor Son Har Melech said. 'Thousands of prisoners in Israeli jails now prove that the current deal proves that, if there was capital punishment, we wouldn’t have to face such embarrassing and disgraceful deals in which murderers of Jews are released.' Son Har Melech herself is a victim of a terrorist attack in 2003, during which her husband was murdered, and she was critically wounded. 'My husband’s murderer was sentenced to seven life sentences, and during the trial he said the sentence had no meaning to him, knowing he will be released,' she added. Khaled Najar was later released as part of a deal in which Israel released over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in return for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was taken into captivity by Hamas in 2011. Najar resumed his terrorist activities, killing more Israelis. Israeli soldiers killed him in Rafah during the latest war. 'There is fear and aversion among Israel’s leadership from the legislation of a death penalty law,' said Son Har Melech. 'Attempts to legislate such a law at the beginning of the war, when it was very clear to everyone that this needs to be corrected, the relatives of the hostages raised objections and even those in favor of the law got cold feet.' Families of hostages voiced their concern that instating the death penalty in the midst of the war, while Israeli hostages are at the mercy of Hamas captors, would lead to their execution. Some begged Knesset members to shoot down any proposals. According to Feinstein, also an adjunct lecturer at the Department of Criminology at Bar Ilan University, the current law allows for the death penalty but is not used only for ideological reasons by which modern countries do not employ capital punishment, barring a few states in the United States. 'When facing terrorists, there is concern that Israelis captured by them will be executed if Israel will employ the death penalty,' Feinstein said. 'Therefore, Israel shouldn’t use capital punishment because its enemies will abuse this.' 'I feel the contrary is true; capital punishment could be used as leverage that they will not have prisoners to release in return for our hostages,' Son Har Melech explained. 'This, of course, needs to be one part of the leverage against Hamas, added to limiting humanitarian aid to Gaza and intense fighting in order to create a new reality and deterrence against terrorists.' Even before the war, there were attempts to legislate capital punishment, including a bill currently stalled, waiting for a preliminary reading in the plenum of the Knesset. 'All our efforts at this point to complete the legislation have met closed doors,' Son Har Melech said. 'Not only do we not have deterrence without capital punishment, but we are also making murdering and massacring Jews lucrative. Our enemies need to know very clearly that prisoner release is off the table; this will change how the conflict is managed by Israel, making it more powerful with greater ability to face our enemies and subdue them.' As a former judge, Feinstein suggests sentencing convicted terrorists to death but not implementing it. 'Convicts should be held in similar conditions to those on death row in the U.S., with very minimal conditions, complete isolation and no option for parole,' he said. 'This could prevent future murders by deterrence.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The current deal between Israel and Hamas, which spans six weeks in which hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are slated to be released, has stirred controversy in the country. Memories of the Shalit deal are still fresh in the minds of many. One of the terrorists released as part of that deal was Yahya Sinwar, who then became the leader of Hamas and was the mastermind of the October 7 attack that stunned Israel and began the war. 'I am happy for each hostage that is freed from captivity,' said Son Har Melech. 'But we need to echo the great danger in releasing murderers and the unspeakable travesty of their release to the loved ones of the victims. This is also true for our soldiers, who I do not think fought and lost their lives for such pictures. This voice needs to be heard.' It is important to note that should the deal progress into its second stage next month, there is a possibility that terrorists who participated in the October 7 attack also will be released. Throughout its history, Israel has carried out many prisoner swaps at high prices, making this one no exception, likely leaving capital punishment off the table, even as emotions run high. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hkspe4puye	2025-02-02T09:27:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/Bkq18BF00kx/Bkq18BF00kx_0_307_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
US FAA pilot safety messaging system resumes operations	A key system that provides safety messages to pilots resumed operating on Sunday after an outage that began the previous night, the Federal Aviation Administration said, in the latest difficulty for the U.S. aviation system in the past week. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Sunday the FAA's 'Notice to Air Mission,' or NOTAM, system is old and needs an upgrade. The system went down late on Saturday, prompting the agency to set up a hotline to send notices every 30 minutes with updates to airlines. 'We are investigating the root cause of the outage,' the FAA said in a statement on Sunday. The NOTAM system provides pilots, flight crews and other users of U.S. airspace with critical safety notices. It could include items such as taxiway lights being out at an airport, nearby parachute activity or a specific runway being closed for construction.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkrtmn6okg	2025-02-02T09:04:58-08:00

Syria's transitional president in inaugural foreign trip visits S...	Ahmad al-Sharaa met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss rebuilding war-torn Syria; The visit signals a shift away from Iranian influence as Syria seeks Gulf investment and international support to restore diplomatic and economic ties On Sunday, Ahmad al-Sharaa, the new leader of Syria, visited Saudi Arabia. This was the country's interim president's first trip outside Syria since taking power in December, after rebel forces – led by the jihadist organization Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, which he heads—overthrew the regime of Bashar Assad. During his visit, al-Sharaa met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. Bin Salman is the second regional leader to meet with al-Sharaa since he assumed power, the first being the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who visited Damascus last month. After the meeting, al-Sharaa issued a statement describing the visit. 'I want to express my gratitude to my brother Mohammed bin Salman for the warm reception and hospitality. We held an extended meeting, during which I witnessed a genuine desire to support Syria, its future, its people, and its territorial integrity. We discussed numerous topics and took steps to strengthen cooperation,' according to the statement. The presidential office in Damascus reported that the two leaders discussed future plans for Syria in energy, technology, health and education. In January, al-Sharaa appointed himself as Syria’s interim president. Before his visit to Saudi Arabia, the presidential office in Damascus released a photo of al-Sharaa and his foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaybani, aboard a plane en route to Riyadh. Al-Sharaa’s visit to Saudi Arabia is widely viewed as a signal of the new Syrian regime distancing itself from Iran, which had been a significant ally of Assad. Since taking power, al-Sharaa has sought support from both Muslim and Western leaders, working to restore Syria’s ties with nations that severed relations during the civil war, which began in 2011 and ended in December. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Saudi Arabia and Iran announced the restoration of diplomatic relations in 2023 after a seven-year freeze. However, regional tensions and disagreements, particularly regarding Syria, persist between the two powers. In late December, al-Sharaa gave an interview to the Saudi network Al-Arabiya, stating that Riyadh 'will definitely play an important role' in Syria’s future while highlighting the 'great investment opportunities' in his country. Damascus is hopeful that Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf nations will assist in rebuilding the war-torn country. Last month, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan visited Damascus and pledged Saudi support in efforts to lift the international sanctions imposed during Assad’s war against the rebels. During his visit, bin Farhan said Riyadh is engaged in dialogue with all relevant nations and entities, including the United States and the European Union. 'We are hearing encouraging messages,' he added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk110imt00yx	2025-02-02T08:41:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/H1JKIfaO1g/H1JKIfaO1g_0_0_3000_2001_0_small.jpg

Electronics, food and alcohol: This is how Trump's tariffs will a...	Trump's sweeping tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China ignite a trade war, sparking swift retaliation, economic uncertainty, and fears of rising inflation United States President Donald Trump fulfilled his election promise and announced that he would impose high tariffs on America's three largest trading partners - Mexico, Canada, and China - citing a national emergency due to the entry of illegal immigrants and fentanyl drugs into the country's borders. On Saturday he signed an order to impose the stiff tariffs on imports drawing swift retaliation and an undeniable sense of betrayal from the country’s North American neighbors as a trade war erupted among the longtime allies. The Republican president posted on social media that the tariffs were necessary 'to protect Americans,' pressing the three nations to do more to curb the manufacture and export of illicit fentanyl and for Canada and Mexico to reduce illegal immigration into the U.S. The products coming from those countries are among the most common and essential items used by Americans, including fruits and vegetables, meat, gasoline, cars, electronics, toys, clothing, lumber, beer and other alcoholic beverages. The tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to significantly worsen, threatening the trust that many voters placed in Trump to lower the prices of groceries, gasoline, housing, autos, and other goods as he promised. They also risked throwing the global economy and Trump’s political mandate into turmoil just two weeks into his second term. Trump declared an economic emergency to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a 10% rate. Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates charged by the U.S. against retaliation by other countries, raising the specter of an even more severe economic disruption. 'The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a somber tone as he announced that his country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in U.S. imports, including alcohol and fruit. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He channeled the betrayal that many Canadians are feeling, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina. 'We were always there standing with you, grieving with you, the American people,' he said. Mexico’s president also ordered retaliatory tariffs. 'We categorically reject the White House’s slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory,' Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote in a post on X while saying she had instructed her economy secretary to implement a response that includes retaliatory tariffs and other measures in defense of Mexico’s interests. 'If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do, and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population. The premier of the Canadian province of British Columbia, David Eby, specifically called on residents to stop buying liquor from U.S. 'red' states and said it was removing American alcohol brands from government store shelves as a response to the tariffs. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country’s government 'firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.' China began regulating fentanyl-related drugs as a class of controlled substances in 2019 and conducted 'counternarcotics cooperation with the U.S.,' the ministry said, calling on the U.S. government to correct what it considers wrongful actions. The Ministry of Commerce in China said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization for the 'wrongful practices of the U.S.' and take measures to safeguard its rights and interests. The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, setting up a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth. A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale University laid out the possible damage to the U.S. economy, saying the average household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes. Economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen, and the situation could be even worse with retaliation from other countries. Democrats were quick to warn that any inflation going forward was the result of Trump’s actions. 'You’re worried about grocery prices. Don’s raising prices with his tariffs,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York wrote in a series of posts on X. 'You’re worried about tomato prices. Wait till Trump’s Mexico tariffs raise your tomato prices,' read another. 'You’re worried about car prices. Wait till Trump’s Canada tariffs raise your car prices,' read another. A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to brief reporters, said the lower rate on energy reflected a desire to minimize disruptive increases in the price of gasoline or utilities. That’s a sign White House officials understand the gamble they’re taking on inflation. Price spikes under former President Joe Biden led to voter frustration that helped return Trump to the White House. The order signed by Trump contained no mechanism for granting exceptions, the official said, a possible blow to homebuilders who rely on Canadian lumber as well as farmers, automakers and other industries. The official did not provide specific benchmarks that could be met to lift the new tariffs, saying only that the best measure would be fewer Americans dying from fentanyl addiction. The order would also allow for tariffs on Canadian imports of less than $800. Imports below that sum are currently able to cross into the United States without customs and duties. 'It doesn’t make much economic sense,’’ said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former U.S. trade official. 'Historically, most of our tariffs on raw materials have been low because we want to get cheaper materials so our manufacturers will be competitive ... Now, what’s he talking about? He’s talking about tariffs on raw materials. I don’t get the economics of it.’’ With the tariffs, Trump is honoring promises that are at the core of his economic and national security philosophy. But the announcement showed his seriousness around the issue as some Trump allies had played down the threat of higher import taxes as mere negotiating tactics. The president is preparing more import taxes in a sign that tariffs will be an ongoing part of his second term. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil, and natural gas, as well as copper, pharmaceutical drugs, and imports from the European Union — moves that could essentially pit the U.S. against much of the global economy. Trudeau warned of economic pain as the tariffs take effect and encouraged Canadians to 'choose Canadian products and services rather than American ones.' But he also voiced optimism about the enduring relationship between the two countries. 'It is going to have real consequences for people, for workers on both sides of our border. We don’t want to be here. We didn’t ask for this, but we will not back down in standing up both for Canadians and for the incredibly successful relationship between Canada and the United States,' Trudeau said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bycbxmt00ye	2025-02-02T08:15:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/r1IwhjhOJg/r1IwhjhOJg_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

A day after his release from captivity, Yarden Bibas' family thanks the people of Israel for the support and concern: 'Yarden is here and finally air is entering his lungs. He has lost weight, but feels good and his physical condition is normal.' Among the 79 hostages that remain in Gaza are his wife, Shiri, and children, Kfir and Ariel - and the fear for their lives is great; 'Respect our privacy, allow us the time and peace we need' In a statement released a day after Yarden Bibas returned from captivity - and while his wife Shiri and children Ariel and Kfir are still in Gaza and there is great fear for their fate - the Bibas family expressed their gratitude to the people of Israel. 'The amazing people of Israel, thank you for being excited with us, caring and embracing Yarden from afar,' they said in their statement, a day after-some 484 days in Hamas captivity Yarden Bibas was released alongside Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegel. 'Your support is felt and appreciated. Yarden is here and finally air is entering his lungs.' The Bibas family said that 'Yarden has lost a lot of weight, but he feels good, his physical condition is normal. He is strong and amazing.' They emphasized that 'along with acclimatization and the beginning of Yarden's rehabilitation journey, we continue to fight for Shiri, Ariel and Kfir, and all the other 76 hostages who must not be left behind. Tomorrow evening we will make a statement to the media. Until then, we ask that our privacy be respected and that we be allowed the time and peace that we need.' On Saturday afternoon, after he returned from captivity, his family announced that 'Yarden is home. A quarter of his heart has returned to us after 15 long months. There are no words to describe the feeling of relief to hold Yarden in our hands, hug him and hear his voice. Yarden is back home, but home is missing. Yarden is a father who left the military to protect his family, bravely survived captivity and returned to an unbearably difficult reality.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The family asked to protect Jordan and his soul.

It will take us a few days to unite with Jordan, but we continue with the hope and call for the return of Shiri, the children and all the kidnapped. Please continue to make their voices heard and the urgency for their return. Help us resonate this now more than ever. For Jordan and for everyone. We won't stop until everyone is home,' the family added. The Bibas family has been preparing for the possibility of Yarden being released before his wife and children over the past two weeks, since the cease-fire and hostage release deal was reached. In an interview earlier this week, after Shiri, Kfir and Ariel were not included in the initial stages of the deal, the family even received an update that the fear for their lives was increasing, and in Israel officials demanded information from the mediators about their situation. So far, no new information has been received following the demand, but the fact that they were not released in the first stages has increased concern about the fate of the mother and children. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skosaz6u1e	2025-02-02T08:04:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/HkiwW9iuJg/HkiwW9iuJg_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

IDF terrorist hunt expands in West Bank amid fear that most relea...	IDF expands operations in the West Bank, raiding Tamun village to dismantle arms smuggling and terrorist havens; Counterterrorism efforts also intensified in Jenin and Tulkarm, with troops demolishing terror infrastructure, and confiscating weapons to suppress growing threats Alongside the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of the hostage deal, the IDF expanded its operations in the West Bank early Sunday, announcing its entry into the Palestinian village of Tamun, which has recently become a hub for explosive-related terrorism. Later in the afternoon, the IDF announced that, as part of its counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank, it had demolished buildings in Jenin used as terror infrastructure. Dramatic footage captured the moment of the explosions, and Palestinian sources reported that close to 20 buildings had been destroyed in Jenin's refugee camp. The demolitions followed a mapping process of buildings where terror infrastructures, explosives labs, and surveillance tools – such as closed-circuit cameras – were discovered. Among the destroyed buildings was the one where Haruv Reconnaissance Unit soldier First Sergeant Liam Hazi from Rosh HaAyin was killed. So far, IDF troops have conducted searches of more than 1,000 buildings during this operation in the West Bank. A joint statement by IDF and Shin Bet revealed that, to date, the counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank has resulted in the elimination of over 35 terrorists and the arrest of more than 100 wanted individuals. Additionally, preemptive airstrikes have killed more than 15. Troops have confiscated dozens of weapons, destroyed hundreds of explosives, and neutralized dozens more planted along roads to target soldiers. Tamun operations The operation in Tamun began before dawn with ground maneuvers focused on a rapid entry into the village for searches, arrests and fortification. Heavy equipment, including bulldozers and excavators, was used to clear paths for ground troops, who began searching for weapons and detaining suspects. Tamun is part of the 'Five Villages' area, which also includes Tubas, Tayasir, Far'a, and Aqaba. In recent months, terrorism originating from these villages has intensified, including planting roadside bombs and using smuggled weapons for attacks. The proximity of Tamun and Tubas to Israel's eastern border has made them key points for arms smuggling by terror groups such as Iran and Hamas. Many arms dealers, including criminal elements, frequent the border area to collect weapons smuggled from Jordan. The villages have also become a haven for terrorists fleeing security forces. Many retreat to these villages before continuing on to Jenin or Tulkarm. Now, with the operation expanded to include Tamun, IDF is operating in three key locations in the eastern West Bank: the refugee camps in Jenin and Tulkarm, and the village of Tamun. The goal is to maintain aggressive and sustained pressure on the terror groups that have grown in the area in recent years. Another goal, following the hostage deal, is to prevent celebrations by released prisoners in cities and villages. Due to the military presence, such celebrations have significantly decreased, and no large armed parades have been reported so far. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: During the operation in Tamun, troops discovered an M-16 rifle and magazines. The IDF is also investigating an incident in which a 73-year-old man, reportedly shot by Israeli forces, was killed. Initial assessments indicate that the deceased, Walid Lahlooh, was in an isolated area where no civilians were expected to be present. Troops who identified him followed standard arrest procedures, which ended with him being shot in the lower body. An IDF announcement regarding the raid stated: 'During the operation, the forces located and confiscated dozens of weapons, destroyed hundreds of explosive devices, and neutralized dozens of additional explosives that had been planted along routes to target our forces.' As part of the broader operation that began nearly two weeks ago, soldiers have been scanning buildings in the hostile Jenin camp, which spans no more than 1.5 square kilometers, arresting and eliminating militants. Last week, Staff Sergeant Liam Hazi, a soldier from the Haruv Reconnaissance Unit, was killed during clashes in Jenin. Four other soldiers sustained light to moderate injuries, while one soldier was seriously wounded. More recently, IDF launched similar operations in the Nur al-Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm. In both Jenin and Tulkarm, checkpoints have been established to inspect Palestinians trying to leave the area, ensuring that no terrorists attempt to flee. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4p911toyg	2025-02-02T07:28:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/B17VMZWaukg/B17VMZWaukg_0_0_1600_1067_0_small.jpg
The world needs to hear the children's voices': Israel's 'spokes...	Meet 9-year-old Ben Carasso, Israel's youngest spokesperson; He tells Ynetnews about his drive, efforts and future ambitions while defending the country on the international stage With Israel facing worldwide criticism and scrutiny over its war against Hamas following the terror group’s massacre on October 7, 2023, many within the country and across the world have taken part in advocating for Israel's actions and its right to defend itself on the international stage. One of the most surprising speakers for Israel is 9-year-old Ben Carasso of Tel Aviv, a third-generation to Holocaust survivors, who decided to embark on a mission to be the voice of Israeli children during the war. Speaking with Ynetnews, he explained the motivation behind his fight for Israel all over the world: 'Children got hurt in this war. If they were scared of the alarms, if they were kidnapped, if they were evacuated from their homes. I felt that the world needs to hear the children's voices, because if we can't do nothing about it, at least let us speak about it.' Ben also discussed his initial steps into advocacy for the country. 'I saw how important it was from October 7. There are no words to describe what happened here. I saw how important it is. So I started really from the start.' When asked about when he began studying English, Ben replied, 'I learned from the age of three.' He also discussed why he decided to involve advocacy in his daily life alongside his days in school and activities as a regular child in Israel. 'I'm advocating because it’s important. And sometimes I do it with my friends, like every regular child. My family supports me and so do my friends. But I'm just a regular child that wants the world to hear what they feel,' he told Ynetnews. When asked where his advocacy efforts took him around the world, he answered: 'I was in London for poster hangings. I was in schools, universities and media outlets. I did almost everything I could to release the hostages and now I’m so happy to see we have hostages back.' Ben also talked about his connection with released hostage Romi Gonen: 'I have two friends whose family members were kidnapped, one is Romi Gonen who’s a cousin of my friend Mika. And another one, Hanan Yablonka, who was kidnapped and murdered. I went to his funeral. He's the father of my best friend from kindergarten. I also have a friend that's evacuated from their home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When asked about facing challenges during his advocacy abroad, Ben said that 'sometimes they just won't want to hear me. But I think one situation is that they don't understand that we're not committing genocide and we just want to help the Palestinians.' He added that he tries to face negative comments head-on. 'If there are negative reactions, I know I said something good because they don't want the world to hear the truth.' Ben shared about his role models working to defend Israel around the world. 'I think whoever is doing advocacy and helping Israel is really instrumental,' he said. ' I'm so happy that we have other people like Hayley Ace. She's a Christian and she's helping us. There are many more out there and I'm so happy we have them and every single spokesperson that helps Israel.' When asked about his ambitions for the future, Ben said: 'I really don't know, but advocacy will always be a part of my life.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byqg3h200yx	2025-02-02T07:13:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/By44R32uke/By44R32uke_56_0_341_192_0_small.jpg
Former hostage Daniella Gilboa reflects on captivity and return: ...	Freed hostage Daniella Gilboa recounts the terror of October 7 and her months in captivity, describing the moment of her abduction and the faith that kept her going Daniella Gilboa, who was released in the second round of the first phase of the hostage deal, shared a heartfelt post on Instagram Sunday morning about her time in captivity and her return home. 'What a surreal year I've had –I don’t even know where to begin,' she wrote. 'First and foremost, I want to thank the people who stood by my family for a year and three months, who never gave up, never lost hope.' A widely shared video shows Gilboa and fellow female IDF lookouts singing 'Am Yisrael Chai' in a meeting with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. 'We want to say thank you, to you and President Trump for everything,' Liri Albag told him. Witkoff responded: 'The people of the United States stand with you, the president stands with you. We have a common goal – to bring everybody home.' Hamas, in a psychological warfare tactic against the hostages’ families, previously released a video showing Gilboa’s tattoo in an attempt to falsely claim she had died in captivity. Addressing the incident, she wrote: 'Thank you for waiting for me, for not believing the horrific rumors, for continuing to pray for me throughout this entire time. That was my last request before I was taken.' Gilboa then described the moment of her abduction from a reinforced shelter in Nahal Oz. 'I refused to despair or say goodbye. Instead, I prayed and believed with all my heart that my story wouldn’t end in that shelter,' she recounted. 'For half an hour, I prayed for every girl with me because I felt there was nothing more powerful I could do at that moment. I couldn't rely on the army coming to protect me, or on the shelter itself – it wasn’t just about missiles this time. Even the few armed girls with us weren’t enough to make me feel safe.' 'I knew the only thing that could save us was faith' On Saturday morning, she and fellow hostages Karina, Naama, Liri and Agam recited the Birkat HaGomel prayer in synagogue, a prayer of thanksgiving after surviving a life-endangering situation – a moment she had long awaited. 'From the day I survived October 7, I was waiting for this – to thank God for saving us against all odds,' she wrote. 'Eight days ago, after 477 days in captivity, I was finally reunited with my loved ones – the family I thought about and worried for more than I worried about myself. The people who were with me, not physically, but in spirit, who never gave up and did everything to bring me home. They strengthened me even without knowing it. 'Thank you, my dear family. Thank you, my beloved friends who fought for me until I returned.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Gilboa also expressed gratitude to her boyfriend, writing: 'Thank you, Roiko, my love, for giving me so much strength from afar. You appeared in my dreams, in my thoughts every hour of the day. For over a year, we were together in heart and soul. I love you.' She then praised the soldiers who risked their lives in the fight to bring the hostages home. 'Thank you to the heroic soldiers who fought with immense bravery and to those who gave their lives with one goal in mind – to find us and bring us back. Each and every one of us. I appreciate and love you so much. Stay strong, you are incredible.' 'With God’s help, very soon we will see all the hostages – both the living and those we lost – back home with their families and loved ones. We cannot give up now. This isn’t over – there are still people who need to come home. And if anyone understands that, it’s you, the people of Israel, who are fighting with all your might and giving them a sliver of hope in the darkness.' Gilboa ended her message with a vow to honor the memory of her fallen friends. 'I am deeply grateful for the incredible chance I was given – to live and to commemorate all the friends who were brutally murdered in the command center and in Nahal Oz. May their memory be a blessing. I will never stop until the end of my days.' 'I love you all so much,' she concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bye11jg6oje	2025-02-02T06:56:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BJxDE11ChOJx/BJxDE11ChOJx_24_174_415_234_0_small.jpg

More Hamas cruelty: The 'thank you' letter Keith Siegel was force...	Not just 'gift bags' and 'release certificates': In a letter circulated online, the hostage released from captivity yesterday allegedly confessed to Hamas; 'Those guarding me during this period took care of all my needs,' it read; But the Hostages and Missing Families Forum clarified: 'The terrorists who held him forced him to write them a detailed letter of thanks, this is another example of Hamas' cruelty' In a letter distributed online by Hamas, Keith Siegel - who was released Saturday from captivity in Gaza - allegedly thanked the terrorists who held him for 484 days. 'I was treated well by them,' he allegedly wrote. But a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum clarified that 'the Hamas terrorists who held Keith forced him to write them a detailed letter of thanks. This is one example of many of the cruel and cynical conduct of the Hamas terrorist organization and the urgency of returning all the hostages to Israel.' 'To the Qassam fighters, my name is Keith Siegel and I am from Kfar Aza. I was a prisoner in Gaza from October 7, 2023 until January 2025,' the letter began. The release date was not specified, and it is possible that the letter was dictated by the terrorists a few days before - when it was not yet clear when Siegel would be released. According to the letter that Siegel was ordered to write: 'My guards during this period took care of all my needs, food and drink, medicine, vitamins, eye drops, a blood pressure measuring device and more. They also made sure I got a doctor's checkup when I felt unwell for a long time. The guards considered my needs and responded to my requests regarding nutrition, eating habits and more. They made sure I had food that suited my health needs.'

I wish and hope for peace soon. To the fighters who guarded me during this period, I would like to say thank you,' the letter also said. Siegel said upon his return that he was forced to eat meat despite being a vegetarian, and that he ate it when it was given to him since he received very little food. The last time he ate before he was released was Friday afternoon. This letter joins the cynical 'release certificates' that Hamas distributes to released hostages as a kind of receipt for the prisoners, including murderers, who are being released from Israeli prisons in the cease-fire and hostage return deal. To all those released so far, Hamas has distributed so-called 'gift bags,' which in some cases also included a map of the Gaza Strip; Siegel was given an additional 'gift bag' to pass on to his wife, Aviva Sigal, who was released in the deal more than a year ago. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h12orwtdjl	2025-02-02T06:21:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/H1LbTgp00kx/H1LbTgp00kx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

It becomes a part of your story': American-Israeli violinist's f...	Award winning violinst Miri Ben-Ari talks with Ynet about her special connection to former hostage due to their shared instrument and an upcoming show featuring the two All of Israel is closely following the advance of the second hostage deal with Hamas, currently in its first phase, as many celebrate the return of captives held in Gaza since the terror group’s attack on Israel on October 7 nearly a year and a half ago. One of the recent hostages to be released was IDF lookout Agam Berger who was abducted from her post in Nahal Oz. Berger is also a talented violinist recognized in the country and had many local and foreign musicians follow her release from Gaza. One of them, Grammy Award-winning American-Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari, told Ynet she felt a deep connection to Berger: 'She's a violinist, I am a violinist. We both enjoy playing violin and once you relate to someone on that level it becomes a part of your story.' Ben-Ari recalled hearing Berger’s violin playing while she was still in captivity. 'I heard her playing 'Hallelujah' and I said that once she's out, I’ll invite her to come to New York and play violin with me. 'I also spoke to this terrific organization, the Israeli American Council, that has organized so many protests and demonstrations all over America for the hostages and they would facilitate this performance. This is official. I'm putting it out. And I'm so looking forward to meeting her,' she said. Ben-Ari added she believed the power of music and playing the violin could help Berger face her trauma in a way akin to therapy. 'I think the violin could become extremely therapeutic. It's something she knows. You don't forget how to play the violin. And it's like an extension of your soul,' she said. 'You get to express yourself to sometimes say things beyond words. The violin comes from your soul. I recommend everyone who is going through a healing journey and especially Agam, who is a violinist, to pick up her violin again and try and create some music. Hopefully with me.' 'I think that music is the very universal language. It is the best vehicle to show unity, to show how harmony should look like, to be proud, to have a voice, not to be afraid,' she added. 'Music and violin could become anything that you want.' 'In my journey, it was hip hop music, which has been my career. I've been the hip hop violinist from the Apollo stage to the White House to my many collaborations. And I hope that with music, we'll be able to make a whole different statement that is going to have a really good and positive impact.'

'One of the things that I chose to do to combat hate and antisemitism is through my project, Symphony of Brotherhood,' she added. 'It's a partnership with the Israeli Commission here and the government in New Jersey and the Department of Education.' 'We are opening Black History Month in a couple of days: 18 high schools here in Newark, 2,000 high school students, the lieutenant governor and a lot of politicians and influentials will attend.'

And I'm going to switch violins in the middle of my show in order to tell the story of that violin that survived the Holocaust,' she explained. 'Now I get to tell the story by playing this instrument. I get to talk about the Holocaust and my family, who are third generation to Holocaust survivors through this violin. This is so unique and I'm so honored.

Hamas prisoners deported in hostage deal remain stranded in Cairo...	Dozens of Hamas terrorists freed in hostage deal remain stuck in Cairo as host countries delay acceptance; Palestinian official describes their situation as moving 'from an Israeli prison to an Egyptian prison' Seventy Hamas terrorists released from Israeli prisons and deported to Egypt as part of the hostage deal remain confined to a hotel in Cairo, as the countries expected to take them in have yet to formally approve their entry. 'Not a single Arab country has agreed to accept even one deported Palestinian prisoner,' a Palestinian Prisoners' Authority official told Ynet. He added that Turkey has agreed to take in the Jerusalemite deportees but will first review their backgrounds. According to the official, all released prisoners are housed in a hotel and are not allowed to leave. He described their situation as moving 'from an Israeli prison to an Egyptian prison,' noting that Hamas leadership has so far remained silent and has not publicly pressured nations like Qatar and Turkey to expedite their acceptance. The official also claimed that the former prisoners spent an extended period wearing Israeli prison uniforms and slippers, adding, 'The Egyptians are not treating them warmly.' Meanwhile, 23 additional prisoners who were set to be deported abroad remain stranded in Gaza. Besides Egypt, other countries mentioned as potential hosts for the deported prisoners include Algeria, Turkey, Tunisia and Qatar. In a joint statement, Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s foreign minister said they are willing to accept some of the released prisoners but did not specify a number. Separately, Palestinian sources reported two airstrikes in central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. The second strike reportedly killed three people and wounded others. The strikes targeted vehicles traveling along the Al-Rashid coastal road, designated for pedestrian movement northward. Under the current agreement, Palestinians wishing to drive north must do so via Salah al-Din Road, where vehicles are subject to inspection. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyuwt0h00yx	2025-02-02T03:01:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/r1mPpsuHdJe/r1mPpsuHdJe_0_92_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Israel grants residency to 5 Thai hostages freed from Gaza	Interior Minister Moshe Arbel tells Thai foreign minister Israel will grant residency to five Thai nationals freed from Hamas captivity after 15 months in Gaza, calling it a humanitarian gesture Interior Minister Moshe Arbel announced Sunday that five Thai nationals freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza will be granted Israeli residency as a humanitarian gesture. The five were held hostage for more than 15 months after being abducted during the October 7 massacre. Arbel shared the decision during a meeting in his office with Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa, where the two also discussed expanding bilateral agreements on employment sectors. Meanwhile, an Israeli delegation has arrived in Bangkok for talks with Thai officials on advancing cooperation.

The hunger, the fear and the fight to stay alive: Freed hostages ...	Held for over 15 months in tunnels, safe houses and UNRWA facilities—some in isolation—hostages endured starvation, injuries and psychological terror; some were locked in cages, others forced to work; many learned Arabic, some managed to read, write and observe Shabbat Gadi Mozes, 80, maintained a morning walking routine and kept a journal, while the IDF lookouts refrained from eating leavened food on Passover and fasted on Yom Kippur. Keith Siegel, a vegetarian, was forced to eat meat due to food shortages. Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon were held in cages during their first days in captivity, while Emily Damari, after being shot twice, was transferred to a UNRWA facility without medical care. These are some of the first testimonies emerging after the release of 13 Israeli hostages and five Thai nationals, who spent over 15 months in Hamas captivity. Siegel was held in Gaza City for 484 days, frequently moved between safe houses and tunnels. Terrorists locked him in separate rooms to prevent him from being found if anyone entered. According to reports by public broadcaster Kan, Siegel initially believed his son, Shai, had been killed, until he heard his voice on the radio and realized he had survived. He described the severe food shortages, recounting that he had to eat meat despite being vegetarian and that his last meal was a full day before his release. Bibas and Calderon, who were violently abducted, were reportedly held in cages together in their first days in captivity. Terrorists mistakenly assumed Calderon was an IDF reservist, which is why he was released in a military uniform. Both men were kept in tunnels and various buildings alongside other hostages, enduring psychological terror. One of the most harrowing moments was the brutal video in which Bibas was filmed after being falsely told that his wife, Shiri, and their sons, Ariel and Kfir, had died—an assertion that Israeli authorities have been unable to confirm or refute. Eyal Calderon, who has yet to reunite with his cousin Ofer, said he learned from Ofer’s children that, until a few weeks ago, Ofer did not know his son Rotem was alive. 'He was in a state of complete uncertainty, and then he found out through a media interview that his son had survived,' he said. 'What he endured is unimaginable. There’s still a long road ahead—his recovery will be long, with ups and downs.' Jimmy Pacheco, the caregiver of Amitai Ben-Tzvi, who was murdered on October 7, was kidnapped and later released in a previous deal. He had previously recounted being held in tunnels with Bibas and Calderon, developing a close bond with them. 'When I cried, they comforted me and assured me that the Israeli government was helping. We sang together, we laughed and I even taught Yarden my language,' he told Army Radio. Isolation, faith and forced labor Newly released hostages are sharing harrowing accounts of their time in Hamas captivity, detailing extreme isolation, forced labor and the small routines that helped them survive. Gadi Mozes, 80, structured his days in captivity to maintain both his physical and mental well-being. He walked in circles, counting tiles to track his distance, and solved math problems to stay mentally sharp. For most of his 484 days in captivity, he was alone. The first hostage he met was 29-year-old Arbel Yehoud, just before her release. Mozes, who speaks Arabic, used his language skills to communicate with his captors, who eventually provided him with English books. He kept a daily journal, writing a few lines each day, though it was confiscated before his release. He had limited access to outside information, but glimpses of his family on TV reassured him that they were fighting for his freedom. When asked what kept him going, he said the thought of reuniting with his loved ones was his main motivation, though he also experienced moments of betrayal, wondering why he and the others were still in captivity. Arbel Yehoud spent nearly 16 months in total isolation, unaware of the full extent of the October 7 attack on her kibbutz, Nir Oz, where one in four residents was either killed or kidnapped. Mozes was the first Israeli she encountered in captivity, meeting him just hours before she was freed. After her release, her father, Yechiel, said, 'She returned in relatively good health, considering the hell she endured. She survived heroically until the very last moment.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF lookouts who were taken hostage on October 7 spent their 477 days in captivity in both apartments and tunnels, some held together, others alone. Naama Levy was kept in isolation for a long period before being reunited with fellow captives Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev, who had known each other from their service on base. Despite strict prohibitions against physical contact or crying, they found ways to support each other, exercised despite the extreme conditions and food shortages, and were often forced to cook, clean and care for the children of their captors. The hostages tried to preserve their identities and faith even under duress. They refused to eat leavened bread during Passover, attempted to fast on Yom Kippur, and Agam Berger, the last lookout to be released, even observed the Sabbath. Liri Albag, another captive, relied on her charisma to navigate captivity and managed to avoid being held in tunnels for most of her time in Gaza. The two were separated shortly before their release, with Albag taken to film a propaganda video while Berger remained alone. As she was freed, Berger said, 'I chose the path of faith, and in faith, I returned.' Naama Levy, who was freed in an earlier exchange, was initially held alone for a long time before being reunited with her fellow hostages. When they finally met, she asked if the moment was real and whether they were still alive. Many of the lookouts recounted being forced to perform household chores for their captors. In an interview with Kol BaRama radio, Yafa Deri, who met with the released soldiers, said they had fasted on Yom Kippur and observed Passover customs, with Daniella even requesting traditional sfenj (North African doughnuts) for Mimouna at the end of the holiday. 'There were bombings, and they had to move from place to place, so there were no sfenj, but they are so sweet and knew their role, which is incredible,' she said. She added that Agam Berger refused to accept a Quran from her captors and instead prayed from a Hebrew prayer book she found, possibly left behind by Israeli soldiers. Mandy Damari, mother of Emily Damari, who was freed after 471 days in Hamas captivity, revealed that her daughter was held in facilities operated by UNRWA. 'Hamas held Emily in UNRWA facilities and denied her access to medical treatment after she was shot twice,' she said. 'It’s a miracle she’s alive.' Emily was released during the first phase of the current hostage deal alongside Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher. She was seen pushing a Hamas terrorist out of the vehicle that brought her to the Red Cross transfer point. Due to her injuries, two of her fingers had to be amputated. Eitan Gonen, father of Romi, told Ynet that the freed hostages supported each other in captivity. 'Romi needed permission from the terrorists for everything, even just to move right or left,' he said. He described the deep bond formed between Romi, Emily and Doron, who were held together. 'They were each other’s entire world in captivity. They talked, helped and took care of one another—like a mother, a father, a sister. Now that they’re back, they do everything together. They go out to eat, visit each other’s rooms and are inseparable. I look at them and see three superheroes.' In a video message played at a rally for the hostages in Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square, Doron said, 'I’m okay. The moment I can, I’ll be out there holding a sign,' signaling her commitment to continuing the fight to bring the remaining hostages home. Over the weekend, five Thai nationals abducted by Hamas on October 7 were also released in Khan Younis as part of a separate deal brokered by the Thai government. It remains unclear whether any concessions were made for their release. The freed hostages—Sathian Suwannakham, 34; Pongsak Thenna, 35; Bannawat Seathao, 27; Watchara Sriaoun, 32; and Surasak Lamnau, 30—spoke of prolonged periods of hunger, difficulty breathing in underground tunnels and being held in dark rooms. They were kept in two separate groups, with two in one location and three in another. During their captivity, they learned to communicate in Arabic with their captors. Despite the harsh conditions, their medical condition was reported as stable upon release. One more Thai hostage remains in captivity, along with a Nepalese citizen. Two Thai nationals and one Tanzanian citizen are believed to have been killed in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjbm6a3ukx	2025-02-02T02:15:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/rkWevT3001g/rkWevT3001g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israeli forces detained Lebanese fisherman, reports claim	Lebanese media claim Israeli Navy detained fisherman near Naqoura as Hezbollah supporters push for new border march despite IDF presence; Hezbollah-affiliated network alleges Israeli sniper shot at camera near Yaroun, releasing footage of incident Lebanese media reported Sunday that Israeli forces detained a fisherman near the coastal town of Naqoura, close to the Israel-Lebanon border, amid ongoing tensions as residents attempt to return to villages in southern Lebanon despite Israeli warnings. A video circulating online purportedly shows the moment of the arrest, with a voice in the background exclaiming, 'Look, he’s raising his hands. I swear to God, he raised his hands!' According to reports, the detained fisherman was identified as Mohammad Jahir. Lebanon’s state-run news agency claimed he was apprehended by an 'enemy Israeli boat' while fishing with his brother, who was left behind. The IDF said it was aware of the reports and the incident was under review. The alleged arrest comes amid renewed calls for Lebanese civilians to participate in 'marches of return' to southern villages still under Israeli military presence. Organizers have dubbed it the 'Second Sunday of Return,' marking a week since violent clashes erupted as thousands of Lebanese demonstrators, many waving Hezbollah flags, attempted to re-enter border villages following the expiration of the initial cease-fire agreement. According to Lebanese sources, at least 22 people, including a Lebanese soldier, were killed in those clashes, with over 100 others wounded. Although the cease-fire was extended until February 18 under U.S. mediation, Hezbollah and its affiliates continue urging civilians to push back into the disputed areas. Calls circulated Saturday night urging residents to gather at village entrances and 'stand alongside the families and the army in defense of the homeland.' By Sunday morning, small groups of Lebanese were seen assembling near border villages, including Meiss El Jabal and Hula, again carrying Hezbollah flags. Despite the mobilization efforts, participation appeared lower than last week, and no major confrontations had been reported. However, in the village of Yaroun, Hezbollah-affiliated network Al Mayadeen claimed an Israeli sniper shot at one of its cameras positioned at the northern entrance of the town. The news outlet shared footage allegedly showing the camera falling from its tripod, though no gunfire was heard in the video. Israeli officials have defended their continued military presence in parts of southern Lebanon, citing the Lebanese army’s failure to deploy effectively in Hezbollah-controlled areas south of the Litani River. Israeli assessments suggest that last week's border confrontations were orchestrated by Hezbollah to provoke clashes with IDF forces, reinforcing Israel’s justification for maintaining a presence in the region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Although the cease-fire remains in effect, it is unclear whether the IDF will complete its withdrawal by the February 18 deadline. A senior Israeli military official told Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth last week that 'until the Lebanese army fully assumes its responsibilities and demonstrates sufficient control over the area, we will not recommend transferring authority to them.' Tensions have also flared in recent days, with the IDF intercepting a suspicious aerial target over the northern border town of Zar'it on Friday. A day earlier, Israeli fighter jets downed a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone—the first such incident since the cease-fire extension. The IDF also conducted a rare airstrike deep in southern Lebanon, targeting a truck and another vehicle suspected of smuggling Hezbollah weaponry in violation of the cease-fire terms. On Thursday night, the Israeli Air Force carried out additional strikes in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, hitting multiple Hezbollah positions. According to the IDF, the sites targeted included an underground weapons production facility and cross-border smuggling routes used by Hezbollah to transfer arms from Syria into Lebanon. The military said the strikes were intended to neutralize threats to Israeli forces and civilian areas. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry4aka3okl	2025-02-02T01:42:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/By11qfAihOyg/By11qfAihOyg_0_221_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israeli forces push into another West Bank terrorist stronghold	After operations in Tulkarm and Jenin, IDF forces enter Tamun overnight, where 10 terrorists killed in airstrike last week; troops launch ground maneuver at dawn, uncovering weapons and explosives as part of counterterror efforts The IDF announced Sunday the expansion of its Iron Wall counterterrorism operation in the northern West Bank, confirming that combat teams from the Bislach Brigade have begun operating in the Palestinian village of Tamun. According to the IDF, forces entered Tamun overnight and uncovered weapons, including an M-16 rifle and ammunition magazines. This marks the latest expansion of the nearly two-week-old operation, which now includes brigade-level combat teams operating simultaneously in three locations: the Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps, and now Tamun. 'Security forces continue the operation to thwart terrorism in northern Samaria while ensuring the safety of Israeli civilians,' the IDF said. Since the start of the operation, IDF troops have been conducting raids in the hostile urban terrain of Jenin, a densely packed area of approximately 1.5 square kilometers, arresting and eliminating terrorists. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Last week, Staff Sgt. Liam Hazi of the Haruv Reconnaissance Battalion was killed in an encounter with Palestinian gunmen in Jenin, where four other soldiers were lightly to moderately wounded, and another was seriously injured. The IDF has recently extended its operation to Tulkarm's Nur Shams refugee camp, implementing checkpoints to screen residents for potential terrorist activity in both Jenin and Tulkarm. On Saturday, Israeli aircraft struck two groups of armed terrorists near the Jenin refugee camp, with confirmed hits, according to the military. Later, the IDF targeted a vehicle carrying terrorists in Kabatiya, south of Jenin, killing three individuals. Palestinian sources identified one of the dead as Abd al-Hadi Kamil, a Hamas operative who was released from Israeli prison in the first hostage deal in November 2023. Tamun, the latest focus of IDF operations, was targeted in an Israeli airstrike last Wednesday that killed at least 10 terrorists, including Omar Basharat and Montaser Bani Odeh, who were involved in a roadside bomb attack that killed IDF reservist Sgt. First Class (res.) Eviatar Ben Yehuda. The two were also linked to additional shooting and bombing attacks. In early January, the IDF confirmed another airstrike in Tamun targeting a group of terrorists. Palestinian reports claimed three people were killed, including two children aged 8 and 10. The IDF claimed that those killed were confirmed as terrorists actively planting explosives near Israeli forces. Prior to that, two armed Palestinians who opened fire at Israeli troops were killed in a drone strike. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjqnmhhu1l	2025-02-02T00:02:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/02/BkHuBq3Oyl/BkHuBq3Oyl_0_534_1200_676_0_small.jpg

Prison issues warning bracelets to terrorists freed in hostage de...	Palestinian prisoners set for release under hostage deal given bracelets inscribed with Bible verse in Arabic and overview of Gaza’s destruction, aimed at deterring them from returning to terrorism Palestinian prisoners released in the third and fourth rounds of the hostage deal’s first phase received bracelets from the Israel Prison Service (IPS) with an Arabic inscription from the Book of Psalms, reading: 'The eternal nation does not forget; I will pursue my enemies and overtake them.' Signs with the same message were displayed in IPS detention facilities as part of a psychological campaign alongside the prisoner releases. The translation on the bracelets was written in formal Arabic, which many prisoners struggled to understand. 'No matter what they write, will it change anything?' a Palestinian Prisoners’ Affairs official said. 'It’s a gesture of provocation and threat, but beyond that, it has no meaning. All the prisoners removed IPS-issued clothing, including the bracelet meant to insult them.' The International Red Cross criticized the IPS, arguing that the method of shackling and the use of the bracelets harmed the prisoners. During the release process, one prisoner felt unwell and was treated by IPS medical staff. Ynet has learned that the prisoners were briefed on the destruction in Gaza to deter them from returning to terrorism. Israel released 183 prisoners on Saturday — 143 were transferred from Ketziot Prison in the Negev to Gaza, eight were deported to Egypt and 32 were released to the West Bank from Ofer Prison, after which celebrations were held in Ramallah.

We can expand the circle of peace': PM says talks will focus on Saudi normalization, next phase of hostage deal and countering Iranian threat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu departed for Washington on Sunday for his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump since the latter’s return to office.

Before boarding his flight, Netanyahu said the meeting was of 'great significance' for Israel, highlighting the deep bond between the two nations and his personal relationship with Trump. 'This connection has already yielded great achievements, including the historic Abraham Accords,' he said, referring to normalization agreements with four Arab nations brokered during Trump’s previous term. 'We can strengthen Israel’s security, expand the circle of peace even further and usher in a remarkable era beyond our imagination—an era of prosperity, security and peace through strength. The strength of our soldiers, our citizens, Israel and the alliance between Israel and the United States,' Netanyahu concluded. During the visit, Netanyahu is expected to discuss key issues, including the ongoing hostage deal negotiations, post-war governance in Gaza and broader regional stability. Talks will also address Iran’s nuclear ambitions and potential normalization with Saudi Arabia—though Riyadh has conditioned any agreement on a political pathway for the Palestinians, a demand Netanyahu has so far resisted. Netanyahu’s delegation includes Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, hostage coordinator Gal Hirsch and newly appointed communications advisor Caroline Glick. Also on board was Netanyahu’s personal physician, following his recent prostate surgery. The visit comes as Trump’s administration is still shaping its Middle East policy.

Iran is expected to be a central focus of discussions, with Israel seeking clarity on whether the U.S. plans to engage diplomatically with Tehran on a new nuclear deal. Israeli officials stress that Washington’s broader regional commitments—particularly to Saudi Arabia and the UAE—are closely tied to its Iran strategy. Netanyahu is likely to urge Trump to prioritize countering Iran before addressing Palestinian-related demands from the Saudis.

These are the 20 hostages set to be freed ahead of fifth hostage ...	3 hostages will be released each week in deal's first phase, followed by expected release of 11 more captives before negotiations begin on next stage Despite challenges, Israel’s hostage deal with Hamas remains intact and the terror group appears intent on maintaining it at least until day 42, the final day of the agreement’s first phase. Following the release of hostages Keith Siegel, Ofer Calderon and Yarden Bibas on Saturday, the number of hostages returned to Israel under the deal has reached 18, including five Thai nationals freed on Thursday. Seventy-nine hostages remain in Gaza, a third of the 251 taken on October 7, 2023, in Hamas’ massacre, 35 of whom are considered deceased. The deal’s first phase, set to return 33 Israelis, is expected to bring back 20 more, including the remaining members of the Bibas family —mother Shiri and children Ariel and Kfir. The IDF warned there was a 'grave concern for their lives.'

New IDF chief faces tough task of rebuilding military amid war	Architect of Israel’s wartime arms race now faces new battle—balancing draft exemption debate as combat units lack troops and reserve turnout drops; with war dragging past 16 months, Eyal Zamir must brace for fresh rounds against Hamas The Israeli government has named Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir as the next chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), replacing Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Zamir, a former deputy chief of staff and director-general of the Defense Ministry, was the leading candidate for the position since the early days of the war, following Halevi’s acceptance of responsibility for the failures of October 7. Zamir, who previously served as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s military secretary, was widely seen as the most experienced and suitable choice. His appointment marks the second time in recent history that a defense ministry director-general has transitioned directly into the IDF’s top position, following Lt. Gen. (res.) Gabi Ashkenazi’s appointment in 2007 after the failures of the Second Lebanon War. As chief of staff, Zamir will face the immense challenge of rebuilding the IDF after months of intense combat, implementing a long-term restructuring plan and preparing the military for multi-front conflicts rather than the traditional two-front model. He will also have to navigate the political and military complexities surrounding the draft exemption for ultra-Orthodox men, a contentious issue that has placed strain on the IDF’s manpower needs. During his tenure as defense ministry director-general, Zamir played a key role in securing military aid, orchestrating air and sea supply lines that brought critical weapons shipments to Israel amid increasing international pressure and embargoes. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, he is expected to benefit from renewed U.S. military support, including the delivery of thousands of precision-guided munitions previously frozen by the Biden administration. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zamir’s immediate priorities will include overseeing fragile cease-fires in both Gaza and Lebanon. While a temporary truce with Hezbollah is in place until at least February 18 under U.S. mediation, tensions remain high, and Hamas’s agreement with Israel is also on shaky ground. If fighting resumes in Gaza, Zamir will be responsible for executing further military operations against Hamas while securing an expanded buffer zone along the border. The lack of a long-term governance plan for Gaza presents another significant challenge. With Hamas still exerting civilian control over the enclave’s population, military gains from months of operations risk being eroded. Zamir may be forced to revert to a policy he knows well from his time as head of the Southern Command: frequent, limited engagements with Hamas to maintain deterrence, but this time with stronger defensive measures aimed at preventing another October 7-style attack. The new chief of staff will also have to address growing fatigue among Israel’s active-duty and reserve forces. Many reservists have served between six months and a year in the ongoing war, and enlistment rates are declining. With the government keeping forces deployed in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime, Zamir will need to push the political leadership to establish clearer military priorities and address troop shortages in combat units. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1sjufnukx	2025-02-01T20:59:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/07/11/HJUG3cOpu/HJUG3cOpu_0_91_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Saudi Arabia, Iran and 'the day after': Netanyahu heads to crucia...	The prime minister will meet with the U.S. president, with the goal of influencing American policy that is still being formed; At least one fateful decision will be made during the visit - which will likely affect both the fate of the hostage deal and the Netanyahu government The Iranian issue, 'the day after' and normalization with Saudi Arabia are on the table as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takes off Sunday morning for a significant visit to Washington, with the aim of influencing the new administration's policy priorities. The most important part of the trip will be Netanyahu's personal meeting with the new-old U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House, during which the two will try to piece together the complex puzzle of the Middle East and set priorities on all the burning issues on the agenda. In focus: the hostage deal , the Gaza Strip, Hamas, 'the day after' and the entire issue of reconstruction. Netanyahu is the first foreign leader invited to meet with Trump, who will roll out the red carpet for him, host him at the official Blair House guest house, and invite him to a gala dinner at the White House. Israel attaches great importance to the visit, and believes that the prime minister will be able to influence the way Trump shapes his administration's policy regarding the Middle East - along with the understanding that the U.S. president also has his own instincts and interests. Trump talked about the Middle East before his inauguration on January 20, but on many issues he has not yet made decisions. Netanyahu is interested in influencing this process, and an Israeli official even said that 'only after his meeting with Trump will it be possible to formulate a policy. Until then, there is not much room to move forward.' Trump's ambitions for the 'relocation' of Gazans in favor of rebuilding the Strip are no joke, and his statements are also consistent with his statements about deporting immigrants to Mexico. Even if there is currently no Arab country willing to accept the Palestinians, Trump continues to bring it up again and again - perhaps also for internal American considerations. In his view, it would be impossible to rehabilitate Gaza without evacuating the population - the land is contaminated, uninhabitable, and it would take years to clear the rubble and clean it up. The Iranian issue: Agreement or military operation After some hoped that the U.S., led by Trump, would cooperate with an attack on Iran, Israel is expecting to hear what the new president's plan is on the subject - and whether he intends to enter into a diplomatic dialogue with Tehran to reach a new nuclear agreement. Israel understands that the Iranian issue fits into the American perspective in the regional architecture, as there are other countries in the Middle East for which this issue is important - such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Therefore, the U.S. has obligations on this issue not only in the Israeli context. Trump's goal is for Iran to not have a nuclear bomb, and the two options he faces are either an agreement or military action against Iran, Israeli or joint. Until one of these outcomes is achieved, Israel would like to see the U.S. impose crippling sanctions on Iran, alongside a credible military threat to deter it. Trump, as has already been understood based on his statements and the statements of his deputy, will not initiate military action against Iran. He does not want to start wars and Iran is not his war, but there are certainly wars of others in which he can help. In doing so, Trump is effectively resolving for himself the contradiction between the desire to be a peacemaker and the ability to help Israel win on various fronts. In addition to the president, Netanyahu is also expected to meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz , House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and Senator Lindsey Graham. In the meetings he will hold, the parties will also discuss the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court in The Hague against Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and the imposition of sanctions on ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan and his team. In addition, they will talk about the continued transfer of weapons from the U.S. to Israel, the maintenance of the cease-fire in Lebanon, the attitude toward the new regime in Syria, and the beginning of discussions on the security memorandum of understanding between the countries, with the current memorandum set to expire in 2028. During his visit, Netanyahu will meet with his wife Sara, who is expected to join him from Miami after not seeing each other for 70 days. This is the first time Netanyahu has flown abroad since the arrest warrant was issued against him, and Sara said she will return to Israel with him on the Wing of Zion official airplane after extending her stay in the U.S. several times. Phase 2 of the cease-fire and hostage deal Negotiations on the second phase of the hostage deal and the cease-fire, which have actually already begun behind closed doors but not formally, are scheduled to begin on Monday - on the 16th day after the cease-fire in the Gaza Strip comes into effect, as stipulated in the agreement. But on Saturday night Netanyahu announced that he will not send a team to Doha or Cairo, and right now it appears that the talks will be conducted in dialogues through envoy Steve Witkoff. Netanyahu holds onto promises from former President Joe Biden (in writing) and President Trump (oral), which state that Israel will be able to return to fighting in the Gaza Strip without it being considered a 'violation' as long as no agreements are reached in negotiations. But, it is clear to everyone that it is much more complex. The Americans are busy building pillars for strategic policy, and Trump is likely to ask - and even demand - the prime minister for more time, and not to return to fighting. From the statements made this week by Donald Trump's Middle East envoy , Steve Witkoff, it can also be understood that the administration does not want to see a return to fighting so quickly - and demands that the negotiations be exhausted to the end. However, voices can be heard in the administration expressing doubt about the ability to fully implement the agreement. As part of the negotiations on phase two of the deal, the parties are also supposed to discuss the issue of 'the day after' in Gaza, which is related to a crucial decision that may be made at the Netanyahu-Trump meeting - the answer to the question of what comes first: dealing with the Iranian threat or normalization with Saudi Arabia . The U.S. and Israel know that the Saudis will not come to the table unless there is a permanent cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and a 'political horizon' for the Palestinians, and it is still unclear as to what exactly it will demand from Israel in general and Netanyahu in particular on a practical or declarative level. It is not impossible that Netanyahu will try to convince Trump during their meeting to deal with the Iranian threat first. He will argue that this will also serve the interests of the Saudis and will give them time, without pressure, to make decisions regarding the Gaza Strip.

In such a scenario, Trump could tell the prime minister: Before Iran, first end the war and return all the hostages. If you don't do this, you will get nothing - neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran. Therefore, if Netanyahu fails to convince Trump, and the American president insists on continuing the deal, he may in effect set a date for early elections in Israel. Either way, the prime minister plans to stay in the U.S. over next weekend - during the next round of the hostages' release. Netanyahu's intention is evident from the fact that, in a referendum on filling his position in his absence that was brought to the government, the ministers were asked to confirm that Netanyahu would stay in the U.S. between February 2 and February 9. His place will be filled by Minister Yariv Levin, and the cabinet meetings will be chaired by Defense Minister Israel Katz. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1liv73dkg	2025-02-01T14:32:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/07/23/ryxHzeETdC/ryxHzeETdC_0_68_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Keith thought his son had been murdered, then heard his voice on ...	The three hostages released Saturday spoke of appalling conditions including lack of food and frequent moves to new hiding places; Keith was forced to eat meat despite being a vegetarian; and Yarden Bibas, who learned Arabic in captivity, was imprisoned in a cage with Ofer Calderon and was subjected to physical and mental abuse. Keith Siegel, Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon returned to Israel Saturday morning after 484 days in captivity, during which they were held in very difficult conditions. Upon their return, they said they suffered from a lack of food and often were moved from place to place by Hamas terrorists. Keith was held in Gaza City, where he stayed with other hostages and moved between safe houses and tunnels. The terrorists locked him in a room each time, so that he could not be found if anyone broke in. Keith, according to a report on the public broadcaster, Kan, recalls the days of his captivity in detail - and said that he thought his son Shai had been murdered until he heard his voice on the radio and realized that he was alive. His wife, Aviva, did not know what had happened to her son until the day she was released from captivity in the previous hostage deal and saw him. Keith also described how he was forced to eat meat despite being a vegetarian, and that he ate it when it was given to him since he received very little food. The last time he ate before he was released was Friday afternoon. In addition, the public broadcaster reported that Yarden Bibas learned Arabic in captivity, and that the terrorists treated Ofer Calderon as a military reservist - which is why he was released in a military uniform. Yarden and Ofer said that during their first days of captivity in Khan Younis the terrorists beat them and locked them in cages - as described by the hostages who were with them and who were released in the previous deal. The two were subjected to severe physical and mental abuse, and were held in tunnels and buildings alongside other hostages. Among other things, the cruel video in which Yarden was filmed while the terrorists informed him of the death of his wife Shiri and his children Ariel and Kfir is particularly memorable - a statement that Israel has so far been unable to verify or discount. When Ofer arrived at the collection point with the IDF on Saturday, he asked the soldiers for a beer - but because of he was weak and just out of captivity he was told that it could only be done gradually. All three of the hostages who returned Saturday testified that they were exposed to the media, especially Al Jazeera, and that they saw the demonstrations for their release. According to them, the protests gave them strength and hope that they would eventually be reunited with their families. At Ichilov Hospital, where Keith Siegel was taken, Deputy Director General Professor Gil Fire said this evening that 'an initial assessment of his condition revealed that his condition is overall fine and stable, allowing him to spend time with his family, both to rest and to process the experiences of the last few days and the entire period. We will continue to accompany Keith and Mr. Gadi Mozes and examine in more depth the effects of the captivity. We will provide them with everything they need, including ancillary services. We will continue to keep them in the hospital as long as their medical condition requires and also provide additional tests, according to their wishes and those of their families.'

We must ensure that the rounds of release continue and move on to phase two of the deal as quickly as possible. We are there for my father, hugging him, and asking to maintain the privacy of my father and the family.' The other hostages who were returned in the current deal also spoke of food shortages, being moved from place to place and even being forced to stay in tunnels. Two of them - Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Mozes, who were held by Islamic Jihad - said they were alone for the entire period, and in fact the first time they saw an Israeli was when they met each other before they were released. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjewsw200yl	2025-02-01T12:01:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/B1yuXpj00yl/B1yuXpj00yl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Israel's next IDF chief of staff: Eyal Zamir	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have chosen Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, director general of the Defense Ministry, to be the first Chief of Staff to come from the Armored Corps since David (Dado) Elazar in the early 1970s; Next month, he will replace Herzi Halevi, who congratulated Zamir: 'I am sure he will lead the IDF forward' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz have selected Eyal Zamir, a retired major general and director general of the Defense Ministry, to be the next IDFchief of staff. His appointment still requires the approval of the advisory committee for senior appointments - the Grunis Committee - and the official and final approval of the government. Assuming he passes successfully, Zamir - who was previously identified as the leading candidate for the position - is expected to take office on March 6, upon the resignation of outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. In doing so, Zamir will be the first chief of staff to come from the Armored Corps since David (Dado) Elazar in the 1970s. Zamir, 59, has been considered the leading candidate to succeed Halevi due to his experience, authority and professionalism, and mainly due to his views that opposed a small army. He is also considered a leading candidate by Netanyahu. At the 2021 Deputy Chief of Staff exchange ceremony, Zamir sounded a warning, stating that 'in the face of a multi-threat campaign, the IDF needs a critical mass of quality and quantity.' Senior political figures said of his candidacy that 'Zamir is the leading candidate for the position of the next Chief of Staff. He is accepted by the top brass of the country, and the right man to bring about healing to the army after the October 7 debacle.' Zamir, the former deputy chief of staff, is also considered very popular with many army officers. He has been involved in force building over the past year and has had excellent relations with the Americans. Since the beginning of the Iron Swords war, Zamir has been involved in an unprecedented purchase of weapons from the United States, including purchase deals for fighter jets and armaments, and also in increasing local production in Israel in the defense industries. As soon as he takes office, he will face major challenges: the immediate appointment of a deputy chief of staff, and a new commander of the Southern Command to replace Major General Yaron Finkelman, who retired. Zamir served in the IDF for 38 years in a variety of senior combat and command positions, including commander of the Southern Command and commander of the Ga'ash Division. In his last position in the army, which he held between 2018 and 2021, he served as Deputy Chief of Staff under Aviv Kochavi. During this period, he coordinated the headquarters' work to implement the multi-year Tnufa (Momentum) plan, and managed all military assistance to the civilian sector during the COVID-19 pandemic and during Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. Before becoming Deputy Chief of Staff, Zamir served as Commander of the Southern Command and as the Prime Minister's Military Secretary. Before that, he was also IDF Ground Forces Chief.

In the coming weeks, we will complete a professional and high-quality transfer of command of the IDF.' The candidates were interviewed by Defense Minister Israel Katz, and at the end of the week by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

We are together until the end ' Doron Steinbrecher , who was released from Hamas captivity in the first phase of the current deal, sent her first video message to the participants of the rally in Hostages' Square Saturday evening. 'The last time I sat like this with a camera pointed at me, it was in captivity, and this whole thing sends me back to all the videos of captivity that I filmed and saw,' she began. 'But this time I'm sitting comfortably on a couch, in a warm and cozy place, with my family looking at me - and no matter how difficult it is, it was important to me to film this video.' Steinbrecher said that 'I want you to see me, that I'm okay, and that it will take more time and it's a process that doesn't end in a week or two - but I'm here thanks to you. Thank you to all the people who embraced my family and are embracing me now, people who don't even know me. It's important for me to also say thank you to all the soldiers and security forces. I sit here to see and contemplate everything that was here in this crazy year - and I see what an important and huge part they played both on October 7 and after.' Steinbrecher then addressed the families of the hostages who remained in captivity: 'You are not alone, and we continue to fight for you. We will do everything, I will do everything, until everyone returns home and until you can close the circle. We are together until the end. The first second I can leave here, I will be there with a sign in my hand.'

And how afraid I was to imagine this moment. 471 days of a long journey, in which optimism cracked time and time again, but hope – it always remained there, burning within us. The emotions are mixed – there is such great joy and gratitude, but also great anxiety. We must not be confused by the sights, we must not sink into euphoria.

Trump says he ordered airstrikes on Islamic State in Somalia	U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered military airstrikes on Saturday targeting a senior Islamic State attack planner and others from the organization in Somalia. 'These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our Allies,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. 'The strikes destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians.' Saturday's strikes were carried out in the Golis Mountains, said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who added that an initial assessment indicated multiple operatives were killed. He said no civilians were harmed. An official in the Somali president's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the strikes and said Somalia's government welcomed the move. 'Somalia cannot be a safe haven for terrorists,' said the official, adding that the impact of the strikes was still being assessed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syzqu13d1x	2025-02-01T09:32:36-08:00	
Defense minister threatens released terrorist Zubeidi: ' One mist...	Israel Katz sent a message to the former commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, saying that 'We will not accept support for terrorism'; Zakaria Zubeidi has complained since his release about torture in prison Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened released terrorist prisoner Zakaria Zubeidi, who was released on Thursday as part of the hostage deal, saying on Saturday evening that: 'We will not accept support for terrorism. One mistake and you’re going to meet old friends.' Zubeidi, a symbol of terrorism in Jenin who was formerly the commander of Fatah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in the Palestinian city in northern Samaria, was welcomed as a hero during celebrations in Ramallah on Thursday, making a V-shaped sign of victory and saying: 'Thanks be to Allah who blessed me with liberation today. May God have mercy on the martyrs in Gaza.' When asked about reports that Israel would not allow him to return to the Jenin refugee camp, where he was born and raised and where the IDF's major Operation Iron Wall is currently underway, he promised that he would eventually return. 'The dragon is the owner of the land and the hunter is an invader – and he must leave,' replied Zubeidi, referring to the nickname he was given in Jenin, and to Israel by 'the hunter.' The origin of these nicknames is the thesis he prepared for his master's degree at Birzeit University, titled 'The Hunter and the Dragon: Being Wanted in the Palestinian Experience 1968-2018.' Zubeidi, as he defines it, embodies the character of 'the dragon,' which originates from an ancient legend in which the dragon overcomes the hunter, after a long and difficult chase, referring to his personal experience with Israel. In an interview with the Turkish news agency Anadolu, Zubeidi claimed that he suffered torture in prison. 'I was beaten in Israeli prisons and remained handcuffed until the last day,' he alleged. 'For three and a half years I was in solitary confinement under torture in Israeli prisons. Gaza returned me to my family and we must unite to rebuild it.' In an interview with the British Sky News network on Saturday, Zubeidi said: 'My life is worth nothing without freedom, and freedom has no price - but the world has ignored my freedom - especially Britain, France and the U.S. They must return what they took from me and my children. They are the ones who were wrong about us - and they need to think about repairing the pain they caused me and my children.' Zubeidi, 49, began his career as a police officer in the Palestinian Authority, but became a terrorist whose main activity took place after Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, which brought about the end of the Second Intifada. He then became a very well-known figure in Israel, mainly due to his ties with Israeli left-wing activist Tali Fahima, who aided Palestinian terrorists, which attracted a lot of media attention. He is one of the senior terrorist operatives in the West Bank and is among the terrorists included in the 'wanted persons agreement' that was formulated in 2007 after the intifada, at which time he ceased to be wanted. Zubeidi was appointed as the representative of the Prisoners' Office in the Jenin refugee camp, and later also served as a member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council. In early 2019, he was arrested and imprisoned following several shooting attacks in the Beit El area. In 2021, he managed to escape from Gilboa prison, along with five other terrorists, and was only captured after a five-day extensive manhunt. Zubeidi had previously spent many years in an Israeli prison, for being the commander of Fatah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Jenin.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byl0acsoke	2025-02-01T09:30:19-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/SkSLePKuye/SkSLePKuye_0_163_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Dad, you’re a hero!': Keith Siegel's emotional homecoming from G...	Wrapped in Israeli flag, Siegel returns to Israel after 484 days in Hamas captivity, waving to supporters at hospital; his wife Aviva tearfully exclaims, 'He looks good!' His daughter Shir calls him a 'champion' Israeli American hostage Keith Siegel returned to Israel on Saturday after 484 days in Hamas captivity, reuniting with his family in an emotional meeting at Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. Siegel, who was released at Gaza’s seaport, was transferred to Israeli security forces and documented smiling and waving before crossing into Israel. After undergoing an initial medical evaluation at a reception center near Gaza, he was flown by helicopter to the hospital, where he walked out wrapped in an Israeli flag alongside his wife, Aviva, who was freed in a previous hostage release deal. Ignoring a wheelchair offered to him, Siegel waved to the crowd as Aviva tearfully exclaimed, 'He looks good!' Their daughter, Shir, shared a celebratory message on social media: 'Our dad is home!!!' In video footage from the hospital, Siegel’s children embraced him, saying, 'Dad, you made it! You're amazing for surviving!' to which he replied, 'You are the amazing ones.' Family members described their relief and gratitude. 'Finally, we can breathe again,' said Siegel’s nephew Gil. 'It feels like a dream. We’re waiting for the hug we’ve missed for so long.' The family prepared Siegel’s favorite meal—pancakes—for his return. 'This will be his first treat, but the real gift is the huge hug from all of us,' Gil added. The family also vowed to keep fighting for those still held in Gaza. 'This is not over until the last hostage comes home,' said Siegel’s nephew, Itay, who noted that another relative, Elia Cohen, remains in captivity. Former hostage Emily Damari, who was freed last month, watched Siegel’s release with Shir, writing on Instagram: 'What a moment of true joy. We won’t stop until Gali, Ziv and all the hostages are home,' referring to Gali and Ziv Berman, who were abducted from Kfar Aza. Siegel was abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7 and was released quietly compared to the chaotic handover of hostages in previous days. He was briefly placed on a stage at the transfer site, where he waved while wearing a cap. Hamas handed him two plastic bags, with reports suggesting one contained belongings for his wife, Aviva. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a statement, the Siegel family expressed overwhelming gratitude. 'At this moment, our father sets foot on Israeli soil, and we are overwhelmed with indescribable emotion. After 484 long, terrifying days filled with immense worry, we can finally breathe. We thank the Israeli and U.S. governments for making this deal happen—one that prioritizes human life and Jewish and Israeli values.' The statement also called for continued efforts to bring back all remaining hostages. 'Our father was cruelly taken from his home, and today he returns. As citizens, it is our duty to ensure that every hostage is brought back—those still alive to their families and those murdered to be laid to rest on Israeli soil.' Ahead of his release, Aviva Siegel was visibly emotional as she prepared to reunite with her husband for the first time since her own release. 'The big day has arrived! I’m so happy, happier than I could ever be,' she told her daughter Shir in a video message. 'I’m ready with everything. I’m going!' Shir responded with excitement: 'See you with Dad!' The hostages’ reception center at Re’im saw another emotional reunion earlier in the day when Jordan Bibas and Ofer Calderon were also freed. Israel is set to release 183 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages under the fourth phase of the cease-fire deal. 'Words can’t describe the joy we feel' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Office welcomed the release of Siegel from Hamas captivity, saying, 'The Israeli government embraces the return of Keith Siegel. His family has been informed by the relevant authorities that he has joined our forces. The government, along with all security agencies, will continue to support him and his family.' Friends from Kibbutz Kfar Aza gathered to watch Siegel’s release. Mor Yitzhak (Pitsu), one of his longtime friends, recalled, 'We met at Ruhama’s clubhouse and watched Keith’s release together—it was incredibly emotional. Keith had pre-existing medical conditions, so Aviva was worried about whether he would survive without proper treatment. We’ve known Keith since he moved to the kibbutz—he’s a quiet, introverted person. We were closer to Aviva because our daughter used to work with her after school and admired her as a caregiver.' Yitzhak noted that Siegel appeared to be in relatively good condition. 'Keith has always been thin, and I didn’t notice anything unusual,' he said. 'He looked pale, unshaven and unkempt, which is unlike him—he was a salesman and always well-groomed. I was afraid I’d see him in worse shape. Words can’t describe the joy we feel. But for the Kfar Aza community, we’re still waiting for Gali and Ziv. Over 70 people remain in Hamas captivity, and every passing day makes their situation worse.' Hagai Horowitz, another resident of Kfar Aza, described the relief of seeing the helicopters arriving in the morning. 'So much happiness for the Siegel family. Keith is a dear man returning home. Now, our hearts are with Gali and Ziv—we must do everything to bring them back.' Two of Siegel’s friends, Hila Sagiv and Ora Lavi, prepared a welcome sign and waited for his arrival near Re’im. 'We’re here for Keith, so that even for a moment, he sees us and feels the warmth—that he knows we’ve been waiting for him,' they said. 'We imagine our first reunion and going back to our favorite restaurant. We know recovery will take time.' Ora added, 'When Aviva came back, I made signs and got ready, but I missed the moment. Today, I’ve been here since 8 a.m.—I won’t miss it this time.' Keith Siegel, 65, was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza alongside his wife, Aviva. She was freed in November 2023 after 51 days in captivity. Following her release, Aviva recalled that during their time in captivity, when Hamas filmed them, Keith told her not to cry so their children would see her as strong. However, in April 2024, Hamas released a video showing Siegel alongside fellow hostage Omri Miran, visibly distressed and crying. His daughter Shir explained, 'I felt like this was his way of showing us how much he was struggling and asking us to get him out already.' On Friday, Shir posted an emotional video embracing her mother. 'Dad is on the list—he's coming home!' she exclaimed. Keith Siegel immigrated to Israel from the United States at the age of 21 and worked as an occupational therapist. In December 2024, while he was still held captive in Gaza, his mother passed away. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skpkecsuyg	2025-02-01T08:10:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/By2zb3jdyl/By2zb3jdyl_0_0_1426_951_0_small.jpg

The fall of Assad: A predetermined outcome	Syrian rebels toppled Bashar Assad’s regime in just 11 days, seizing Damascus after years of internal dissent; expert Dr. Mordechai Kedar says Assad’s fall was inevitable due to his regime’s lack of legitimacy On November 27, 2024, the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect, and within mere days, the long-awaited rebellion in Syria exploded into action. In just 11 days, Syrian rebels seized the opportunity to overthrow Bashar Assad’s regime. By the time the dust settled, Syria was under the control of a coalition of rebels, Damascus was in their hands, and Assad had fled to Russia. The speed and intensity of the collapse of Syria has shocked the world, but for Lt. Col. (res.) Dr. Mordechai Kedar, a member of the 'Securityists' movement and a prominent expert on the Middle East, it was not unexpected. Dr. Kedar, whose writings on the legitimacy of the Assad regime date back decades, argues that the collapse of Syria was foreseeable. 'Syria is a hollow country,' Kedar states, as 'the people never believed in the regime, and the army was unwilling to die for it.' His 2005 book Asad in Search of Legitimacy chronicles the Baathist regime's fruitless efforts to establish itself as a legitimate governing force in Syria. In his view, the Assad family never earned the legitimacy of their people, ruling instead through force and repression. This lack of legitimacy, Dr. Kedar explains, can be traced back to 1966, when the minority Alawite regime took over Syria. To the Sunni Muslim majority, the Alawites were considered infidels. The Alawite rulers, recognizing the lack of public support for their regime, understood the necessity of establishing an iron-fisted dictatorship instead to secure their grip on power. The suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1980s, including the infamous Hama Massacre in 1982, solidified the Assad family’s reputation for merciless repression. However, Kedar argues that this strategy was always destined to fail. The regime’s foundation was inherently unstable because it never had popular support. The regime’s inevitable collapse of the regime was a consequence of this lack of legitimacy. Still, the speed at which the rebels took control was aided by more than just internal dissent. The timing was also crucial. The weakened state of the Assad regime, following Hezbollah’s war against Israel, had left it vulnerable. The opposition forces, many of whom had been exiled to Idlib for years, were then poised to strike the moment the regime’s attention wavered. Rebel groups, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, linked to Al-Qaeda), then launched a surprise offensive that quickly gained momentum. Their rapid victories in Aleppo, Hama, and Homs were followed by uprisings from Druze and Bedouin populations in the south, culminating in the fall of Damascus. Despite their ideological differences, the rebels managed to unite to overthrow Assad. Yet, not all rebel groups share the same agenda. Some moderate groups even express a willingness to work with Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One rebel leader even declared that the true victory would be when Israeli flags fly over the Iranian embassies in Damascus and Amman. This sentiment reveals an interesting dynamic in the rebellion: the desire to eliminate Iranian and Hezbollah influence in the region. However, while the fall of the Assad regime may seem like a victory for freedom and democracy, the future of Syria is uncertain. Syria remains a deeply divided country, with ethnic, religious, and tribal groups historically at odds. For this reason, if Syria falls into the hands of Islamist groups, it could disintegrate into chaos. However, such a scenario may be preferable to a unified Iran-backed Syria under Assad. Israel is preparing for any outcome following the regime collapse, including the rise of extremist groups. The IDF has concentrated forces in the strategically vital Golan Heights and strengthened its positions on the Syrian border in anticipation of potential fallout. The uncertainty surrounding Syria’s future has already prompted Israel to take preventative measures as Israel would prefer to deal with ISIS-style militias over the strategic threat posed by an Iran-backed regime. Israel cannot afford to be caught unprepared, as it was on October 7, 2023, when a surprise attack from Hezbollah put the country on high alert. While the outcome of the rebellion in Syria is yet to be determined, the fall of the Assad regime was almost inevitable. Syria's lack of national unity, its sectarian divisions, and the regime’s lack of legitimacy created a powder keg that only needed the right spark to ignite. What follows, however, remains unpredictable. Whether Syria will emerge as a modern, liberal state or a failed, fragmented one remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that the collapse of the Assad regime marks a turning point in Middle East security, with significant implications for the broader region. Jennifer Teale is a researcher at the Israel Defense and Security Forum. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkaiu2s001l	2025-02-01T06:23:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/19/BJky9lGBye/BJky9lGBye_0_55_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Yarden Bibas returns to ‘unbearable reality,’ says family – Insid...	Freed hostage Yarden Bibas arrives at Sheba Medical Center, where he saw his mother for the first time; amid fears for his wife and sons still in captivity, his family urges: 'A quarter of our heart is back—respect his privacy' Yarden Bibas arrived at Sheba Medical Center on Saturday after 484 days in Hamas captivity, where medical staff are preparing for intensive psychological and physical care. Footage from his release highlighted the emotional toll he endured, and medical teams are bracing for the possibility that his psychological recovery will be even more challenging than the physical rehabilitation. His family—parents Pnina and Eli and sister Ofri—have remained by his side, staying in his hospital room and requesting privacy. In their first statement, the Bibas family expressed relief and heartbreak: 'Yarden is home. A quarter of our heart has returned after 15 long months. Words cannot describe the relief of holding him again, hearing his voice. But the home is incomplete. Yarden is a father who left his shelter to protect his family, survived captivity with immense bravery and has now returned to a unbearable reality.' The family urged the public to respect Yarden’s need for privacy. 'Please give him the space he needs for his body and soul to begin healing. Thank you to our incredible people, to our soldiers and to those who sacrificed their lives to make this day possible. We will take time to reunite with Yarden, but our fight continues. Shiri, Ariel and Kfir must come home, along with all the hostages. Please amplify their voices, now more than ever. For Yarden, for all of them—we will not stop until they are home.' Medical staff, initially concerned by his condition upon release, were encouraged to see Yarden smiling after reuniting with his loved ones. Aboard the military helicopter transporting him to Sheba, he posed with his sister and father, holding a board on which he wrote: 'I want to thank the people of Israel for their support. I heard from my family how you fought for me, and I deeply appreciate it. It’s not taken for granted.' He also sent birthday wishes to his grandfather Yechiel, writing, 'Happy 90th, Grandpa!' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Bibas family had prepared for the possibility that Yarden would be released before his wife Shiri and their young sons, Kfir and Ariel. In recent weeks, Israeli officials demanded clear answers from Hamas regarding their fate, as they were supposed to be among the first hostages released under the terms of the deal. So far, no new information has emerged, intensifying fears for their well-being. Speaking to Ynet earlier this week, Ofri Bibas-Levi said the family was bracing for another wave of uncertainty. 'We aren’t making preparations—at most, we are thinking practically about logistics. But there’s no home to return to. One phase ends, another begins, filled with unknowns. That’s terrifying,' she said. 'I know we are heading into another storm. Life will turn upside down again, and I have no way to prepare.' Jimmy Miller, Shiri's cousin, spoke this week in an interview with Ynet, expressing the family’s anguish over the lack of information. 'What will we tell Yarden if he is freed before his wife and children?' Miller asked. 'What will we say to him? We have no words. These are difficult times—our worst nightmare.' On October 7, Hamas terrorists brutally abducted Yarden from Kibbutz Nir Oz. Video footage showed him being beaten and dragged into Gaza, his face covered in blood. A later Hamas propaganda video depicted him speaking about his wife and children, who were kidnapped separately, likely under duress with words dictated by his captors. He turned 35 in captivity. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj4bghio1e	2025-02-01T05:48:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/rygiPZ5oOyl/rygiPZ5oOyl_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

In a statement representatives of Egypt, Jordan, Saud Arabia, UAE say the Trump plan would threaten regional stability, risk expanding the conflict and undermine prospects for peace Powerful Arab nations on Saturday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League released a joint statement rejecting any plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the West Bank. The statement warned that such plans 'threaten the region’s stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples.' The statement followed a meeting in Cairo of top diplomats from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as Hussein al-Sheikh — a senior Palestinian official who serves as the main liaison with Israel — and Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul-Gheit. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday rejected the idea that Egypt would facilitate the displacement of Gazans and said Egyptians would take to the streets to express their disapproval. He told a news conference that the transfer of Palestinians 'can’t ever be tolerated or allowed.' 'The solution to this issue is the two-state solution. It is the establishment of a Palestinian state,' he said. 'The solution is not to remove the Palestinian people from their place. No.' However, on Thursday, Trump reiterated the idea, saying: 'We do a lot for them, and they are going to do it,' in apparent reference to abundant U.S. aid, including military assistance, to both Egypt and Jordan. told a news conference that the transfer of Palestinians 'can’t ever be tolerated or allowed.' The representatives who met in Cairo said they discussed the need to maintain the cease-fire in Gaza and the options for the mechanism to enable the Palestinian Authority (PA)to play a role in ruling the Strip.

Rafah crossing, Gaza's gateway to the world opens	50 sick and wounded children, likely from families of senior Hamas members and 61 escorts crossed the Rafah border into Egypt from Gaza under the eye of PA officials as part of the cease-fire deal On Saturday and for the first time since the IDF took control of the Rafah border with Egypt last May, 50 Gazans who were sick or injured, and 61 people who accompanied them, left the Gaza Strip through the border crossing dubbed Gaza's gateway to the world. According to the cease-fire and hostage exchange deal, some 200 people, including 50 in need of medical treatment and three people to accompany each of them, are to leave Gaza for Egypt, daily. Most of those who were taken through the border crossing on Saturday were children although Hamas was to transfer the wounded among its terror force. But the families of members of the terror group were also among the injured. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement released by his office (PMO) that Israel had oversight of the crossings and the authority to block any if that were decided. Netanyahu had previously insisted that the border must remain under IDF control to prevent Hamas for rebuilding its military strength. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas had smuggled some of its weaponry through the crossing before the war began after the Oct. 7 massacre and after it started, trucks carrying humanitarian aid came across the border into the Strip. But in the deal, Israel agreed that its troops would not be present at the Rafah border crossing but would maintain a presence on the Philadelphi Corridor. Netanyahu also vowed that there would be no Palestinian Authority involvement there but today, PA officials were on hand to ensure the border's operations.

Military says relied on erroneouse intelligence last December when it announced the death of the Shati camp commander Hitham Khawajari after a similar revalation last month The IDF said on Saturday that it was wrong to announce the death of a Hamas commander who was seen in the release of Keith Siegal on the shores of Gaza. Hitham Khawajari,who was commander of the Shati refugee camp battalion for Hamas was announced to have been killed last December in an air force strike. 'After the strike it was determined with high probability that he was killed,' the IDF said. Further investigation revealed the intelligence information our assumption was based on in the military intelligence and the Shin Bet was wrong.' In a separate incident last month images appeared of Hussein Fiyad, commander of the Beit Hanoun Hamas battalion when he participated in a funeral procession.

Most of 183 Palestinians released by Israel to be transfered to G...	After completion of the release of Israeli Yarden Bibas, Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegal, Israel will free 18 terrorists sentenced to life behind bars and over 100 Gazans detained after the Oct. 7 massacre The Prison Authority on Saturday said that a prisoner who was to be released from Ktziot Prison as part of the release of terrorists in exchange for Israeli hostages, felt unwell and was taken to the prison health clinic. After the release from Hamas captivity of Yarden Bibas, Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegal on Saturday, Israel will begin to release 183 Palestinian prisoners, 143 of which will leave the Ktziot Prison in the South and be transferred by the Red Cross to Gaza. There are 18 men who have been sentenced to life in prison, among those being freed. Hamas said on Friday that 54 prisoners given life sentences and 111 residents of Gaza who were detained by Israeli forces after the October massacre, will be released. According to the cease-fire agreement, 1,000 Gazans in total, all of whom had not participated in the atrocities but were detained after them, will be freed. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: An official for the prison authorities said preparations for the release of the Palestinian prisoners began overnight. 'They were given medical examinations, were seen by the Red Cross and we are now awaiting the order to release them from jail,' he said. Hamas named among those to be freed, Shadi Amori who was sentenced to 17 years in jail for participating in the acquisition and preparation of a car bomb that exploded in the Megiddo junction, killing 17 people, Ashraf Abu Sror, who was found guilty in the fatal shooting of an IDF soldier near Bethlehem in 2000 and Ahmed Salim, from the Fatah movement who was involved in the murder of Avi and Avital Walensky in a West Bank terror attack in 2002. After completion of the release on Saturday, Israel would have freed 583 Palestinians from its jails. At the end of the first phase of the deal, Israel will have freed 290 prisoners sentenced to life out of a total of 2,000. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj6p0vodyx	2025-02-01T02:26:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/ryrdOGMdJe/ryrdOGMdJe_0_96_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Tears of joy: Ofer sees his kids, Yarden hugs his father and Keit...	Ofer Calderon lands at Sheba Medical Center, greeted by cheering friends and family; Yarden Bibas reunites with his father and sister in emotional embrace; Keith Siegel returns to Israel as his wife watches his release: 'He looks good!' Israeli hostages Ofer Calderon, Yarden Bibas and Keith Siegel returned to Israel on Saturday after 484 days in Hamas captivity. Calderon arrived by military helicopter at Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer, where friends greeted him with cheers and sang, 'How good it is that you came home.' Bibas, whose wife Shiri and two young sons remain in captivity, reunited with his father and sister at the Re’im reception center near the Gaza border. Siegel, released separately from Gaza’s port area, was transferred to Israeli forces before crossing into Israel. His daughter, Shira, shared her joy on social media, writing: 'Our dad is home!' Aviva Siegel, Keith’s wife, who was freed in a previous hostage deal, tearfully watched his release, exclaiming, 'There he is! He looks good!' Bibas also arrived by helicopter at Sheba Medical Center, where medical teams were prepared to provide physical and psychological care. 'These are incredibly sensitive moments for the returning hostages and their families,' the Health Ministry said, urging privacy. President Isaac Herzog described Bibas’s reunion with his family as 'heartbreaking' and reiterated the nation’s deep concern for the fate of Shiri and the children, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, who remain in Hamas captivity. 'All of Israel stands with Yarden and his family in worry and prayer,' Herzog said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Unlike previous releases, where chaos erupted as hostages were handed over, Saturday’s transfer of Calderon and Bibas from Hamas to the Red Cross in Khan Younis was relatively smooth. Siegel, released about two hours later from Gaza’s port area, was briefly paraded before Hamas gunmen before being handed over. According to reports from Gaza, Hamas also gave him two bags—one reportedly intended for his wife, Aviva Siegel. Following the traumatic scenes during Thursday’s hostage release in Khan Younis, Israeli officials had expressed deep concerns over the security of the hostages and protested to mediators. Hamas appeared to heed the message, avoiding large crowds at Saturday’s handover. As part of the ongoing hostage deal, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners, including 18 serving life sentences. Most—143 prisoners—will be transferred to Gaza. The Israel Prison Service (IPS) reported an unusual incident during the prisoner selection process at Ketziot Prison, reporting that 'one prisoner felt unwell and was treated by an IPS doctor at a designated medical facility.' The Hamas-run Ministry for Prisoners' Affairs in Gaza published a list of those expected to be released, which includes 54 convicted of serious offenses and 111 detainees arrested after October 7. According to the terms of the deal, Israel has agreed to release approximately 1,000 Palestinian detainees from Gaza who were arrested after the October 7 massacre but were not directly involved in the attack. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj9glujoje	2025-02-01T01:33:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/B1uwYwjOJl/B1uwYwjOJl_2_0_1279_720_0_small.jpg

Family vows to keep fighting for Shiri Bibas and her two sons amid growing fears for their fate, while pledging full support for Yarden’s long road to recovery After 484 days in Hamas captivity, Yarden Bibas returned to Israel on Saturday, but his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons remain unaccounted for. Their fate remains unknown, deepening the anguish surrounding his homecoming. 'We have mixed emotions that are difficult to put into words,' said his cousin, Oria Bibas. 'There’s immense relief, but the struggle is far from over. We are grateful to see Yarden standing on his own two feet and will do everything to support and help him heal.' She added that the family was also grappling with the difficult answers they would eventually have to provide him about his wife and children. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I hope we’ll soon be able to have a barbecue with the kind of good meat Yarden loves, when he’s ready, and maybe catch a rock concert—some music for the soul,' she said. 'But the fight isn’t over. We must hold on to hope and faith for Shiri and the boys.' Friends of Bibas gathered outside the Re’im military base, where he arrived after his release, holding signs and flags. 'It’s a moment of relief, but clearly, the road to recovery is long,' said Inbal Luzon. 'We will continue the fight for Shiri, the boys, and all the hostages still held in Gaza.' Danielle Aloni, who was held captive with Bibas before her release in the 2023 hostage deal, described him as strong, noble and a devoted father. She noted that both Bibas and fellow hostage Ofer Calderon, also freed on Saturday, were subjected to harsh treatment by Hamas, as their captors suspected them of having military ties—though she declined to provide further details. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b15p0uidye	2025-02-01T00:31:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/SkxRsNIj00yl/SkxRsNIj00yl_0_98_1140_642_0_small.jpg
Under pressure: Hamas avoids chaos in latest hostage releases aft...	After Israeli outrage, Saturday hostage releases proceed smoothly with Gaza crowds kept at bay; Yarden Bibas, Ofer Calderon and Keith Siegel are back in Israel After Israel expressed outrage over chaotic hostage releases earlier in the week, Hamas conducted a more orderly transfer of Israeli hostages Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon on Saturday. Unlike previous releases, there were fewer armed Hamas operatives on stage, and the ceremony was brief. Both hostages were made to wave at the cameras, but within minutes, the transfer to the Red Cross was complete. Israeli officials said they were satisfied with the smoother process, noting that it adhered to the agreed-upon plan. Hamas-affiliated media reported that the terror group had reduced the number of civilians allowed to attend the event at the request of cease-fire mediators. Reports also indicated that Hamas timed the release earlier in the day to prevent large crowds from gathering and to facilitate the opening of the Rafah border crossing, allowing wounded Palestinians to receive medical treatment in Egypt. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: As part of the negotiated deal, 50 wounded Palestinians are to be transferred out of Gaza daily, each accompanied by three escorts, with a total of 200 people crossing into Egypt per day, pending Israeli and Egyptian security vetting. The agreement also allows for the transfer of additional children, subject to Israeli approval. Bibas and Calderon entered Israel quickly following 484 days in captivity. Israeli officials credited diplomatic pressure for the improved conditions of the transfer. 'Israeli pressure worked,' one official said. 'Communication with the mediators is crucial, and it is proving effective.' According to Israeli estimates, 79 hostages remain in Gaza. Under the current agreement, 20 are set to be released in the first phase, with 12 believed to be alive. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkqrsus00je	2025-01-31T23:49:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/01/Hkmc2Lju1l/Hkmc2Lju1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The returning hostages: Yarden alone, Ofer’s fight for his life a...	Yarden returns without his family, Ofer asked his daughter to fight for him, Keith will finally be united with his wife Aviva; these are their stories Yarden Bibas is returning home on Saturday without his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons, Kfir and Ariel, who remain captive in Gaza. On Thursday, Israel demanded that Hamas disclose their fate after the terror group claimed early in the war that they had been killed, though it provided no proof. They were supposed to be released in the earlier hostage exchanges, before the IDF lookouts, but when that did not happen, concerns for their fate grew. 'Our Yarden is supposed to return tomorrow, and we are all so excited,' his family said in a statement on Friday. 'But Shiri and the kids have not come back. Our feelings are mixed, and we have complex days ahead of us,' they added, calling on the public to 'please respect Yarden's privacy and that of the family' in the coming days. Last Saturday, the IDF said that there was grave concern for the lives of Shiri and the two boys, who became symbols of Hamas atrocities when their abduction was filmed and spread worldwide by the terrorists in social media posts. Yarden’s abduction was also filmed, showing him being brutally beaten, blood streaming from head wounds as he was dragged into Gaza. In a video later released by Hamas as part of its psychological terror campaign, he spoke about his wife and children, who had been abducted separately. He was clearly reading from a dictated script. He turned 35 while in captivity. His sister, Ofri Bibas-Levi, said at the time that she did not know if Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were alive or where they were being held. 'Dodjy,' she said, using her affectionate nickname for her brother, 'we all love you very much. We miss you and can only hope that you are freed and returned to us.' She expressed hope that he would one day reunite with his wife and children to celebrate his next birthday, 'and before that, be here with us, have air to breathe, freedom, daylight – all those basic things that should be so obvious. If only he could have that,' she said. 'Thank God, what a perfect morning,' Ofer Calderon's daughter, Sahar, posted upon learning that her father would be returning home on Saturday. She and her brother, Erez, were also taken hostage and released after 52 days in captivity. Now, 432 days later, she and her father will finally reunite. 'The last words Ofer said to his children were for them to fight for his release,' his cousin Eyal told Ynet. 'He said he did not want to die in the tunnels.' Eyal said the family learned from freed hostages that Ofer had helped others stay hopeful. 'Just days after Sahar and Erez were released, Shani Goren was brought to the tunnels where Ofer was being held. He seemed optimistic and told her he would prepare food for her with whatever ingredients were available. He was sure he would be out within days.' Ofer and his two children were abducted from their home during the Hamas massacre. 'We thank President Trump for ensuring the deal and call on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli delegation not to delay the next phase of the agreement for even a minute and to ensure all the hostages—both the living and the dead—are returned,' Ofer's family said. Keith Siegel was abducted from his home with his wife, Aviva, during the massacre. Before she was released in 2023, Hamas filmed the couple. Aviva said Keith told her not to cry so that the children would see how strong they both were. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: However, in a later Hamas propaganda video, Keith appeared alongside fellow hostage Omri Miran, visibly crying. His daughter, Shira, said that was his way of signaling to the family that he was struggling and needed them to get him out. Shira posted a video of herself hugging her mother when she learned of his release. 'Daddy is on the list. He is coming,' she said. Keith immigrated to Israel from the United States at 21 and worked as an occupational therapist. His six-year-old grandson sent him a message: 'I love you and am waiting for you to come back.' Keith’s mother passed away last December while he was still in captivity. 'When I landed at the hospital and met our sweet children, I could not believe I was there without you,' Aviva wrote in a message to her husband. 'I was in shock for weeks before I could even understand that we had been torn apart and I was here without you.' Aviva recalled the small room in Gaza where she was told she had to leave him behind. 'I looked at you and saw the fear in your eyes, and you couldn’t say a word. I looked at you and said I would be strong for you, and I asked you to be strong for me. I swore to you, Keith, that this is all I think about every day and every night.' 'I stay strong for you so that you can survive and stay strong for me, for the kids, and for the grandkids. I hope you can survive there. I remember the tunnel we were taken into and left alone. Do you remember how hard it was to breathe? I remember looking at you, barely able to speak, and you said you couldn’t breathe,' she wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byp1g8ioyl	2025-01-31T22:52:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/Bk979M9d1l/Bk979M9d1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Calderon and Bibas released after 484 days in Gaza captivity; Keith Siegel to be freed in separate event Hamas once again set up a staged platform, as seen in previous releases Israeli hostages Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon were transferred by Hamas to Red Cross teams in Khan Younis on Saturday morning after 484 days in captivity. They are expected to join IDF forces in Gaza before heading back to Israeli territory. A third hostage, Keith Siegel, is expected to be released later in the day from the Gaza port area, according to reports. A security official said that the IDF is preparing for the transfer and safe return of the three hostages, but cautioned that the timeline remains subject to change. Following the chaotic and distressing images from the last hostage release in Khan Younis—when freed hostages Arbel Yehoud, Gadi Mozes and five Thai nationals were swarmed by crowds—Israel conveyed strong concerns to mediators, demanding better security measures. Similar incidents occurred in the first exchange, when released hostages Doron Steinbrecher, Emily Damari and Romi Gonen were surrounded by mobs in Gaza City. However, Israeli officials believe Hamas has adjusted its procedures after facing international backlash and does not plan a repeat of these scenes on Saturday. White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt reaffirmed U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to securing the release of all remaining hostages, saying, 'The president remains steadfast in his efforts to bring home every hostage who should never have been taken by the brutal terrorist organization Hamas. The White House welcomes the release of the eight additional hostages yesterday, thanks to a deal brokered by President Trump. They are finally reuniting with their families after enduring more than 15 months of inhumane captivity.'

Keith Siegel, Ofer Calderon, and Yarden Bibas will likely be released from Gaza City and Khan Younis early in the morning after 484 days in captivity; The Rafah crossing is expected to open to allow the evacuation of wounded Palestinians The fourth phase of the hostage release deal is expected to take place early Saturday morning, with Keith Siegel, Ofer Calderon, and Yarden Bibas set to be freed after 484 days in captivity. The three, abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza and Kibbutz Nir Oz, will likely be released from two different locations in Gaza—one from Gaza City and the other from Khan Younis. Bibas' wife, Shiri, and their two children, Kfir and Ariel, remain in captivity. Israeli officials have demanded a clear answer from Hamas regarding their status after they were not released in the initial phases of the deal, which prioritized women and children. Their absence has intensified fears about their condition, but no new information has been provided. After an initial medical assessment, the released hostages will be transported to Sourasky Medical Center and Sheba Medical Center. Barzilai Medical Center and Soroka Medical Center are on standby for emergency care if needed. As in previous releases, IDF forces will escort the hostages out of Gaza, bringing them to the reception center in Re’im, where they will receive preliminary treatment and reunite with their families before being transferred to hospitals for further evaluation. As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel will release 90 Palestinian prisoners—nine serving life sentences and 81 others with long-term sentences. However, Hamas’ Prisoners Affairs Office in Gaza has published a list of 183 names, including 18 life-sentence prisoners, 54 inmates serving lengthy terms, and 111 Gazan detainees arrested after October 7. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Among the notable names are Shadi Amouri, serving 17 life sentences for orchestrating the 2002 Megiddo Junction car bombing that killed 17 people; Ashraf Abu Srour, convicted of fatally shooting Israeli soldier Shahar Vekret near Rachel’s Tomb in 2000; and Ahmed Salim, a Fatah militant involved in the 2002 murder of Israeli couple Avi and Avital Wolanski in the West Bank. According to the list, 150 prisoners will be sent to Gaza, including seven lifers to be deported there, while 32 will be released to the West Bank. One prisoner, an Egyptian national, will be repatriated to Egypt. Israeli security forces are preparing for the release, aiming to prevent celebratory gatherings in the West Bank. For example, Border Police forces intervened in Abu Dis on Friday night after reports of planned festivities for a life-sentenced prisoner’s release. Meanwhile, the Rafah border crossing is expected to open on Saturday to allow the evacuation of wounded Palestinians—mostly Hamas operatives—to Egypt. Reports suggest up to 50 wounded individuals will be transferred daily, each accompanied by three escorts, totaling 200 people per day. Transfers will require approval from Israeli security agencies and Egyptian authorities. The deal also allows for additional Palestinian children to be evacuated if approved by Israel, which is unlikely to oppose such requests. As of now, 82 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, 23 of whom are expected to be freed in upcoming exchanges under the first phase of the agreement. Of those, 15 are alive, while eight are deceased. The remains of the fallen hostages are scheduled to be returned in the final two stages of the deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bypu63cokx	2025-01-31T12:59:31-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/Bk979M9d1l/Bk979M9d1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Some testimonies we collect come with a trigger warning'	Award-winning director Talya Tibbon discusses her unique methodology recording October 7 testimonies, the harrowing accounts collected and the contrast between the comfortable life abroad and the horrors she documents What is a historical narrative? Who gets to shape it and who decides how we remember a particular event, especially when it comes to a pivotal moment like October 7? Talya Tibbon is an award-winning documentary filmmaker who divides her time between London and New York. Her films have been featured on Netflix, Amazon, National Geographic and other major platforms. She transitioned to documentary filmmaking after a decade of working at CNN. Not an interviewer, but a listener Throughout her career, she has filmed on four continents—from the halls of the White House and the Pentagon to brothels in Mexico and remote villages in Laos, Nigeria, and Lapland. She has had the opportunity to meet and interview war refugees, drug dealers, trafficked women, senior CIA officials, and Native American tribal elders. All of this likely prepared her for what she has been doing for the past year as a volunteer with the Edut (Hebrew for testimony) 710 project, where she is part of the organization’s leadership and coordinates the research and English translation teams. 'I'm also learning new things because this is a different form of documentation than what I'm familiar with,' she says. 'The philosophy of Edut 710 essentially states that all the power lies with the witness, the interviewee. The interviewer is there as a Listener. The witness chooses what to focus on, what to talk about, and what not to talk about. We never push for more, never ask for additional information, and never direct the conversation. We are there only to listen.' 'There are three or four initial questions to start the conversation, and from there, all the power lies with the witness, including the decision whether to publish their testimony, given the highly sensitive nature of the situation.' The approach is based on the work of Professor Dori Laub, a psychiatrist who was the first to document on camera the testimonies of Holocaust survivors. Laub's therapeutic approach empowers the witness, allowing them to reclaim the narrative. 'Imagine a state of helplessness when uncontrollable things are happening around you,' Tibbon explains. 'You’re hiding behind a bush in the Nova festival or locked up in a safe room. When you talk about the experience, you’re reclaiming the story. You are no longer helpless; you’re building your narrative and your resilience.' What does it do to you as a listener? 'I find this fascinating. When people are allowed to lead the story, their thoughts surface, their emotions surface, and as a listener you receive a deeply personal account of the event: what the person felt, what they were afraid of, what the fear aroused in them. 'This openness, during which I just listen, brings about the realization that we are touching on places that are almost sacred. It’s a privilege to be there and to listen to these stories.' 'This testimony broke me' In the interview with Tibbon, she recounts filming the testimony of an American pathologist who volunteered to come to Israel and assist in identifying bodies. As someone who worked at some of the most severe murder scenes in Philadelphia and had identified 9/11 victims, she thought she had seen it all. But the extreme sights (of October 7 attack victims) she was exposed to at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, led her to call the institute’s director and make it clear that these were unequivocally war crimes. 'They brought her a lump of coal and she had to figure out what it was, and then she realized it was an adult and a child together. It was very important for her to give her testimony, and it wasn't easy, nor was it easy for me as a listener. These are things that are incredibly difficult to hear' 'She identified a case of someone who had been tied up with their hands behind their back and shot in the back of the head at close range. That's a war crime. That's an execution. She was the first to identify it, and being able to think in such a way in that situation is incredible.' 'They brought her a lump of coal and she had to figure out what it was, and then she realized it was an adult and a child together,' she adds. 'It was very important for her to give her testimony, and it wasn't easy, nor was it easy for me as a listener. These are things that are incredibly difficult to hear, which is why our testimonies come with a trigger warning.' Was there a testimony that particularly moved you? There are many. I choose to share the testimony of Amos Epstein from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, who lost his wife, his son-in-law and two grandchildren on October 7. He’s well into his 80s, one of the founders of the Western Negev communities. He gave his testimony with a choked voice in the face of the general and personal devastation, and while speaking, he relived the murder of his wife and family. That testimony broke me.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: I can hear that it's still difficult for you. I'm in a profession where I’ve learned to both feel and protect myself emotionally, but confronting the stories of October 7 was difficult, because even though I haven’t lived in Israel for many years, I am Israeli, and anyone who was hurt could have been my friend or a member of my family. 'Day-to-day it's strange for me to be abroad. Now, for instance ( we’re speaking in December) when everyone on the street is busy with Christmas, and I'm collecting testimonies. We're making an effort to reach as many witnesses as possible, and to build a digital archive that will document the event from every possible angle. For example, we're currently documenting, in the context of October 7, the medical staff at Soroka Medical Center, the Bedouin community, new immigrants, and Holocaust survivors who experienced the attacks.' Why is it important to divide testimonies into sub-groups? 'To hear perspectives from a wide variety of angles, including those that haven’t yet been part of the narrative. For example, we documented a group of medics, who shared experiences we hadn’t heard before, as well as joint testimonies from members of the local civilian emergency response teams. While many of those we’ve been collecting testimony from recount what they experienced inside their homes, their safe rooms, these are two groups that operated outside, in the line of fire, and the idea is to hear all the different narratives without judgment or a hierarchy of testimonies.' What is the difference between a testimony of a native-born Israeli and that of an immigrant? In the testimony of someone who grew up in the Western Negev, there’s an inherent understanding that they live in an amazing place, and that there is this terrible threat in the background. On the other hand, in the testimony of a new immigrant couple who fell in love with the Negev and brought their children there, we heard how living under these conditions and developing trauma is not a decision they take for granted at all. They are grappling with the question of how to build a future for their children within this reality, that they may feel deeply connected to, but for them, moving their family to this area wasn’t an obvious decision. 'The testimonies of Holocaust survivors are also fascinating because for those who survived the atrocities of World War II at the age of six or seven, and then experienced October 7, we can only guess what it had evoked in them. So the idea is to get as many perspectives as possible to preserve a memory that is as broad and inclusive as possible.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bjzy029001x	2025-01-31T12:36:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/10/SJ6mXMRU1x/SJ6mXMRU1x_0_259_1600_901_0_small.jpg
Freed Thai hostages talk about Hamas captivity: 'Struggled to bre...	A day after arriving in Israel following more than 15 months in Hamas captivity, five Thai nationals freed from Gaza described enduring relentless bombings and frequent hunger; 'Sometimes there was food, sometimes there wasn’t' one of them says A day after arriving in Israel following more than 15 months in Hamas captivity, five Thai nationals freed from Gaza are sharing new details about their time in captivity. In a meeting Friday with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, the former hostages described enduring relentless bombings and frequent hunger. 'Sometimes there was food, sometimes there wasn’t,' one of them said. The men—Sathian Suwannakham, 34; Pongsak Thenna, 35; Bannawat Seathao, 27; Watchara Sriaoun, 32; and Surasak Lamnau, 30—confirmed they were held underground in tunnels for the entire 482 days of their captivity. They struggled to breathe in the cramped conditions and were separated into two groups—two held together and the other three elsewhere. They said they communicated with their captors mainly in English but also learned some Arabic during their imprisonment. Since their release, they have spent hours on the phone reconnecting with their families in Thailand, who are expected to arrive in Israel soon at the government’s expense. Sa’ar praised their resilience, telling them, 'You are strong. I wish you and your families good health, freedom, and a good life.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Thailand’s ambassador to Israel, Pannabha Chandraramya, who accompanied Sa’ar on the visit, called their release 'the happiest day of my life,' adding, 'This is a day of good news for me, my country, and the world.' Dr. Osnat Levtzion-Korach, director of the hospital where the men are receiving care, said their condition is stable despite the severe hardships they endured. 'They suffered from extreme hunger, spending long periods with little to no food. Some were held in tunnels, while others were kept in dark rooms above ground,' she said. 'Our main goal now is to help them regain control over their lives.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1zjws9o1x	2025-01-31T11:55:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/H1kl7zYO1l/H1kl7zYO1l_1_81_800_451_0_small.jpg

Mishel Gerzig on balancing work, family while advocating for Isra...	The Israeli model made a brief visit to Israel and shared her advocacy efforts abroad for the country, the significance of wearing the yellow pin at international events, and also revealed what language she and her husband, Belgian Real Madrid star Thibaut Courtois, speak to their infant daughter Since model Mishel Gerzig and her husband, Belgian footballer Thibaut Courtois, welcomed their first daughter, Eli, Gerzig has rarely visited Israel. Despite missing it, traveling with a 10-month-old baby or leaving her at home in Madrid has been a challenge for the Israeli model. This week, however, she visited Israel alone for a short but busy two-day work trip. Gerzig stars in a new fashion shoot for Michael Kors at Factory 54, photographed in a luxurious location in Jaffa. She also spoke about her continued advocacy for Israel globally, even as hostages return home, the significance of wearing a yellow pin at events abroad, and her thoughts on Gal Gadot’s handling of the issue. How is it to come to Israel during this time? 'First of all, coming home is a dream. I haven’t been able to visit much since I had Ellie, and now it’s a whirlwind of emotions—excitement, worry, anticipation. The hostages are coming home, and seeing the videos of their reunions with their families is incredibly emotional.' How is it to experience this from afar? 'A lot of people we know are asking about it and showing interest, which is great. I think it might make people reconsider their views. I hope, and I want to believe it’s having an impact. From what we’re seeing, it seems to be making a difference. Anyone who isn’t affected by it is likely inhuman, because it’s impossible not to be moved by all the videos we’re seeing.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When you attend events abroad, is wearing the yellow pin important to you? 'I’ve worn it at every event over the past year. Together with jewelry designers, we made a large ring with the symbol for one event, and a gold necklace with the symbol for another. But I think the most important thing is explaining with words and sharing. Unfortunately, not many people understand the symbol, and worldwide, it’s not always connected to the hostages. Ultimately, what matters is showing up, explaining, and speaking out.' Gal Gadot received criticism for not wearing the pin at the Golden Globes. 'I think Gal is doing amazing things, and what she shares on Instagram, as well as her involvement in events, is very important. In my view, it’s even more important than wearing the pin. It creates more of an impact, and people understand it better in the end.' Is it harder to come to Israel for work now that you’re a mom? 'It’s the hardest thing in the world. There are no words. That’s why I came for a short visit, because Ellie isn’t here with me, and I want to get back to her as soon as possible. It’s tough to say goodbye like this, but it’s also really important to balance my work. That’s why I travel.' She’s 10 months old now. What is she up to at this stage? 'She’s started standing, crawling, and babbling—it’s fun, it’s like she’s going crazy in a cute way, it’s awesome.' What languages will she speak? 'I have no idea what she’ll pick up, but for now, we speak to her in Hebrew, English, Spanish, Flemish, and French. It may be a lot, but that’s just how it is, the house is full of languages. I’m really curious to hear her first sentence, which will probably mix all those languages.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rk37yoc001e	2025-01-31T10:24:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/rkbczTOUO1x/rkbczTOUO1x_0_122_720_405_0_small.jpg

Abbas Araqchi warns that a military strike by Israel and the US on Iranian nuclear facilities would be 'one of the biggest historical mistakes the US could make' Iran will respond immediately and decisively if its nuclear sites are attacked which would lead to an 'all-out war in the region,' Tehran's foreign minister told Al Jazeera TV in an interview aired on Friday. Israel and the U.S. launching a military attack on Iranian nuclear facilities would be 'one of the biggest historical mistakes the U.S. could make,' Abbas Araqchi said through a translator. Concerns have grown among Iran's top decision-makers that U.S. President Donald Trump might in his second term empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its oil industry. Those concerns, coupled with mounting anger within Iran over economic conditions, could drive Tehran toward engaging in negotiations with the Trump administration over the fate of its fast-advancing nuclear program. Araqchi suggested that the United States could free blocked Iranian funds as a first confidence-building step between the two hostile countries. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Iranian assets and funds have been frozen at various points by the U.S (which) has not fulfilled its previous pledges (to free them). These things can be done by the U.S. administration in order to bring confidence between us,' Araqchi said. In 2018, then-President Trump reneged on the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and a group of world powers and re-imposed harsh U.S. sanctions as part of his 'maximum pressure' policy against the country. In response, Tehran breached the deal in several ways including by accelerating its uranium enrichment. Trump has vowed to return to the policy he pursued in his previous term that sought to use economic pressure to force the country to negotiate a deal on its nuclear program, ballistic missile program and regional activities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byn1jqqu1x	2025-01-31T09:56:18-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/SyZncxZhlyl/SyZncxZhlyl_0_75_720_405_0_small.jpg

Considering the hell she endured, she survived as a hero until the very last moment, with immeasurable bravery.' Yechiel also extended thanks to the U.S. government and President Donald Trump, as well as Special Envoy Steve Whitacoff, for their role in securing the release of hostages. 'Thank you to the Israeli government for understanding, albeit too late, and at the cost of lives of both hostages and IDF soldiers, that there was no choice but to implement the agreement, release the hostages, and end the war. This is the true victory needed for the country's revival and its citizens.' He also expressed gratitude to the German government, Chancellor, and ambassadors for their support.

Emily told Keir Starmer she was held in UNRWA facilities for some time but was denied medical treatment, despite losing two fingers on her left hand and suffering an unhealed leg wound; 'Only aid she received was an expired bottle of medication' she added Emily Damari spoke on Friday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. She told him that she was held in some United Nations facilities belonging to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) but was denied access to medical care even though she was shot twice on October 7. During the call with her mother, Mandy, Emily told Starmer she had been held for some time in the UNRWA facilities but was denied any medical treatment despite losing two fingers on her left hand and suffering an unhealed leg wound, adding that the only medical aid she received was an expired bottle of medication. Emily and her mother urged Starmer to apply maximum pressure on Hamas and UNRWA to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) access to the 82 hostages still held in Gaza. After the phone call, her mother Mandy Damari wrote on X: 'Hamas held Emily in UNRWA facilities and denied her access to medical treatment after shooting her twice. It's a miracle that she survived, and we need to get aid to remaining hostages now.' Emily Damari was released from Hamas captivity in Gaza last Sunday, as part of the first wave of hostage releases under the current deal. She was freed alongside Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbacher. A British citizen, Emily quickly became a symbol of courage.

But his wife, Shiri, and their two young children, Kfir and Ariel, remain in captivity in Gaza. 'Our Yarden is supposed to come home, and we are so emotional,' the Bibas family said in a statement. 'But Shiri and the children have not returned yet. We have mixed emotions and are facing very difficult days ahead.' The family also urged the public to respect their privacy during this challenging time. 'Please, take care of Yarden’s heart and honor his and our privacy in the coming days,' they said. Israel has demanded clear answers from Hamas regarding Shiri and the children, who were supposed to be among the first hostages released under the deal prioritizing women and children. However, their release never happened. Last Saturday, the IDF said they had 'grave concerns' for their safety. The image of the Bibas family’s abduction has since become a symbol of Hamas’ brutality.

Terror group seeks Hezbollah prisoner swap for Elizabeth Tsurkov,...	Iraqi and Lebanese sources say Kata’ib Hezbollah offers Israel to release terror group operatives and ship captain for Israeli researcher's return two years after her abduction Iraqi and Lebanese sources told UK-based outlet Amwaj Media on Friday that a proposal has been issued for Israel to release Hezbollah terrorists and a Lebanese ship captain — described by the IDF as a senior Hezbollah operative — in exchange for Elizabeth Tsurkov, a 36-year-old Israeli-Russian academic kidnapped in Baghdad in March 2023. Pro-Iranian militia Kata’ib Hezbollah, which holds Tsurkov, has reportedly expressed willingness to proceed, but Israel has not yet greenlit the deal, per sources close to the Shia militia. Under the terms, Israel would release seven Hezbollah members captured between September 27 and November 27, along with naval captain Imad Amhaz, seized during a rare IDF commando raid in Batroun, northern Lebanon—100 miles (160 km) from the border. The IDF previously called Amhaz a 'senior Hezbollah operative with maritime expertise.' Lebanon’s Al-Jadeed outlet reported the 4-minute raid involved 20 troops.

We’re drawing strength from our incredible dad': Gadi Mozes' fam...	After being released from Hamas captivity, former hostage's family says they couldn't process the elation of his return and reunion with children and grandchildren Gadi Mozes returned to Israel after nearly 16 months in Hamas captivity on Thursday. 'There's no one happier than us,' His family said. 'Light has returned to our lives thanks to a life-saving hostage deal.' In a video posted online, his son, Yair Mozes, was seen shaving the beard he grew throughout his father’s captivity — as he had promised to do upon his return. Mozes, who will soon turn 81, said, ' I will do everything in my power to restore Nir Oz,' the kibbutz from which he was abducted. 'We were granted a miracle and got our father and grandfather, Gadi, back safe and sound after a year and four months of an uncompromising struggle filled with fear, terror, despair, worry and breathlessness,' his family said. 'Everything is filled with life again and we’re drawing strength from our incredible and extraordinary Gadi,' they added. 'We’re continuing this long and important struggle because every hostage family and all of Israel deserve to reach this moment.' Shai, Gadi’s nephew, added, 'We still don't know how aware he was of the scale of the disaster in Nir Oz. There were things he was exposed to before he was abducted. He knew about Efrat (his murdered partner), but I’m not sure he knew about the other kidnappings. He says he was alone the entire time — Arbel Yehud was the first hostage he met.' 'He made sure to take walks in the mornings, counting tiles to measure his distance,' his nephew said. 'He did various math exercises to keep his mind sharp, calculating how much he was walking. He managed to get a few books from his captors and read a little in English. He already knew Arabic, so he spoke with them in Arabic which helped him. Gadi is a people person — he knows how to communicate well.' 'They let him write, he kept a journal and counted the days — just a few lines each day — but they took it away before his release. Gadi is on his feet, lost some weight but he’s still the Gadi we know. He told us that he saw me on TV. He saw other family members too, so he was exposed to the outside but in a very limited way. That’s how he knew that we weren’t stopping the fight for him.' 'We're waiting for all restrictions to be lifted so we can really raise a glass with him,' Shai said. 'He hasn't had a chance to speak with the people from Nir Oz yet and we haven’t talked to him about the horrific moments during the release. 'I can only imagine how terrifying it was — those were 90 dreadful minutes. His son Yair explained that he had vowed not to shave and Gadi was happy to see his son had fought for him.'

We were fortunate and we’ll keep fighting so that everyone gets to experience this moment.' In a conversation with Ynet, Einav said, 'It's hard to process everything that happened, it’s not easy to switch your mindset in an instant. This is a harsh reality. Understanding that he’s here with us, alive and on his feet — it just doesn’t register. 'We sat around him and he was talking and telling stories — and I couldn’t process it. But at the same time, it feels like he left yesterday and came back today because it’s so natural for him to be with us.' 'He came back as the Gadi we know. We were afraid of how we would receive him, how he would return mentally and physically. Of course, there are effects, and it’s too early to know their full extent, but he seems to have held on to who he is. The kids got their grandpa back just as they knew him.' 'We asked him, 'What kept you going in there?' and he answered, 'I thought about you. The desire to be with you again, to reunite and be together — that’s what kept me going,' she added. 'He said he kept repeating to himself, 'You have to hold on for the kids.' One of the things that really broke his spirit was the feeling of betrayal by the state. He said he kept asking himself, 'How is it possible that we’re still here?'

Meet the oldest hostage in Gaza: Shlomo Masour	Woman pays tribute to her grandfather, who is being held in captivity in Gaza If words could capture the last 15 months for Noam Safir, they are the ones you hear: the pain, the confusion, the memories—each brought to life with every stroke of the piano keys. 'My grandfather, Shlomo Mansour, is the oldest hostage in captivity, an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor,' Safir told ILTV, as she played a song she wrote in his honor. Her grandfather survived a violent pogrom in Iraq as a little boy. Now, decades later, he is trapped in captivity by Hamas. On October 7, more than a handful of terrorists broke into his house. Safir’s grandmother ran into the bathroom. The terrorists took Mansour out, slapped his face, and beat him. Then they handcuffed him and took him away. Eventually, they took his wife, Mazal, too. The couple had been married for 60 years. Hamas terrorists led Shlomo and Mazal out of their home, but Mazal managed to break away. Shlomo, weighing only 57 kilograms and without his hearing aids, was then kidnapped into Gaza in his own car. But the psychological torture for the family had only just begun. 'They didn’t leave my grandmother alone. They tried calling her, pretending to be Shlomo. They tried setting the house on fire,' Safir recalled. Just one kilometer from the border, Kissufim had once been a safe haven for Safir—a place filled with childhood memories of her grandfather. But the home she knew was now destroyed, and since that day, there has been no sign of life from Mansour. 'I decided that my mission is to be his voice, as long as he can't speak for himself,' Safir said. 'He was always wearing a smile on his face. He always welcomed us with the widest smile and the biggest hug, just waiting to spend time with us.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rynethcdyx	2025-01-31T04:01:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/S14strqu1g/S14strqu1g_0_0_519_294_0_small.jpg
Who are the 110 prisoners released from Israeli jails on Thursday...	Thirty-three of the prisoners were serving life sentences, many for the murder of Israelis At the same time that Israel celebrates the return of Israeli hostages, the nation is also aware that their freedom means the release of convicted Palestinian security prisoners. Following the release of the three Israeli hostages on Thursday, 110 terrorists were set free from Israeli prisons. Thirty-three of the prisoners were serving life sentences, many for the murder of Israelis. The terrorists were released from Ofer and Ketziot prisons and were received by thousands of rejoicing Hamas supporters in their hometowns in Judea and Samaria. Through the first phase, Israel is committed to releasing 1,904 prisoners in exchange for 33 Israeli hostages, eight of whom are dead. Before Thursday, 290 Palestinian prisoners were released, including 121 serving life sentences. Israel is not freeing prisoners for the five Thai hostages that were released because the deal was arranged directly with the Thai government. Talks are due to begin on the second stage of the deal with Hamas. In that phase, Hamas would release male hostages, including soldiers, and demands for the release of the most prominent and dangerous terrorists are certain. Three notorious prisoners were released on Thursday. They include Zakaria Zubeidi, Mahmoud Atallah, and Ahmed Barghouti. Zubeidi, who returned to Samaria, organized dozens of attacks during the Second Intifada while heading the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Jenin. He was one of six prisoners who briefly escaped from Gilboa Prison in 2021 before being recaptured. Atallah was released to Nablus. He was indicted in September for repeatedly sexually assaulting female guards at Gilboa Prison. Barghouti, a senior military official in Fatah, received 13 life sentences for carrying out a series of terror attacks during the Second Intifada that killed 12 Israelis. He was deported abroad. All prisoners that are released are transported to two main reception points, Ofer and Ketziot prisons, before being released home or deported.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkgxqb9dyg	2025-01-31T03:39:05-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/yk14243535/yk14243535_0_76_490_276_0_small.jpg
Who is released hostage Gadi Moses?	Gadi Moses was released from captivity on Thursday. He was the oldest hostage and the first man to be released as part of this ceasefire hostage deal More than 480 days after he was kidnapped outside his home on Kibbutz Nir Oz, hostage Gadi Moses was released from captivity on Thursday. He was the oldest hostage and the first man to be released as part of this ceasefire hostage deal. A day from hell on October 7 for his family—upon release, Moses learned the fate of his partner, Efrat Katz, who was murdered on that day. Katz’s daughter and her two grandchildren were kidnapped with Moses’s ex-wife, Margalit, and all three were released in the hostage deal in November 2023. Moses is known for working as a peace activist who advocated for Palestinian rights and peace. On October 7, Moses even tried to bargain with terrorists as they demanded money from him and the keys to his car before they abducted him. Moses is a potato expert and renowned agronomist who frequently lectured on agriculture. He is a founding member of the kibbutz’s vineyard and helped maintain its community vegetable garden. In December 2023, Islamic Jihad released a propaganda video of Moses, who pleaded in the video for the government to make a deal to release him. Known for his sociable and kind nature and belief in coexistence, the 80-year-old reached his milestone birthday while in captivity last March.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syaewhcoyl	2025-01-31T03:30:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/r1xW4UQ9dkg/r1xW4UQ9dkg_1_245_720_406_0_small.jpg

$10,000 for Iron Dome video: Court charges two reservists for spy...	Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev face significant espionage charges with intent to harm national security; details reveal close cooperation with Iranian handler Two IDF reservists Yuri Eliasfov, 22, and Georgi Andreyev, 21, were charged on Friday with collaborating with an Iranian foreign agent known as 'Boaz' and carrying out actions intended to harm Israel’s national security. Eliasfov is accused of aiding an enemy in war, providing information that could benefit the enemy, contact with a foreign agent, aggravated forgery and other offenses. Andreyev is charged with contact with a foreign agent, vandalism and tampering with evidence. Neither has a previous criminal record. According to the indictment filed in Haifa District Court, Eliasfov served as a technician in the Iron Dome air defense system and later during his reserve service, while Andreyev was a technician at the Israeli Air Force's operations center and also served in reserves. The two have been friends for years. The two spray-painted pro-Iranian graffiti in public places across Israel in exchange for $100 in cryptocurrency, photographed the creation and sent the images to 'Boaz' before erasing part of the text. Eliasfov allegedly sent 'Boaz' blurred images of sites he claimed were military locations, receiving payment. He later offered to sell him weapons. Between November 1-3 last year, while on reserve duty, Eliasfov recorded the Iron Dome radar screen, capturing classified data on the system’s location. He sent 'Boaz' an edited clip containing highly classified information and offered the full video for $10,000, demanding an $800 advance payment. During his compulsory service, Eliasfov allegedly took eight photos of Iron Dome’s computer systems containing classified data and stored them on his phone, knowing they were highly confidential. 'Boaz' reportedly believed Eliasfov was a commander in the IDF’s elite Egoz unit with military connections. The Iranian agent expressed interest in Israeli Air Force bases, aircraft and specifically Nevatim Airbase, targeted in an Iranian attack last October. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Eliasfov falsely claimed he knew a soldier at Nevatim and could obtain information. 'Boaz' asked him to verify how many aircraft were damaged in the attack, photograph the base and obtain flight speed and altitude data. Eliasfov agreed, knowing 'Boaz' was an Iranian agent. He asked a reservist friend about Israeli Air Force flight times to Iran and damage from the attack. The friend, unaware, directed him to search online. Eliasfov later found public data, calculated flight times, and sent 'Boaz' the results. Unable to confirm Nevatim’s damage, he fabricated information and received $146 in cryptocurrency. He also sent blurred images, falsely claiming they were of Nevatim, for which he received $94. Eliasfov further claimed to know a female soldier who had access to classified information. He then forged a document with the IDF emblem and 'classified' label, making it appear to be a summary of a planned ground incursion into Lebanon last November. He received $296 and another $90 in cryptocurrency for it. He also sent 'Boaz' images of a drone and the IDF’s headquarters base in Tel Aviv, downloaded from the internet. Additionally, he offered to sell 'Boaz' an M16 rifle, three magazines and 50 rounds but the agent declined. The prosecution has requested the court extend their detention until the end of legal proceedings against them. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryc11k4q00yg	2025-01-31T03:01:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/31/HJNQ55M5001x/HJNQ55M5001x_1216_530_1393_784_0_small.jpg

Israel approves Hamas' list for the fourth hostage handover set to take place Saturday; Yarden Bibas first of his family to return from captivity After 484 days in Hamas captivity, Israeli hostages Keith Siegel, 65, Ofer Calderon, 54, and Yarden Bibas, 35, are set to be released tomorrow in the fourth handover of Israel’s deal with Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that Hamas provided the list to Qatari and Egyptian mediators and was then approved by Israel after the hostages’ families were notified. Hamas is still holding 82 hostages, 23 of whom are set for release in the next handovers of the deal’s first phase. Of these, 15 are alive and eight are deceased. The living hostages will be freed first. Before Saturday’s release, the Rafah crossing is expected to open on Friday for the evacuation of wounded Palestinians to Egypt, most of them being Hamas terrorists. Meetings are taking place in Cairo between Palestinian Authority and Egyptian officials on reopening the crossing.

Minute by minute: Hamas' relentless attack on Nahal Oz base on Oc...	IDF seeks to complete probe into one of the worst battles in Hamas' assault and may ask released IDF lookouts to testify in order to advance conclusions While the IDF’s investigation into the battle at Nahal Oz base is nearing completion, testimonies of IDF lookouts recently released from captivity as part of the cease-fire deal with Hamas could aid intelligence efforts to track down the Nukhba terrorists who took part in the attack and assist in finalizing one of the war’s key inquiries. The battle was the deadliest among the numerous attacks on IDF bases near the Gaza border. The probe found that the terrorists had precise intelligence on the base, located 1–2 km from Gaza’s Shuja'iyya neighborhood. Timeline of the battle: 6:45 a.m.: Around 60 Nukhba terrorists storm the Nahal Oz base from land and by motorized paragliders under cover of heavy mortar and rocket fire. 7:05 a.m.: Terrorists reach the base’s command center and officers’ quarters. Most of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion was outside securing nearby Israeli communities. 7:50 a.m.: An Israeli Air Force drone strikes inside the base despite the chaos and risk of friendly fire, as some terrorists wear IDF uniforms. 8:30 a.m.: Hamas takes full control of the base, moving through shelters. 9:00 a.m.: A second wave of 50 terrorists enters, setting fires. Kidnappings proceed unimpeded, with terrorists using IDF jeeps. 10:00 a.m.: Terrorists roam freely; a third wave of 100 Hamas operatives arrives. 12:00 p.m.: The base’s central command post is overrun and burned. First reinforcements arrive and engage in combat. 1:00 p.m.: The tide turns as IDF forces begin clearing the base. From 7:30 a.m., attack helicopters and drones circled overhead, struggling to differentiate between soldiers and terrorists. Targeting was hampered by limited guidance from burning command posts and distant bases. The probe also found that some terrorists mistaken for soldiers were spared. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Inside a female barracks shelter, 15 soldiers hid. When terrorists approached, they fled in separate directions. Four were killed in a nearby building. Eleven others locked themselves inside another structure as terrorists tried to break in. An Air Force drone operator launched a precise missile strike nearby despite incomplete identification of the attackers. The blast forced the terrorists to flee, saving the soldiers. Survivors recalled hearing the door handle rattling before the explosion shattered all windows and silenced the attackers. The Air Force carried out 14 drone strikes inside the base, the first at 7:50 a.m., along with six helicopter strikes and 150 Apache cannon rounds. Nearby, drones executed 77 strikes, helicopters 36, and artillery fired over 1,600 shells, with 10 additional fighter jet strikes. According to the IDF’s investigation, around 60 terrorists were killed from the air in and around Nahal Oz on October 7. Some 53 IDF soldiers were killed in the battle to defend the base. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkritzc00kl	2025-01-31T00:57:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/r1IOgXK00Jg/r1IOgXK00Jg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Is Al Jazeera a mouthpiece for Hamas?	Video aired by Al Jazeera showing the staged release of three Israeli hostages has intensified allegations that the network acts as a platform for Hamas propaganda Video capturing the return of three Israeli hostages on Thursday — Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and Gadi Mozes —has reignited the debate over Al Jazeera’s role in reporting on Hamas and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The footage, aired by Al Jazeera, shows the carefully staged release of these hostages, a moment that Hamas has framed as a public relations victory. As the images unfold, masked gunmen are seen escorting the captives in a manner that critics say is designed to reinforce Hamas’ narrative of strength and control. The Qatari-owned network has long been at the center of controversy, accused by Israel and several Arab nations of serving as a propaganda platform for Hamas. While Al Jazeera maintains that it provides independent and balanced journalism, many argue that its editorial decisions and financial ties to Qatar align it with Hamas’ messaging. The video, which captures the handover of the hostages, is emblematic of these concerns. The carefully orchestrated scene, presented without critical context, has led many to question whether Al Jazeera is reporting news or amplifying Hamas’ narrative. The network’s critics point to numerous examples in which Al Jazeera’s coverage appears to favor Hamas while suppressing alternative perspectives. One such instance occurred when an Al Jazeera reporter abruptly cut off an interview with a wounded Gazan man after he criticized Hamas for using civilians as human shields. Saudi journalist Faisal Ibrahim Alshammeri commented on the incident, stating, 'Al Jazeera trades in the blood of the people of Gaza. When a Palestinian man criticized Hamas, the reporter didn’t like it [and cut him off].' Similarly, Saudi businessman Monther Aal Sheikh Mubarak called attention to the same event, arguing that Al Jazeera deliberately censors criticism of Hamas. 'An elderly Gazan wondered why the resistance [Hamas] hides among civilians. … The Al Jazeera reporter cut the interview short and walked away, because that is not what the man was supposed [to say] in the interview,' Mubarak remarked. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The network’s alleged bias is often linked to Qatar’s close ties with Hamas. Reports indicate that Qatar has provided over $1 billion in aid to Gaza in recent years, with significant portions of this funding allegedly benefiting Hamas. Al Jazeera’s Arabic-language broadcasts have frequently featured unchallenged statements from Hamas leaders, reinforcing the perception that it serves as the group’s media arm. Furthermore, its framing of events—such as referring to Hamas-led attacks as 'resistance operations' rather than acts of terrorism—has drawn condemnation from both Israeli and Arab commentators. In May 2024, Israel’s cabinet unanimously voted to shut down Al Jazeera’s operations within the country, citing national security concerns. This decision led to the immediate closure of the network’s offices and a ban on its broadcasts. In December 2024, the Palestinian Authority (PA) accused Al Jazeera of broadcasting misleading reports and stoking divisions, leading to a ban on the network’s operations in the West Bank. Subsequently, in January 2025, the PA temporarily suspended Al Jazeera’s broadcasts across the West Bank, citing concerns over 'inciting material.' Despite the widespread criticism, Al Jazeera denies allegations of bias, insisting that it provides a counterbalance to Western media narratives. The network argues that its coverage amplifies Palestinian voices that might otherwise be ignored and that accusations of pro-Hamas bias stem from political agendas rather than journalistic shortcomings. Al Jazeera supporters claim that it has been unfairly targeted by governments seeking to suppress independent reporting on human rights abuses in Gaza and the broader Middle East. Yet, even among those who value Al Jazeera’s reporting, there is acknowledgment that its editorial stance leans heavily toward Hamas’ perspective. The network’s decision to prominently feature Hamas spokespeople, air highly produced footage from hostage releases, and rarely challenge Hamas’ governance of Gaza has fueled the perception that it operates as more than just a neutral observer. The latest video showcasing the hostage release only adds to the growing body of evidence that Al Jazeera’s coverage often aligns with Hamas’ strategic messaging. While the network asserts its commitment to journalism, its editorial choices, financial ties to Qatar and repeated controversies suggest a pattern of reporting that favors Hamas’ perspective. Whether this alignment is a conscious editorial decision or the byproduct of Qatar’s geopolitical positioning remains a subject of intense debate. However, the criticism levied by both Israeli and Arab figures suggests that concerns over Al Jazeera’s role as a mouthpiece for Hamas are not without merit.

Israel readies for fourth hostage release in deal's first phase	Next handover will prioritize men over 50, injured or ill individuals, Avera Mengistu, Hisham al-Sayed, Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas alongside Keith Siegel; three men expected to be released Saturday Israel and Hamas concluded the third hostage release in the cease-fire agreement on Thursday with the return of Agam Berger, Arbel Yehud, Gadi Mozes, and five Thai nationals from Gaza. Subsequently, 110 Palestinian prisoners were released after Israel secured commitments from mediators for safer hostage releases in future releases — following chaotic scenes in Khan Younis. Some 82 hostages — 23 slated for release in subsequent handovers — remain in Hamas captivity. The next release, set for Saturday, will prioritize men over 50, injured or ill individuals, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed and Shiri, Kfir and Ariel Bibas, whose condition remains unknown. Israel anticipates the release of U.S.-Israeli citizen Keith Siegel, 63, Saturday, with Yarden Bibas potentially added to the list. Berger was transferred from Jabaliya to the International Red Cross and then to Israeli forces. The handover of Yehud, Mozes, and five Thai nationals was delayed in Khan Younis as crowds surrounded their vehicle. Israel issued sharp warnings to Qatar and Egypt, demanding guarantees for safer future releases and warning of 'immediate pressure' if protocols are violated. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the scenes, saying, 'I view the appalling images during our hostages’ release with grave seriousness — further proof of Hamas’ unfathomable brutality.' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari confirmed mediators received Israel’s demands, securing commitments for safer transfers in upcoming handovers. The Palestinian prisoner release was delayed until Thursday afternoon, per Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz’s orders. The eight freed hostages were hospitalized at various Israeli medical facilities, reuniting with families. Mozes pledged to 'rebuild Nir Oz,' his kibbutz devastated on October 7 by terrorists. After the release, Thailand's Ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya said: 'I can barely breathe. Thailand’s citizens, government and people eagerly await our five hostages’ return.'

He expressed hope for a lasting cease-fire, adding, 'President Trump and I will do everything to return them all… American citizens are a top priority.' Security officials warned talks on the second phase could collapse, jeopardizing the deal's first phase. 'If Hamas realizes the second phase won’t happen, they’ll have no incentive to complete the first phase or reach day 42 of the cease-fire,' a source said, criticizing Netanyahu for 'contradictory pledges' on IDF troop withdrawals. Conversely, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer’s circle believes a 'historic mega-deal' is possible, linking normalization with Saudi Arabia, a multinational Gaza force to fend off Hamas’ return and reconstruction funding. This 'New Abraham Accords' framework is expected to dominate Netanyahu’s upcoming meeting with Trump in the U.S. next week. Hamas still holds 82 hostages, living and deceased, including 59 men under 50 — soldiers, civilians and five foreign nationals. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byct00kcuyg	2025-01-30T22:01:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/S1k11HSY00yx/S1k11HSY00yx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
IDF confirms struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon	Israeli Air Force Units targeted Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon Thursday overnight for the first time since the cease-fire had been extended, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported Friday. 'The targets that were struck include a Hezbollah terrorist site containing underground infrastructure, used to develop and manufacture weaponry and additional terrorist infrastructure sites on the Syrian-Lebanese border used by Hezbollah to smuggle weaponry into Lebanon,' the military said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1jqwk9d1x	2025-01-30T21:01:28-08:00	
A message from home and Passover in Gaza: Freed hostages share sn...	Arbel Yehoud was unaware of the scope of the massacre in her kibbutz, Nir Oz; Gadi Mozes vows to rebuild his beloved kibbutz after returning home; IDF lookouts held below and above ground and observed holidays Eight Israeli hostages were released from Gaza as part of the deal with Hamas on Thursday, including Israelis Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and Gadi Mozes, along with five Thai nationals. Yehoud, 29, was held alone since October 7 and met another Israeli for the first time only hours before her release — Mozes, 80. The Islamic Jihad released a video of them embracing before being handed over. Both were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where one in four residents was either kidnapped or killed in the October 7 attack. Yehoud was unaware of the full extent of the massacre. Mozes told his children he had seen their relatives interviewed on TV, including Al Jazeera. 'I once heard your mother speaking on the radio,' he told them upon their reunion at an IDF reception center. ' I will do everything in my power to restore Nir Oz.' Berger, 20, was the last of the female IDF lookouts from the Nahal Oz base to remain in captivity. She spent much of her time with fellow hostage Liri Albag. The lookouts avoided eating leavened bread during Passover and tried to fast on Yom Kippur. Berger also observed the Sabbath. On her way to the hospital, she wrote a message on a board: 'I chose the path of faith, and in faith I returned.' The five lookouts were held both above and below ground. Naama Levy, released in a previous exchange, was kept alone for a long period before being reunited with her comrades. 'Is this real? Are you alive?' she asked them. In many cases, they were housed with families, where they were made to cook, clean and care for children. They exercised to pass the time, despite poor conditions and little food. Their captors forbade them from holding hands or crying but they found ways to support each other. Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev, longtime friends from their shared service, were held together most of the time. Mozes, Berger and Yehoud were released in the third exchange of the hostage deal after Hamas delayed Yehoud's release, despite her civilian status making her eligible for an earlier phase.

One more Thai hostage remains in captivity, along with two who were killed in the attack. A Nepali citizen is also held, while a Tanzanian captive was killed by terrorists. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad struggled to maintain order during the Khan Younis handover, as Yehoud and Mozes were forced through an angry crowd. In response, Israel delayed the release of 110 Palestinian prisoners, with prison buses ordered to turn back. A later agreement was reached after mediators assured Israel of 'safe passage' for future hostages. The prisoners were then released, including 30 serving life sentences. After the latest exchange, 82 hostages remain in Gaza, 35 of whom Israel has declared dead. In the coming weeks, 23 more hostages are expected to be released, including an estimated eight deceased. Hamas is set to release three men on Saturday, with their names to be confirmed Friday. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by3ghvtdke	2025-01-30T14:48:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/S1k11HSY00yx/S1k11HSY00yx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Cease-fire deal and Iran: Marks for Netanyahu and Trump's meeting	Israel sees great importance in prime minister's upcoming visit to Washington next week in which he'll discuss Tehran, Gaza and possible normalization with Saudi Arabia Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to leave Israel for the U.S. on Sunday for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss Iran and Gaza's future. Israel sees the meeting as an opportunity to shape regional policy, as key decisions have yet to be made by Trump's administration. Israel’s top priority is Iran, while Trump sees Iran's role fits into a broader regional strategy. Israel wishes for crippling U.S. sanctions alongside a credible military threat against Tehran. During his previous term, Trump imposed tough sanctions but did not back them with military action. His position remains that Iran will not obtain nuclear weapons, though the strategy to ensure that is still in question. While he is unlikely to initiate military action by the U.S., Trump could support Israeli operations against Iran and its proxies. Israel seeks clarity on whether Trump plans diplomatic talks for a new nuclear deal. The Iran issue is also tied to U.S. efforts to expand the Abraham Accords, with Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, visiting Saudi Arabia last week. Another key topic is the Israeli hostages and Gaza's future. The hostage issue is urgent, but resolving Gaza’s situation will take longer than the 19-day negotiation window for the second phase of the hostage deal agreed with Hamas. Witkoff has yet to take a firm position on the matter and the U.S. insists Gaza must not become a terrorist haven while also prioritizing hostage recovery. Trump and Netanyahu will seek to balance these goals. Both outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and Trump assured Netanyahu that resuming military action if negotiations fail would not be considered a violation of the cease-fire. However, the U.S. is working on a broader strategic framework where each issue connects to others. Trump may ask Netanyahu to delay further military action. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel was surprised by Trump’s suggestion to relocate half of Gaza’s population to Jordan or Egypt for the Strip’s reconstruction. The idea has never been seriously considered in Israel and it’s unclear if Trump sees it as realistic or a trial balloon. The proposal has been met with strong opposition in the Arab world. Trump is expected to ask Netanyahu directly: 'What are your plans?' Saudi Arabia has informed Israel normalization won't progress without a cease-fire. With a fragile truce in place, Saudi officials warn renewed fighting could derail the process. Israel hopes to learn from Trump where normalization efforts stand, though Israeli officials doubt a deal can be finalized before the first phase of the hostage agreement ends. Trump and Netanyahu will also discuss the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrants against the prime minister and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, potential U.S. sanctions on ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, continued U.S. arms delivery to Israel, the Lebanon cease-fire and Syria’s new government. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skyjh8koyl	2025-01-30T12:30:13-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/SJb7A72vJe/SJb7A72vJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Palestinian Authority and EU to operate Rafah Crossing in Februar...	Critical border crossing to Egypt set to open, with EU sending local force to oversee Palestinians leaving enclave; Netanyahu says PA's role at border symbolic Hundreds of thousands of Gazans began returning to northern Gaza via the Netzarim Corridor on Monday, with a U.S. security firm responsible for preventing weapons smuggling using vehicles. The firm consists of about 100 former elite unit members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, security measures are being prepared at the Rafah crossing, set to reopen in February, to prevent terrorists and weapons from being smuggled into Egypt. EU foreign ministers agreed to redeploy a European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) mission at the Rafah Crossing in February. Under the cease-fire agreement with Hamas, 200 Palestinians —mostly wounded individuals and their escorts — will leave Gaza daily through the crossing. EUBAM was established in 2005 as an EU civilian mission to assist the Palestinian Authority (PA) in managing Rafah. In 2007, after Hamas seized Gaza, the mission was suspended, relocating first to Ashkelon and later to Ramat Gan. A senior EU official said Israel recently asked how the EU could help reestablish EUBAM, with the request coming from Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) and the Foreign Ministry. 'The European force will play an important role in the cease-fire,' he said. 'The idea is to reopen the crossing during the first phase to allow people to leave Gaza.' Talks on redeployment involved Egypt and the U.S. 'From Israel, Egypt and the U.S. perspective, the EU force is a reliable body to oversee that terrorists and weapons don't pass through,' the official said. 'The EU wants to reestablish the mission to show support for the cease-fire and cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Israel wants a trustworthy partner to work with,' he added. The Rafah crossing will reopen in February, with Palestinians vetted by Shin Bet. The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement last week that these individuals will not be affiliated with the PA. However, a senior EU official said, 'The PA will provide mission personnel. European border officers from several countries will oversee operations. The crossing will be managed by PA border officers, while the IDF remains stationed around the perimeter.' Upon arrival, Palestinians will undergo security checks, including ID verification and weapons screening, before entering Egypt. The EU is expected to deploy up to 100 border officers with security arrangements in place. Most of those crossing will be wounded individuals, children and critically ill patients seeking treatment abroad. EUBAM has begun recruiting personnel ahead of redeployment. 'There's good cooperation and mutual interest going on with Israel,' the EU official said. 'Israel wants a trusted presence at the crossing.' 'The PA is trying to create a false impression that it controls the crossing. Under the agreement, the IDF secures the crossing, and no one passes without its supervision and prior approval from the IDF and Shin Bet,' The Prime Minister’s Office stated last week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'The technical operation inside the crossing is handled by non-Hamas Gazans vetted by Shin Bet who have been managing essential services in Gaza since the war began. EUBAM oversees their work. The PA’s only practical role is stamping passports, as it is the internationally recognized authority for Palestinian travel documentation. This arrangement applies to the first phase of the hostage deal and will be reviewed at a later date.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjsyahkoyx	2025-01-30T11:22:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/19/Hkgk7FFvVT/Hkgk7FFvVT_0_30_1564_880_0_small.jpg
US security firm in Gaza stops fake UN vehicle at checkpoint	American security personnel at Netzarim Corridor stop Palestinian vehicle disguised as UN car, conducting X-ray scans and manual inspections; source says US team thorough and won’t allow UNRWA or others to game the system A U.S. security firm overseeing inspections at the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza intercepted a Palestinian car attempting to disguise itself as a United Nations vehicle, officials said Thursday. Despite bearing 'UN' markings, security personnel immediately identified the vehicle as fraudulent and conducted a thorough inspection, including X-ray scanning and manual searches of all bags inside. No weapons or explosives were found. The U.S. security team, staffed by former elite military personnel, including ex-CIA operatives, is tasked with preventing weapons smuggling into northern Gaza. They operate state-of-the-art scanning systems provided by Leidos, using AI-enhanced technology to examine vehicles from multiple angles simultaneously. All images are stored in a secured system. Sources familiar with the process said the American team is rigorous in its screening, adding, 'They are taking no risks, especially with UNRWA, and won’t tolerate any deception.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Under the hostage release and cease-fire agreement, only vehicles heading north are subject to inspection, with no checks for individuals crossing on foot. The U.S. security personnel, numbering around 100 contractors, operate under a mandate from the mediators—the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, who also finance the operation. The Egyptian security company stationed at the outer perimeter conducts initial screenings and interviews with Gazans approaching the crossing. Meanwhile, Israeli engineering units and bomb-sniffing dogs sweep the area for unexploded ordnance. The security oversight is managed by a multinational consortium comprising strategic and logistics planning firm Safe Reach Solutions (SRS), global integrated security solutions provider UG Solutions and an Egyptian security and screening company. The consortium was selected by mediators to ensure vehicle screenings and facilitate the safe return of Gazans to northern Gaza. With extensive experience in high-risk zones and counterterrorism operations, the security firms dismissed concerns that 100 personnel were insufficient for the mission, emphasizing that security measures and staffing levels were carefully evaluated in response to potential threats. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rydopufdke	2025-01-30T11:20:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/rkoc0GYd1g/rkoc0GYd1g_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg

Freed hostage, 80, vows to rebuild his kibbutz	Gadi Mozes returns to Israel in third release of hostage deal and says will 'do everything in my power to restore his community of Nir Oz, ravaged by Hamas terrorists on October 7 Former hostage Gadi Mozes, 80, shared his first message upon release after 482 days in captivity in Gaza. 'I will do everything in my power to restore Nir Oz,' he said, referencing the southern Israeli kibbutz devastated in Hamas’ October 7 attack. Earlier, a photo circulated from the reunification center in Kibbutz Re’im showed Mozes embracing his three children — Moran, Oded and Yair — who had waited for his return to shave off beards grown since the war began. His daughter was heard urging him, 'Sit down, Dad.' Mozes told his children, 'I once heard your mother speaking on the radio.' Shailee, Mozes’ granddaughter, posted on Instagram: 'I have no words except *thank God* for this day, and thanks to everyone who cared for us, supported us and fought with us through this long, exhausting journey to victory — to have my grandfather back #BringThemAllHome.' Margalit Mozes, Gadi's ex-partner, said: 'A stone has been lifted from my heart. I am elated, especially for the children who suffered so much and for all of us. This was a very difficult period. Today is a crucial step toward healing.' His son Yair, who had vowed not to shave until his father’s return, shared an emotional reunion photo on Instagram: 'Dad is back!!!' Orna Pauker, Mozes’ partner, added: 'There’s great joy that Arbel [Yehoud] and Gadi returned but also worry for the rest of the hostages and grief for the tragedy we endured. It’s not easy.'

Terror group officially acknowledges death of October 7 attack mastermind and architect of Hamas' military capabilities; group also confirms elimination of Deif’s deputy Rafa Salama along with 5 other senior operatives Hamas officially confirmed Thursday that its military commander, Mohammed Deif, was killed during the war, nearly six months after the IDF announced his elimination. Hamas spokesperson Abu Ubaida also confirmed the deaths of Deif’s deputy, Khan Younis Brigade commander Rafa Salama, as well as senior operatives Marwan Issa, Ghazi Abu Tama’a, Raad Thabet, Ahmed Ghandour and Ayman Nofal. Deif, the architect of Hamas' military capabilities and mastermind behind the October 7 attacks, was killed in an airstrike in Khan Younis on July 13, according to an earlier IDF statement. For weeks after the strike, Israeli intelligence gathered evidence to confirm his death before publicly announcing it in early August.

Liam Hazi, 20, from Rosh HaAyin, killed and 5 others wounded, one seriously, in ambush inside Jenin refugee camp building; terrorists open fire at close range before escaping; manhunt underway An Israeli soldier was killed and five others wounded during an IDF raid in the Jenin refugee camp, the military said Thursday, marking the first fatality in Israel's week-long counterterrorism crackdown across the West Bank, condemned Operation Iron Wall. The fallen soldier, Staff Sgt. Liam Hazi, 20, from Rosh HaAyin, was a combat fighter in the Haruv Reconnaissance Battalion. The IDF said four soldiers sustained mild to moderate injuries, while one remains in serious condition. A preliminary IDF investigation revealed that Haruv forces entered a building in the refugee camp for routine searches when terrorists hiding inside one of the rooms ambushed them, opening fire at close range. Staff Sgt. Hazi was killed in the firefight, while the attackers managed to escape.

Thai military doctor arrives in Israel to assist 5 Thai nationals freed from Hamas captivity; medical staff prepares Thai-language signs, flags and private rooms; Sriaoun’s mother weeps upon hearing news Five Thai nationals held hostage in Gaza since October 7 were released on Thursday and transferred to Israel under a behind-the-scenes agreement between Thailand, Hamas and Iran, Thai officials confirmed. The freed hostages—Sathian Suwannakham, 34, Pongsak Thenna, 35, Bannawat Seathao, 27, Watchara Sriaoun, 32, and Surasak Lamnau, 30—were handed over to the Red Cross before being transported to Shamir Medical Center in Be’er Ya’akov. In Thailand, Sriaoun’s mother, Wiwiyao, broke into tears upon seeing the footage of her son’s release after 482 days in captivity. Shamir Medical Center prepared a dedicated reception area for the Thai hostages, where they will receive medical and psychological care. A Thai military doctor, sent by the Royal Thai Army, met them at the reception center and accompanied them to the hospital. Each survivor was assigned a private room with two beds, following a request made during a previous prisoner exchange in November 2023, where Thai hostages preferred to stay together. Hospital staff placed signs in both Hebrew and Thai, and medical personnel wore name tags in both languages. To mark their arrival, hospital workers prepared a ceremonial display of Thai flags. 'Their return is an emotional moment for all of us,' said Dr. Yuval Levy, head of Israel’s public hospital division at the Health Ministry. 'The fate of these hostages has been intertwined with ours. They are now undergoing initial medical assessments, and we are fully prepared for any situation. This is a complex event, not just for their families but for all of Israel. We hope to see the safe return of all remaining hostages.' Following the release, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed relief and joy, while Thailand’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement welcoming the hostages’ return and confirming their safe arrival in Israel. 'Thailand thanks Israel and all involved parties for facilitating the release of the Thai hostages from Gaza,' the statement read. 'We extend our heartfelt congratulations to their families and express deep appreciation to Qatar, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, the United States and other friendly nations, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross, for their instrumental roles in securing their release.'

Peng Ruwikit Grossi, director at the Thai employment company Nima, said, 'This is a deeply emotional day for the Thai community in Israel. It is a moment of joy for them and for all Thai workers in the country.' However, she acknowledged the pain endured by hostage families throughout the ordeal. 'Our happiness is mixed with sorrow,' she said. 'Beyond their release, we know how difficult it was for their families to wait so long, receiving updates only from afar. The extensive coverage in Thailand is not just about their personal stories, but also a message to the entire Thai community—reminding them that there are people in Israel who care for them beyond their work.' Grossi emphasized that Nima, which serves over 60% of Thailand’s migrant workers in Israel, sees its role as extending beyond employment. 'This is not just about work; it’s about family, trust, support, and a real community that we’ve built here,' she said. 'Today, we are overjoyed to welcome our friends back.' Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar spoke with his Thai counterpart, Maris Sangiampongsa, following the release, assuring him that 'their condition is good.' 'Minister Sa’ar updated the Thai foreign minister on the details of their release, their current medical status—which is classified as good following initial assessments—and the plan to transport them shortly by helicopter to a hospital,' the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. Sa’ar thanked Thailand for its cooperation in negotiations and noted that the two ministers had spoken two weeks earlier regarding the hostages. They agreed to meet in Israel this weekend when Sangiampongsa visits. Before the hostages’ release, Thai Ambassador to Israel Pannabha Chandraramya expressed overwhelming emotion at the prospect of seeing them freed. 'This is a day of great news for me, for my country, and for the entire world,' she said. 'I have waited so long for this moment. I can barely breathe. Thai citizens, our government—everyone has been anxiously waiting to see our five hostages again. I want to thank Israel for taking care of them.' However, she urged continued efforts to secure the release of Nattapong. Two other Thai hostages, Sudthisak Rinthalak, 43, and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, 30, have been declared by Israel to be dead, with their bodies held captive. On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists killed 49 Thai workers in Israel, including 11 murdered at Kibbutz Nir Oz, where five others were kidnapped.

Israel resumes release of Palestinian prisoners after temporary h...	Israeli leaders suspend release of Palestinian prisoners after freed hostages swarmed by Gaza crowds during transfer; following talks with mediators, officials agreed to proceed with exchange under stricter security measures Israel resumed the release of Palestinian prisoners Thursday evening, following a temporary suspension ordered by the government in response to chaotic scenes during the handover of Israeli hostages in Khan Younis. The third phase of the prisoner exchange began with buses carrying prisoners departing from Ofer and Ketziot prisons. However, violent clashes erupted in Beitunia in the West Bank as demonstrators protested the transfer. Earlier, Israeli authorities had halted the scheduled release of 110 Palestinian prisoners, after a Gazan crowd blocked the path of vehicles carrying freed hostages to their handover point in Khan Younis. The hostages were forced to walk through the crowd to reach Red Cross vehicles, leading Israel to issue a strong protest to mediators. Following the incident, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the Israel Prison Service (IPS) to halt the prisoner release until assurances were received that future hostage transfers would occur safely. 'The prime minister, alongside the defense minister, has ordered a delay in the release of prisoners until the safe passage of our hostages is guaranteed in the upcoming phases,' Netanyahu’s spokesperson, Omer Dostri, said. 'Israel demands that mediators secure these guarantees.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich added: 'I support the prime minister and call on him to halt the release of terrorists until assurances are received that the disturbing, degrading scenes from Gaza and the abuse of our hostages before their return will not happen again.' Buses carrying prisoners were instructed to stop and return to the prisons, while Hamas and other Palestinian factions condemned Israel’s move. Senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu said, 'We demand that Israel be held accountable for implementing the terms of the agreement.' After negotiations, Israel agreed to resume the releases following a commitment from mediators ensuring that future hostage transfers would be handled securely.

'Israel insists that lessons be learned, and that future handovers are conducted under strict security measures.' Prisoners were freed from Ketziot Prison in southern Israel and Ofer Prison near Givat Ze’ev. Of the 110 inmates released, about 30 were deported, while the rest were transferred to Gaza and the West Bank. Among the notable prisoners freed was Zakaria Zubeidi, a high-profile terrorist involved in multiple shooting attacks. In exchange for the release of Israeli hostage Agam Berger, Israel freed 30 prisoners serving life sentences and 20 prisoners with varying sentences; for Arbel Yehoud’s release, Israel freed 30 minors and women; and for Gadi Mozes' release, Israel freed 30 prisoners, including 27 serving various sentences and three serving life terms. The IDF dropped leaflets near Ofer Prison reading: 'We will not allow demonstrations in support of terrorism.' IPS Central District commander Shlomi Sagi said: 'We've been preparing the prisoners for release since last night. We'll load them onto buses and transfer them. The International Red Cross has conducted all necessary checks. There have been no unusual incidents; order and discipline are being maintained. We will ensure discipline to the end — no celebrations will be allowed.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1grwfkdyg	2025-01-30T07:14:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/rkBWWgFO1x/rkBWWgFO1x_0_82_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Freed Nahal Oz lookout Agam Berger reunites with family, joins fe...	Aboard the helicopter to the hospital, Agam told that Karina, Naama, Daniella and Liri, freed earlier, chose to stay with her another week; Her response: 'Perfect!' Watch the emotional reunion Agam Berger, the last of five female IDF lookouts abducted from Nahal Oz on October 7, was released from Hamas captivity on Thursday, marking an emotional reunion with her family and fellow soldiers in Israel. After 482 days in captivity, Berger was transferred to the IDF reception center at the Gaza border, where she reunited with her parents. 'We are here, we will never leave you, forever. A promise from your mother,' her mother, Merav, told her. From there, she was airlifted by an Israeli Air Force helicopter to Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, where she was greeted by the four other freed Nahal Oz lookouts—Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, Daniella Gilboa and Liri Albag, who were released in the previous phase of the deal last week. Upon seeing her fellow lookouts at the hospital, Berger ran toward them and embraced them tightly. She also reunited with her relatives, including her brother, whom she greeted with laughter and tears. 'How are you this tall? You're as tall as Dad!' she said emotionally. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Albag’s father, Eli, expressed his joy at Berger’s return, saying, 'They have closed the circle. Now, there is still a soldier from Nahal Oz who needs to be freed, along with all the other hostages—urgently.' The four released lookouts had prepared welcome signs for Berger’s arrival. In return, during her helicopter flight, she held up a handwritten message reading, 'We love you, Am Yisrael Chai.' Her parents also wrote a note to her during the flight, informing her that her fellow lookouts had decided to stay at the hospital for another week to be with her, to which she responded, 'Perfect!' Berger was handed over to Israeli security forces inside Gaza by Red Cross personnel after a staged release ceremony by Hamas in Jabaliya. According to Israeli officials, Hamas forced her to stand on a stage amid the ruins of destroyed homes, smile and wave as part of a psychological manipulation tactic. Alongside Berger, two Israeli civilians—Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Mozes, 80, both kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz—were also released near the ruins of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s home in Khan Younis. Additionally, five Thai nationals—Pongsak Thainna, 35, Sathin Suwankham, 34, Sariyaon Watchara, 32, Saitiao Banawat, 27, and Romano Surasak, 30—were freed as part of the exchange. As Berger’s helicopter landed at Rabin Medical Center, crowds gathered to cheer and welcome her home, marking another milestone in the ongoing efforts to bring back the remaining hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjl000mku1g	2025-01-30T06:32:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/B1AP00bYdyx/B1AP00bYdyx_0_0_2048_1364_0_small.jpg

Salwan Momika, 38, staged several burnings and desecrations of Islam's holy book in Sweden in 2023. Videos of the Quran burnings got worldwide publicity and raised anger and criticism in several Muslim nations, leading to riots and unrest in many places. The Stockholm District Court said a verdict scheduled Thursday in a trial in which Momika was a defendant was postponed because one of the defendants had died. A judge at the court confirmed that the deceased was Momika. He said he didn't have any information on when or how Momika died.

Meirav and Shlomi Berger met their daughter on Gaza border; From there, Agam and her parents were transferred by an Israeli Air Force helicopter to Rabin Medical Center, where she will reunite with four of her IDF lookout team who were released from Gaza on Saturday After 482 days in captivity, the long-awaited moment finally arrived. Agam Berger, a 20-year-old IDF lookout kidnapped from her post in Nahal Oz on Oct. 7, was reunited with her family on Thursday afternoon after being released by Hamas. The IDF released footage of Berger’s handover to IDF forces and the emotional reunion with her parents, Meirav and Shlomi, at a forward reception point. From there, she was flown by an Israeli Air Force helicopter to Rabin Medical Center, where she will join four fellow female soldiers who were freed from Hamas captivity on Saturday. Elite IDF forces and Israel’s Shin Bet security agency received Berger inside Gaza from Red Cross personnel after yet another orchestrated release ceremony staged by Hamas in the Jabaliya refugee camp. She was led out of the ruins of destroyed buildings toward a platform set up for the event, where she was seen walking on her own, smiling and even waving. Her family expressed their relief in a statement: 'Thank God we have reached this moment. Our hero, Agam, has returned to us after 482 days in enemy hands. Our daughter is strong, full of faith, and courageous. We want to thank the security forces and all of Israel for the support and prayers. Now, Agam and our family can begin the healing process – but the recovery will not be complete until all the hostages return home.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office also released a statement: 'The Government of Israel embraces IDF soldier Agam Berger. Her family has been updated by the responsible authorities that she is with our forces. The Government, together with all of the security officials, will accompany her and her family. The Government of Israel is committed to returning all of the hostages and the missing. 'And I will return the captivity of My people Israel.' (Amos 9:14).' Dr. Lena Koren Feldman, director of Beilinson Hospital, where Agam Berger arrived, said the four fellow observers who were freed on Saturday erupted in joy upon hearing the news of her release. 'Her return is part of their healing process,' Koren Feldman said. In Holon, dozens of friends and family members gathered outside Berger’s home, reciting Psalms and carrying a Torah scroll in celebration. 'I didn’t sleep all night,' one of her friends admitted. When Berger was seen emerging from the ruins in Jabaliya, her friends shouted, 'This is it—it’s happening.' Friends who watched footage of Berger being led by Hamas fighters onto the stage prepared for her release reacted with relief. 'Our champion. She looks okay. That’s her—that’s exactly her,' they said. 'Our hero, our fighter, we are so proud of her. The nightmare is over. We waited a year to see her again, and now it’s finally over.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1irzjkdkg	2025-01-30T02:53:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/SJhCtAO001e/SJhCtAO001e_0_0_1542_868_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah provocations persist: IDF intercepts reconnaissance dro...	IDF intercepted a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone as provocations increase during an extended cease-fire; Senior officials stress that security remains Israel's responsibility, with operations underway to dismantle terror strongholds and recover hidden munitions along the border For the first time since the cease-fire in the north took effect on November 27 last year, the IDF intercepted an unmanned aerial vehicle launched toward Israel. 'The Air Force intercepted a reconnaissance UAV belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization,' IDF spokesperson said on Thursday, adding: 'We will not allow Hezbollah’s terrorist activities in Lebanon and will act to eliminate any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens.' The original cease-fire agreement stipulated that IDF troops would withdraw from southern Lebanon after 60 days. However, on Sunday, the White House announced that the agreement had been extended until February 18, allowing IDF troops to remain in Lebanese territory until that date. The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, closely associated with Hezbollah, reported this week that the terrorist organization was not a party to the negotiations for extending the cease-fire in Lebanon and even rejected requests to prolong the deadline. During the additional three weeks in which, according to the agreement, IDF troops will remain in southern Lebanon, the military plans to carry out a range of operations to destroy terrorist strongholds and retrieve weapons hidden by Hezbollah, especially in the eastern sector bordering the Upper Galilee region. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier this week, after the original 60-day period ended, Hezbollah attempted to provoke confrontations by sending hundreds of operatives waving the organization’s flags to nearby villages along the border, trying to engage with IDF soldiers. A senior military official, still operating with his troops in southern Lebanon, told Ynet this week: 'Until the Lebanese army fulfills its responsibilities and demonstrates sufficient control over the area, we will not recommend transferring control to them.' He added: 'In villages not adjacent to the border in the western and central sectors of southern Lebanon, we have returned control to the Lebanese army. But in villages near us and in the border fence area along its entire length, we are still present.' He emphasized that no one in the Israeli military trusts the Lebanese forces to ensure the safety of the residents who have already started returning northward. 'The responsibility for the security of our residents lies with Israeli forces, certainly not with the Lebanese army or any other foreign force,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkx75auuyg	2025-01-30T02:45:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/HkxEUCpO00ke/HkxEUCpO00ke_149_11_1076_605_0_small.jpg

Major Kyiv mall reopens following destruction from Russian attack...	Retroville shopping mall in Kyiv, destroyed in a deadly Russian missile attack, was rebuilt and partially reopened in just four months; Its reopening symbolizes Ukraine’s resilience, with visitors now exceeding pre-war levels by 25% This was one of the deadliest Russian attacks against Ukraine at the beginning of the war. A Russian missile struck the Retroville shopping mall, one of the largest shopping centers in Kyiv, obliterating it. Eight were killed, and many were injured. Yedioth Ahronoth correspondent Ronen Bergman, together with photographer Ziv Koren, were among the first to arrive at the scene at the time of the attack. They documented immense destruction, with the entire commercial center turned into 'ashes and dust.' This week, we returned to the mall, which has unwillingly become one of the symbols of Ukraine's fight for independence. Nothing in the massive shopping center – featuring 3,000 parking spaces and offering a range of international brands like H&M, McDonald’s, Timberland, and Samsung – hints at the tragedy that occurred there three years ago. Customers stroll around with shopping bags, and the restaurants and cafes are full. Retroville is also a favorite spot for the Israeli community in Ukraine's capital due to its affordable prices and ample parking. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The mall's CEO, Renata Jakubcioniene, is among those responsible for the rapid reconstruction of the shopping center. At a time when Israel is also facing the damages of war, it is fascinating to hear how Ukraine is trying to recover and return to a normal life of commerce and economy. \ 'The mall was rebuilt and partially reopened within four months,' says the CEO. 'We managed to do this thanks to a strong team and quick solutions. We created a strategy to reopen the mall in phases.' Perhaps due to its symbolic significance, foot traffic in the mall has increased by 25% compared to pre-war levels. 'Retroville attracts about one million visitors a month. Almost all the tenants who were affected decided to reopen.' Did you receive assistance from insurance companies, Kyiv municipality, or donors? 'We received a lot of attention and sympathy from the authorities and the media, but there was no real financial support. The reconstruction work was carried out entirely from our internal resources. There was also a desire here to show that we are stronger than the enemy's attacks. This gave us the strength to reopen faster.' 'A short time after the attack, I arrived at the site and saw that they had struck the center of the mall,' recounts Vlada Molchanova, founder of the Lithuanian group Stolitsa, which owns Retroville. 'We made the decision not to give up and to reopen. This is symbolic not only for Ukraine itself but also for many people who have faced hardships because of the war. The message is: don’t give up.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryqxbpoujg	2025-01-30T02:02:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/rkohdkOdkl/rkohdkOdkl_245_38_1139_641_0_small.jpg

Mother of slain soldier whose murderers are freed: 'He would have...	Tzila Pikholtz's son Yaron was killed while serving in the IDF in 2001, and his Palestinian murderers are being released as part of the deal to bring the hostages home, but this does not change her mind about the worthiness of the arrangement; 'If Yaron were alive, he would have blessed this deal and hugged them' 'If bringing home living people is possible, life must take precedence over death,' says Tzila Pikholtz, mother of the Staff Sergeant Yaron Pikholtz, who was killed while serving in the IDF in 2001 and whose murderers are among those being released in the hostage exchange deal. Did the state inform you about the imminent release of your son's murderers? 'No. My daughter Chen's friend called her on Saturday at 8 a.m. and said there was a list of Hamas prisoners being released on Ynet, and that Yaron's murderers were on the list. We immediately got organized and drove to my other daughter, Ayala, who is religious, because we didn’t know how she would react and wanted her to hear it from us. Only on Saturday night did the casualty officer call us. It’s outrageous that we had to find this out through the media.' How did you feel when you first heard the news? 'Accelerated heartbeat, trembling and immense pain. It dragged us backward, as if we were reliving the day Yaron was murdered. But, to be honest, this past year has already brought us back to those moments. We experience every 'cleared for publication' personally, because we know what awaits those families. I was moved to see the girls who were released. They were born after Yaron was killed, and if he were alive, he would have blessed this deal and embraced them.' What is your opinion on the deal? 'If bringing home living people is possible, life must take precedence over death. We can't bring Yaron back, and, overall, these vile murderers have already served quite a long time – 21 years. Of course, there’s the fear they’ll return to terrorism and kill again, but the hostages are people who need to be saved. I was deeply moved to see the girls who were freed in the last two weeks. They were born after Yaron was killed – young girls with pure hearts who had just joined the army and didn’t know anything yet about life. If Yaron were alive, he would have blessed this deal and hugged them.' How did Yaron die? 'Yaron was a squad commander in the Engineering Corps, and was killed on November 29, 2001, during an encounter with an Islamic Jihad terrorist cell near Baqa al-Sharqiyya. The terrorists arrived at a checkpoint in a car with Israeli license plates. Yaron approached to inspect them and was shot at close range. He was airlifted to Hillel Yaffe Medical Center but died of his wounds en route. He was 20 years and nine months old.' When were the attackers caught? 'One of them was killed during operational activity. The other two, Jasser Radad and Basel Makhlouf, from the Tulkarm area, were caught two and a half months later. During the operation to capture them, Lt. Col. Eyal Weiss, from the Duvdevan Unit, was killed.'

'I was at an art class, and at the exact moment he was killed, all my yellow paint – his favorite color because he was a Maccabi Tel Aviv fan – spilled. I went home with a beautiful painting, feeling euphoric, with no bad feelings at all. That morning, he had returned to base after a weekend at home. At 4 p.m., he called to tell me that the soldiers loved the cookies I had baked for him and sent their thanks. I was so happy because he sounded happy, and it was such a good conversation. I had no idea that within an hour and a half, he would no longer be alive.' Did you follow the trial of his murderers? 'No. We were shattered and didn’t engage with it. It was a coping mechanism. I had two young daughters at home, and I wanted so badly to rebuild our lives and keep going that I chose not to invest energy in it.' Even now, you choose to work rather than retire. 'I’m a social worker by trade, and even though I’m of retirement age, I still work in elder care. In recent years, I’ve studied group facilitation and now volunteer by leading groups of bereaved mothers. A few years ago, my husband Amos and I established a memorial project for Yaron, where we distribute teddy bears to children with special needs. Over the years, we’ve donated thousands of teddy bears, and now we’re starting to give them to new war orphans. Sadly, there are far too many this past year.' Who funds this initiative? 'It’s our own money. Amos said that as long as we’re working and have the means, we’ll continue memorializing Yaron, so as many people as possible can come to know him.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hk2th2u001x	2025-01-30T00:15:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2021/04/11/rk9MQsxLd/rk9MQsxLd_0_21_1192_672_0_small.jpg

Gadi Mozes, 80, Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Agam Berger, 20, and 5 foreign workers are being released Thursday morning from captivity in Gaza; Watch the hostage release live After 482 days, Gadi Mozes, 80, Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Agam Berger, 20, and 5 foreign workers are being released Thursday morning from captivity in Gaza. Ynetnews is broadcasting their return live. Agam Berger emerges from an Islamic Jihad vehicle on her feet and mounts a stage in Jabaliya after Red Cross vehicles arrive at the collection point. Earlier, Islamic Jihad organization released a short video of Gadi Mozes and Arbel Yehoud, two of the Israeli hostages expected to be released, in which they embrace prior to their release from captivity. The exact date of the recording is unclear, but the organization noted that it was filmed 'during the final procedures for their handover.' Mozes was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, where his partner, Efrat Katz, was murdered. His ex-wife, Margalit Mozes, was also kidnapped but was freed in the first hostage release in November 2023. Born in Hadera, Mozes moved to Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza Strip about 60 years ago as part of a youth movement program. He worked in agriculture, eventually becoming a renowned agronomist who trained generations of farmers in the kibbutz and taught irrigation and crop cultivation courses worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Berger, a resident of Holon, was abducted from the Nahal Oz outpost just two months after enlisting in the IDF, where she served as a military lookout.In footage from the October 7 attack, Berger is seen with blood-stained face, though it remains unclear whether she was injured or if the blood belonged to fellow soldiers who were murdered in the shelter beside her. She is the last Nahal Oz lookout still in captivity, following the November 2023 rescue of Ori Magidish and the recovery of Noa Marciano’s body, after she was executed by her captors. This past Saturday, four additional lookouts—Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev and Daniella Gilboa—were freed Yehoud was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz along with her partner, Ariel Cunio, during the October 7 attack. Her brother, Dolev, left his home that morning to help treat the wounded. After eight months of uncertainty, his body was finally discovered in the kibbutz. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Under the original terms of the hostage deal, the first groups to be released were female civilian captives. Yehoud was initially slated to be freed in the first or second phase, but due to what Hamas called 'technical issues,' her release was postponed. Instead, Hamas prioritized the release of the four female military lookouts. In response, Israel refused to open the Netzarim Corridor for humanitarian movement. Following mediation efforts, an agreement was reached to secure Yehoud’s release on Thursday. As part of the deal, the Netzarim Corridor was reopened, allowing hundreds of thousands of Gazans to return to northern Gaza. The freed hostages will have a basic medical examination at the border before being taken to one of four Israeli hospitals. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1b9yoddjx	2025-01-29T22:49:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/S1G5D6vuke/S1G5D6vuke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Trump signs executive order to revoke visas of foreign students supporting Hamas, intensifies antisemitism crackdown and targets campus extremism; The order mandates investigations, deportations and restrictions on federal funding for institutions promoting anti-American or antisemitic ideologies President Trump fulfilled another of his campaign promises on Wednesday night by signing an executive order to revoke visas for all foreign 'Hamas supporters' studying on U.S. campuses and deport them. The order also directs the Justice Department to intensify efforts to combat antisemitism, stating it must 'aggressively pursue indictments for terrorist threats, arson, vandalism, and violence against Jewish Americans.' The order pledges to 'investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist and anti-American colleges and universities' and instructs government agencies to identify and utilize all available legal tools against antisemitic attackers and harassers within 60 days. In an explanatory document attached to the order, Trump states: 'To all foreign nationals who participated in pro-jihadist demonstrations, consider yourselves warned – in 2025, we will find you and deport you.' He further adds, 'I will act swiftly to revoke the visas of Hamas-supporting students on campuses, where extremism has become more rampant than ever.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The order specifically targets foreign nationals who violated the law during protests that have erupted on U.S. campuses since the October 7 massacre, which sparked demonstrations against Israel's war in Gaza. Trump also instructed government agencies to submit recommendations on the matter to the White House within 60 days. The Justice Department is reportedly tasked with investigating incidents such as graffiti slogans supporting Hamas. During his election campaign, Trump vowed to expel 'Hamas supporters' from U.S. universities. At a rally in May, he declared: 'When I am president, we will not allow violent extremists to take over our campuses. If you came here from another country and tried to bring jihadism, anti-Americanism, or antisemitism to our campuses – we will deport you immediately.' During the campaign, Trump also promised to prioritize addressing discrimination on campuses, particularly antisemitism, as well as policies like affirmative action and diversity programs (DEI) related to gender identity and racial equality. These programs were already ordered removed from all branches of the U.S. government during his first days in office. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt announced Wednesday night that Trump plans to sign another executive order addressing the education system. Among other measures, it will block federal funding for institutions that promote curricula accusing the U.S. of institutional racism. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aoa5uoyg	2025-01-29T22:09:28-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/09/rJ63Ithbkg/rJ63Ithbkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Mother of hostage Segev Kalfon: 'You will return. Stay strong. We...	Gailt urges Segev to hold on just a little longer, as she believes with all her heart he’ll be home soon; 'Segev, if you’re listening, know there's a deal, and hostages are returning, Dad is doing everything he can, we know you will come home' As hostages are gradually released under the ongoing deal, Segev Kalfon's mother, Galit, is determined to send him a message of strength and hope. 'I want my son to know that we are strong, thinking of him constantly, and working behind the scenes for his return,' she said Wednesday. Segev was kidnapped on Oct. 7 from the Nova music festival. 'He's a kind-hearted young man who wins people over,' Galit said. 'He has so many friends. I never liked him going to parties like Nova, and on Oct. 7, I woke up in a panic when I saw he wasn't home. I called him, and he reassured me, but I could hear chaos in the background. He sounded anxious and said he had abandoned his car.' 'Later, we spoke again and asked him to send his location. That’s when I realized he was exactly where I feared most. The call disconnected, and I understood he had been taken – around 8:20 a.m. A friend of his, who hid in the bushes, later told me Segev wasn’t injured when he was kidnapped. We know he's alive, but I can’t share more than that. We're just waiting for him to come home.' Galit expressed frustration over how long the ordeal has dragged on. 'Everyone should have been home by now. It’s unreal that this is taking so long,' she said. 'This sends a message for generations to come –that if civilians are kidnapped, the country stands behind them.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She also called for more open support from politicians. 'We have an assigned officer who stays in touch, and we meet with Knesset members – mostly those who support us. But I want them to be more vocal, to go on record saying they stand behind Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in bringing the hostages home.' Since Segev’s abduction, the Kalfon family's life has been at a standstill. 'I haven’t gone back to work. My husband works, but he’s barely functioning. Our son, Shai, is keeping the family business running. My daughter studies from home so I won’t be alone,' Galit shared. 'Our lives have changed. My faith has strengthened, and prayers are what keep me going. I just want us to be a family again – to have our Friday night dinners that Segev loves so much.' Galit knows some of the families whose loved ones have already been released but said they had no new information about her son. 'I want to be in that place already,' she said, and addressed Segev directly: 'I heard that some hostages can listen to the radio. If you hear me now, know that I am strong. I’m sensitive and emotional, but strong. Hold on just a little longer – I believe with all my heart that soon you’ll be home. Segev, if you’re listening, know that there’s a deal in place, and hostages are coming back. You will return. Stay strong. We believe in you. Dad is doing everything he can. Every second, we’re praying. We know – without a doubt – you will come home.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj3x8fooje	2025-01-29T21:16:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/01/07/SJ7MMNduT/SJ7MMNduT_0_256_591_333_0_small.jpg

Israel faces new security concerns as Palestinians return to nort...	As thousands return to their homes in northern Gaza, Israeli security officials debate the potential risks of Hamas regrouping and the challenges of maintaining long-term security Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians returned to northern Gaza on Tuesday after the IDF withdrew from a key crossing that had previously blocked their movement during the war. The withdrawal was part of a cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel earlier this month. Despite agreeing to the cease-fire, the Israeli government has vowed to resume military operations once the first stage of the deal is completed. At the start of the war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to dismantle Hamas’s military infrastructure and remove it from power in Gaza. As this objective remains unfulfilled, Israel has committed to continuing the war. Although negotiations to extend the cease-fire are set to begin next week, deep distrust between the two sides leaves little hope that it will last beyond its initial phase, which is scheduled to end in early March. The sight of refugees carrying their belongings on foot was both emotional for Palestinians and concerning for Israelis, who fear the security implications of a repopulated northern Gaza. With Israeli forces no longer present in the area, there are growing concerns that Hamas could regain control and pose a renewed threat to Israel. Before the war, northern Gaza was home to approximately one million people and borders Israeli communities known as the 'Gaza Envelope.' These areas have been targeted by Hamas for over two decades, particularly since Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. The Palestinian cities of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahiya previously served as Hamas’s strongholds and were the launch sites for its October 7, 2023, terrorist attack—one of the deadliest conflicts in the region in recent years. Critics of the cease-fire argue that allowing Palestinians to return to these areas endangers Israel. They advocate for maintaining an unpopulated buffer zone along the border. 'Everything is reversible,' Dr. Harel Chorev of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Tel Aviv University said. 'If there will be an operational need, the population can be moved again.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Brig. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Nuriel, former director of the Counter-Terrorism Bureau at the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, warned that allowing Palestinian residents to return would severely limit Israel’s ability to carry out future military operations. 'Any future evacuation will likely be for a much more limited time period and not see residents heading all the way to southern Gaza,' Nuriel said. 'It will also limit Israel’s ability to use firepower and undertake ground operations during the presence of a civilian population. The simple rules of engagement will become much more complicated.' The cease-fire was reached after more than 15 months of war. Hamas’ surprise offensive resulted in the deaths of around 1,200 Israelis, thousands of injuries, and the capture of approximately 250 hostages. Of those, 90 remain in captivity. Some hostages have already been released or are set for release as part of the current ceasefire, while others, whose fate remains uncertain, may be freed in a second phase of negotiations. Israel responded with a large-scale military operation in Gaza, aiming to destroy Hamas’s military capabilities and remove it from power. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, over 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, and approximately 110,000 have been injured. Many areas in Gaza have been reduced to rubble, with UN figures indicating that over 90% of housing units have been destroyed and nearly 70% of all structures either damaged or obliterated. The large-scale destruction drew international calls for Israel to halt the war and agree to a cease-fire months before it was finally reached. 'Israel now has much more operational freedom than it would have had if it had agreed to a ceasefire at the beginning of 2024,' said Chorev, addressing concerns that Israel may not be able to resume fighting if the ceasefire fails. 'This freedom has been reached by the killing of approximately 20,000 Hamas terrorists and significant damage to military infrastructure, including tunnels and manufacturing workshops.' According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), approximately 200,000 people returned to northern Gaza from the south on Monday. The UN estimates that nearly two million Palestinians were displaced during the war as the Israeli military advanced through the Gaza Strip. While some followed Israeli evacuation orders, others fled in fear of the massive air and ground offensive. 'The area does not look like what it used to, this is clear,' said Nuriel. 'But the operational infrastructure that the army will face means it will essentially be starting from scratch, and this is a significant challenge.' The cease-fire has facilitated the return of residents. As part of the deal, Hamas has begun releasing Israeli hostages, and Israeli forces have withdrawn from most of Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are also set to be released from Israeli jails as part of the agreement. When the details of the deal emerged, some within the Netanyahu government criticized the withdrawal from northern Gaza, arguing that it would allow Hamas to regroup. 'There is no doubt that Hamas will take advantage of this time to reconstruct tunnels and train new recruits,' Chorev said. The war in Gaza quickly expanded into a broader regional conflict. The Lebanese-based terrorist group Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels joined Hamas in attacking Israel. During the war, Israel and Iran engaged in direct strikes for the first time after decades of a shadow conflict. Israel’s military campaign against Hezbollah severely weakened the Iran-backed group, which also contributed to the collapse of the Bashar Assad regime in Syria. Hamas cannot ignore this regional fallout, even as it gains temporary respite through the ceasefire. 'Hamas is currently limited in the resources it needs in order to recover,' Chorev added. 'They are dependent on supplies from outside Gaza, and those supply lines have been damaged by Israel’s extensive attacks on the ‘resistance axis’ from Syria to Lebanon. Hamas now faces significant challenges in smuggling weapons.' Israeli forces still control the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza, a narrow strip of land bordering Egypt that has long served as a key supply route for Hamas. Hamas is unlikely to accept an ongoing Israeli presence there in future negotiations. 'Looking at the situation rationally, Hamas has suffered a significant blow and lacks the means to rebuild,' said Nuriel. 'There is room for some optimism, but real optimism can only come if the government makes meaningful decisions about Gaza’s future and who will govern it after Hamas.' This is a question that Netanyahu’s government has largely avoided for political reasons. The far-right coalition refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, to assume control of Gaza, arguing that it also supports terrorism. Israeli media has reported that Egyptian and American security contractors have set up roadblocks leading to northern Gaza to monitor traffic and prevent terrorists from moving arms into the area. 'The likelihood of preventing small arms is very slim,' said Nuriel. 'However, the intention of these roadblocks is to prevent the transfer of large rockets or missiles—those can be detected by these companies.' As the fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas holds, Israel faces not only military challenges but also political ones. A government that pledged to dismantle Hamas will face immense pressure, both domestically and internationally, should it decide to resume military operations in Gaza. That pressure may prove to be an even greater challenge than the war itself.

Israel estimates: Hamas is interested in completing the next two phases, Thursday and Saturday, because of the importance of opening the Rafah crossing Eight hostages are spending thier last hours in the hell of Gaza. Arbel Yehoud , who was supposed to be released in one of the first two waves; Agam Berger, the last IDF observer left in the Strip; and Gadi Mozes , who celebrated his 80th birthday in captivity are the three Israeli hostages on the list of those to be released later Thursday morning, along with five abductees from Thailand, and according to Israeli estimates they will be released between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. However, preparations were made to receive them from early morning, in case Hamas decides to advance the release process. It is estimated that the release will take place from two different locations simultaneously. The assessment in Israel is that Hamas has an interest in completing the next two phases - Thursday and the one on Saturday, when three men are supposed to be released from captivity alive - because of the importance for them of opening the Rafah Crossing, which is supposed to open between Friday and Saturday, from the 14th day of the cease-fire. This crossing is supposed to allow 50 wounded Palestinians to pass through every day, in addition to three companions for each wounded person - and a total of 200 people every day, subject to approvals from the Shin Bet and Egypt. The agreement includes a clause stating that if Hamas wants to transfer children beyond this number, it will be possible to do so subject to Israeli approval - and it is estimated that Israel will not object. The Ministry of Health reported that the hostages who will be released today will arrive, after an initial medical assessment, at Ichilov, Sheba, Assaf Harofeh, and Beilinson hospitals. Barzilai and Soroka hospitals will be prepared to provide a response if there is a medical need for a non-emergency response. Agam Berger is expected to arrive at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva, where her four fellow observers who were released in the second phase of the deal were transferred. Gadi Mozes will likely be admitted to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv, and Arbel Yehoud to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer. The five Thais who will be released will arrive at Assaf Harofeh-Shamir Hospital in Tzirifin. The format for the releases is expected to be similar to the previous one: Hamas will inform the Red Cross representatives at the last minute of where to arrive and pick up the hostages in a way that will be recorded live by Arab television networks, in order to garner political, image, internal and international capital. The hostages will then be transferred from the Red Cross to special unit fighters in the area where the IDF remains on the Netzarim Corridor, and from there to the initial absorption facility in the Re'im camp in the center of the Gaza Strip for a basic medical examination. At the base, the hostages will be able to reunite with their immediate families, but their remaining relatives will wait for them in the hospitals to which they will be flown by Air Force helicopter for further examinations and treatment if necessary. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Medical Corps is preparing to provide Gadi Mozes with advanced treatment already at the Re'im camp, mainly due to his advanced age and in light of the fact that he survived a year and four months in harsh captivity conditions, which are certainly more evident on his body than in other hostages. Hamas did not announce the names of the five Thais who will be released, apparently due to concerns about mistaken identification, and their identities will only be announced at the crossing point. The Ethnic Restaurants Organization, together with the Abductees' Directorate at the Prime Minister's Office, will ensure that Thai food is sent for the Thai abductees who will be released today to the embassy staff who will accompany them. Ten of the 90 abductees still being held captive in the Gaza Strip are foreign citizens who were kidnapped from the surrounding kibbutzim. Eight of them are Thai citizens, most of whom came to Israel to support their families. Two more arrived in Israel from Nepal and Tanzania. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjo3yydu1g	2025-01-29T20:48:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/S1G5D6vuke/S1G5D6vuke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Qatar's Emir to visit Damascus on Thursday, Al Jazeera says	Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani will visit Damascus on Thursday, Qatar's Al Jazeera reported, as Syria's new interim government begins a political transition after Islamist rebels ousted the Assad regime last year. Qatar's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Qatar, a longtime supporter of the armed uprising against former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, had been lobbying Washington to issue a sanctions exemption allowing it to provide funding through official channels, the U.S. official and diplomat said. Earlier in January, Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani visited Damascus. Qatar will supply Syria with 200 megawatts of electricity, and plans to gradually increase supply, Thani said in a press conference in Damascus on Thursday. In December, Qatar said it would reopen its embassy in Damascus after more than 13 years, a week after Assad was removed from power. Qatar shut its embassy in July 2011 after withdrawing its ambassador in protest against Assad's deadly crackdown on demonstrators, violence that spiraled into a 13-year-long civil war.

Report: 18 bodies recovered from river where plane crashed in Was...	CBS reported that 18 bodies were recovered from the Potomac River, where an American Airlines plane crashed after colliding with a military Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1yk0fdujg	2025-01-29T20:28:18-08:00	
Passenger plane carrying 64 crashes after colliding with an Army ...	American Airlines plane crashed into the Potomac River; Multiple bodies pulled from the water but no survivors had so far been found; 3 soldiers were in the Black Hawk helicopter which was on a training mission A jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided Wednesday with an Army helicopter while landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, prompting a large search-and-rescue operation in the nearby Potomac River. The Washington Post, citing sources, said multiple bodies had been pulled from the water. No survivors had so far been found, the newspaper reported. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on social media that 'we know there are fatalities,' though he did not say how many. Watch the footage of the collision, and the resulting fireball: All takeoffs and landings from the airport were halted as helicopters from law enforcement agencies across the region flew over the scene in search of survivors. Inflatable rescue boats were launched into the Potomac River from a point along the George Washington Parkway, just north of the airport, and first responders set up light towers from the shore to illuminate the area near the site of the collision. President Donald Trump said he had been 'fully briefed on this terrible accident' and, referring to the passengers, added, 'May God Bless their souls.' Some friends, family and relatives of passengers gathered at Reagan Washington National seeking more information. Police said multiple agencies were involved in a search and rescue operation in the Potomac River, which borders the airport. Dozens of police, ambulance and rescue units, some ferrying boats, staged along the river and raced to positions along the tarmac of Reagan airport. Live TV images showed several boats in the water, flashing blue and red lights. The Federal Aviation Administration said the midair crash occurred around 9 p.m. EST when a regional jet that had departed from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a military helicopter on a training flight while on approach to an airport runway. It occurred in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over three miles south of the White House and the Capitol. Investigators will try to piece together the aircrafts' final moments before their collision, including contact with air traffic controllers as well as a loss of altitude by the passenger jet. American Airlines Flight 5342 was inbound to Reagan National at an altitude of about 400 feet and a speed of about 140 miles per hour when it suffered a rapid loss of altitude over the Potomac River, according to data from its radio transponder. The Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet, manufactured in 2004, can be configured to carry up to 70 passengers. A few minutes before landing, air traffic controllers asked the arriving commercial jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33 at Reagan National and the pilots said they were able. Controllers then cleared the plane to land on Runway 33. Flight tracking sites showed the plane adjust its approach to the new runway. Less than 30 seconds before the crash, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the arriving plane in sight. The controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later: 'PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.' Seconds after that, the two aircraft collided. The plane's radio transponder stopped transmitting about 2,400 feet short of the runway, roughly over the middle of the river. Video from an observation camera at the nearby Kennedy Center showed two sets of lights consistent with aircraft appearing to join in a fireball. The collision occurred on a warm winter evening in Washington, with temperatures registering as high as 60 degrees Fahrenheit, following a stretch days earlier of intense cold and ice. On Wednesday, the Potomac River was 36 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The National Weather Service reported that wind gusts of up to 25 mph were possible in the area throughout the evening. The U.S. Army described the helicopter as a UH-60 Blackhawk based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. A crew of three soldiers were onboard the helicopter, an Army official said. The helicopter was on a training flight. The crash is serving as a major test for two of the Trump administration's newest agency leaders. Pete Hegseth, sworn in days ago as defense secretary, posted on social media that his department was 'actively monitoring' the situation that involved an Army helicopter. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, just sworn in earlier this week, said in a social media post that he was 'at the FAA HQ and closely monitoring the situation.' The airport was to remain closed until 5 a.m. Friday. Located along the Potomac River, just southwest of the city. Reagan National is a popular choice because it's much closer than the larger Dulles International Airport, which is deeper in Virginia. Depending on the runway being used, flights into Reagan can offer passengers spectacular views of landmarks like the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol. It's a postcard-worthy welcome for tourists visiting the city. The incident recalled the crash of an Air Florida flight that plummeted into the Potomac on January 13, 1982, that killed 78 people. That crash was attributed to bad weather. The last fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, including 45 passengers, 2 pilots and 2 flight attendants. Another person on the ground also died, bringing the total death toll to 50. An investigation determined that the captain accidentally caused the plane to stall as it approached the airport in Buffalo.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkhtfydu1l	2025-01-29T20:25:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/30/Hy100WKOdkx/Hy100WKOdkx_1_34_800_451_0_small.jpg

An American Airlines regional passenger jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed into the Potomac River after a midair collision near Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night, officials said. There were 60 passengers and four crew members aboard the plane. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter, a U.S. official said. The Washington Post, citing sources, said multiple bodies had been pulled from the water. No survivors had so far been found, the newspaper reported. The U.S. Army said in a statement that it could 'confirm that the aircraft involved in tonight's incident was an Army UH-60 helicopter out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia. We are working with local officials and will provide additional information once it becomes available.' The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said a PSA Airlines CRJ700 regional jet collided midair with the helicopter while on approach to Reagan. PSA was operating Flight 5342 for American Airlines, which had departed from Wichita, Kansas, according to the FAA. The airport said late on Wednesday that all takeoffs and landings had been halted as emergency personnel responded to an aircraft incident.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkmulyo001e	2025-01-29T19:58:35-08:00

The IDF has conducted situation assessments and plans to tighten intelligence operations surrounding the event. So far, no prisoners released in the past week have been rearrested, and Israeli authorities are advising against immediate detentions, opting instead to monitor the situation over time. Meanwhile, hundreds of additional troops have been deployed to the West Bank to bolster both defensive and offensive operations. Military preparations include removing Palestinian flags from public spaces, setting up ambushes on roads leading to celebration sites, and, if necessary, conducting precise airstrikes near gathering areas as a warning. Should large-scale rallies take place, security forces are prepared to disperse them by force if operational conditions allow it and approval is granted. However, stopping the celebrations remains a challenge, particularly in densely packed cities like Ramallah, Nablus, and Bethlehem, where thousands of unarmed civilians, including children and the elderly, often participate. Such scenes are broadcast live across the Arab world, complicating Israeli efforts to intervene directly. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1iuzqooyl	2025-01-29T13:32:09-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/H1tOyPMukx/H1tOyPMukx_0_240_1280_721_0_small.jpg

How the IDF cracks down on online incitement	Established after Oct. 7 massacre, counter-incitement unit tracks social media activity, flags suspicious Facebook accounts and employs legal experts to prosecute offenders; 'We're seeing impact, but there’s still a lot of work to do' As part of the planned hostage deal, Israel is set to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners by the end of the week, many of whom will return to the West Bank. Despite efforts by the IDF's Central Command to curb celebrations, images of terrorists rejoicing continue to circulate online. A specialized counter-incitement unit, formed within Central Command at the outset of the war, has been at the forefront of efforts to combat public and online incitement. Led by military prosecutors in the West Bank Division, the unit operates in coordination with intelligence officers and operational teams under the command of Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth. In 2024, the unit has filed 303 indictments for incitement offenses. In comparison, the West Bank Military Prosecution typically filed 60 to 70 such cases per year in the past. During the 2015 wave of lone-wolf attacks, that number peaked at around 150. 'There is no doubt we've seen a surge,' a senior official in the West Bank prosecution said. 'Before the war, this issue fell through the cracks. It requires coordination between multiple agencies. Immediately after Oct. 7, we saw a sharp rise in online incitement, particularly among women, with people praising martyrs and glorifying Hamas' attack.' The official outlined the challenges of enforcement, explaining that legal complexities often make it difficult to define incitement. 'For example, someone wrote after Oct. 7, ‘a great and glorious act.’ On the surface, it looks like incitement, but it could be interpreted differently. We have to consider context and the use of certain phrases rather than just their literal meaning.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Investigators employ technological tools to track incitement but must go beyond simple screenshots. 'Once we detect incitement on a Facebook post, for instance, we need to ‘capture’ the entire page,' the official said. 'We scroll through past posts, gather as much evidence as possible to establish a pattern of incitement and link the page to a specific suspect. Then, we build an indictment under a defined legal provision.' To aid prosecutions, the military commander of Central Command issued a minimum sentencing order after the war began, mandating at least one year in prison for incitement, with at least six months served behind bars. Among those arrested by the counter-incitement unit were members of a Palestinian band called Al-Ibaa, which performed at various venues in the West Bank. According to an indictment, after Oct. 7, the student council at An-Najah University in Nablus invited one of the band's singers to perform at an event. The singer agreed to a payment of 4,000 shekels. When the band arrived in early May, they realized the event was a memorial for 'martyrs' and was decorated with Hamas flags. During the performance, the musicians sang, 'Advance, O Hamas, you strike fear into everyone. May God grant you victory.' In another case, prosecutors indicted a 50-year-old Palestinian woman from the village of Sanur in the northern West Bank for multiple inciting posts on social media. She allegedly shared an illustration of Hamas terrorists with the caption 'Al-Aqsa Flood'—the name Hamas gave to its Oct. 7 attack. In a separate post, she wrote, 'Tel Aviv is burning. Praise be to God. May God guide our army’s fire,' accompanied by a green heart—Hamas’ signature color. Israel’s counter-incitement efforts are expected to intensify as the war continues, with authorities closely monitoring online activity and taking legal action against those suspected of encouraging violence. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjdh00yooyx	2025-01-29T12:49:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/yk14240678/yk14240678_0_162_425_240_0_small.jpg

October 7 massacre in Sderot: The security gaps that left civilia...	IDF probe reveals failures in Sderot’s 7/10 defense: alert squad left with handguns, long rifles taken before attack and police station battle diverting forces; while military takes blame, criticism also falls on local leadership In the coming weeks, the IDF is set to release a series of investigations into the October 7 Hamas attacks on communities in southern Israel, including those in the Gaza border region and the western Negev. The central theme emerging from these investigations is the military’s failure to defend Israeli communities, an assessment that has been widely acknowledged, with officials taking responsibility. However, following the release of findings regarding Kibbutz Be’eri, public outrage led the IDF to pause publication of additional reports. Despite this, newly appointed Defense Minister Israel Katz has instructed officials to accelerate the completion of the investigations, pushing for the release of outstanding findings. One of the most anticipated reports, now in its final stages, focuses on security failures in the town of Sderot. The investigation reveals significant lapses within the military, but also places blame on local authorities, including the Sderot Municipality and its security division. The report highlights the town's inability to respond effectively to the Hamas assault, despite having years of experience transitioning between routine and emergency situations due to ongoing security threats. On October 7, 22 members of Sderot’s civilian alert squad were present in the town. Unlike the armed security teams in other Gaza border communities, whose M-16 rifles had been confiscated per military orders, Sderot’s municipal security division voluntarily handed over its weapons to the Gaza Division, without any directive to do so. This decision was made unbeknownst to Mayor Alon Davidi, and after the handover, no one informed him that the alert squad had been left without automatic weapons. The rifles were stored in a military armory for an extended period. Although Gaza Division officials later recommended that the municipal security division retrieve the weapons and rearm the team, nothing was done due to concerns that the weapons could be stolen from members’ homes. As a result, when the October 7 attack began, alert squad members were left armed only with personal handguns, severely limiting their ability to engage the dozens of Hamas terrorists who stormed the town. The investigation also reveals that, prior to October 7, Sderot's longtime security chief, Kobi Harush, had resigned due to health reasons, and his successor, Ronen Gabay, had no prior security experience, having previously served as Mayor Davidi’s driver. Upon taking office, Gabay began the process of retrieving the weapons his predecessor had handed over, but the bureaucratic process dragged on. The delay was largely due to a requirement that emergency responders install safes in their homes to store the rifles—a costly process that lacked funding and clear oversight. Harush had stepped down in summer 2022 after being diagnosed with cancer and required to undergo life-saving treatments. Military protocol required him to return all weapons under his authority until a replacement was formally appointed on January 1, 2023. However, months of bureaucratic delays in the municipality stalled the official appointment, leaving no one authorized to sign for the weapons. Even when the alert squad was eventually approved for rearmament, bureaucratic obstacles resurfaced—this time over the lack of safes required for storing M-16 rifles, further delaying the process. Mayor learned of the shortage – on the day of the massacre Another critical finding from the investigation: Mayor Davidi was entirely unaware that members of the town’s alert squad lacked automatic weapons. He only discovered this fact on the day of the attack. The investigation further revealed that Sderot’s alert suqad had not undergone the required training and drills, which fall under the responsibility of the IDF. The town’s security coordinator, like all other security coordinators, operates under the IDF’s authority and works directly with it. Today, the situation in Sderot is different. Following the events of October 7, the town decided to establish a large security division. It is headed by Eran Guez, a retired IDF lieutenant colonel with a background in combat and intelligence, who has built a significant and efficient security framework for the residents. The security division has substantial budgets and personnel allocations. It also oversees the municipal supervision unit, managed by Tal Mehai, which consists of dozens of young inspectors, most of whom are veterans of IDF combat units. As part of the conclusions drawn from October 7, it was decided that the security coordinator’s role would now fall under the new head of the security division. This means that Gabay would report to Lt. Col. (res.) Guez. The two clashed repeatedly, mainly over authority issues, to the point of a complete breakdown in their relationship, including shouting matches in various forums. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ultimately, Mayor Davidi decided to remove Gabay from his position and conducted a hearing for him earlier this month. A process will now begin to find a new security coordinator. Gabay, however, intends to fight to keep his job and may take legal action. Gabay was seriously wounded on October 7 when he engaged the terrorists who had barricaded themselves inside the Sderot police station. Regarding that infamous battle, the investigation found that a large number of police forces arrived at the station but remained concentrated there, failing to spread out across the town or provide responses to other attack sites. The reason for this, it appears, is that officers had clearer situational awareness from their colleagues at the police station but were less informed about the other attack locations throughout the town. Many police officers in Sderot lost their lives defending the town, saving countless others. As in other communities near Gaza, the defenders of Sderot were heavily outgunned and outnumbered, similar to those in Kibbutz Be’eri and Kfar Aza. In Sderot alone, there were at least 11 active combat zones on October 7. Two of them are well known to the public: the battle at the police station and the horrific massacre of a group of pensioners on their way for a day trip to the Dead Sea. Why were the shelter doors locked? Another crucial issue raised in the investigation is the question—why did the doors of the town's public bomb shelters remain locked on the day of the massacre? This can be understood through the claims made by the victims' families. Recently, a massive lawsuit was filed in the Tel Aviv District Court by the families of the victims of the so-called 'Pensioners' Massacre' in Sderot, in which 13 elderly people were murdered in a Hamas ambush. The lawsuit, totaling NIS 12 million ($3.36 million), was filed by eight families of the victims, accusing the Sderot municipality and Motorola of severe negligence that led to the massacre due to a critical failure in the Gatekeeper smart shelter system. Thirteen senior citizens were murdered in that attack in Sderot while on their way to a spa day at the Dead Sea. At 6:30 a.m., as a massive rocket barrage began targeting the town, their minibus suffered a flat tire, leaving them stranded by the roadside near a municipal smart shelter. This smart shelter, operated by Motorola, was supposed to open automatically in emergencies and during an air raid siren. It was equipped with a heavy door that could be locked from the inside. However, when the elderly passengers attempted to enter, the system failed—the doors remained locked, and all attempts by both the victims and passing police officers to open them were unsuccessful. Minutes later, Hamas terrorists arrived in pickup trucks and slaughtered all 13 elderly individuals, who stood helpless and unprotected beside the locked shelter. Had the shelter doors opened, the lawsuit claims, the terrorists would have likely continued driving past without noticing the group, and their lives would have been spared. The lawsuit was filed by the families of the victims: Zinaida Beilin, Lyudmila Furman, Valery Friedman, Igor Kurtzer, Nadezhda Sprivchakov, Berta Shmiayev-Batsian, Michal Zerbailov and Lilia Giller. The IDF said in response: 'On October 7, the IDF failed in its mission. However, IDF soldiers, reservists, alert squads and civilians fought heroically throughout the Gaza border region. The findings presented in this article do not constitute an official IDF investigation. The IDF is conducting its own inquiry into the events of October 7 and their preceding circumstances, including the battle in Sderot. Once the investigation is completed, it will be transparently presented to the bereaved families, residents and subsequently, the public.' The Sderot Municipality stated: 'On October 7, members of the alert squad and the security coordinator fought bravely alongside IDF soldiers, police officers, commanders, reservists and civilians to stop the attack and save lives. The security coordinator, Ronen Gabay, was wounded by terrorist gunfire during the battle at the police station, was evacuated by medical teams and hospitalized. 'Regarding the alert squad—firstly, it is important to note that such teams are operated and overseen by the IDF. The IDF determines the number of team members in each community and is responsible for ensuring that all members are equipped with firearms, which unfortunately did not happen on the morning of October 7. 'Regarding the weapons issue—in August 2022, when the town's previous security coordinator completed his tenure, he decided to return the weapons to the army. The town's leadership was unaware of this, and from its perspective, the alert squad continued to operate as usual. After appointing a new security coordinator—a process that took several months—the alert squad was restructured and underwent several training sessions. 'As part of rebuilding the team, applications were submitted to the National Security Ministry to issue firearm licenses as required. However, the process was delayed because the previous security coordinator had failed to return the IDF-issued weapon storage facilities for team members’ homes. As a result, on October 7, alert squad members did not have long rifles but went out to fight with their handguns. 'Today, following the mayor’s directive and actions taken by the security division, the alert squad now includes over 100 members, all equipped with long rifles and full gear. 'Regarding the shelter near the library—a lawsuit has been filed in court by some of the victims' families, and therefore, we are unable to comment on the matter.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjglzmduyx	2025-01-29T12:29:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/07/r100iewCeT/r100iewCeT_128_1_615_347_0_small.jpg
Rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa appointed Syrian president, armed fa...	After 54 years of Assad family rule, Syria enters a new era with Ahmad al-Sharaa as transitional president; rebel factions unite to form a national army, pledging to rebuild the country and reshape its foreign policy and economy Ahmad al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani), leader of Syria’s new administration, delivered a victory speech on Wednesday, marking his official appointment as the transitional president of Syria. The event was attended by prominent Syrian military faction leaders, the prime minister and several ministers from the caretaker government. According to a military source present at the closed-door meeting, attendees unanimously approved Sharaa's appointment as Syria’s transitional president, granting him authority to form a legislative council for the interim period. 'Months ago, Damascus appeared to me like a devoted mother, wounded and distressed, looking upon her children for salvation while bleeding and struggling with humiliation. But today, Syria rises with newfound dignity,' Sharaa said during his speech. 'We have broken the chains, liberated the oppressed and dusted off the humiliation that clouded Damascus. The sun of Syria shines anew as people chant in celebration of this monumental victory.' Sharaa emphasized that while wars typically bring destruction, Syria’s victory was characterized by 'mercy, justice and compassion.' He called for renewed determination to rebuild Syria, highlighting the need to restore state institutions, preserve civil peace and revive the country’s economy and international standing. The military source revealed that 18 armed factions agreed to dissolve themselves and integrate into the Defense Ministry to form a unified Syrian army. Among these groups were Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Jaysh al-Nasr and Jaysh al-Izza. Military commander Fadlallah al-Hajji described this as the 'beginning of a new era toward building a just nation for Syrians who have made tremendous sacrifices.' Commander Azzam al-Gharib highlighted the responsibility that comes with this victory, urging everyone to contribute to state-building efforts. Meanwhile, Ahmed Issa Sheikh stressed the importance of unity, compassion and collaboration in rebuilding Syria. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Amir Sheikh echoed these sentiments, asserting that just as 'protests were the path to liberation, solidarity will be the way to reconstruction.' Commander Essam Buwidani reaffirmed his support for the new leadership, while Fahim Issa expressed confidence in Sharaa’s ability to lead Syria into a better future. Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani outlined Syria’s foreign policy under the new administration at the event. He emphasized a strategic, multifaceted approach to reassuring international partners, gaining new allies and representing Syrians domestically and abroad. He added: 'We have successfully crafted a new Syrian identity that embodies freedom, justice and dignity, laying the groundwork for a nation where all citizens feel a sense of belonging and pride.' Al-Shibani highlighted Syria’s commitment to regional peace, underlining its intention to strengthen Arab ties and forge strategic partnerships. He also noted that diplomatic efforts led to temporary suspensions of U.S. and European sanctions, fostering a favorable environment for economic recovery. Syrian political figure Firas al-Khalidi, head of the Cairo Platform for the Syrian Opposition, described Sharaa’s appointment as a 'natural consequence of his sacrifices and leadership.' He emphasized the need for capable leaders to steer Syria out of the chaos left by the Assad regime. Al-Khalidi also welcomed the dissolution of military factions, viewing it as a critical step toward establishing a state that respects its people and neighboring countries. 'The new administration is open to all Syrians, regardless of sect or affiliation, to contribute to nation-building,' al-Khalidi said, hailing this moment as a 'historic milestone.' Sharaa’s speech comes more than 50 days after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime and HTS's temporary administration of the country under a caretaker government dominated by Sharaa loyalists. Previously, Sharaa had announced plans to disband HTS and hinted that national elections could take up to four years, while drafting a new constitution may require around three years.

An Israeli airstrike killed a Palestinian terrorist in Jenin on Tuesday after he was spotted throwing an explosive device at Israeli forces, the military said on Wednesday. According to the IDF, an Air Force aircraft identified the suspect during an operation in the area. Within minutes, the terrorist was struck and eliminated. Following the strike, secondary explosions were observed at the scene, indicating the presence of additional explosives, which the military said were likely intended to target Israeli troops.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkujp100dyg	2025-01-29T09:04:43-08:00	
Israel presses Hamas for answers on fate of Shiri Bibas and her c...	Jerusalem demands clear, official answers on fate of Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, abducted on October 7; her husband, Yarden Bibas, kidnapped separately, expected to be released in future exchange As Israel prepares for the third phase of the hostage release deal on Thursday, officials have issued a renewed demand to Hamas, through mediators, for clear information on the fate of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir. After 481 days since the war began, Israeli authorities say their goal is to close the painful uncertainty surrounding the family and finally provide definitive information to their relatives. Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were expected to be released in earlier phases of the deal, as the agreement prioritizes women and children over military personnel. However, they were not freed in previous exchanges, and Hamas has now indicated that it will release three male hostages on Saturday instead. Meanwhile, Shiri's husband, Yarden Bibas, who was kidnapped separately during Hamas' October 7 attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, is expected to be released in the first stage of the deal, given what Israeli officials described as his humanitarian condition. The uncertainty surrounding the Bibas family has turned them into one of the most harrowing symbols of the October 7 hostage crisis. The IDF has previously said that there is grave concern for the fate of Shiri and her children, but no official confirmation has been provided regarding their condition. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Jimmy Miller, Shiri's cousin, spoke this week in an interview with Ynet, expressing the family’s anguish over the lack of information. 'What will we tell Yarden if he is freed before his wife and children?' Miller asked. 'What will we say to him? We have no words. These are difficult times—our worst nightmare.' Miller said that even the military officers assigned to assist the family have no concrete answers about their fate. 'We get bits and pieces of information, but nothing that gives us clarity. There is no certainty about anything. We hold on to a sliver of hope that we will see Shiri, the children and Yarden together, but everything is speculation. There is no official confirmation—even from the army—on what actually happened to them,' he said. Miller described the ongoing uncertainty as unbearable, saying that the family is desperate for closure. 'The officers assisting us don't know exactly what’s happening either. I just hope for some kind of surprise, that we will finally be able to breathe again. We are running out of air. This is a catastrophe, and I don’t know how much longer we can take it. We need to know what happened to Shiri and the children—we have to know,' he said. Miller also expressed concern over the psychological impact on Yarden if he is released without his family. 'If Yarden is freed without them, how will he cope? The mere thought of it is devastating,' he said. 'On one hand, we celebrate every hostage that returns. Each one is a world of their own, for their families and for us—we have all become one big family. But Shiri and the kids were supposed to be back already. They should have been here by now.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkv4iyooje	2025-01-29T08:44:35-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/29/HyTTLaVST/HyTTLaVST_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

The last lookout, a grieving sister and an 80-year-old survivor: ...	In first, Palestinian Islamic Jihad will release 2 hostages, Gadi Mozes and Arbel Yehoud, while Agam Berger, the last remaining lookout in captivity, will also be freed The third phase of the hostage release deal is set to take place Thursday morning, with the release of Gadi Mozes, 80, Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Agam Berger, 20. Mozes and Yehoud were both held by the military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), marking the first time in the current deal that the terrorist group will release hostages in its custody. Gadi Mozes (80) Mozes was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, where his partner, Efrat Katz, was murdered. His ex-wife, Margalit Mozes, was also kidnapped but was freed in the first hostage release in November 2023. Nearly two months after the October 7 attack, Hamas released a proof-of-life video featuring Mozes alongside fellow hostage Elad Katzir. Reacting to the footage, his son Yair Mozes expressed deep concern: 'My father looks very thin. You can see he is exhausted. He is usually a very cheerful and lively person, but here, you can see the bags under his eyes—his physical condition is not good.' Born in Hadera, Mozes moved to Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza Strip about 60 years ago as part of a youth movement program. He worked in agriculture, eventually becoming a renowned agronomist who trained generations of farmers in the kibbutz and taught irrigation and crop cultivation courses worldwide, particularly in developing countries. His son Oded Mozes described him as an involved and supportive father and an active grandfather. 'He takes the grandchildren to the pool, on trips and teaches them about potatoes and carrots in the fields,' he said. Einav Mozes, Oded’s wife, shared the family's distress over the uncertainty surrounding his captivity. 'We know nothing about his condition in captivity, and that is one of the hardest things. Someone you love so much, and you have no idea what’s happening to him,' she told Ynet. 'You try to push away intrusive thoughts, but you can’t. Did he even get a piece of flatbread today? He suffers terribly from the cold—was he given a blanket? In the heat, does he have enough water? Is he sleeping on the floor? Are they abusing him? Just being there is already abuse, but how are they treating him? What does he know? What doesn’t he know? A million thoughts, and you’re not there with him. The thought of him being alone in this situation is unbearable.' Arbel Yehoud (29) Yehoud was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz along with her partner, Ariel Cunio, during the October 7 attack. Her brother, Dolev, left his home that morning to help treat the wounded. After eight months of uncertainty, his body was finally discovered in the kibbutz. A lifelong space enthusiast, Yehoud developed a passion for astronomy after watching Star Trek as a child. In recent years, she worked at a technology, science and space center in the Eshkol Regional Council. Her mother describes her as 'endlessly energetic, sensitive and full of life.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Her father, Yehiel Yehoud, spoke at the Knesset, directing an emotional message to his daughter: 'Do not break, my love, the soul of our family. We love you and are waiting for you. My child, did you sleep last night? Do your captors beat you? What do they demand of you in exchange for a piece of bread? Are you terrified by the sounds of war? I beg you, my daughter, to stay optimistic because you will return to us, just as you were taken from us.' Under the original terms of the hostage deal, the first groups to be released were female civilian captives. Yehoud was initially slated to be freed in the first or second phase, but due to what Hamas called 'technical issues,' her release was postponed. Instead, Hamas prioritized the release of four female military lookouts—Naama Levy, Liri Albag, Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev. In response, Israel refused to open the Netzarim Corridor for humanitarian movement. Following mediation efforts, an agreement was reached to secure Yehoud’s release on Thursday. As part of the deal, the Netzarim Corridor was reopened, allowing hundreds of thousands of Gazans to return to northern Gaza. Agam Berger (20) Berger, a resident of Holon, was abducted from the Nahal Oz outpost just two months after enlisting in the IDF, where she served as a military lookout. In footage from the October 7 attack, Berger is seen with blood-stained face, though it remains unclear whether she was injured or if the blood belonged to fellow soldiers who were murdered in the shelter beside her. She is the last Nahal Oz lookout still in captivity, following the November 2023 rescue of Ori Magidish and the recovery of Noa Marciano’s body, after she was executed by her captors. This past Saturday, four additional lookouts—Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev and Daniella Gilboa—were freed. Berger is the daughter of Shlomi and Merav and has a twin sister, Li-Yam, as well as two brothers, Bar and Ilay. A talented violinist, she volunteers with special-needs populations. Her family describes her as strong-willed, outspoken and a fierce advocate for justice. On November 26, on her father’s birthday, freed hostage Agam Goldstein-Almog called him and relayed a message: 'I was with your Agam in captivity, and she asked me to wish you a happy birthday.' Other released hostages said Berger remained steadfast in her beliefs while in captivity, reciting blessings over food and refusing to light fire on the Sabbath. After viewing the full video of his daughter’s abduction, Berger’s father, Shlomi, shared his devastation: 'I had already seen the end of the video on October 8, but watching it in full closed the circle. The sheer number of terrorists on an IDF base—their indifference—they casually ate, smoked, prayed. Nothing threatened them. They came in, kidnapped, murdered and then laughed. Where was the IDF? Where was the State of Israel?' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rygn9cv00ye	2025-01-29T08:18:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/S1G5D6vuke/S1G5D6vuke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Netanyahu meets with US envoy Witkoff in Jerusalem	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, at his office in Jerusalem on Wednesday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1yqtcvoje	2025-01-29T07:38:01-08:00	
Netanyahu heads to US on Sunday – when will he meet Trump?	PM to depart for Washington next week as first foreign leader to visit White House during Trump’s second term; Netanyahu scheduled to return to Israel on Thursday A day after receiving an official invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released on Wednesday his itinerary for his upcoming trip to Washington. Netanyahu, the first foreign leader to visit the White House during Trump’s second term, is set to depart for Washington early Sunday morning. Two days later, he will meet with the president in the Oval Office and is scheduled to return to Israel on Thursday. In a statement sent to reporters, officials emphasized that the schedule is still subject to change, noting, 'A final itinerary has not yet been confirmed. An updated schedule will be provided on Sunday before departure.' Netanyahu’s visit comes exactly two weeks after Trump’s second inauguration. According to the preliminary schedule, Netanyahu is not expected to testify next week in his ongoing trial in Israel and has sought court approval to postpone the hearings. On Tuesday, reports emerged that Trump is expected to host Netanyahu for a formal White House dinner. Sources close to the prime minister said his wife, Sara Netanyahu, will accompany him and return to Israel with him on the state aircraft Wing of Zion. In the official invitation, Trump wrote, 'I look forward to discussing ways to achieve peace for Israel and its neighbors, as well as our joint efforts to confront shared adversaries.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Meanwhile, Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Israel on Wednesday. As part of his visit, he toured the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza and held preparatory talks ahead of the second phase of a planned agreement set to take effect 42 days after its initial implementation. Israeli officials have voiced concerns over Qatar’s potential influence on Witkoff due to his extensive past business ties with the Gulf nation. In 2023, Qatar purchased the iconic Park Lane Hotel in New York for $623 million from a real estate group led by Witkoff, which had owned the property for a decade. The deal was seen as a financial lifeline for the developer, who was facing challenges in maintaining ownership of the hotel. Senior Israeli officials, speaking privately, have expressed fears that Witkoff’s close relationship with Qatari officials could allow them to sway his positions. At the same time, they acknowledge his deep personal connection to Israel and strong understanding of its security needs. There are also growing concerns in Jerusalem over Qatar’s potential influence on Trump and his inner circle. Qatar’s role is expected to be critical as negotiations resume for the second phase of the hostage deal, set to begin on day 16 of the ceasefire agreement next week. Israeli leaders are preparing for the talks, though several cabinet ministers remain skeptical about their success. Some are convinced that negotiations will ultimately collapse, leading Israel to resume military operations. They cite Hamas' likely refusal to accept Jerusalem’s key demands, which include the demilitarization of Gaza, the expulsion of the terror group’s leadership and Hamas’ exclusion from post-war governance in the enclave. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkiwwtvu1l	2025-01-29T07:25:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/SJb7A72vJe/SJb7A72vJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

US president to sign executive order to combat antisemitism, pledging to deport non-citizen students and resident aliens who participated in pro-Palestinian protests and directing Justice Department to prosecute anti-Jewish threats and violence U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Wednesday to combat antisemitism and pledge to deport non-citizen college students and other resident aliens who took part in pro-Palestinian protests, a White House official said. A fact sheet on the order said Trump would order the Justice Department to 'aggressively prosecute terroristic threats, arson, vandalism and violence against American Jews.' 'To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,' Trump said in the fact sheet. 'I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.' According to the New York Post, the order directs federal agencies to submit policy recommendations to the White House within 60 days and mandates the Justice Department to investigate cases of pro-Hamas graffiti on college campuses. During his election campaign, Trump vowed to deport 'Hamas supporters' from U.S. universities, a pledge he reiterated in a May 2023 rally. 'When I am president, we will not allow violent extremists to take over our campuses. If you come here from another country and try to bring jihadism, anti-Americanism or antisemitism to our universities—we will deport you immediately,' he said at the time. Trump has also pledged to prioritize combating discrimination on campuses, particularly cases of antisemitism, and to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs focused on gender identity and racial equity. Within his first days in office, he ordered the removal of DEI initiatives from all federal agencies. White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt announced Tuesday that Trump will soon sign an additional executive order on education, which will include cutting federal funding to institutions that promote curricula blaming the U.S. for systemic racism. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1hoxapojx	2025-01-29T07:19:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/09/rJ63Ithbkg/rJ63Ithbkg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Lebanese media reports Israeli airstrikes hit Farah City amusement park in Nabatieh, injuring 4; IDF says strikes targeted Hezbollah truck and vehicle transporting weapons; Hezbollah lawmaker condemns attack as 'ongoing Israeli threat' Lebanese media reported Tuesday that Israeli airstrikes targeted two locations in southern Lebanon, including an amusement park. The first strike hit Nabatieh al-Fawqa, where 20 people were reportedly injured in an attack on a pickup truck. The second strike, according to reports, hit the Farah City amusement park, located along a nearby road, injuring four people. The amusement park, which had reopened in December after a temporary closure due to the war, has been an active recreational site. Posts on its Facebook page in recent days included messages such as: 'The best outing for the best kids' and 'There’s nothing better than the laughter of children filling Farah City with life and joy.' Another post read: 'Turn the first day of the week into something special with games and surprises!' Videos shared online showed the aftermath of the strikes, including damage to the amusement park complex. While the park is a civilian site frequented daily by children, reports indicated that Hezbollah continued to operate in the area or use it as a base.

The IDF did not directly address reports of a strike on the amusement park.

Israel waits to learn identity of 3rd hostage that will be releas...	Israel expects to receive the list of hostages to be released on Thursday from Hamas today, ahead of the expected release of Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and another hostage who has not yet been named; Trump's envoy to the Middle East arrived in Gaza and will also meet with Netanyahu in Israel for discussions on the second phase of the deal and Saudi Arabia relations A day before the scheduled release of Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and another hostage - a man who is still alive, Israel is on high alert ahead of the transfer of the names from Hamas. According to the agreement, the terrorist organization is supposed to transfer on Wednesday the list of names of the hostages who will be released Thursday. In Israel; the families of the hostages are waiting with great anticipation to discover the name of the third hostage who will be released, assuming Hamas complies with the deal. Throughout the week it has been assumed that the hostage who will be released Thursday alongside Agam Berger and Arbel Yehoud is American-Israeli citizen Keith Siegel, partly due to a news report on NBC. However, there is no absolute certainty regarding the identity of the third hostage that Hamas will release as part of the 'special' phase added to the agreement, as part of resolving the crisis of Arbel Yehoud's non-release and Israel's insistence on not withdrawing from the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza until her release was arranged. Another release is expected on Saturday, in which three living men are expected to be freed. Meanwhile, ahead of the opening of negotiations on the second phase of the cease-fire deal - which is supposed to begin on the 16th day of the cease-fire according to the agreement, Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, arrived in Israel Wednesday and will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after visiting the Gaza Strip. Witkoff came to Israel from Saudi Arabia, where he was negotiating a comprehensive deal for the Middle East, which would include the implementation of the second phase of the cease-fire, the reconstruction of Gaza, and a path to normalization with Riyadh. On Wednesday morning, the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed claimed that Witkoff had pledged to Netanyahu in a meeting they held before the cease-fire was announced to stall the reconstruction of the northern Gaza Strip and to postpone the entry of caravans there, until an agreement is reached on 'plans that will provide security for the communities surrounding Gaza,' according to the report. The Qatari newspaper reported that the U.S. has formulated a plan that includes security projects that will ensure that Gaza will not pose a future threat to Israel. It was also reported that the U.S. commitments were intended to push Netanyahu to continue with the agreement, and to push Gazans to leave the strip for other countries by blocking and slowing the reconstruction of the northern Gaza Strip, and making the area uninhabitable for the long term. The report has no confirmation from another source. Meanwhile, crowds of Gazans continue to make their way to the northern Gaza Strip. Very long traffic jams were recorded on Salah ad-Din Street, the length of the Gaza Strip, from its center to the checkpoint set up for cars on the Netzarim Corridor. According to Palestinian reports, 50 vehicles are entering the checkpoint per hour. Trump's intention to remove the residents of the Gaza Strip in order to rebuild it continues to cause a stir in the Arab world. According to the Wall Street Journal, Egypt and Jordan - the countries where the American president intends to house those Palestinians - have joined Saudi Arabia in talks on an emergency meeting of the Arab League, at which the member states will present public opposition to the plan, and apply pressure on it to 'change direction,' according to Arab sources quoted in the report.

Trump's plan for the Palestinians: Viable or unrealistic?	Former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon: 'Trump is showing that he is really thinking outside the box' Is U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to relocate Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt viable? According to former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon, it may not be as far-fetched as it seems. Ayalon told ILTV News that while the idea has faced strong pushback from Jordan, the concern is that an influx of Palestinians could destabilize the kingdom. 'About 80% of Jordanians are Palestinians,' Ayalon explained. 'Certainly, King Abdullah wouldn’t want them to be there and take over, as they have tried before.' As for Egypt, Ayalon noted that while the Sinai Peninsula is vast and could temporarily accommodate Palestinians, Egypt would not agree to such a move without Palestinian approval. 'Trump is showing that he is really thinking outside the box,' Ayalon said. 'He is thinking like a constructor, a real estate guy—given this chaotic situation in Gaza and the rubble, you cannot really build with all this population, so it would be easier to move them out and back.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjmqwjduyx	2025-01-29T03:42:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/29/S12zNFDuyg/S12zNFDuyg_0_146_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
‘Hamas’ victory is that it still exists’	Col. (Res.) Miri Eisin says what Hamas wants to do is control how Israelis feel, to scare the citizens The victory for the Hamas terrorist organization is that it still exists, according to Col. (Res.) Miri Eisin, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. Eisin told ILTV News that for Hamas, victory is not measured by the number of fighters killed or weapons destroyed but by whether it maintains authority in the Gaza Strip. 'What they want to control is how we feel, and that scares us,' Eisin said. She explained that Hamas no longer has the heavy weapons it once did, meaning it cannot carry out a coordinated, multi-pronged attack like on October 7. However, she added, 'It’s clear, though, that Hamas will try to rearm.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjojjswukx	2025-01-29T03:30:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/19/HyzO3uyoD1g/HyzO3uyoD1g_0_0_2956_1665_0_small.jpg
UNRWA Lebanon says not impacted by US aid freeze or new Israeli l...	The director of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon said on Wednesday that the agency had not been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's halt to U.S. foreign aid funding or by an Israeli ban on its operations. UNRWA currently is not receiving any U.S. funding so there is no direct impact of the more recent decisions related to the U.N. system for UNRWA,' Dorothee Klaus told reporters at UNRWA's field office in Lebanon. U.S. funding to UNRWA was suspended last year until March 2025 under a deal reached by U.S. lawmakers and after Israel accused 12 of the agency's 13,000 employees in Gaza of participating in the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the Gaza war. The U.N. has said it had fired nine UNRWA staff who may have been involved and said it would investigate all accusations made. Klaus said that UNRWA Lebanon had also placed four staff members on administrative leave as it investigated allegations they had breached the U.N. principle of neutrality.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byqrh5wuke	2025-01-29T02:50:24-08:00

The pilot on board managed to bail out before hitting the ground, and is seen in the background plummeting to safety. According to the US Air Force, the crash at Eielson Air Force Base occurred during the landing process, after the pilot encountered some kind of 'inflight malfunction.' After falling to the ground, the pilot was taken to receive medical treatment, and his condition was described as stable. The crash caused 'significant damage' to the plane and that there will be a 'a thorough investigation in hopes to minimize the chances of such occurrences from happening again.'

Hezbollah hands over to Lebanese army huge tunnel complex reveale...	The Imad 4 underground complex included trucks, motorcycles, and the ability to launch missiles; Reports in the Arab world and in Lebanon, said when the Lebanese army received the facility from the terrorist organization it was emptied of heavy equipment; The Lebanese army entered a huge underground facility that Hezbollah revealed during the war, which contains large tunnels through which trucks can also travel, media outlets in Lebanon and around the Arab world began reporting Tuesday evening. The Imad 4 facility, as presented by Hezbollah in August before the exploding pager operation and the shake-up that the terrorist organization experienced with the elimination of its senior figures, was equipped with computers, lighting, and a size and depth that also allows motorcycles to pass through. The Al-Arabiya channel reported Tuesday night, citing sources, that the Lebanese army entered the facility located in southern Lebanon, but that it was emptied of heavy equipment before the army entered. The Lebanese Al-Jadeed channel also reported the entry of Lebanese army personnel and, according to reports, the facility was handed over to them more than a week ago. According to the same report, the facility is located between the villages of Joya and Itit in the area of ​​the city of Tyre. Footage published by Hezbollah at the time revealed a long, illuminated Hezbollah underground labyrinth, with retractable missile launch platforms underground. The Al-Mayadeen network affiliated with the terrorist organization reported at the time that 'the video shows the secrecy maintained around the location of Hezbollah's missile capabilities. The facility is located deep underground, far from hostile intelligence capabilities and also provides protection against hostile targets.' A year ago, an extensive article about Hezbollah tunnels was published in the French newspaper Libération - where it claimed that the terrorist organization had dug hundreds of kilometers of tunnels carved into rock over more than 30 years, some of them 40 meters to 80 meters deep. The investigation found that the tunnels are more sophisticated and dangerous than those in Gaza, and that blowing up some of them could cause an earthquake or landslides.

Netanyahu 'hero' among young Iranians: Author in hot water follow...	An Iranian political commentator and author finds himself in legal trouble following impromptu remarks he made in Qatar, in which he said younger Iranians are more distrustful of Palestinians and increasingly view the Israeli premier as a 'hero', prompting Tehran’s prosecutor to file a criminal complaint Tehran’s prosecutor has filed a criminal complaint against Sadegh Zibakalam, an Iranian political commentator and author, over recent statements that praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as 'baseless,' Iranian news agency Tasnim reported on Tuesday. Zibakalam, who has a history of similar convictions, is facing new legal trouble, reportedly due to comments he made at a conference in Qatar. There, he claimed that younger Iranians view Netanyahu as a 'hero.' 'You would be shocked by the number of Iranians who despise the Palestinians since October 7. What happened to the sympathy? It’s gone,' Zibakalam, a staunch supporter of the Iranian regime, said at the Qatar conference. 'If someone had told me, Sadegh, a day would come when Iranians would hate the Palestinians and praise Netanyahu – of all people – as a hero, I would have thought they were out of their minds. I would have thought they were speaking nonsense and didn’t understand Iranians at all. But I’ve seen it with my own eyes over the past 15 months. I’ve witnessed the levels of hatred among the young Iranian generation toward the Palestinians and their perception of Netanyahu as a hero.' During the conference, he also touched on the U.S. elections, saying, 'If someone had told me that Iranians would dream of a Donald Trump victory – a man who is against women, Arabs, immigrants, and Black people – I would have responded, 'You don’t know Iranians.' But I’ve seen with my own eyes what has unfolded over the past 15 months.' Zibakalam, has previously faced legal trouble for remarks deemed problematic. However, his controversial statements often align with the regime’s narrative. In recent years, he has been accused of spreading fake news and unsubstantiated content on social media, leading to several lawsuits against him. He was previously sentenced to 18 months in prison and banned from political activity in both physical and virtual spaces for two years due to 'propaganda activities against the regime.' In another case, he was sentenced to one year in prison, and in a third, where he was accused of publishing 'false information,' his sentence was reduced to six months following an appeal to Iran’s Supreme Court. Currently, he is reportedly out of prison due to health reasons. Beni Sabti, a researcher at the Iran Program of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), explains that Zibakalam is considered someone who helps preserve the Iranian regime, ensuring it does not weaken or become less conservative. According to Sabti, Zibakalam's remarks at the Qatar conference were misinterpreted. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: So why has he been charged now, despite being a regime supporter? 'Because he aired the regime's dirty laundry,' Sabti explains. 'There are things you simply don’t say publicly. Even if people in Iran criticize the weak economy, they’re thrown in jail for exposing these issues externally. You’re not allowed to present the Iranian regime as weak, flawed, or ineffective, nor can you suggest that its enemies are admired.' Sabti notes that Zibakalam’s portrayal of Netanyahu as 'admired' is particularly problematic because it undermines Iranian propaganda. 'At the same conference, he also said that Hamas has managed to stand up to Israel heroically and with strength,' Sabti adds. 'He didn’t only talk about Netanyahu.' Sabti further described Zibakalam as 'unreliable,' claiming that in the 1980s, Zibakalam was involved in hanging regime opponents and overseeing the execution of Kurds. According to Sabti, Zibakalam’s statements, in some ways, serve the Iranian regime. 'Every time there’s trouble for him, it’s dismissed,' Sabti says. 'He acts as a shield for the regime. He makes grand statements that sound appealing, so people think there are 'good Iranians' within the regime and that dialogue with them is possible. This lures the West. The Iranians play games with headlines and appearances.' Sabti believes this is why Zibakalam was allowed to speak in Qatar and remains out of prison. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkezcuw00yl	2025-01-29T00:10:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/01/SyY0GtKCR/SyY0GtKCR_0_0_434_255_0_small.jpg

World shocked as Trump insists on idea of forced Palestinian relo...	Trump’s proposal to move Palestinians from Gaza to Jordan, Egypt, or other nations has drawn global criticism; Fierce opposition from these countries highlights fears of destabilization, while analysts warn of the plan’s impracticality and potential long-term security risks No longer is the concept of forced emigration of Palestinians from Gaza confined to Israeli far-right circles. With President Trump's full-throated endorsement, issued with the backing of the presidential seal, it is now firmly implanted within the realm of mainstream political thought. Trump has proposed the relocation of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the devastated Gaza Strip during the long reonstruction– a suggestion that has sparked astonishment globally and fierce opposition from the nations he named as potential destinations: Jordan and Egypt. Other countries mentioned in reports, such as Albania and Indonesia, have also strongly denied any agreement to accept refugees under such a plan. Trump first unveiled his proposal late Saturday night, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. He described Gaza as a 'massive demolition site' and declared that to rebuild it, its residents should be relocated to Jordan or Egypt. He suggested this could even serve as a long-term solution, saying: 'We’re talking about moving 1.5 million people and simply clearing out the entire area.' Despite vehement opposition from Jordan and Egypt, Trump reiterated his stance the following night, claiming to have discussed the matter with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi after an earlier conversation with Jordan’s King Abdullah. However, an Egyptian official quickly denied such a conversation between Trump and Sisi had even taken place. 'I wish he’d take some of them,' Trump said about the Egyptian president. 'We help Egypt a lot, and I’m sure he can help us. He’s my friend.' Trump added, 'El-Sisi is in a very tough part of the world, to be honest. As they say – it’s a rough neighborhood. But I think he can do it.' While Israeli right-wing leaders have rushed to embrace the idea – Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich even promised to draft a practical plan for implementing Palestinian emigration – the fierce resistance from Palestinians themselves, alongside opposition from Jordan and Egypt, makes the proposal appear unfeasible. Furthermore, it remains unclear how committed Trump is to advancing the plan. Even his close ally, pro-Israel Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, expressed significant skepticism, saying in a CNN interview, 'I don’t know what he’s talking about,' and dismissing the idea as 'not very practical.' Publicly, Egypt and Jordan justify their opposition with pro-Palestinian statements, but both regimes, in Cairo and Amman, are primarily concerned about the threats such a move would pose to their own stability. Hassan al-Hassan, a researcher at the Bahrain Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN that both governments would face 'widespread domestic resistance' if their citizens perceived them as complicit in a 'second Palestinian Nakba.' He added that since Gaza’s residents would not agree to leave voluntarily, any forced relocation to Egypt or Jordan would create 'a variety of existential threats' for those countries. The fierce resistance from Palestinians themselves, alongside opposition from Jordan and Egypt, makes the proposal appear unfeasible Egypt, already grappling with severe economic challenges, fears that absorbing large numbers of Gazan refugees would further destabilize the country. With over 100 million people – many of whom live in poverty – Egypt’s economy has only worsened during the Gaza war. Houthi attacks in the Red Sea disrupted shipping through the Suez Canal on one end, and the strait of Bab al-Mandab on the other, exacerbating the situation. According to the UN, Egypt is already hosting 877,000 refugees, most of whom are not from Gaza. However, estimates suggest that around 100,000 Gazans entered Egypt during the war, despite the government’s official stance against 'the displacement of Palestinians.' Another concern for Egypt is the potential infiltration of terrorist elements into the Sinai Peninsula under the guise of accepting refugees. Sisi’s regime has long battled jihadist militants in Sinai, and the government views Gaza’s residents, particularly Hamas, as aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood – a group outlawed in Egypt. Security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted, 'Hamas, a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, is something the Egyptians prefer to keep on the other side of the high fence along the Philadelphi Corridor inside Gaza – not on their territory.' Sisi has repeatedly expressed his staunch opposition to the migration of Gazans into Egypt throughout the war. As early as October 2023, shortly after Hamas’ October 7 terror attack, Sisi declared that 'the solution to the Palestinian issue will not come at Egypt’s expense. The solution is not displacement, but justice and the Palestinians’ right to self-determination.' He even suggested that, if Israel insists on evacuating Palestinians from Gaza, it should move them to the Negev. Following Trump’s recent statements, senior Egyptian officials have reiterated their opposition. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel-Atti stated yesterday, 'Egypt rejects any displacement of Palestinians, whether temporary or long-term.' Jordan has similarly maintained its firm opposition to any relocation of Palestinians, with officials in Amman repeatedly emphasizing this stance in recent months. While Egypt fears the displacement of Gazans into its territory, Jordan is primarily concerned about the relocation of Palestinians from the West Bank. In November 2023, Jordanian Prime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh declared, 'Any attempt to displace Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank is a red line – and will be considered a declaration of war.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Following Trump’s remarks, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi reiterated this position two days ago, stating that 'Jordan is for Jordanians, Palestine is for Palestinians, and the solution to the Palestinian issue lies on Palestinian soil, where their independent state must be established. No to displacement. Not only because it is a historic and consistent national position for Jordan, but also because any attempt to uproot Palestinians from their land will destabilize security and stability and will not bring peace. The Palestinian issue cannot be solved at Jordan’s expense.' Jordan also fears that absorbing large numbers of Palestinians would destabilize the delicate balance of power between its Bedouin tribes and its 2.39 million registered Palestinian refugees. The arrival of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands more could upset this balance. Jordan, like Egypt, is already economically strained, having absorbed large numbers of Syrian refugees during the civil war. The addition of Gazan refugees would further burden its fragile economy. Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, noted that the cost of absorbing so many refugees would be so high for Egypt and Jordan that even U.S. aid would not suffice. Al-Hassan, the Bahraini researcher, warned, 'Neither Egypt nor Jordan can afford to take in millions of additional refugees.' He also cautioned that the influx of refugees could create future security risks, as their presence in Egypt and Jordan might lead to attacks against Israel. 'By seeking to empty Gaza of its Palestinian residents, Trump is serving the fanatics on Israel’s far right,' Al-Hassan accused. 'Ironically, his proposal, if implemented, would be self-defeating,' he argued, warning that destabilizing Jordan and Egypt could empower Islamist forces like the Muslim Brotherhood, which 'would be far less friendly to Israel and more sympathetic to Hamas.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqqcbp00kx	2025-01-28T23:11:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/rJnzHo8uJx/rJnzHo8uJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Claudia Tenney, who led efforts earlier this year to introduce the ‘Recognizing Judea and Samaria Act,’ confirmed last week that she plans to revive the legislation, which is backed by Trump A bill aiming to redefine the language used to describe the disputed territories between Israel and Jordan will be reintroduced in the U.S. Congress this month. Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY), who led efforts earlier this year to introduce the 'Recognizing Judea and Samaria Act,' confirmed last week that she plans to revive the legislation. The proposed bill seeks to officially refer to the area commonly known as the West Bank as 'Judea and Samaria.' Tenney also revealed that U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged his support, bolstering the bill’s chances of advancement. 'We need to make sure that we don’t allow the language, the tradition, the history of Israel, to be weaponized by terms like ‘West Bank,’' Tenney told a room of hundreds last week at the re-launch party of the Congressional Israel Allies Caucus. The proposed legislation mandates that all official documents referring to the region currently known as the West Bank instead use the term 'Judea and Samaria.' Senator Tom Cotton will also reintroduce a parallel bill in the Senate. 'President Trump has said this is going to be a very priority task for him to get this done,' Tenney said. 'It’s the beginning of us shifting the language, and what we’re doing and making sure that we always protect the historical homeland of the Jews, and that is in Israel, and Israel includes Judea and Samaria.' Jordan, which controlled the area from 1949 to 1967, introduced the term 'West Bank' as a geographical designation; the area was named for its location west of the Jordan River. However, the region – historically known as Judea and Samaria – has been central to the identity and heritage of the Jewish people for thousands of years. After Israel regained control of the territory in 1967, it was officially known as the Judea and Samaria region, which aligns with the names of the biblical kingdoms of Judea and Samaria. Despite this historical connection, many governments worldwide continue to use the term West Bank. 'Calling it Judea and Samaria ignores the basic reality of 3.5 million people who are not Jews and living in the West Bank,' said Middle East analyst Gershon Baskin, who is in opposition to the proposed bill. 'That reality does not change with linguistics.' Elias Baboun, peace initiator of the Palestine Land Peace Plan and a resident of Bethlehem, said changing the name to Judea and Samaria is not the main issue. 'What truly matters is achieving justice and equality for all the people in the region,' he told The Media Line. 'The name may have historical and symbolic significance, but it remains a secondary matter compared to the larger issue of equal rights.' Supporters of Israel argue that the 'West Bank' terminology seeks to delegitimize Israel’s presence in the region. 'The Israeli people have an undeniable and indisputable historical and legal claim over Judea and Samaria, and at this critical moment in history, the United States must reaffirm this,' Tenney said in a statement in May, shortly after she initially introduced the legislation. 'This bill reaffirms Israel’s rightful claim to its territory. I remain committed to defending the integrity of the Jewish state and fully supporting Israel’s sovereignty over Judea and Samaria.' Cotton echoed this sentiment in December when he first introduced the bill. 'The Jewish people’s legal and historic rights to Judea and Samaria go back thousands of years,' Cotton said. 'The U.S. should stop using the politically charged term ‘West Bank’ to refer to the biblical heartland of Israel.' According to Israel Ganz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, 'People still use terms like West Bank, like it’s nowhere, and it’s not part of the State of Israel.' He said that using a term like 'West Bank' causes people to 'forget this is the biblical land. We want it to be called ‘Judea and Samaria.’ We also want to apply Israeli sovereignty over this ancient, historical Jewish place.' Noor Dahri, executive director of the UK-based Islamic Theology of Counter Terrorism think tank, seconded Ganz’s sentiments. He said that if the legislation moves forward, 'it would be another milestone after moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. The original name of the area is Judea and Samaria, which was later turned into the West Bank, which I believe was a direct attack on Jewish history.' He called the term West Bank 'a successful act to erase the Jewish geographical evidence' and a 'form of antisemitism.' Even Baboun admitts that 'Jews face significant challenges in freely practicing their religious rituals at holy sites in areas under Palestinian control.' He emphasized that access to Jewish religious sites like the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron is highly restricted for Jews. 'These restrictions contrast with the rights that Palestinians enjoy at the same sites,' Baboun added. Earlier this month, Tenney spearheaded the launch of the Congressional Friends of Judea and Samaria Caucus. Alongside advocating for the name change, the caucus supports Israeli annexation of the territories Israel gained during the Six-Day War in 1967. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: To date, Israel has refrained from annexing the area for various reasons, and it largely remains under military administration. Currently, Jews predominantly reside in what is designated as Area C, while Palestinians live under Palestinian Authority rule in Areas A and B, as well as under Israeli military rule in Area C. While proponents of annexation argue that the region is integral to Israel’s historical and biblical heritage, the international community largely views Israel’s policies in the West Bank as a violation of international law. The International Court of Justice in July 2024 issued an advisory opinion declaring that Israel’s continued presence in the Palestinian territories is illegal under international law. The nonbinding ruling cited violations of the prohibition on acquiring territory by force and the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people. The court’s findings expand on its 2004 advisory opinion, which deemed the construction of Israel’s separation barrier in the territories a form of de facto annexation. The countries that back this assessment maintain that most of the West Bank should form part of a future Palestinian state. However, the Trump administration previously recognized the territory as disputed and stated that for Israelis to live there was not illegal under international law. The Yesha Council, a leadership body in the West Bank, is counting on President Trump’s support for Israel’s annexation of the area. 'After years of the [Biden] administration being against the Jews living in Judea and Samaria, the biblical heartland, to come back here to the inauguration of President Trump with a team of people that believe in the biblical heartland is truly a blessing,' said Yesha Council spokeswoman Eliana Passentin. The night before Trump’s inauguration, the Yesha Council organized a rally in Times Square. Electric billboards displayed messages praising the former and future president, and Israelis marched through the streets waving Israeli flags in celebration. 'We are excited,' Passentin said. 'We are grateful for everything President Trump has done in the past for Israel, everything he’s doing in the present, and everything that he will do in the future.' The push to adopt the term 'Judea and Samaria' is not without precedent. In February 2024, Troy Miller, president and CEO of the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB), endorsed a resolution calling for the rejection of the term 'West Bank' and the adoption of 'Judea and Samaria' instead. The resolution, prepared collaboratively by Israel365, The Israel Guys, and the Israel Allies Foundation, was endorsed during the annual NRB convention. It argued that Judea and Samaria represent the biblical heartland of Israel, including historically significant sites like Hebron, Bethel, Shiloh, and Shechem, and fulfill scriptural prophecies of Jewish exile and return. The resolution emphasized the West Bank's strategic importance, noting that the Samaritan mountains provide critical oversight of Israel’s coastal cities, including Tel Aviv and Ben-Gurion International Airport. It also highlighted the positive impact of the Jewish presence in the area, pointing to economic opportunities for Palestinians created by Israeli investment and jobs. The NRB, with over 1,100 member organizations, reaches millions of viewers, listeners, and readers. As such, this shift in language can potentially influence the narrative both in the short and long term.

Union representing 30,000 CUNY faculty and staff votes to divest ...	The move is a stand against Israel’s 'apartheid regime' and its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, supporters say at university, which has been a focal point for student-led activism on this issue, with protests and solidarity campaigns The Professional Staff Congress (PSC), the union representing over 30,000 faculty and staff at the City University of New York (CUNY), passed a resolution to divest its union funds from Israeli companies and government bonds. The resolution approved late last week narrowly passed with 73 votes in favor and 70 against, reflecting the contentious nature of the decision. The union also recommended that the Teachers Retirement System (TRS), which manages over $100 million in pension investments tied to Israeli entities, adopt a similar policy. Proponents of the resolution described the move as a stand against what they termed Israel’s 'apartheid regime' and its actions in Gaza and the West Bank. The resolution's supporters emphasized solidarity with Palestinian workers and students and cited international calls for labor unions to oppose institutional complicity in Israeli policies. 'This decision marks an important step toward aligning our investments with our values,' stated one delegate. They argued that divestment underscores the union’s commitment to social justice and international solidarity. Since October 7, CUNY has been a focal point for student-led activism on this issue, with protests and solidarity campaigns calling for institutional accountability and support for Palestinian rights. Jewish groups have expressed concerns about rising antisemitism on college campuses and have accused CUNY of failing to adequately address these issues. Critics argue that framing Israel’s actions in terms of 'apartheid' and 'genocide' is inflammatory and ignores the complexities of the conflict. They contend that such rhetoric can contribute to a hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty. The resolution has also faced significant criticism within the union itself. Opponents expressed concerns that such a divisive stance could undermine unity among members and open the union to legal challenges. Historically, the PSC leadership has been cautious about taking explicit positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, fearing potential backlash. This hesitation was reflected in the narrow margin of the vote, with several delegates warning that the move might alienate members or distract from the union's core mission of advocating for labor rights and educational resources. 'This decision risks fracturing our union at a time when solidarity is more important than ever,' one delegate who opposed the resolution said. 'Our focus should remain on the issues directly impacting our members, not on divisive international politics.' They have also pointed to past instances where political resolutions led to membership disputes and legal battles, including a lawsuit following the union's 2021 resolution to discuss boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) initiatives. That case, which argued that members should not be compelled to support positions contrary to their beliefs, nearly reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The resolution has also drawn legal scrutiny. On Tuesday, a complaint was filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights, alleging that the PSC-CUNY’s divestment policy constitutes a discriminatory boycott in violation of New York Executive Law. The complaint, submitted on behalf of Zionist Jewish and Israeli faculty members, argues that the union’s adoption of BDS policies discriminates against faculty based on their creed and national origin. According to the complaint, the union’s decision effectively excludes Zionist Jewish and Israeli faculty members from certain research grants and collaboration opportunities. It further asserts that the boycott prevents faculty members from engaging in academic work with Israeli institutions and scholars, thereby institutionalizing discrimination within the university system. 'The PSC-CUNY has made abundantly clear that it does not view Zionist Jews or Israelis to be protected classes and has abandoned their sacrosanct Duty of Fair Representation to these groups,' the complaint states. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjqc00rvo1e	2025-01-28T21:55:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2022/05/22/r17Kt8wv9/r17Kt8wv9_27_0_2134_1201_0_small.jpg
Chinese tech company Alibaba releases AI model it claims surpasse...	Chinese tech company Alibaba on Wednesday released a new version of its Qwen 2.5 artificial intelligence model that it claimed surpassed the highly-acclaimed DeepSeek-V3. The unusual timing of the Qwen 2.5-Max's release, on the first day of the Lunar New Year when most Chinese people are off work and with their families, points to the pressure Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's meteoric rise in the past three weeks has placed on not just overseas rivals, but also its domestic competition. The Jan. 10 release of DeepSeek's AI assistant, powered by the DeepSeek-V3 model, as well as the Jan. 20 release of its R1 model, has shocked Silicon Valley and caused tech shares to plunge, with the Chinese startup's purportedly low development and usage costs prompting investors to question huge spending plans by leading AI firms in the United States.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkxsaswujl	2025-01-28T21:41:09-08:00

Qatari channel Al-Araby reported that U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, pledged in a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to disrupt the reconstruction of the northern Gaza Strip until an agreement is reached on plans for the security of the Israeli border communities. According to the report, the meeting prior to the announcement of the agreement detailed an American plan that includes security projects that will be funded by the U.S. and the Gulf States, concerning the area between the Gaza border communities and the Gaza Strip, to ensure that the area does not pose a future threat to Israel. It was also reported that the American commitments were intended to pressure Netanyahu to continue with the agreement, and to push the Palestinians to emigrate from the Gaza Strip.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyxwnhpoyl	2025-01-28T21:38:53-08:00

The IDF won't withdraw until the Lebanese army shows it is in con...	In the next three weeks of the extended cease-fire, the IDF plans to destroy many hotbeds of terrorism in southern Lebanon; at the same time, military outposts are being set up between Israeli towns and the border fence; 'Responsibility for security of our residents lies with the IDF, and certainly not with the Lebanese army or any other foreign force' Since the United States announced earlier this week that agreements had been reached to extend the cease-fire with Lebanon, the riots initiated by Hezbollah along the border - in which it sent hundreds of activists with the organization's flags to try to enter villages near the fence and confront IDF soldiers - have calmed down. On Tuesday, for example, there was a tense silence on the northern border. IDF forces continued to repel attempts by Lebanese civilians to approach the villages where they were prohibited from staying and fired deterrent shots at them. The Israel Air Force, despite the cease-fire, attacked Hezbollah weapons , due to what was defined as a 'violation of the agreement.' A senior military official who is still operating with his forces in the depths of southern Lebanon told Ynet and Yediot Aharonoth that 'until the Lebanese army fulfills its missions and demonstrates good and sufficient control over the territory, we will not recommend transferring control to them.' The IDF plans to fill the additional three weeks, during which, according to the agreement, its forces will remain in southern Lebanon and conduct a long series of operations to destroy terrorist areas and collect weapons that Hezbollah has hidden and that still remain, mainly in the eastern sector, which borders the Upper Galilee. 'In the villages that are not adjacent to the fence in the western and central part of southern Lebanon, we have returned control to the Lebanese army. But in the villages that are adjacent to us and along the border fence, along its entire length, we are still there,' the senior military official explained. He emphasized that no one in the IDF trusts the Lebanese forces to ensure the security of the residents who have already begun to return north. 'The responsibility for the security of our residents lies with the IDF, and certainly not with the Lebanese army or any other foreign force,' he said. This clear statement is supported by the IDF's new defense concept on the northern border. 'We organized the space differently,' the senior official explained. 'The concept today is that the IDF is at the front, even before the communities. Every town that exists, between the border fence and that town, will have an outpost.' So far, the establishment of several military outposts has been completed, in what will be - as the residents who are supposed to return to the north are demanding - an Israeli security zone. 'If we want the residents to return, there needs to be a strong and massive security zone,' according to Rafi Biton, a native and resident of Avivim. 'One that will give security to the residents here, and not like it was in the last decade when they simply abandoned us. They left us to rely on technological wonders like radars and cameras, and on the first day of the war, Hezbollah knocked everything down and left us naked.' Biton's family has been evacuated to a hotel in Tiberias since the outbreak of the war, and recently he has been trying to convince his wife, Rachel, and their children to return home, but without success. 'After October 7, I no longer want to be in this place of fear,' Rachel explained. 'We lost our innocence.' According to the government's decision, which is based on the IDF's recommendation, tens of thousands of displaced people in the north can return to their homes on March 1. However, in accordance with the cease-fire agreement, the hundreds of thousands of displaced Lebanese whose homes served as infrastructure for terrorism and were part of the network of launch and attack posts for the Radwan forces will also be allowed to return and will ostensibly be able to rebuild their homes and even renew the terrorist infrastructure. The IDF is well aware of the residents' concerns. 'We will continue to act and remove any infrastructure that threatens, or could threaten in the future,' said the senior military official. 'We are certain that Hezbollah terrorists will not become peace activists, but will try to continue to establish themselves. We are using many tools and capabilities to understand what Hezbollah is trying to do. We are building the system in such a way that, whenever Hezbollah tries to establish something, our ability to handle it will be immediate, and not just the ability to watch it. We will make sure that they will not be used as terrorist infrastructure again. The responsibility on the IDF's shoulders is to make sure that Hezbollah does not establish its infrastructure again.'

'The army fought here and did an amazing job. The soldiers deserve all the praise, and right now we need to trust the international system and Israel,' he said. 'If I don't trust the people who ran the war here, then who will I trust? We were very complacent and we must never return to that complacent state, but I think that as citizens we need to believe that we have sobered up, that the IDF has sobered up, and that there is now much greater readiness.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ihjhpo1l	2025-01-28T21:09:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/HkxC2kI800Jx/HkxC2kI800Jx_1_84_1601_901_0_small.jpg

US Senate blocks bill to impose sanctions on International Crimin...	Despite setbacks in efforts to challenge the ICC, Israeli officials are hopeful that ongoing discussions in Washington could lead to a modified version of the proposal in the future Legislation that would have imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court in protest of its arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister was voted down in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. Senate Democrats blocked the bill that was intended to severely punish the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC) for the arrest warrants it issued against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The bill promoted by Republicans, to impose 'crippling' sanctions against the court and against anyone involved in its investigations into Israel, received a majority of votes – 54 to 45 – but not the 60-member majority needed in the in the 100-member Senate to prevent a filibuster and allow the legislation to advance. The vote was largely along party lines, with almost every Democrat and independent voting against it. Senator John Fetterman was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans to advance the measure. Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff did not vote. Republicans have a 53-member majority in the Senate. In an interview with The Washington Post before the vote, Fetterman said he wanted the 'strongest version' of sanctions on The Hague: 'I'm going to vote for it, I don't understand how anyone could not vote for sanctions against the ICC, after how they've treated Israel.' The 'Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act' would have imposed sanctions on any foreigner who investigates, arrests, detains, or prosecutes U.S. citizens or those of an allied country, including Israel, who are not members of the court. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: It passed the House earlier this month 243-140, as 45 Democrats joined Republicans in voting 'yes.' In the Senate, Democrats said they agreed with much of the bill, but said it was too broad and risked alienating important U.S. allies and imposing sanctions on lower level workers at the court in the Netherlands. Urging colleagues to vote 'no,' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, accused the ICC of having 'an anti-Israel bias that cannot be ignored.' However, he said the bill was poorly crafted and also could target U.S. companies, such as those whose products help protect the court from foreign hackers. Although it seems like a setback for Israel's efforts to act against the ICC, officials in Jerusalem say that discussions in Washington regarding the proposal's wording are ongoing. There is a possibility that the proposal may resurface later, potentially in a more softened form. Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who signed the bill, accused Democrats after the vote of poor negotiating practices on the text. 'Democrats had 10 months to negotiate this bill, but instead they waited until the last minute to demand unworkable changes,' he said, claiming that Democrats want to grant significant relief to tech companies. 'Democrats voted against protecting American forces against a court-martial,' Cotton accused - referring to the Republicans' claim that the arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials constitute a dangerous precedent that could also threaten future soldiers and senior officials in the United States, which, like Israel, is not a member of the court and does not recognize its authority. 'Make no mistake: Democrats today weakened our national security and Israel's ability to defend itself.' The drafters of the law state in the proposal that Prosecutor Karim Khan 's accusations against Israel, alleging war crimes and attempts to starve civilians in Gaza, are 'baseless and illegitimate.' The proposal also states that the arrest warrants issued by the ICC judges constitute a 'dangerous precedent' that threatens the US, Israel, and other allies that do not recognize the authority of the court, which was established in 2002 under the Rome Statute. Israel never signed the treaty, but in 2021 the court's judges ruled that it had jurisdiction over what was happening in the Palestinian territories because the Palestinian Authority had joined the treaty. An investigation into suspected war crimes against Israel had already been opened at that time, and it was expanded following the events of the war. The prosecutor who requested the arrest warrants, Khan, is currently embroiled in an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment . In recent days, Western diplomats and human rights organizations have warned of the implications of the bill, arguing that sanctions on the ICC would harm efforts to prevent war crimes around the world – and also the court’s investigations into Russia following the war in Ukraine. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a letter sent by 20 European diplomats to senior Senate officials, they warned that the proposed sanctions 'threaten to erode the rule of international law, which is critical in promoting order and security in the world.' According to them, 'such steps would undermine the very principle of international justice and accountability – a principle of which the United States has been a strong advocate.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylymr8u1e	2025-01-28T13:55:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/ry8XXaUO1l/ry8XXaUO1l_186_2_893_503_0_small.jpg
Poll: 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the US	An opinion poll indicated on Tuesday that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish their Arctic island - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - to become a part of the United States, Danish daily Berlingske reported. U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that Greenland was vital to U.S. security and Denmark should give up control of the strategically important island. The survey by pollster Verian, commissioned by the Danish paper, showed only 6% of Greenlanders are in favor of becoming part of the U.S., with 9% undecided, Berlingske said. Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede, who has stepped up a push for independence, has repeatedly said the island is not for sale and that it is up to its people to decide their future. The U.S. military has a permanent presence at the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, a strategic location for its ballistic missile early-warning system, as the shortest route from Europe to North America runs via the island.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjff10io1g	2025-01-28T12:44:42-08:00

Naama wrote that she is waiting for the release of lookout Agam Berger, who is expected to be freed from captivity on Thursday, along with civilian Arbel Yehoud and another hostage whose identity is still unknown. 'We are waiting for Agami and the other hostages so we can complete the rehabilitation process. I want to thank the IDF soldiers and the entire people of Israel. Even in captivity, I saw how you were fighting for me! Thank you all, I love you.' Although Naama spent the first 50 days after her abduction alone, she was not held in a tunnel. Later, she was reunited with her fellow lookouts and other civilian captives. The lookouts were not always kept together, as their captors occasionally separated them and moved them between locations. Meanwhile, Liri Albag’s sister, Shai Albag, shared a video from the day of her release and wrote: 'My little sister—you’re number one. For 477 days, you didn’t give up; you believed the happy ending would come. I’m proud of you and love you more than words can ever express. And as I told you today – my life’s mission was to bring you home, and now my mission is to make all your dreams come true 💙.' Radio host Omer Gefen shared a greeting on behalf of Romi Gonen, who was released in the first phase of the deal along with Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher. 'I want to send you greetings, everyone, from Romi Gonen, who is listening to us right now with her family. She asked me to dedicate a song on her behalf and share a few words,' Gefen said.

I’m with you ‘until after eternity.’ A meaningful song for her, and for us, we’ll listen to Peer Tasi’s ‘Until After Eternity.’ We love you, Romi, we’re thinking of you and everyone else. Thank you for these words.' The four lookouts who were released from Hamas captivity are still staying at Rabin Medical Center, surrounded by family and close friends. As time passes, more details are emerging about the harsh reality they endured in captivity – and the bravery of these young women. Alongside the treatments the women are receiving at the hospital, they are constantly trying to find out whether their friend Agam Berger will be released in the next phase of the deal on Thursday and reunited with them. Only once Agam’s situation is clarified will it be decided which hospital she will be transferred to. Liri Albag will turn 20 next week, and her friends are preparing to celebrate with her, depending on her medical condition. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkyzk3i00jl	2025-01-28T12:10:21-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/Bk1xOFLd1e/Bk1xOFLd1e_1_52_695_392_0_small.jpg

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday he had ordered a report detailing how to tackle the effect on Ukrainian programs hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of foreign aid. Zelensky said Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba and other officials would determine the effect on Ukrainian programs of Trump's order, which aims to review whether aid allocations are in line with his foreign policy. 'These are humanitarian programmes ... most of them did not operate through the Ukrainian government but directly through our communities,' Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday called U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion to relocate Palestinians from war-ravaged Gaza to Jordan and Egypt 'unacceptable.' 'Any resettlement plans, the idea that the citizens of Gaza will be expelled from there to Egypt or Jordan, is unacceptable,' Scholz said, referring at a campaign event in Berlin to Trump's comments. He reiterated his support for a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians live peacefully side by side, adding that it must be clear that the Palestinian Authority would assume responsibility for Gaza. Germany is among Israel's main arms suppliers, with its defense exports to the country rising nearly tenfold annually in 2023, the year when the Gaza war started.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1t7chuujg	2025-01-28T11:13:21-08:00	
Trump, Netanyahu to meet at White House next week	The Israeli premier will be the first foreign leader Trump meets with since he took office; The U.S. president is also expected to invite Netanyahu to dinner at the White House; His envoy, Steve Witkoff, is set to touch down in Israel to speak with Netanyahu, and will also visit Netzarim Corridor in Gaza before the start of negotiations on next phase of cease-fire; However, concern swirls around possible influence of Qatari authorities on Witkoff, over past business ties with Doha President Donald Trump has invited Benjamin Netanyahu to a meeting at the White House on February 4, according to an official statement from the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday night. The statement noted that Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to be invited to the White House since the start ofTrump’s second term. The U.S. president is also expected to invite Netanyahu to dinner at the White House. Sources close to the prime minister said that Sara Netanyahu will return to Israel on the official government Wing of Zion airplane after the prime minister's visit to the United States. In the official invitation, Trump wrote: 'I look forward to discussing with you how to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to confront our common enemies.' However, just this week, the prime minister requested to reduce the number of days he is required to testify in his corruption trial, citing his recovery from prostate surgery. The official statement reported that Netanyahu was invited but did not explicitly confirm his attendance. Given that Netanyahu is scheduled to continue his testimony during those days, he is expected to request approval from the judges to cancel the hearings. Meanwhile, Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to arrive in Israel on Wednesday to visit the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza and hold preparatory talks ahead of negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire and hostage release agreement, which is set to take effect 42 days after its initiation. In Israel, there is concern about the influence of Qatari authorities on Witkoff, due to his past extensive business ties with the Doha government. In the summer of 2023, Qatar spent $623 million to purchase the famous Park Lane Hotel in New York from a real estate group led by Witkoff, which had owned the property for about a decade. Essentially, the Qataris 'rescued' Trump’s associate from financial difficulties surrounding the continued ownership of the hotel. Senior Israeli officials, in private conversations, have expressed concerns about the close relationship between the Qataris and Witkoff, fearing the Qataris may have undue influence over him. While Israel holds Witkoff in high regard, with those familiar with him describing him as deeply connected to Israel and its security needs, there is also concern about Qatar’s influence on President Trump and his team. Qatar’s influence is critical as the second phase of the hostage deal approaches, with negotiations set to begin on the 16th day of the agreement next week. Israel is preparing for the talks, though several government ministers are convinced that the negotiations will fail and that Israel will inevitably return to fighting. They doubt Hamas will agree to the conditions set by Jerusalem, which include disarming the Gaza Strip, exiling Hamas leaders, and ensuring the group’s non-involvement in Gaza’s 'day after' governance. At the same time, some ministers were 'shocked' by the 'ceremony' Hamas held for the release of four female observers who were freed from captivity. The event demonstrated that the terrorist organization has not lost its ability to govern, as it showcased active armed battalions, white pickup trucks, machine guns and motorcycles with sirens. These images are in stark contrast with Israeli claims that it has succeeded in dismantling Hamas’ military capabilities. Nevertheless, senior Israeli officials believe that Witkoff and Trump will not rush to allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resume fighting in Gaza. Instead, they are expected to present a series of incentives that will make it difficult for Netanyahu to take that path. These include potential sanctions on Iran, normalization with Saudi Arabia, the initiation of discussions on a security memorandum of understanding, and harsh sanctions on the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Netanyahu will find it challenging to say 'no' to Trump and risk losing these opportunities. All these issues are expected to be discussed during the planned meeting between Trump and Netanyahu at the White House next week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Some have noticed that in Netanyahu’s recent statements he has hinted that Israel may not necessarily return to the type of fighting seen previously if negotiations for the second phase of the agreement fail. 'If we need to return to fighting, we will do so in new ways and with great intensity,' the Prime Minister said this week. Some believe Netanyahu is signaling that there will not be a massive ground operation like before, but rather more surgical combat methods and targeted eliminations. Witkoff is set to arrive in the region on Wednesday on his private plane. He will visit Israel and Gaza after attending the main ceremony marking 80 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp in Poland, where he met with families of hostages. After visiting the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza, Witkoff is expected to meet with Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. Meanwhile, Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Than spoke by phone Tuesday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. According to a statement from Qatar’s Foreign Ministry, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continuing joint mediation efforts in the Gaza Strip and emphasized the importance of adhering to the cease-fire. The statement added, 'The parties expressed their hope that the agreement will move to the second phase, leading to a permanent cease-fire.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1rirjio1x	2025-01-28T11:09:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/SJb7A72vJe/SJb7A72vJe_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Israel announces UNRWA ban to take effect in 48 hours	Israel's UN Ambassador announced officially that Palestinian aid agency UNRWA must leave Jerusalem by Thursday; 'The decision was not made lightly, nor was it made quickly. It was not a political decision, it was simply a necessary one' he says Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, announced officially on Tuesday that Jerusalem will sever all ties with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and anyone operating on its behalf. The decision will take effect on Thursday, January 30, as stipulated by the law passed by Israel's government. 'I hereby inform the United Nations and the Security Council that the legislation concerning UNWRA's activities in Israel will officially come into force in 48 hours,' Danon stated. 'In accordance with applicable Israeli law and following the termination of the provisional agreement, UNRWA must cease its operations and evacuate all premises it operates in Jerusalem. The legislation forbids UNWRA from operating within the sovereign territory of the state of Israel and forbids any contact between Israeli officials and UNWRA,' Danon said. 'Furthermore, UNRWA will be prohibited from maintaining any representative office, service or activity within our territory, and will terminate all collaboration, communication and contact with UNRWA or anyone acting on its behalf. This decision was not made lightly, nor was it made quickly. It was not a political decision. It was simply a necessary one,' he also said. Danon added that the severing of ties 'follows decades of betrayal by an agency that has placed political agendas, neglect and cover-ups over humanitarian principles. This decision reflects years of efforts to address the grave accusations raised against it. This decision also reflects the reality of the situation that UNWRA has miserably failed in its mandate, and it has failed the people who were supposed to benefit from its services. More precisely, this decision was driven by UNWA's constant refusal to address the widespread infiltration of its ranks by Hamas and other terrorist organizations.' 'No sovereign state should facilitate the operation of an agency that threatens its national security and blatantly violates its laws. Israel remains committed to its obligations under international law, and we reaffirm our readiness to cooperate with other UN agencies that are not tainted by terror,' he concluded.

Contractor working in Gaza accidentally killed by IDF fire	Kobi Avitan, a 39-year-old father of 3 from Eilat operated a tractor and performed engineering work of the IDF; He was shot dead in the Netzarim Corridor after being mistaken for a terrorist Kobi Avitan, an employee of a contracting company that performs engineering work for the IDF on behalf of the Ministry of Defense, was killed Tuesday morning in the Netzarim Corridor after being mistaken for a terrorist. He was operating a tractor as part of work on the cross-Gaza highway - the western part of which the IDF was required to withdraw from Tuesday as part of the hostages release deal, thereby enabling the mass return of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip. Avitan was killed by DF forces. Under the direction of the Military Prosecutor's Office, an investigation by the military police has been opened. Avitan, a 39-year-old father of three children, lived in Eilat. ZAKA Search and Rescue paid tribute to him, noting that he volunteered at the organization's branch in the city. 'Kobi was a man of kindness who dedicated his life to the common good and gave his soul for the people of Israel.

The ZAKA family shares in the deep mourning of his wife Tali and the dear Avitan family, praying that in his great and good deeds you will find solace and know no more sorrow.' Tuesday's serious incident is the first time Israelis have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the start of the cease-fire as part of the hostage deal - and the first fatal incident there since the explosion of the building in Beit Hanoun on January 13, in which five Nahal patrol fighters were killed.

Jordan launches air corridor for life-saving medicines into Gaza	Jordan's air force launched on Tuesday the biggest air bridge so far to bring urgent medical supplies to Gaza under a U.S.-sponsored deal to step up deliveries following a cease-fire, officials said. The operation involves 16 helicopter flights a day that will at first deliver at least 160 tonnes of life-saving medical supplies over a week to hospitals and medical centers, army officials said. Under an agreement sponsored by the U.S., Israel had allowed Jordan to deliver aid to a designated location near Israel's Kissufim border crossing with the devastated Gaza Strip. A helicopter pad in a spot that lies in a central area connecting the northern and southern parts of the enclave would help facilitate speedier deliveries, according to aid officials.

Palestinians return to Gaza City: Kiss the ground, clean up rubbl...	Some 300,000 refugees returned to northern Gaza, reuniting with family members they had been separated from for 15 months; Families gathered to celebrate their reunions, marking the moment with both joy and determination; 'We will not leave again,' one returning refugee says, 'not even Trump will make us emigrate' Displaced Palestinians returning to their homes in Gaza City this week found a city in ruins after 15 months of fighting, with many seeking shelter among the rubble and searching for relatives lost in the chaotic return march. Gaza City, in the north of the enclave, is a shell of the bustling urban center it was before the war, with swathes of buildings destroyed by bombardments and piles of rubble and torn-up concrete on every side. 'Look at this scene, there is nothing to say,' said a man who gave his name as Abu Mohammad as he searched for a place to settle. 'People will sleep on the ground. There is nothing left.' Many of those returning, often laden with what personal possessions they still have after months of being moved around as the battlegrounds shifted, had trekked 20 km (12 miles) or more along the coastal highway north. 'I am waiting for my father, mother and brother. We lost them on the way,' said Jameel Abed, who walked up from the central area of the Gaza Strip. 'We found some lights here and we are waiting for them,' he said. 'There is no car, no motorized rickshaw, no donkey cart, no vehicle, nothing that could move on this road.' By late on Monday, Gaza's Hamas authorities said more than 300,000 people, or almost half of those displaced from the north during the war, had crossed into Gaza City and the north edge of the enclave from areas in the south. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Even as those who arrived in Gaza looked around for somewhere to settle down, tens of thousands were still moving north as mediators began preliminary work on the second stage of cease-fire negotiations due to begin next week. Three more Israeli hostages are due to be handed over on Thursday by Hamas, the terror group still in control of Gaza, with another three expected on Saturday, in exchange for scores of Palestinian prisoners set for release from Israeli jails, some of whom will go into exile. In Cairo, a high-level Hamas team led by Mohammad Darwish, head of the group's leading council, held talks with Egyptian mediators and welcomed 70 Palestinian prisoners who arrived in Cairo prior to being moved to third countries who would be willing to host them, a Hamas statement said. These include Qatar, Turkey and Algeria, according to Hamas and other sources. Later on Tuesday, Hamas said the delegation has also discussed with Cairo officials alleged Israeli violations of the truce and ideas to achieve national unity with the rival Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas, including an Egyptian proposal to form a committee to run post-war Gaza. Hamas, which has run Gaza since 2007, and Abbas' authority, which has a sway in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, have so far failed to end political splits that weakened Palestinian aspirations for statehood. Negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire Under the terms of the cease-fire, agreed this month with Egyptian and Qatari mediation and U.S. support, 33 hostages are due to be released during a six-week cease-fire, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, many of them serving life sentences in Israeli jails. Seven hostages and 290 prisoners have so far been exchanged. A second stage, which will decide what happens to more than 60 other hostages, including men of military age as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, is due to begin by next Tuesday. But Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, said the group believed the talks would go ahead. 'We are ready to begin negotiations for the second phase at the specified time and are confident that Netanyahu has no choice but to proceed with the second phase,' he said. What would follow full implementation of the cease-fire remains unclear after Israel's repeated declarations that Hamas will not be allowed to remain in power in Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump's call for Palestinians in Gaza to be taken to Egypt or Jordan, though strongly rejected in the region and by Palestinian officials and residents, has further complicated the outlook. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h11100nclu1l	2025-01-28T09:40:00-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/Sk8fNuIdJx/Sk8fNuIdJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Casualties reported in UAV attack in Nabatieh that led to a large fire and billowing smoke in the area; Comes days after cease-fire was extended, allowing the IDF to remain in Lebanon for more than two more weeks. An unusual attack in the Nabatieh area in southern Lebanon was reported on Tuesday evening, less than two days after cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon was extended, allowing the IDF to remain in Lebanon for more than two more weeks. According to the Al-Mayadeen channel, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, this was an attack by a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). The Beirut Health Ministry reported that there were seven casualties in the attack - which led to a large fire and smoke rising in the area. If the IDF did indeed attack the area, then this is the most significant attack in a long period of time in southern Lebanon. Earlier, the Lebanese army claimed that the IDF opened fire on military personnel and civilians on the Yaron-Maroun al-Ras road, and that a soldier and three civilians were injured. This happened while Lebanese army soldiers were escorting residents returning to villages in the south of the country. The White House announced earlier this week that the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon has been extended until February 18. The Americans issued the announcement in light of the fact that the IDF had not yet withdrawn from southern Lebanon, and due to crowds of Lebanese rioters, most of them acting at the behest of Hezbollah. The IDF fired distance shots at many of them, and according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 22 civilians were killed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjedq5800kg	2025-01-28T09:09:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/HkVjEcL00yg/HkVjEcL00yg_4_356_957_539_0_small.jpg

Every terrorist we identify is marked for death': IDF Special Fo...	Duvdevan Special Forces, stretched across multiple fronts since October 7, return to their core mission: eliminating armed terrorists in the West Bank; Recent operations in Tulkarm reveal tactical ambushes, drone technology and the dismantling of explosives and terror networks the IDF's Duvdevan Special Forces, which has been stretched thin since October 7, 2023, across three combat zones, has recently returned – mostly – to its original purpose and primary expertise: combating armed terrorists in the alleys of the West Bank. Exclusive footage from the fighting in the alleys of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarm reveals the complexity of their operations. The unit led a major operation in the Nur al-Shams refugee camp near Tulkarm, last month as part of its role at the forefront of the IDF’s offensive lines in the northern section of the West Bank and again in recent days. This offensive activity, conducted near the seamline and just three kilometers in a straight line from Route 6 and the communities of Hefer Valley Regional Council, takes place in a world so near yet far from the calm of the Sharon region, north of greater Tel Aviv. During an operation that began in recent days in Tulkarm, two armed militants were already eliminated, including the leader of the local terrorist network, and approximately 20 explosive devices were detonated. Duvdevan eliminated more than 10 armed terrorists during the operation – both on the ground and from the air. They conducted nighttime ambushes and daytime searches, attempting to reach every last armed terrorists. They uncovered large stockpiles of weapons in the camp and the command centers of terror groups, which had likely been used to plan the attack that prompted the unit's offensive: a large-scale incursion into Israeli territory by dozens of armed terrorists, inspired by the deadly October 7 massacre. Duvdevan thwarted the incursion. The threat level decreased following the operation, but Central Command estimates it is only a matter of time before the soldiers will be required to return to the area –just as they have raided this hostile camp dozens of times in the past two years. Exclusive footage from the operation, obtained by Ynet, reveals the challenges of fighting in the densely built and crowded urban terrain: numerous blind spots, narrow streets, hidden explosive devices and the need for precise command and control by officers. The simple understanding is clear: every armed terrorist identified is sentenced to death. The soldiers were documented using the small 'Tarnegol' ('Rooster') drones, which were first revealed last year. These drones can move and jump over obstacles on the ground, navigate narrow paths or tunnels, and then fly through windows and rooms. 'We’ve eliminated enemies in large numbers across the West Bank in recent months – dozens of armed terrorists we’ve killed, piles of explosive devices we’ve destroyed. Tulkarm is no longer the same place it used to be,' said Captain N., a platoon commander in the unit, in an interview with Ynet. In footage from the operation, Duvdevan and Shin Bet operatives can be seen operating together in Jenin. The unit has returned to its original mission. 'We saw explosive devices even on the peripheral roads around Nur al-Shams. They are prepared for our entry, but we eliminate them even when they barricade themselves inside houses,' added Captain N. 'We don’t take risks with our soldiers – every armed terrorist is immediately killed. This is what the unit does best, transitioning seamlessly between missions, moving from Gaza to Lebanon and back to the West Bank.'

During the Tulkarm operation, soldiers also discovered bomb-making labs, lathes for manufacturing weapons and explosives with remote activation capabilities hidden in children’s school bags. 'Terrorists simply fled, but we ambushed them,' described Captain N. 'They left behind hot cups of coffee, active phones and electricity running. We even found large improvised vehicle bombs weighing tens of kilograms. I don’t think we’ll be fighting there in cycles because each time there are fewer enemies and fewer weapons. They try to flee the camp whenever we enter.' Captain N. explained, as reported two weeks ago by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, that the IDF finds it challenging to strike the many armed terrorists present during funeral processions. 'It’s very complicated to operate there because there are many uninvolved civilians. Still, we work nonstop, thwarting attacks daily and arresting, on average, about 10 wanted terrorists weekly – just the unit alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjlsxf8ojg	2025-01-28T08:49:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/BJWbw7dIOyg/BJWbw7dIOyg_0_0_1280_590_0_small.jpg
Israel proposes south Lebanon buffer zone as border violence erup...	Renewed clashes highlight long-standing disputes over troop presence and Hezbollah’s influence in southern Lebanon Clashes between the IDF and Lebanese civilians on Sunday have raised alarms over the fragile cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, brokered to halt last year’s war. At least 22 people were killed and over 120 injured, including women and children, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The violence unfolded in southern Lebanon as thousands of displaced residents attempted to return to their homes, defying Israeli military orders and Lebanese army warnings. The IDF said in a statement that its forces fired warning shots to deter 'imminent threats' from groups approaching Israeli positions. 'On Sunday, IDF troops operating in southern Lebanon fired warning shots to remove threats in a number of areas where suspects were identified approaching the troops. Additionally, a number of suspects in proximity to IDF troops that posed an imminent threat to the troops were apprehended and are currently being questioned at the scene,' according to the IDF. Avraham Levine, speaker, and digital content manager at the Alma Center, justified the IDF’s response, saying: 'We were faced with an overwhelming number of people approaching our positions, and our forces fired in response to what was perceived as a direct threat. Retaliation is not what we wanted, but soldiers saw people carrying Hezbollah flags coming their way and had no time to check everyone’s IDs. The Lebanese army should have avoided this circumstance in the first place.' Lebanese officials strongly condemned the incident, calling it a violation of the ceasefire agreement signed three months ago. 'The cease-fire was meant to protect the people of Lebanon, but Israel continues to violate it,' said Faisal Mosleh, a professor of international relations in Beirut. 'Shooting unarmed civilians is not an act of self-defense; it’s an act of aggression. Israel’s forces are once again showing their disregard for the safety of Lebanese citizens and the terms of the cease-fire.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Imad Harb, director of research and analysis at the Arab Center Washington DC, questioned Israel’s intentions. 'The cease-fire agreement was supposed to lead to a full withdrawal, but Israel aims to extend its stay. I doubt this deadline will be met,' according to Harb. The U.S. confirmed on Sunday that the cease-fire agreement will remain in effect until February 18, 2025. 'The arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, will continue to be in effect until February 18, 2025,' the White House said. The delays have fueled frustrations in Lebanon, where the new government, led by President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, faces immense challenges in restoring stability. 'The new government is trying to move the country forward, but Israel’s failure to meet its obligations makes this task nearly impossible,' Mosleh said. In Beirut, Hezbollah supporters held demonstrations to showcase their resilience. While far from the violence in the south, the gatherings highlighted the group’s enduring role in Lebanese society. Harb described the demonstrations as 'a display of resilience, but it also signals how vulnerable they really are.' Levine criticized Hezbollah’s role. 'Hezbollah is exploiting this situation to build their narrative as defenders of Lebanon. Their goal is to provoke tensions and delay the full implementation of the cease-fire agreement,' he said. Critics argue that such a measure would exacerbate tensions rather than bring stability. Harb dismissed the idea. 'This isn’t new. Israel had a buffer zone in Lebanon from 1978 to 2000, and it failed to provide the security it sought. Why would this strategy work now? It’s destruction for the sake of control, but it won’t bring peace or stability to anyone,' Harb said. Future negotiations and challenges In a related development, the U.S. announced that Israel, Lebanon, and the U.S. would begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after October 7, 2023. That date marked Hezbollah’s attack on Israel in support of Hamas, as violence erupted in Gaza. The ongoing presence of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon remains a contentious issue. Lebanese leaders face the dual challenge of addressing external conflicts and managing internal divisions. Harb observed, 'Lebanon’s leadership has no choice but to engage with groups like Amal and Hezbollah. These forces are a powerful part of the political landscape, and while their influence is controversial, the government cannot afford to ignore them.' Despite skepticism, Harb expressed cautious hope for Lebanon’s future. 'Lebanon has faced immense challenges in the past, and we have always managed to rebuild. I believe in our people, in our resilience. If our government can find a way to unite and address both our internal divisions and external pressures, there is still hope for a brighter future,' he said. Whether Lebanon’s fragile cease-fire can hold and the region can avoid further escalation remains to be seen. The coming months will test the resilience of Lebanon’s government and the effectiveness of international efforts to stabilize the region.

UNRWA ban in Israel will be disastrous, UNRWA chief says	Implementation of a ban on the U.N.

Let Israelis move to Greenland, Iran says after Trump suggests mo...	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says by relocating Israelis to Greenland the US can kill two birds with one stone, and resolve the Greenland problem and Israel-Palestinian issue Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi proposed Tuesday that Israelis should be relocated to Greenland, rather than implementing former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to move Palestinians out of Gaza. 'I think this is a project many people have tried to do in the past, but they have all failed. You know, Palestine cannot be deleted and Palestinians cannot be expelled. So my suggestion is something else. Instead of Palestinians try to expel Israelis, take them to Greenland so they can kill two birds with one stone. They can resolve the problem in Greenland and Israelis, it would be a good place for them,' he said in an interview with Sky News You don't think the Israelis have a right to live in what they regard as their homeland?

It is a cause that is still alive, still there, and still breathing.' 'Hamas and Hezbollah have been damaged. But at the same time, they are rebuilding themselves, because as I said, this is a school of thought, this is an idea, this is a cause, this is an ideal that will always be there,' he said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1r9duiojl	2025-01-28T07:15:43-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/27/rJh9l112g1e/rJh9l112g1e_0_0_1200_676_0_small.jpg
IDF will say on Syrian Mount Hermon 'indefintely', Defense Minist...	During a visit to Mount Hermon, Israel Katz emphasized that 'the IDF will remain in the security zone indefinitely' and 'we will not rely on others for our defense – here or anywhere else'; He added that Israel 'will not allow hostile forces to establish themselves and we will act against any threat' Defense Minister Israel Katz visited IDF posts on the summit of Mount Hermon in Syria, and in assessing the current situation he defined Israel's security policy in Syria and announced that 'The IDF will remain at the summit of the Hermon and the security zone indefinitely to ensure the security of the communities of the Golan Heights and the north, and all the residents of Israel.' 'I came here to ensure that the IDF is well-prepared for both defense and offense, for a prolonged stay at the Hermon outposts,' Katz said during a visit to the Hermon's peak. 'We will not return to the reality of October 7, and we will not rely on others for our defense – here or anywhere else. We only rely on the commanders and soldiers of the IDF, both regular and reserve, to provide security to the people of Israel.' 'We will not allow hostile forces to establish themselves in the security zone in southern Syria… we will act against any threat,' he also said. The minister added that Israel would establish contact with friendly populations in the area, especially the large Druze community 'which has historic and close family relations with our Druze brothers in Israel.' During a visit to the peak of Mount Hermon, together with the commander of the 210th Division, Brigadier General Yair Palai, and the commander of the 810th Mountain Brigade, Colonel L., Katz heard from the forces in the outposts about the operational activity in the field to protect Israel's border and prevent the establishment of hostile forces in the area. He spoke with soldiers from the Alpinist Unit, with soldiers of the Haredi Battalion 8551, and the Har Zion 0710 mobility unit, and thanked them for their great contribution to the security of the State of Israel. Meanwhile, an IDF spokesman reported that the Technology and Logistics Branch, the Northern Command, and the Engineering and Construction Branch at the Ministry of Defense have been working in recent weeks to provide the fighting forces with the best possible response to the winter conditions in the Syrian Hermon sector. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'As part of the logistical effort, equipment was provided for the forces to stay in stormy weather conditions, uniquely suited to the extreme weather conditions in the area,' the IDF spokesman noted. 'Infrastructure and equipment were established that can withstand various weather conditions, including temporary structures with an additional layer of insulation, heating means, generators and a water heating system.' The IDF spokesman added: 'As part of the complete response, a unique medical building was provided for treating injuries from cold temperatures, equipped with appropriate medical equipment, kitchens and a dining room that will enable the provision of hot food to the soldiers. Thousands of winter items were distributed to the fighters in the sector, with an emphasis on unique equipment for snow conditions, including heating bags, raincoats, storm suits and winter boots.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bya5nduujl	2025-01-28T07:06:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/r1bU8RvUdkl/r1bU8RvUdkl_83_97_1179_664_0_small.jpg

Hostage families urge Trump: Secure phase II of hostage deal	In meeting with evangelical leader Mike Evans, hostages families deliver a message to the president: 'Only you can save them' The families of Israeli hostages have appealed to former U.S. President Donald Trump to ensure the continuation of phase two of the hostage-for-ceasefire deal, which they hope will bring their loved ones home. In a meeting with Mike Evans, founder of the Friends of Zion Museum and one of Trump’s key allies in Israel, the families shared emotional messages directed at the former president. 'We have 65 more hostages that are going to stay after the first stage of the deal, and you have to make sure that all of them will come back home,' said the wife of a man who was taken hostage but asked to remain anonymous. 'I am begging you from the bottom of my heart, and I can’t wait to see my husband and all the hostages hug you. Thank you for all the things you are doing to bring all of them home.' Gal Gilboa Dalal, a survivor of the Nova music festival and the brother of Guy Gilboa Dalal, who was kidnapped from the same event, and a handful of other hostages met with Evans during Evans’ recent visit to Israel, where he hosted an event celebrating Trump’s legacy at his museum in collaboration with ILTV. Dalal credited Trump with helping finalize the current deal and securing the release of hostages. According to Evans, Dalal described Trump as 'the most powerful man in the world and the only person who can make a difference to bring his younger brother and all the hostages home.' Another family member, Ilay David, the brother of Evyatar David—who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival at age 22—also made an impassioned plea. 'Dozens of innocent people, aged 1 to 86, are being held in tunnels 50 meters underground in horrible conditions,' he said. 'They have been in captivity for more than 475 days. My brother is a young man, and he is set to be released only in the second stage of the deal. I am so afraid that they are dying there. At any moment, they can be executed.' David urged Trump to ensure the agreement continues. 'You are the only one who can bring back my brother and all the hostages,' he said. 'You have to make sure the two sides agree to continue to the second phase of the deal. You are the only one who can bring back my little brother. Please help us and save his life.' Evans delivered the families’ messages to Trump, who responded. Evans, who served as one of Trump’s faith advisors during his presidency from 2017 to 2021, has continued to act as a liaison for the former president in Israel. Since October 7, he has been instrumental in supporting hostage families through events, fundraising, and direct aid. Israel is in the midst of phase I of a hostage deal, which includes the release of 33 hostages over 42 days. So far, seven hostages have returned home. Another three are expected to be released on Thursday and three more on Saturday. Among the released hostages are four observer soldiers, female soldiers who were serving at the Nahal Oz base on Israel's border on the day of the Hamas attack.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj3nquuo1l	2025-01-28T06:17:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/H1zo4OUuyl/H1zo4OUuyl_1_872_1689_951_0_small.jpg
Suddenly, I have a daughter who speaks Arabic': Romi Gonen's fir...	Former hostage's father speaks with Ynet about her healing process, the horror she endured in Gaza and the family's surprise at her mental and physical condition after over a year held captive Over a week after being released from Hamas captivity, Romi Gonen's father Eitan told Ynet on Tuesday that 'Romi is amazing, wonderful. A champion inspiring admiration and awe. We just look at her and are in complete shock at what we see.' 'When she saw me, she simply said, 'Dad, I came back alive.' That means all the interviews we did on TV and radio somehow managed to reach Gaza as well,' he noted. 'I ended every interview with these words: 'Romi will come back alive.' I said it thousands of times, hoping she'd hear it just once and she did,' he added. 'That was the most important thing she had to tell me in the first sentence after 471 days of not speaking. 'I feel incredible euphoria. We waited so long for this day — to feel, to embrace Romi, to talk to her, like you see in the pictures. I get emotional every time I see that video; it's the highest of all highs.' Talking about her long captivity, Eitan clarified: 'On Sunday, after consulting with psychologists, we handed the reins over to Romi. We told her we didn't want to overwhelm or discomfort her. We won't ask questions and will let her process it her way. If she wants a hug, we'll hug her.' 'If she wants us to stand aside, that's what we'll do — and it's working. When she feels a little closed off, she says, 'Let me go,' and we do. When she says, 'Gather around me,' we gather.' Eitan shared that the family was surprised by Romi's physical condition. 'We were very worried about her right arm, where she was injured. We had no idea what or if she'd eaten or if she was sick. But I know Romi's noble spirit; she's the family's sunshine. I wanted that to come back, unharmed. Our sunshine is shining again, without a doubt.' He stressed that a bond formed between her and the other captives. 'The friendship between her and Emily Damari became like a bond of blood. She met Emily in captivity and something extraordinary developed there. I stand aside and say, 'Wow, we have another family member.'' 'They were each other's entire world in captivity. They talked, helped and cared for each other — like a mother, a father, a sister. And when they returned to Israel, they did everything together. 'They go out to eat together, visit places together and chat in each other's rooms. We've gotten to know the wonderful families, both Emily's and Doron Steinbrecher’s. I stand aside and see three superheroes.' Are there any signs hinting at their time in captivity? 'On Romi's first day back, I think most of her speech was in Arabic and she didn’t even realize it. She spoke Arabic nonstop there for over 400 days. She learned it because the terrorists didn’t speak Hebrew or English. So, in the toolbox she developed for herself, part of it was learning how to communicate — to make requests, to get permission for everything she wanted to do. 'To stand, to talk, to go right, to go left — it all required approval. And how do you get that? Only by learning their language. So, yes, that’s one anecdote: Suddenly, I have a daughter who speaks Arabic.' Eitan praised U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration for their involvement in securing the deal. 'I have a very important message from Romi: Completing the deal in all its phases is a vital obligation for Israel. It's unacceptable to break this agreement or shift the blame onto one side or another. 'All captives must come home. There's no need to look for someone to blame — Hamas is a terrorist organization; we know that. They’ll test all our nerves, breaking agreements here and there.' After former hostage Liri Albag's father, Eli, criticized decision-makers who opposed the deal, Eitan said: 'It upset me and my entire family to see [Bezalel] Smotrich and [Itamar] Ben-Gvir's congratulations for Romi, Emily and Doron's return. Are you joking? To oppose the deal and then congratulate them? I despise this behavior.' 'I can't believe they wear a kippah. They claim to be Jews, even more righteous than me but I think that’s very wrong. They acted against Judaism, against tradition and against the most fundamental Jewish mitzvah, redeeming captives.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Don’t try to scare us with the released terrorists. We have the IDF, we have security forces — why was Ben-Gvir the national security minister? He stripped the police and everyone under him of their power,' he added. 'If his daughter had been kidnapped, he wouldn’t have said these things, not him nor Smotrich. I've said this from the start: to speak at the expense of the hostages’ families and call this a reckless deal means they themselves are reckless, not anyone else.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj4a11uioyg	2025-01-28T05:34:57-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/SyAQ9PB00Jx/SyAQ9PB00Jx_532_0_749_422_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu's Haredi coalition partners urge him to see cease-fire ...	Both Shas and United Torah Judaism leaders vow to su pport any deal that would see all of the hostages held captive by Hamas return but in addition to far-right members of the coalition, the PM's own likud members say no deal if Hamas remains to rule Gaza Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ultra-Orthodox coalition partners are urging him to see the cease-fire and hostage release deal through to its end and not return to the war after the first phase is completed. Negotiations on the second phase of the agreement are to begin next week. Netanyahu has been warned by his far-right coalition partners in the Religious Zionist Party that they would topple his government if he ended the war. 'Don't stop!' said Labor Minister Yoav Ben-Tzur from the Shas Party said on Tuesday in a public event. 'Our boys and girls are suffering there. I promise you that all six of the Party's members will support you. Bringing them back is the most sacred cause.' Shas chairmen Aryeh Deri said n Monday in a meeting of his Knesset factions that the deal must be completed in full. In a not so veiled criticizm of far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and the former National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir who resigned from the coalition after the cease-fire deal was signed, Deri said Shas from day one wanted to eliminate Hamas and remove its ability to rule Gaza but on the other hand, the hostages were always top of mind. In the first deal we brought home close to 100 captives. Not everyone agreed with us and now, I understand the concerns because the prices are high, but we have to save lives,' he said. 'We will make every effort to bring every last one of the hostages, home. We are not busy making threats or public declarations. We are not threatening anyone.' Under the terms of the deal, Israel has already begun releasing terrorists sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Israelis and will continue to release them from Israeli prisons as more hostages are freed. In the second phase of the deal, Israel agreed to withdraw its troops out of Gaza, effectively bringing an end to the war. Housing Minister Yitzhak Issachar Goldknopf from the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party agreed. 'I told Netanyahu that we would support any deal to bring the hostages home,' he said. Netanyahu had been accused of avoiding a deal that would end the war and potentially leave Hamas able to regain control of the Gaza Strip, under pressure from Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. The resigning minister called the cease-fire deal a catastrophe for Israel's future security. Culture Minister Mickey Zohar from Netanyahu's Likud Party told ynet in an interview on Tuesday that completion of the deal could rely on the plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump to transfer half of the population of Gaza out of the Strip and settle them temporarily in neighboring Arab countries. 'If we find a way to present a global agreement for an agreed migration, we would support it. This could lead to a break through toward the second phase of the cease-fire deal,' Zohar said. 'Let's be clear. Returning the hostages is our top priority but we cannot allow Hamas to remain in control in Gaza.' But you did not propose any alternatives? 'Alternatives are being considered with the U.S. and others. There is currently no 'operationally realistic' option many people are sitting and thinking of solutions and we hope they find them.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Ahead of Netanyahu's planned meeting with Trump, Zohar said he was already discussing the second phase of the deal, despite his coalition partners on the right, threatening to topple the government. 'I know he is examining the security implications of the second phase,' he said. 'If he finds a suitable solution acceptable for him and the defense establishment that would not harm to Israel's security and would ensure Hamas cannot rule Gaza, that could bring about a breakthrough.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1efsuu00jx	2025-01-28T04:23:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/15/r1HqNMSPkx/r1HqNMSPkx_0_160_1558_877_0_small.jpg
Russian delegation in first Syria visit since Assad fall, TASS re...	The purpose of the visit according to officials is to ensure Russia would retain its naval and air bases in Latakiya and Tartus ; Deputy Russian foreign minister Bogdanov and Kremlin special Syria envoy Lavretiev to meet with new leadership A Russian delegation has arrived in Damascus for the first time since Moscow's ally President Bashar al-Assad was toppled, Russia's TASS state news agency reported on Tuesday, as Russia tries to secure the future of its military bases in Syria.

Native of Hezbollah's strong hold the Dahieh: Meet Lebanon's firs...	Naamat Aoun steals show at her husband's presidential inauguration and stirs interest in Lebanon thanks to her roots and fashion sense Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun was elected on January 9 and has since faced numerous challenges, particularly the return of South Lebanon residents to their villages as the IDF remains deployed in the area. In the early days of his presidency, attention shifted to his wife, Naamat Aoun, born Naamat Elias Naama. On the day of Aoun’s election and inauguration, the Lebanese daily outlet An-Nahar predicted that 'Naamat Aoun will play an active role,' during his term. 'Her extensive experience in public relations allows her to champion social and humanitarian issues in Lebanon.' Naamat comes from a modest family in the A-Shiyah area of Beirut’s Dahieh district, Hezbollah’s main stronghold in the country. Her father, Malham, worked for Lebanon’s national carrier, Middle East Airlines. She has two sisters, Tania and Lina and has had a 23-year log career as head of protocol and public relations at the Lebanese American University. Naamat and Joseph Aoun have two children: Khalil, a banker and professional basketball player and Nour, a science graduate working with international organizations. They’re also have two grandchildren and reportedly one more on the way. Though often described as avoiding the spotlight, Naamat doesn’t shy away from expressing her views. 'My blood is southern, my home is in the South and I go to the South,' she said in a recent interview. 'May Allah strengthen the South. Together, we will rebuild it and return to it, God willing.' President Aoun himself hails from Al-Aishiya, a village in South Lebanon. Known for her social and religious activism, Naamat has spoken about the challenges of her life, shaped by her husband’s military career. She has frequently stated that she raised their children largely on her own during sensitive security periods while maintaining a successful career. 'It wasn’t easy but my husband’s support helped me achieve personal and professional success,' she said in an interview. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: One aspect that captured public attention following Aoun’s inauguration was Naamat’s outfit: a Moschino suit and Dior shoes valued at over $1,000. An-Nahar noted her elegant appearance, describing her black-and-white suit as a symbol of balance between change and strength at the start of a new era. The report added that white, as a neutral and festive color, was chosen to signify that Naamat is not aligned with any political faction in Lebanon’s divided landscape, enhancing her image. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzrjgu001e	2025-01-28T02:23:20-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/SJMXM0Ndye/SJMXM0Ndye_366_47_2269_1277_0_small.jpg
Woman sells baby for adoption abroad	A 71-year-old is indicted after agreeing to sell her ward's unborne child to a couple for adoption in the U.S while the mother who is in her care, is hospitalized in a psychiatric facility A 71-year-old court-appointed guardian from northern Israel has been charged with selling a baby born to a young woman under her care. The case, investigated for eight years by the Israel Police Northern District’s Central Investigative Unit, culminated in a severe indictment filed by the Northern District Prosecutor’s Office on Tuesday. The defendant, whose name is under gag order, faces unprecedented charges but is not in custody. Nazareth District Court President Judge Esther Hellman allowed the publication of key details from the indictment, though the trial will be held behind closed doors. The defendant, represented by attorney Yahli Sperling, is accused of human trafficking, kidnapping for trafficking purposes, child abduction and obstruction of justice. According to the indictment, filed by senior deputy district prosecutors Nurit Hadass and Hani Ezra, the defendant worked with individuals suffering from mental illnesses and was appointed as the complainant’s legal guardian in May 2015. 'When the complainant was in the late stages of pregnancy and hospitalized in a psychiatric facility, the defendant decided to arrange for the baby’s adoption of her own volition,' the indictment read. 'To advance her plan, she located a couple in Israel and agreed they would adopt the child in the U.S., covering all pregnancy and birth-related expenses, without informing the complainant or relevant authorities.' The defendant allegedly flew with the complainant to New York without notifying authorities. The adoptive couple arrived days later, and the defendant facilitated the adoption process, including hiring a U.S. lawyer, arranging a caregiver for the complainant and preparing necessary documents. After the birth and a deterioration in the complainant’s health, the defendant signed adoption consent forms on her behalf and assisted the couple in finalizing the adoption with U.S. authorities. The defendant returned to Israel shortly after the adoption, leaving the complainant hospitalized in the U.S. Despite her requests to return, the complainant was forced to remain abroad and dependent on others without financial resources, her passport or proper medical care. In September, six months after the birth, a host family purchased a flight ticket for the complainant to return to Israel. Upon her return, she filed a police complaint, leading to the adoptive couple’s identification and the child’s location. National Anti-Trafficking Coordination Unit Director Dina Dominitz called the indictment 'unique and precedent-setting, both in Israel and globally.' She added: 'It attributes severe offenses of human trafficking and kidnapping for the purpose of bearing and taking a child, involving particularly cruel exploitation. 'The international investigation underscores the importance of cooperation between enforcement and treatment agencies. I hope this indictment brings healing and justice to the young woman at its hear, who was brutally exploited by those meant to protect her.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Attorney Yahli Sperling, representing the defendant, said, 'My client’s actions were beyond reproach. She vehemently denies the allegations, which do not reflect the truth and this will be clarified in court.' 'The indictment’s filing nine years after the incident speaks volumes about the doubts surrounding it. My client is an elderly, ill woman whose life has been dedicated to charity and volunteer work. She committed no criminal offense,' she added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcuc7uoyg	2025-01-28T02:00:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/04/02/H123lztJA/H123lztJA_0_16_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Six hostages to be freed this week, some families' concern grows ...	PM's coordinator informs families of Hamas reports about fatalities among the hostages; 'its Hamas,' says a brother of a captive, 'it does not end until it does'; three hostages to come home Thrusday, three more on Saturday Six Israeli hostages held by Hamas are expected to be released this week. Three on Thursday including Arbel Yehoud, whose release was delayed by Hamas, Agam Berger and a living male hostage. Three more, living men, are to be freed on Saturday, before implementation of the cease-fire deal is back on track with three hostages freed each week. Hamas is supposed to deliver the names of the hostages 24 hours before their release so on Wednesday, the terror group is to confirm the release of Yehoud, Berger and probably American-Israeli Keith Siegal, whose wife Aviva was freed from captivity in the 2023 exchange. And on Friday, Hamas will provide the names of the three men to be freed on the following day. After Hamas finally transferred the details regarding the condition of the remaining hostages that are to be included in the first phase of the cease-fire and hostage release deal, the families of some of the captives were informed by the government's point man on hostages and missing Israelis, Gal Hirsch, that the chance of their loved ones' being alive are small. 'But Hamas has not provided concrete evidence that my brother is no longer alive,' said Dani Elgarat whose brother Itzik was abducted during the Oct. 7 massacre. He said the information that was received does increase the family's concerns, 'but it is not over until it is,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Dani said other hostages who had been freed, had seen his brother alive in the Hamas tunnels and at the time, he was fine.

Israelis unconvinced that returning to the north is safe	Many residents evacuated from their home close to the Lebanese border say they are not hurrying to return; insist the government and military must ensure their safety For the past 16 months, Rafi and Rachel Biton from the Upper Galilee town of Avivim have been displaced from the home they built 32 years ago, near the Shi'ite village of Maroun al-Ras across the border in southern Lebanon. On Monday, Rafi returned to organize the house, hoping to convince Rachel to move back when the evacuation period declared by the government, ends next month. During his visit, Rachel called him frequently via video to check on his well-being. 'I’m very worried. I left a home of 32 years and I can’t see a way back,' she says. Rafi, drawn to his childhood home in the Galilee, says he feels torn away each evening when returning to the Tiberias hotel, where the family had been housed for since the war began. 'We regularly give thanks in the synagogue for the miracle here,' he says. 'We’ve faced great tragedies, but nothing like what could have happened. We celebrated Simchat Torah together as a community and within minutes, terrorists from Maroun al-Ras could’ve descended on us. We wouldn’t be alive to tell the story.' Gunfire from IDF forces stationed near the destroyed village was audible throughout our conversation. Most of the homes in Maroun al-Ras, once a Hezbollah stronghold, have been destrpyed. Pointing to the area’s former Hezbollah symbol, Rafi remarks on its complete destruction but warns: 'A year from now, you’ll see it rebuilt.' Rafi believes a strong buffer zone is essential for residents to return. 'For a decade, we’ve been abandoned with technology like radars and cameras. Hezbollah disabled it all on the war’s first day, leaving us exposed.' he says 'After October 7, I don’t want to live in fear anymore. We’re not naive,' his wife adds. Rafi and Rachel, married for over three decades, agree that they’ll return only when the IDF visibly secures the area. 'The village controlled the entire region, from Meron to Dalton,' Rafi says. 'Security means having the army inside, ensuring Hezbollah isn’t watching us anymore.' Elsewhere along the northern border, tensions have eased following the cease-fire extension between Israel and Hezbollah. However, isolated incidents continue, including provocations by Lebanese waving Hezbollah flags. Near the village of Aitaroun, two Hezbollah operatives carrying flags were detained by IDF forces and taken for questioning. He stresses the importance of Israeli resilience and that he believed northern residents would return to their homes out of love for their homeland. 'Strong settlement, agriculture and a vigilant military are the solution. It’s our responsibility to shape reality here,' he added.

‘Hamas is blackmailing Israel’	Hamas accused of manipulating Israel during hostage negotiations. Analyst Yoni Ben-Menachem warns of Hamas’ tactics and calls for strength Hamas continues to blackmail Israel, even as the hostage-for-ceasefire deal was signed and is being implemented, according to Mideast analyst Yoni Ben-Menachem. He said, 'When you make a deal with a terror organization such as Hamas or Hezbollah, you know what to expect. This was expected by the Israelis.' Ben-Menachem was referring to Hamas’s decision to hold civilian hostage Arbel Yehud during the previous release on Saturday, even though she was expected to be released. In response, Israel delayed allowing Gazans from the northern part of the Strip to return home. 'We have to learn to negotiate with this cruel enemy terror organization,' Ben-Menachem said. 'They only understand one language, the language of force. Any attempt to come to terms with them, to negotiate with them, they will always try to cheat and manipulate Israel and blackmail Israel. 'So, we have to be very, very strong,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjj11gxidkl	2025-01-28T00:25:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/28/SJ11dzeIOyl/SJ11dzeIOyl_0_307_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Smiling hostages not evidence of humane captivity, but a PR stunt	Reports reveal Hamas' pre-release 'rehabilitation' strategy to mislead public opinion Following the release of hostages Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, Hamas supporters quickly pointed out that the women appeared neither malnourished nor distressed. They noted the hostages were smiling and seemed well-fed, using this as justification for Hamas’ actions on October 7. However, new details have emerged about Hamas' pre-release practices. According to a report from Channel 12, Hamas implements an accelerated 'rehabilitation process' shortly before releasing hostages. This includes providing them with nourishing and nutritious food, as well as stimulants designed to create the illusion of humane treatment during their captivity. Since their release, however, these hostages have shared accounts of their actual experiences, revealing that their time in captivity was far from humane and highlighting the harsh reality of their ordeal. Testimonies from the young women indicate that they endured harsh conditions, including subsisting on seawater, bread, and rice, while being held in underground tunnels and cages. The pre-release measures, described by N12, appear to be a calculated effort by Hamas to manipulate public perception. Other recently freed hostages have since been discharged from medical care, where doctors and social workers have advised their families to allow the survivors to share their stories at their own pace. Gilboa, who still carries a bullet in her leg from the October 7 attack, has shown resilience. 'She’s smiling, and her mood is stable,' her family shared, though the psychological scars will take time to heal. Meanwhile, reports state that one of the female soldiers freed on Saturday expressed a desire to stay behind with Agam Berger, who remains in captivity. Berger, along with six other soldiers, was taken from the Nahal Oz post during the October 7 attacks. She is expected to be part of the next release on Thursday, along with Arbel Yehud and one other hostage. As more hostages return home, their bravery and resilience serve as a testament to the human spirit. But the stories of those still held in captivity remind us that the road to justice and healing is far from over.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skce3gidyl	2025-01-28T00:03:49-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/yk14239222/yk14239222_0_0_820_462_0_small.jpg
100 armed Americans, dogs, ensure no weapons flow to northern Gaz...	Consortium of defense contractors inspects vehicles for arms' transfere north; companies say dedicated to highest professional stadards and implimentaion of the cease-fire terms Thousands of Gazans continue to head to northern Gaza on Tuesday after their passage was permitted on Monday. Convoys of cars have been crossing through the A-Rashid road while others make their way on foot. According to the cease-fire agreement there is not security check for the people walking north and only vehicles are inspected by the consortium of American defense contractors set up to carry out that task. These are highly-skilled, ex-military, ex-CIA personnel who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan and have vast fighting experience. Some of them speak Arabic. They are armed and their mission is to prevent the flow of weapons and terrorists, north. In all, 100 employees of the consortium have been sent to Gaza, using a hotel in southern Israel as their home base. All are working under the mandate given by the mediators in the cease-fire deal – the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, who also pay their wages. A second line of defense is manned by an Egyptian security fence that participates in the initial questioning and secures the site. Inspections are carrying out using X-ray equipment and other technologies in addition to hand searchers. The Americans travel in white pick-up trucks or blue armored vehicles, reminiscent of those used by UN peace keeper, but unlike them, the American defense contractors do not intend to turn a blind eye. Hamas would likely be disappointed if the terror group attempts to test them. When a car approaches the checkpoint all of its passengers, but the driver, must exit the vehicle while the driver and his car are inspected for explosives. The entire process takes only minutes. Along the road, on both sides of the checkpoint at Netzarim, Hamas police are deployed to maintain order and IDF troops deploy dogs to sniff out any weapons. The consortium includes Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) and UG Solutions who provide comprehensive security solutions globally. It also includes the Egyptian SRS security firm. The consortium was selected by the mediators, with the agreement of the parties to the cease-fire deal. The legality of the consortium's work has not yet been clarified. For example it is not clear who would investigate a fatal shooting incident if one occurs. Would it be Israel Police? The U.S.?

Aner Shapira's baguette truck	New food truck inspires soldiers, in memory of fallen Nova festival hero A new food truck is delivering warm baguette sandwiches to soldiers on the frontlines in Gaza, Lebanon, Judea, and Samaria in honor of fallen civilian-soldier Aner Shapira. Shapira attended the Nova music festival on October 7, the day Hamas infiltrated Israel and began a killing spree. While returning to his military base, he was forced to detour due to gunfire on the highway. He pulled over and entered a shelter where 24 people were already hiding. Shapira, noticing the panic among those inside, reassured them and urged them to remain calm. He instructed them to hide and cover their heads with their hands. Standing in the center of the room with a broken beer bottle as a makeshift weapon, he prepared to defend the group. The terrorists began firing and throwing grenades into the shelter. Shapira heroically caught and returned the first eight grenades to the attackers. Tragically, an RPG eventually exploded, taking his life. Known for his love of cooking, Shapira often made shakshuka and other classic Israeli dishes for his friends. To honor his memory, the NGO Nechama and Hatzala launched a food truck that delivers baguettes to soldiers, inspiring them to remember Shapira’s bravery and remain motivated in their mission.

Liquid prophecy: Father-daughter duo crafts ‘Biblical’ wine	A boutique winery and lodge in a remote settlement is creating a vibrant gathering space despite political and logistical challenges The winding Samaria roads leading to Esh Kodesh are dizzying—both breathtakingly beautiful and steep, making the drive awe-inspiring and a little intimidating. But once you reach the top of the hill, located 35 kilometers from Jerusalem and home to only a few dozen families, the view is nothing short of spectacular. From this vantage point, you can see the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan River Valley to the east. Nestled in the heart of this small community is a charming wooden cabin that looks like something out of Little House on the Prairie, complete with a slanted roof and large windows. In the frigid cold of winter, the windows fog up; inside, it’s toasty and inviting. Settlers Winery & Lodge opened just two months ago, and it has already become one of, if not the, most happening spots in the Binyamin region on Thursday and Saturday nights. Hundreds of locals and visitors from across the country come to drink wine, enjoy good food, and jam to live music until dawn. The lodge is the brainchild of A.Y. Katsof, a 40-year-old resident of Esh Kodesh. Katsof, who has lived in the community for 15 years, essentially built his house with his own two hands. In 2011, he planted his first rows of grapes, inspired by a vision to make wine in the hills of Samaria, just as described in Jeremiah 31:5: 'Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit.' In 2017, he bottled his first label, Settlers Cellar. Since then, the boutique winery has been producing thousands of bottles annually, primarily sold through a private wine club. The wine is also available at the bar—but you won’t find it in stores. Katsof’s then-7-year-old daughter, Neomi, planted those first grapes alongside him. Now 19, Neomi is running the bar with her father, managing a two-cabin bed-and-breakfast, and helping with the winery. With her blond hair, feisty attitude and cowboy boots, she strides through the restaurant with visible pride in what she and her father are building together — although much of the past year, Katsof was away serving in the reserves. Around 9 p.m., the bar begins to fill, starting with a small group of soldiers, followed by young women, likely from a nearby seminary. By midnight, it’s packed. The lights are dim, and as guests grow livelier, the music becomes more eclectic—country, rap, rock, Israeli melodies, even meditative tunes. Instruments like darbukas, guitars, and a small keyboard come out for an open mic session that feels like karaoke but is far more spontaneous and soulful. 'People come from all over Israel: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Raanana, Gedera,' Katsof said. 'We often talk about normalization with Arab countries. This wine bar is normalization among ourselves, among Israelis.' Katsof explained that people connect through the music, which he calls 'jams.' 'Around 12:30 a.m., the music really gets going,' Katsof says as he picks up a guitar to play a soft rock song. His mellow voice fills the room as he sings some of the greatest hits of the ’70s and ’80s. 'Random people get up, bring instruments — country, blues, reggae,' Katsof continued. 'People play guitar solos until the sun rises. Some fall asleep on the couch. Others sleep in their cars.' The menu varies, reflecting the challenges of living in a remote location where food isn’t always easily accessible and you have to be planful. Esh Kodesh is fairly isolated, with the nearest community, Shiloh, about 15 minutes away. There’s a small market in Esh Kodesh with limited hours, and a slightly larger one in Shiloh. For major shopping trips, residents drive to Ariel, 19 kilometers away. On this particular Thursday night, the menu features kosher cheeseburgers—made with kosher meat and vegan cheese—along with fries and pickles. There are also mini schnitzel bites – fried chicken patties. They discover they forgot the lettuce, so just go with the flow. 'It’s hard work,' Neomi said. She recalled planting grapes for the first time as a child, waking up early to help her father before heading to school. 'It wasn’t like a walk in the park,' she admitted, rolling her eyes slightly. 'But at the end of the day, I definitely enjoyed the work, and I still do. We’ve planted a lot.' Working with family, Neomi acknowledged, can 'be very hard.' After spending several months working on a farm, she returned to Esh Kodesh to help her father. 'It’s a lot of responsibility,' she said, 'but I think the hard work is good for me. I love being busy. If there’s nothing to do, I go crazy.' Her feistiness is evident in her big, round eyes. Her long blond hair falls below her waist, and her cowboy boots make sharp clicks on the wooden bar floor as she sets down ketchup bottles and tea light candles in glass holders to brighten the tables. Since starting to work at the winery, Neomi said she has developed a deep appreciation for wine. As her father serves samples of their varieties, she often weighs in on her favorites. With practiced ease, she flips out glasses and pours just enough to give a taste, careful not to waste what her father calls 'liquid prophecy' — wine sourced from the land of the Bible, fulfilling the verse in Jeremiah. Not everyone supports what Katsof is doing. Esh Kodesh has the added complication of having been built without authorization from the Israeli government and is therefore also considered illegal under Israeli law. It was included in the 1999 'outpost agreement' with Prime Minister Ehud Barak’s government, which evacuated some outposts, moved others, and permitted others to remain in place but did not formally legalize their status. 'Settlers are pioneers' In 2015, Ariel Handel, a professor at Tel Aviv University, coined the term 'wine-washing' in a paper examining the winemaking industry in these disputed areas. A few years later, an opinion writer for Al Jazeera adopted the term, claiming that 'Israel is using its wine industry to distract from its other domestic pastimes like ethnic cleansing, apartheid, and the periodic massacre of Palestinians.' Critics argue that the emphasis on winemaking in the region serves to whitewash its realities. Instead of viewing the occupied territories as a site of checkpoints, clashes and violence, the focus shifts to portraying them as destinations for fine wine, tourism, and an idyllic quality of life. For years, Settlers Cellar focused exclusively on producing deep red wines, primarily cabernet sauvignons. However, in recent years, the winery has started experimenting with bubbly rosés and other new creations. Katsof opens a bottle of their pink wine. It has a bottle cap, similar to a glass soda bottle, and inside is a slightly bubbly elixir. The wine is sweet but not overly so—perfect for a summer day on the beach, a sailing trip across the Mediterranean, or a picnic in the desert, all quintessential Israeli pastimes. 'You go to France, you drink champagne,' Katsof explained. 'You go to Spain, you drink cava. If you go to the hilltops of Judea and Samaria, you drink ‘buot.’' 'Buot,' which means bubbles in Hebrew, is a sparkling wine that Katsof is developing specifically for the region. 'Every region has its own terroir. Planting grapes in the hills of Samaria is not easy. After 4,000 years, when the Jews returned here, this land was covered in forest,' he said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The terrain is challenging, with limestone hills that are difficult to farm. The region’s cold mornings, hot days, and cooler evenings create additional hardships for the vines. But Katsof believes these challenges result in stronger, more flavorful grapes. He named the winery 'Settlers Cellar' not to evoke the negative connotations associated with the term, but because, as he put it, he and his family came to a deserted hilltop and settled it. 'Settlers are pioneers,' Katsof said. The early days were not easy. Arab residents would occasionally break into the vineyard and burn the fields. As a boutique winery, Settlers Cellar can experiment with small batches. 'Sometimes we get lucky, and sometimes we get even luckier,' Katsof admitted with a grin. Still, he believes they’re only scratching the surface of what they can achieve. 'We are just starting to figure out how to create special, unique flavors,' Katsof said. Neither Katsof nor his daughter is formally trained in winemaking. They’ve learned on the job, relying on advice from friends in the industry. For Neomi, like her dad, the work is about more than just making wine—it’s about fulfilling a spiritual mission. 'My siblings and I are very connected to the Bible and the land. Every Shabbat meal, my father tells us another story about the prophets or the Torah, so we understand. The land was promised to us by God, and it says to plant vineyards in the mountains of Samaria. So that’s what we are here doing,' she explained. Their work has also inspired Christian believers. Each season, a group of volunteers from the center and southern United States travels to Israel through an organization called HaYovel to help harvest the grapes. 'The world is against Israel’s right to live in their biblical homeland,' the group’s website states. 'We bring Christians to Israel to serve the land and people, enabling them to connect to the land of their faith, restore Christian-Jewish relations, and confirm Israel’s right to their ancestral homeland.' Other Christians living in or visiting Israel have also supported Katsof’s efforts, including Henry Strauss, the spouse of Ilse Strauss from the Bridges for Peace organization. Strauss, alongside others, helped build the wine bar, contributing his labor and bringing in like-minded volunteers. 'There is no Arab labor here — only Jewish and Christian labor,' Katsof said. 'They are very, very busy, but they volunteer to help us because they believe in helping Jews.' Katsof has six children, ranging in age from 19 to 8. His 16-year-old son Yisroel often helps out in the kitchen. Katsof shared a touching story: two soldiers, grieving the recent loss of a close friend who died in Gaza, came to the bar one night to jam. They played their guitars until the early hours of the morning. A few days later, one of the soldiers asked Neomi out on a date, and they’ve been seeing each other ever since. Nearly every night the bar is open, the young man—whom they refer to only as 'N.'—returns to drink, hang out, and enjoy the atmosphere. As the sun rises, Neomi and N. often sit on the stage to play music together. Neomi, who has a beautiful voice, is shy and only sings after her work is done. Katsof looked at his daughter with a smile. 'If they end up together, this whole winery will be worth it just for them.'

Trump pressures Egypt to take in Gaza Palestinians	President tells reporters he hoped el-Sisi who is a 'friend' would agree to his idea to remove Gazans to neighboring countries during rebuilding in the Strip as the U.S. provides Egypt with much aid; says will discuss two-state solution with Netanyahu soon U.S. President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi about his suggestion to move Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries while the Strip was being rebuilt. 'I’d like to get them living in an area where they can live without disruption and revolution and violence,' Trump said. 'When you look at the Gaza Strip, it’s been hell for so many years…There have been various civilizations on that strip. It didn’t start here. It started thousands of years before, and there’s always been violence associated with it. You could get people living in areas that are a lot safer and maybe a lot better and maybe a lot more comfortable,' he said. The president told reporters on Air Force One that he hoped the Egyptian president would agree to take the Gazan's in and said the United States provided Egypt with much aid and he was sure el-Sisi, whom he called a friend, could help. 'It's a tough neighborhood but I think he can do that,' Trump said.

Syria intercepts weapons shipment destined for Hezbollah	New Damascus rulers fins a variety of weapons and missiles near the Lebanese border, signaling a resurgence in the group’s smuggling operations despite prior setbacks The Ministry of Interior in Syria's new administration announced on Sunday that it had seized a shipment of weapons allegedly intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah group. A media source from the Syrian Ministry of Interior stated that the General Directorate of Border Security intercepted the shipment on smuggling routes along the Syrian-Lebanese border. The source told The Media Line that the operation took place near the city of Serghaya in the Damascus countryside, an area where Hezbollah has reportedly been increasing its activity. In a related development, the Public Security Directorate of the Syrian Ministry of Interior announced last week the thwarting of another arms smuggling operation aimed at Lebanon. The shipment reportedly contained a variety of weapons. The General Security Directorate in the coastal province of Tartus said it intercepted the shipment, which was headed to Lebanon through illegal crossings, in coordination with the province's intelligence agency. According to officials, the shipment was seized before crossing into Lebanese territory. It included a variety of weapons and missiles. Images released by the directorate showed the confiscated items, which included sniper rifles, machine guns, Russian-made AK-47 rifles, grenade launchers, and three boxes containing missiles. Although Hezbollah has lost several vital supply routes in recent years—most notably its Syrian corridor, which facilitated arms transfers from Iran—the group appears to be resuming its illicit activities. In December, Hezbollah’s Secretary-General, Naim Qassem, acknowledged the impact of these disruptions. He admitted that developments in Syria have directly affected Lebanon and Hezbollah’s operations. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Since the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, along with several other party commanders, as well as the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah's activities in arms smuggling and drug production have declined significantly. However, recent events suggest a resurgence of the group’s operations, albeit on a smaller scale. This resurgence poses significant challenges to Syria's new administration as it grapples with securing its borders and curbing Hezbollah's influence in the region.

Freed hostages share experiences with friends and family	IDF lookouts witnessed their friends murdered, other dying of wounds; terrorists guarding them forbade crying or holding hands but the girls found ways to support each other; the picked up Arabic and use black humor to process their ordeal Since their release from Hamas captivity on Saturday, the four IDF lookouts have been telling their families about the long months when they were held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. 'The are talking all the time about their experiences. They are telling all, perhaps out of a sense that they have to let it all out,' some who have been with the girls, said. They were aware of the events during the Oct. 7 massacre because they were abducted by the terrorists, relatively late and understood the magnitude of the atrocities. People around them said they spoke of what had transpired in the shelter that they were in, where they watched their friends slowly die or be murdered and that had a significant effect on them. They also said they used black humor to communicate and are spending the time at the Beilinson Hospital to be together surrounded by close friends and family. The girls have picked up good Arabic language skills and occasionally drop a word in Arabic in their sentences. A few of them contacted other hostages that were free, who had been with them in Gaza. All the girls have met up with friends and Liri united with her partner Nir, and was happy to see him on his feet after he was badly hurt in a terrorist ramming attack and has been in a wheel chair. After he was operated on last March, he was able to walk with the help of crutches. Naama Levy was held hostage on her own for a long time until she was united with the other girls. Then she asked them if they were really alive. Four of the girls tried to pass the time with physical exercise despite to difficult condition they were held in and the lack of food. The terrorists who guarded them did not allow them to hold hands or cry but they found ways to support each other.

Closet leading to tunnel shaft: Ynet joins IDF forces in Jenin	Military continues its West Bank counterterror operation in Jenin, now expanding to Tulkarm and exposing dangerous terror infrastructure in the area Security forces expanded their West Bank counterterror operations on Monday to the Palestinian town of Tulkarm, where Hamas terror cell leader Ihab Abu Atiyya was killed in an airstrike. In a tour of the Jenin refugee camp, the extensive destruction from the operation is evident. The camp is now in ruins, with D9 bulldozers visible from afar. Most residents have left and security officials stressed the military allowed them to leave via designated routes. 'Large forces are currently operating in the camp during the initial stages of the operation, which will continue indefinitely,' the IDF said in a statement. 'This comes after dozens of operations in Tulkarm, Nur al-Shams and Jenin since the start of the war, aimed at dismantling terror infrastructures.' So far, 15 terrorists have been killed, over 40 injured and more than 35 Palestinians have been detained for questioning. Forces have destroyed several booby-trapped apartments and command centers and continue to search for weapons, explosives labs and terror hideouts. IDF Combat Engineering Corps units are clearing pathways around the camp. A security source said that approximately 60 buildings in the camp were demolished in the past week. 'Opening a 450-meter route in such dense terrain takes nearly two days,' they explained, noting the challenges of operating in such conditions. Col. A, a brigade commander who was moderately injured last month in an explosion in Tulkarm, said, 'The difference in this operation lies in the mission: completely neutralizing the Jenin battalion. We have the resources, forces and firepower needed, as well as the time it requires.' 'We started the operation with tactical ingenuity, applying pressure on terrorists in the camp's center, eliminating those who remain and intercepting escapees with intelligence-backed special forces,' he added. Senior IDF Central Command officials suggested the operation might last months to fully dismantle the battalion, which has become a symbol in the West Bank, drawing both fleeing terrorists and significant funding from Iran and other sources via Hamas. During the tour, Lt. Col. D, commander of an IDF reconnaissance Unit, presented a room containing weapons and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) connected to gas canisters. 'Something that looks like a child’s wardrobe conceals a hole leading to a hidden shaft where terrorists stored arms,' he explained. 'The room also contained a surveillance command center equipped with computers monitoring our forces’ movements through cameras installed in the camp,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Outside another room, forces discovered additional ready-to-use explosives and a vehicle rigged as a car bomb. A soldier described these IEDs as 'dangerously unstable but highly lethal,' adding they are often transported to other areas and used on roads near settlements. The operation involves units from various IDF combat infantry units, Border Police units, UAV operators and attack helicopters when needed. However, the mission has not been without cost. A recent incident saw three Egoz Brigade soldiers injured, one critically, in a shooting incident still under investigation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h14yvwru1e	2025-01-27T12:30:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/S1YNjwbHuke/S1YNjwbHuke_1_167_1601_901_0_small.jpg

The Iranian handler saw potential' interrogation of spies reveal...	Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev tell police they knew they were speaking with an Iranian handler who wanted information on fighter jets and military bases in the country After 21-year-old IDF reserve soldiers Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev were arrested on suspicion of spying and providing classified information to Iran on Monday, their claims during their interrogation showed a worrying picture about Tehran’s incessant efforts to obtain information on Israel. 'The Iranian agent asked me in messages where I served. I replied, ‘The Iron Dome.' He wrote, 'Prove it,' so I sent him a video from the base,' Eliasfov said during his interrogation. Eliasfov revealed the Iranian agent questioned how his friends reacted when he told them about spraying graffiti for him. 'They told me to be careful and called me a spy,' he said. He added that his partner asked him to cut ties with the agent, saying, 'Please block him.' 'This was early on, so I blocked him,' Eliasfov said. 'Later, when media reports about agents emerged, she sent me the articles and said, 'See? It’s a good thing you stopped.'' Superintendent Sarit Peretz of Israel Police’s Lahav 433's National Unit for Serious and International Crime Investigations explained, 'Initially, we thought they were active-duty soldiers but we later realized they were reservists and involved the Shin Bet and Military Police. This case exposed us to classified materials, requiring us to collaborate with military investigators.' Peretz said the suspects were arrested at home, where they were 'shocked' but quickly connected their detention to activities for Iran. 'Initially, they downplayed the incident, but as the investigation deepened, they acknowledged their awareness of the agent, the damage their actions caused and the potential consequences,' Peretz noted. The suspects admitted they knew they were communicating with a foreign agent but tried to claim uncertainty. Evidence, including a Ynet article they discussed about Iranian espionage, tied them directly to their actions. 'The graffiti spraying was a starting point for more significant operations,' Peretz said. Andreyev reportedly decided to stop cooperating after realizing the implications, but not before assisting Eliasfov in coordinating with the agent. Eliasfov allegedly filmed classified information from the Iron Dome base and sent it to Iranian handlers. 'He claimed he only sent part of the video, but the full footage is in Iranian hands,' Peretz said. Iranian requests included technical data on Air Force fighter jets, information on military bases and aerial footage of IDF facilities such as Nevatim Airbase and military headquarters in Tel Aviv. Eliasfov also forged operational orders about an IDF raid in Lebanon and offered to sell ammunition. 'The Iranian handler saw the potential there — a connection to someone in Iron Dome and another in the IDF HQ. That’s a goldmine,' Peretz added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: When asked if their families were aware, Peretz said, 'One of Yuri’s family members knew and warned him against it. Friends and coworkers suspected something but dismissed it as just graffiti.' She stressed, 'Even graffiti can create fear and signals Iranian infiltration into Israel.' Regarding national security risks, Peretz concluded, 'In the right hands, this information is very dangerous and will move to someone who can use it. I hope the military addresses the vulnerabilities.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjey58s00jx	2025-01-27T11:03:23-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/Sy9XdRV00kg/Sy9XdRV00kg_102_0_1069_601_0_small.jpg
Hezbollah leader says group rejects delay in IDF withdrawal from ...	In speech, terror group's Director-General Naim Qassem attacks Lebanon's political leaders for speaking out against Hezbollah alleging they disappeared during Israeli attacks; Qassem also accuses Israel of assassinating a senior commander Hezbollah's Director-General Naim Qassem said on Monday that the Iran-backed terror group does not accept the delay in the IDF withdrawal from South Lebanon, 'by even a single day.' In a televised address Qassem attacked Lebanon’s political leaders, accusing them of 'raising their voices against the resistance and disappearing during Israeli attacks. 'He can't grant Israel any concessions,' he said of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun. 'Does the U.S. expect to find someone in Lebanon who will accept continued Israeli attacks? That won’t happen. All consequences from the delay in Israel’s withdrawal are the responsibility of the UN and the U.S.,' he said. 'The enemy requested to halt attacks and we agreed because we didn't seek them in the first place,' he added. 'We didn't decide on war. We agreed to the cease-fire because the state decided to defend its borders and expel Israel. This is an opportunity for the state to fulfill its duties and prove its capabilities on the political level.' Qassem said Hezbollah did not expect to lose so many of its leaders in such a short time. 'The leaking of information, the enemy's media control and its air force contributed to the attacks against us.' Following Hezbollah's provocations in southern Lebanon on Sunday which led to 22 deaths from IDF fire, Qassem declared, 'We won because we returned and because Israel will withdraw against its will.' 'Hezbollah soldiers haven’t left the area and Hezbollah remains steadfast and strong. We chose patience and refrained from responding to Israeli violations, despite feelings of humiliation and a desire for revenge.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: He also claimed that 'Israel violated the agreement 1,350 times' and criticized the U.S., saying, 'The Americans sponsor Israeli crimes and fail to fulfill their role.

Qassem further accused Israel of allegedly orchestrating the assassination of Hezbollah commander Mohammad Hamadi who was shot to death in his apartment last week. 'Treacherous hands assassinated Mohammad Hamadi, and investigations are ongoing, but attention is focused on the Zionists. We're examining the significant breaches to draw lessons.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skuk3br00ke	2025-01-27T10:58:15-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/r1mM8HHuJg/r1mM8HHuJg_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

All those on motorbikes, are Hezbollah' Lebanon border once agai...	Hezbollah operatives parade in villages of South Lebanon, once again posing a threat despite an agreement that should keep them far away Dozens of Lebanese roamed freely in the ruins of Al-Matmura village, near the border fence facing the western Galilee on Sunday. The area was vacated by IDF forces on January 11, and the Lebanese army was expected to secure it and prevent residents from returning. However, no Lebanese army presence was visible in the area overlooking Israel. IDF troops looked on, wary of possible anti-tank missile or gunfire that could escalate tensions and reignite the war with Hezbollah after the cease-fire in southern Lebanon ended overnight without an Israeli withdrawal. Nearby, sporadic gunfire echoed as the military worked to prevent the return of Hezbollah terrorists, disguised as civilians, to restricted areas. Earlier, a senior correspondent for the Hezbollah-affiliated al-Mayadeen network, Ali Mortada broadcast from the village ruins. 'Israel is having a very bad day,' he mocked. Meanwhile, locals hoisted Hezbollah flags and fixed them into the ground, while motorcycles and vehicles moved freely through the streets, with some riders approaching the Israeli border fence. 'Anyone riding a motorcycle there is a Hezbollah operative,' a young local said, requesting anonymity because he had family across the border. Israel 'can't stop the Sunni villagers from returning,' he added, 'These are their homes.' A nearby shepherd, reflecting on the conflict. 'War is bad. What's happening there isn’t good,' he said. Over the past year, most of the 2,000 residents of Arab Al-Aramshe located near the border with Lebanon, remained in their homes despite frequent Hezbollah drone and missile attacks targeting Israeli military positions in the village. In October 2023, a Hezbollah terror cell infiltrated the village, killing three soldiers, including Col. Alim Saad. The attackers arrived from Al-Matmura, which housed vast stockpiles of advanced weapons and fortified combat positions, later seized by Israeli forces. The area was handed over to the Lebanese army two weeks ago. Recent social media footage shows Hezbollah operatives, including civilians, attempting to reclaim destroyed border villages, taunting nearby Israeli forces who responded with warning shots. 'The Lebanese army isn't preventing Hezbollah's return to these areas, as Israel feared,' Retired Lt. Col. Sarit Zehavi, head of the Israeli Alma Research Center think tank, said. Eitan Davidi, head of Margaliot’s local council, added, 'We can't accept breaches or allow residents to return under these conditions.' 'The situation requires maintaining strategic positions to ensure northern residents' safety. If Lebanon objects, Israel should be prepared to resume the conflict,' he said, addressing the agreement seeking to implement UN Resolution 1701 from 2006 which Israeli residents now fear is not enough to prevent Hezbollah from recuperating its strength in Lebanon and ensure their safety.

Lookout soldier Maya Desiatnik survived October 7. The return of ...	Maya saw her fellow soldiers killed and kidnapped during the Hamas attack and massacre at Nahal Oz, where she was stationed at the military base; She has been plagued by PTSD, nightmares, and overwhelming survivor’s guilt For Maya Desiatnik, the morning of October 7, 2023, will forever be etched in her memory as the day her world changed forever. On that fateful morning, Hamas, the terrorist organization ruling Gaza, launched an unprecedented and brutal attack on Israel. Among their targets was the Nahal Oz military base near the Gaza border, where Maya was stationed as a lookout soldier. 'I will never forget what I saw through the surveillance cameras,' Maya recalls, her voice heavy with emotion. 'The terrorists breached the border effortlessly, storming into our base. Chaos erupted as they advanced, leaving destruction in their wake.' Trapped in the command center with her fellow lookout soldiers, Maya endured hours of terror as gunfire and explosions echoed around them. When the terrorists set the command center on fire, Maya narrowly escaped, but her fellow soldiers and friends were not as fortunate. 'I was the only one who survived,' she says, her voice breaking. 'I lost my closest friends that day. The memories of them and their bravery are with me always.' In the aftermath of the attack, Maya faced a new and more complicated battle. Her physical injuries from smoke inhalation eventually healed, but the emotional scars run far deeper. Plagued by PTSD, nightmares, and overwhelming survivor’s guilt, Maya has struggled to find her footing. During her recovery, the fact that not all her friends had perished that day, and instead were taken captive by Hamas, gave her a sliver of hope. The knowledge that Daniella, Liri, Naama and Karina, had reportedly been taken captive by Hamas became both a source of strength and a tormenting uncertainty. Months passed, Maya traveled to New York with a delegation from the organization Belev Echad - an international nonprofit dedicated to helping injured soldiers. There Maya was confronted with heart-wrenching images of her friends in captivity. 'I didn’t want to see them,' she recalls. 'But when I did, I recognized Daniella immediately because of the tattoo on her arm. It was a moment of both hope and pain, knowing they were alive but trapped in such unimaginable circumstances.' Just last week, Maya’s world shifted once more. While on another advocacy mission with Belev Echad in Cleveland, Ohio, she received the news she had prayed for: her friends had been released and were on their way home to Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'I felt a tidal wave of emotions – relief, joy, anger, everything at once,' she says. 'Relief that they were alive, joy that they were safe, but also anger at Hamas for dragging this out, for separating us, for trying to claim some twisted victory in the end.' Maya’s reaction was raw and immediate. 'I broke down and cried,' she admits. 'For the first time, I cried tears of happiness. It felt like a weight had been lifted. For so long, my life revolved around ensuring their stories weren’t forgotten, and now, they are free. They are home.' This moment of closure marked a profound turning point for Maya. For over a year, she has lived with the singular purpose of advocating for her friends’ freedom, unable to imagine a future beyond her grief. 'Now, I finally feel like I can breathe,' she says. 'For the first time, I’m allowing myself to think about the future – studying, traveling, and rebuilding the life I put on hold.' She currently is traveling to college campuses across the United States under the auspices of Belev Echad, sharing her story, and ensuring the world hears the truth about Israel and the sacrifices made by its people. Through her lectures, Maya is not just educating audiences but also inspiring them. Her story is one of survival, resilience and the unbreakable bond between friends. 'Their release is not just a moment of joy; it’s a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the strength we find in each other,' she says. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1rw5mbuyg	2025-01-27T06:03:04-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/BJ2o6GH001x/BJ2o6GH001x_65_580_919_518_0_small.jpg
Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander says Iran purchased Russian...	Iran has purchased Russian-made Sukhoi-35 fighter jets, a senior Revolutionary Guards commander said on Monday, amid Western concerns about Tehran and Moscow's growing military cooperation. This is the first time an Iranian official has confirmed the purchase of Su-35 jets. However, Ali Shadmani, who was quoted by the Student News Network, did not clarify how many jets were purchased and whether they had already been delivered to Iran. 'If the enemy acts foolishly, it will taste the bitter taste of being hit by our missiles, and none of its interests in the occupied territories will remain safe,' Shadmani warned referring to Israel. Iran's air force has only a few dozen strike aircraft, including Russian jets as well as ageing U.S. models acquired before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj211hwrdye	2025-01-27T04:38:10-08:00

Hamas list confirms fate of hostages: 25 reported alive out of 33...	Hamas confirms 25 Israeli hostages are alive; Israel says list aligns with intelligence assessments; 'The families have been updated' Hamas has handed over to mediators a list showing that 25 Israeli hostages are still alive, out of 33 scheduled for release, an official of the group told Reuters on Monday. He said Israel had received the list from the mediators of the Gaza cease-fire agreement. According to Israeli officials, the list was divided into categories: women and men, living and deceased. The list revealed that the majority of the additional 26 hostages slated for release in the first phase are still alive. Israeli authorities updated the families. Some were informed that the list confirms the assessment that their loved ones are alive. But other families were given the difficult news that the information received confirms grave concerns about the lives of their loved ones. However, it was clarified to these families that a hostage cannot be officially declared dead while their body remains in captivity unless Israel obtains unequivocal evidence. Families whose fears for their loved ones' lives were confirmed by the Hamas list received personal calls overnight and into the morning from the Coordinator for POWs and MIAs, Brigadier General (res.) Gal Hirsch. Some families, who have been receiving consistent updates based on reliable information independent of the Hamas list, are unwilling to accept the situation, as there has been no definitive confirmation of death. As a result, they maintain hope that their loved ones are still alive. Additionally, Hirsch released a statement to all the families regarding the agreements reached overnight concerning civilian hostage Arbel Yehoud, the upcoming releases scheduled in the following days, details about the list received from Hamas, and the opening of the Netzarim Corridor to the northern part of the Gaza Strip on Monday morning. Israeli officials stated overnight that the list provided contained no surprises and aligned almost exactly with intelligence assessments. Prior to receiving the list, Israel had assessed that out of the 33 hostages expected to be released in the first phase, 25 were alive. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The guarantee Israel received for Arbel’s release was a public declaration from the United States and Qatar. The delay in her release was primarily due to internal power struggles between Islamic Jihad and the Resistance Committees, with the expectation that Hamas would enforce a resolution — something that ultimately occurred. Hours after learning that Arbel would be released from captivity this coming Thursday, her family from Nir Oz issued a statement expressing their feelings. 'We are experiencing complex, emotional and nerve-wracking days,' they wrote. 'We long for the moment when we can once again embrace our Arbel and pray for the return of all the hostages.' Arbel, who has been in captivity for 479 days, is set to be released in three days, along with the only remaining female IDF lookout in captivity, Agam Berger, and another unnamed hostage. This unusual phase of the deal was reached to resolve the cease-fire crisis. Three additional hostages are expected to be released on Saturday. The crisis began after the list of female hostages scheduled to be released in the second phase of the deal was published last Saturday evening, and Arbel, a kidnapped civilian, was not included — contrary to the agreements between Israel and Hamas. In addition, Hamas failed to provide the agreed-upon list of hostages by midnight on Saturday, only submitting it on Sunday near midnight. Once the list was handed over to Israel, families were promptly updated. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry000glhdje	2025-01-27T04:28:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/12/23/BJf44Z3EPa/BJf44Z3EPa_181_87_2574_1449_0_small.jpg
Gaza hostages held in tunnels for over 8 months, were starved, ID...	They had little to no human contact and showed signs of 'mild starvation'; Hostages said their treatment improved in the days leading up to their release including more food and showers Some of the hostages released from Gaza so far during the current cease-fire had been held in Hamas tunnels for up to eight months straight, deprived of daylight and with little to no human contact, an Israeli general said on Monday. Three Israeli civilians and four soldiers - all women - have been released so far in the most recent cease-fire, which began on Jan. 19. In return, Israel has released 290 Palestinian terrorists and murderer, and detainees. 'Some of them told us that they've been in the past few months, that they've been through the entire time, in tunnels, underground,' deputy chief of the Israeli military's medical corps, Colonel Dr. Avi Banov, told journalists online. 'Some of them were alone through the entire time they were there,' he said. 'Those who said they were together were in better shape.' The Israeli military oversees the first health checks that the hostages receive upon their arrival in Israeli territory. Reuters was unable to reach Hamas' armed wing for comment but the terror group that perpetrated a massacre on southern Israel 15 months ago said on Saturday that it maintains hostages' wellbeing. The hostages said their treatment improved in the days leading up to their release, Banov said, when they were allowed to shower, change their clothes and received better food. They appeared to be in good condition and smiling in videos on the days of their release. Citing the hostages' privacy, Banov would not say whether any of the seven bore signs of torture or abuse. Some had not received proper treatment for wounds sustained when they were captured during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and some showed signs of 'mild starvation,' Banov said. The three civilians, released on the first day of the cease-fire, were discharged from hospital on Sunday. The four soldiers, freed in the cease-fire's second swap on Saturday, were still being treated in another medical center. Eitan Gonen, father of 24-year-old Romi Gonen who was released on Jan. 19, told Israel's public broadcaster Kan: 'Romi is amazing. We met a mature, amazing woman who stunned us all.' Gonen would not elaborate on her medical condition or details of her ordeal. But he said that while in captivity she had heard some of the radio interviews he had given. 'Even if only 10% of the interviews reach the hostages' ears, it is enough to give them strength,' he said. 'It gave her a lot of strength, energy and great hope.' More than 250 hostages were abducted in the Hamas attack in October 2023. Around half were released the following month during the war's only previous truce, and others have been recovered dead or alive during the fighting. Israel still lists 90 captives in Gaza, with around 30 declared dead in absentia. Twenty-six women, children, elderly, ill or injured hostages are still meant to be released in the six-week first phase of the cease-fire. Hamas provided a list late on Sunday detailing their condition, at least eight of them reportedly are dead. Israeli authorities have said that they believe most due to be released in the first phase are alive and they fear for the lives of the rest. They have given no new details since receiving the list. Banov said he expected that some of next hostages 'will be more ill and also people who have died during their time in Gaza.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skkogzsd1x	2025-01-27T04:14:03-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/ryrLroMOyl/ryrLroMOyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Seventh day of Operation Iron Wall in the West Bank: According to reports, the car hit by IDF aircraft fire carried al-Qassam Brigades Tulkarm commander Ihab Abu Atiwa; Earlier, a fatality was also reported from IDF fire near Qalandiya In a targeted counter-terrorism operation in West Bank, an Israeli Air Force aircraft attacked a vehicle in the Nur a-Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm at noon on Monday. The strike was part of a joint operation by the IDF and Shin Bet, according to the military. The Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that al-Qassam Brigades Tulkarm commander Ihab Abu Atiwa, who was killed, was in the vehicle. Three other people were moderately and lightly injured and were evacuated to the government hospital in Tulkarm. Footage from the scene shows the vehicle engulfed in flames. Since the start of Operation Iron Wall at the beginning of last week, two commanders of the Al-Qassam Brigades in the camp have been reported killed, including Abu Atiwa, as well as the commander of the Jenin Brigade affiliated with Islamic Jihad. Earlier Monday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health announced one man was dead and two moderately injured as a result of IDF gunfire near the Qalandiya camp. At the same time, the IDF's Iron Wall operation in Jenin continued, and the Palestinians published footage of terrorist houses that were set on fire or destroyed as a result of the forces' activities. This is the seventh day of the IDF and Central Command operation in the Jenin refugee camp and surrounding villages, and so far 16 people have been killed and about 50 injured. According to the IDF, the forces have destroyed about 20 IEDs and dozens of pipe bombs, including using D9 engineering tools that exposed axes around the camp.

IDF reservists arrested for spying for Iran: 'Very sensitive info...	Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev are suspected of contact with a foreign agent, passing classified information, and aiding the enemy in war; Eliasfov admitted that he sent his Iranian handler a video he recorded of the Iron Dome system, saying 'I got into a difficult financial situation'; they were first asked to spray pro-Iranian graffiti in Tel Aviv Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev, 21-year-old IDF reserve soldiers from the Kiryat Shmona area, are at the center of another Iranian espionage case. A prosecutor's statement has been filed against the two in preparation for an indictment for contact with a foreign agent, passing classified information to a foreign entity, and aiding the enemy in wartime, the Rishon LeZion Magistrate Yuval Kedar allowed to be made public, despite the opposition of the defense attorneys who requested that the names of the two remain confidential at this stage. Their detention will be extended until Friday for the filing of an indictment in the Haifa District Court. Eliasfov is the main suspect and, according to the investigation, as part of his job search, he contacted an Iranian operator on social media. To begin with, he sprayed graffiti in Tel Aviv, after his handler asked him to spray the inscription 'Children of Ruhollah' - the first leader of Iran after the Islamic Revolution. He recruited his friend Andreyev, by convincing him that it was easy money. At one point, they exchanged Israeli media articles about Iranian espionage over the past year, including one about the previous spy who was caught. They talked about the possible punishments, and Andreyev - who was serving as a reservist in the Kirya defense department headquarters at the time - got scared and stopped cooperating. Eliasfov began his career as a spy as a soldier in regular service and continued in the reserves. He served in Iron Dome, and was exposed to classified information. At the request of his handlers, he filmed and transmitted a video of the system, which contains information at the highest classification level. By the time he was caught, Eliasfov had managed to receive $2,500, while Andreyev only $50. Both admitted to the accusations during the interrogations, and talked about the tasks they were assigned, the information they passed on, and the payments they received.

Identity of the new Germany in question as far-right AfD party ga...	Concerns about Holocaust trivialization and nationalist policies underscore the growing anxiety over the influence of the far-right party, which evolved into a powerful political force and recently won the endorsement of Elon Musk Strong relations with Israel and a commitment to commemorating the Holocaust have been central tenets in Germany’s identity since the end of the Nazi regime, and especially since German reunification. But the identity of the new Germany now seems to be in question, as the far-right Alternative for Germany party, known by its German-language initials AfD, is polling over 20% leading up to the federal election on February 23. The AfD was founded in 2013 as a movement critical of the European Union. In the years since, it’s evolved into a powerful political force, blending anti-immigration rhetoric with nationalist policies. Following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-party government last November, the AfD has capitalized on discontent over Germany’s open borders and economic policies, drawing voters disillusioned with traditional conservative parties. The far-right party has been in second place in the most recent polls for the general elections, raising concerns among Jews in Germany and abroad. The party has expressed strong support for Israel, especially following the October 7 attacks, but party leaders have also been accused of trivializing Holocaust history. Some are concerned that relations with Israel and the German Jewish community could be affected even if the party doesn’t have enough popular support to win the chancellorship. With the federal elections getting closer, the rise of the AfD forces a critical question: Under a party pushing such divisive rhetoric, could Germany remain a modern democracy rooted in historical responsibility? In December 2024, Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, publicly endorsed the party, stating on his social media platform X that 'only the AfD can save Germany.' He further supported the party by authoring an op-ed in Die Welt, criticizing traditional parties and advocating for the AfD’s platform. In January 2025, Musk hosted a livestream with AfD leader Alice Weidel, discussing various topics and bolstering the party’s visibility. Later that month, he made a virtual appearance at an AfD campaign rally in Halle, addressing 4,500 attendees and emphasizing the importance of preserving German culture while moving beyond past guilt associated with the Nazi era. Musk’s involvement has been met with significant criticism from German political figures, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who condemned his actions as interference in Germany’s democratic process. Additionally, during President Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration, Musk faced backlash for making a gesture resembling a Nazi salute, which he dismissed as an overreaction. Emmanuel Navon, an international relations lecturer at Tel Aviv University and senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, attributed the AfD’s appeal to the disillusionment of traditional conservative voters in Germany. 'Angela Merkel’s policies on immigration and the economy alienated segments of the electorate who now find refuge in the AfD,' according to Navon. The AfD has capitalized on fears of immigration and the erosion of national identity, he said, themes that resonate deeply in many European nations facing similar political shifts. Similarly, Carsten Ovens, executive director of a German organization devoted to promoting relations between Israel and European countries, said that the AfD’s growth is part of a broader trend of polarization in Germany exacerbated by economic crises and societal transformations. 'Since the reunification of Germany, the eastern regions have faced rapid systemic changes,' Ovens, a former member of the Hamburg state Parliament, said, pointing to the financial crisis of 2008 and the 2015 refugee crisis as critical junctures increasing polarization. This polarization, Ovens said, has nurtured extremism on both ends of the political spectrum. 'While the AfD’s strength is particularly pronounced in the east, it has become a nationwide problem,' he said. 'The AfD at its core is a racist and antisemitic party and a threat to Jewish life in Germany and abroad.' Indeed, the AfD’s growth has sparked anxiety within Germany’s Jewish community. While most antisemitic violence in Europe today stems from far-left and Islamist groups, the AfD’s rhetoric concerning Germany’s Nazi past has drawn sharp criticism from Jewish groups. Alexander Gauland, the party’s honorary chairman, infamously referred to the Holocaust as merely 'a speck of bird poop in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.' Ovens said that the party’s historical revisionism alienates Jewish communities both domestically and internationally. 'A party that trivializes the Holocaust cannot be a partner for Jewish life in Germany or Israel,' he said. Should the AfD gain more influence, its foreign policy could strain Germany’s traditional role as a mediator in the Middle East and undermine Western cohesion Andreas Friedrich Horst, spokesperson for leading AfD member Beatrix von Storch, squarely rejected the claim that AfD leaders had made antisemitic remarks. He said that leftists had 'wrongly and maliciously' accused AfD members of antisemitism in order to distract from antisemitism on the left. 'It is the left that compares the Holocaust with immigration restriction and the war in Gaza. For the AfD, Jewish life belongs to Germany and has to be protected, [and] Israel is the only Western democracy in the Middle East and an important ally in the fight against Islamic terrorism,' he said. Horst attributed the success of the AfD to the dissatisfaction of many Germans with open borders, the abandonment of nuclear and coal power, and 'gender ideology.' 'When I grew up, this was the agenda of the radical left. Today, it is the agenda of the political mainstream,' he said. 'Angela Merkel made it the official policy of the Christian Democrats. People are fed up with this, and they want to go back to normal. This is true not only in Germany but also in all Western countries. The roots for the success of the AfD are the same as for the success of Donald Trump.' According to Navon, some of the values celebrated by the AfD are also associated with Israel – namely, national pride, security, and economic success. He said that many on the far right also see Israel as a 'bastion against radical Islam.' Similarly, Ovens said that the AfD often uses a pro-Israel stance 'as a fig leaf to obscure its Islamophobia.' After the attacks of October 7, 2023, honorary AfD chair Gauland said that 'The attack was not only aimed at the Jewish state, it was also aimed at us. Israel is the West in an environment that rejects and fights the West. When we stand with Israel, we are also defending our way of life.' But in October 2024, Tino Chrupalla, one of the AfD’s co-chairs, called for an end to arms deliveries to Israel. 'This highlights the party’s hypocrisy,' Ovens says. 'It is easy to express support when it costs nothing, but their actions tell a different story.' Furthermore, the AfD, like other far-right European parties, often supports Russia, Navon said. 'This is problematic for Israel because of Russia’s alignment with Iran and its efforts to undermine US-led global order in tandem with China,' he said. 'Such alliances are contrary to Israel’s strategic interests.' Should the AfD gain more influence, its foreign policy could strain Germany’s traditional role as a mediator in the Middle East and undermine Western cohesion, Navon said. Defending the AfD point of view, Andreas said that the prime ministers of Israel and Russia have built up a strong relationship and that Israel has refused to sanction Russia. 'If we want to stop the Iranian nuclear program, it is much better to look for diplomatic support in Moscow then to make Russia an enemy,' he said. Both Ovens and Navon said that the rise of the AfD is unlikely to disrupt official ties between Israel and Germany, two countries that have cultivated a unique relationship rooted in shared values and historical responsibility. 'The broad majority of German political parties support the partnership with Israel,' Ovens said. But he warned that the AfD’s influence on public discourse could have indirect effects.

'We need a new immigration policy, new energy policy, investment in our rotten infrastructure, stopping spending money for migration, climate, gender and other ideological nonsense, and reducing the tax burden on companies and citizens,' he said.

Reservists arrested on suspicion of spying for Iran	Yuri Eliasfov and Georgi Andreyev, 21-year-old IDF reserve soldiers from the north of the country, are suspected of contact with a foreign agent, passing classified information to a foreign entity and aiding the enemy in the war - as part of another Iranian espionage case, the Rishon LeZion Magistrate's Court announced on Monday. Eliasfov is the main suspect, and according to the investigation, as part of a job search, he made contact with an Iranian operator on social media. Eliasfov started spying as a regular soldier and continued in the reserves, and later recruited Andreyev. He served in the Iron Dome unit, and was exposed to classified information. At the request of his operators, he filmed and transmitted a video about the system, which includes information at the highest classification level. By the time he was caught, Eliasfov had managed to receive $2,500, and Andreyev only $50.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1i001yhdjl	2025-01-27T01:30:29-08:00	
Even Trump couldn't force us to emigrate': Hundreds of thousands...	Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians return to northern Gaza after months of displacement, with 650,000 expected to make their way back through the Netzarm Corridor despite destroyed homes and ongoing challenges; Masked men waving Hamas and Islamic Jihad flags welcomed them Following the IDF's reopening of the Netzarim Corridor Monday after an agreement was reached for Arbel Yehoud to be returned on Thursday, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have begun returning to northern Gaza, with reports estimating around 650,000 people making their way back after months of displacement. The displacement followed Israeli evacuation orders and military activities in the region during the war. Palestinians were forced to live in temporary tent camps, but with the corridor reopened many are now heading back to their destroyed homes. While the Israeli military warned against the transfer of weapons or terrorists to the north, enforcement efforts have varied. Vehicles traveling through Salah al-Din Street are being inspected by an American company, while those walking along al-Rashid Street near the coast face no screening. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have taken advantage of the return for propaganda purposes. Masked terrorists with headbands bearing their organizations' insignias greeted returning residents, shaking hands with some and waving to others. In one widely shared photograph, a man holding a child stands beside a Hamas terrorist, both making victory signs for the cameras. Welcome banners were also posted on the remaining structures in the area. Tens of thousands of Palestinians had waited for two days at checkpoints, hoping to return to their homes. Many slept on the streets after Israel delayed reopening the corridor due to unresolved issues regarding Arbel Yehoud’s release. This morning, with the matter resolved, masses of people began their journey north. Ismail Abu Matar, a father of four, described the scene as 'a sea of people' moving northward. He and his family waited three days to return to their home in Gaza City. 'These were three days of hell. We feared the cease-fire would collapse, and we wouldn’t be able to return,' he said. Another Palestinian, who walked from Deir al-Balah to the north, said, 'Two months ago, I cried in the shameful tent camps, and today I’m returning to my family and my people, back home. I will rebuild my house from the ruins. Without the resilience of the people in the north, we wouldn’t have seen this day.' One man declared, 'We will die here; we will not uproot ourselves again. Even Trump couldn’t force us to emigrate. I’m happy to be back and will never leave again.' A man who returned to Gaza City after over a year expressed his relief, saying, 'We’ve been waiting for this moment for a year and four months. Today, I’d rather die than uproot myself again.' Another Palestinian from the Zaytoun neighborhood added, 'I’ve been sleeping in the street for five days, waiting to return. I regret the moment we left. It would have been better to die in my house. We were humiliated.'

'Now I will walk about five kilometers to reunite with my family in the north. I’ve been waiting for this moment,' he said. Hamas released a statement declaring, 'The return of the displaced is a victory for our people and a declaration of the failure and defeat of the occupation and its plans for displacement. The sight of the massive crowds of our people returning to the areas they were forced to flee, despite the destruction of their homes, confirms the greatness of our people and their steadfastness in their land despite the pain and tragedy.' Islamic Jihad issued its own statement, saying, 'In a legendary scene, hundreds of thousands of our displaced people are returning to northern Gaza, which Israel destroyed.

Lebanese army spills 'sensitive information' to Hezbollah during ...	Lebanese military intelligence leaked sensitive information to Hezbollah during a fragile cease-fire with Israel, Britain's The Times reports; The leaks exposed Hezbollah's ties to the Lebanese army, raising concerns about its ability to control southern Lebanon effectively The head of military intelligence in southern Lebanon, Suhil Bahij Gharb, leaked secrets to Hezbollah during the cease-fire agreement with Israel, the British newspaper, The Times, reported on Monday. The report stated that 'sensitive information' was leaked to the terrorist organization from a security control room managed by the United States, France, and the UN peacekeeping force (UNIFIL). The Times indicated that the information passed by Gharb to Hezbollah jeopardized the cease-fire, which was achieved after more than a year of efforts. According to an international intelligence report obtained by the newspaper, Gharb is just one of dozens of officers in the Lebanese army who leaked information to Hezbollah terrorists, warning them of planned raids or patrols. These leaks allowed Hezbollah to hide weapons and evade exposure. According to an intelligence document obtained by The Times, 'Hezbollah is using internal and sensitive information regarding the Lebanese army to conceal its operations from international bodies tasked with regional security.' The document also raised concerns about the Lebanese army's ability to effectively control southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah has been building its military and political power for years. Israeli security officials stated that, while the Lebanese army 'does its job' and has confiscated some weapon stockpiles in areas vacated by Israeli forces, the leaks from its officers enabled Hezbollah terrorists and their weapons to remain near the Israeli border. Gharb, a Shiite Muslim residing in southern Lebanon, was present in the international operations room due to the insistence of Wafiq Safa, a senior Hezbollah commander who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in Beirut last October. In an interview with The Times, Hilal Khashan, a professor of political science at the American University of Beirut, noted that Hezbollah’s survival does not depend on maintaining a military presence in southern Lebanon but rather on preserving the political power it has accumulated in recent years. He also pointed out that, as Israel has previously stated, given that Hezbollah terrorists in the southern region are essentially Shiite residents of villages near the border, completely eliminating the presence of the terrorist organization south of the Litani River would be challenging.

The U.S. announcement came as the IDF had not yet withdrawn from southern Lebanon, and in the shadow of the riots there Sunday, in which crowds of Lebanese people rioted, most acting on behalf of Hezbollah, causing disturbances. IDF troops fired warning shots at many of them, and according to data from the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 22 people were killed. The White House’s announcement, which implies the IDF will be required to withdraw from Lebanon in about three weeks, also mentioned that Israel and the U.S. will begin negotiations to return Lebanese terrorists captured during IDF’s ground operations in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese prime minister confirmed that his country would comply with the extended cease-fire and added that Beirut had submitted the request for the release of Lebanese detainees captured by Israeli troops. The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which serves as a mouthpiece for Hezbollah, reported this morning that 'the Lebanese army has begun redeploying in Aitaroun, Mis al-Jabal, and Houla' in southern Lebanon. Earlier, the newspaper reported that Hezbollah rejects the agreements reached between Israel, Lebanon, and the U.S. Official sources told the newspaper that the terrorist organization is unwilling to enter any new negotiations and that the mediators must compel 'the enemy' to implement the agreement. According to Al-Akhbar, 'What was yesterday will continue today with the masses. The people will not wait for approval. What happens today could be a turning point in the confrontation.

Iran-backed militias in crisis as Middle East alliances unravel	Tehran faces mounting challenges as its proxy strategies collapse, domestic discontent rises, and new regional alliances threaten its influence The Islamic Republic of Iran, long reliant on a network of proxy groups to exert influence across the Middle East, faces significant challenges as its strategy falters. Years of investment in allies such as Hezbollah, Hamas and other factions in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria are unraveling, leaving Tehran grappling with diminishing regional authority and rising domestic discontent. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran today is very different from what we knew six or seven months ago,' according to David Menashri, a professor at the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies. 'It has lost its proxies. All these years of investment in groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have nearly collapsed. Iran’s regional prestige and power are diminished.' Tehran has responded by intensifying its propaganda, including publishing a video of a naval underground arsenal just days before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Propaganda as tool of survival Iran’s propaganda machine, though longstanding, now reflects the severity of its crisis. The video, showcasing advanced missile systems purportedly capable of targeting U.S. aircraft carriers, is part of Tehran’s efforts to project defiance. 'The regime is trying to compensate for its weaknesses by using extensive propaganda to suggest that everything is normal. It’s not,' Menashri observed. 'This messaging aims to reassure the Iranian people and signal to the world that Iran remains a formidable power.' But these efforts fail to obscure the regime’s struggles. 'These maneuvers are more about external messaging to opponents like the US and Israel, showing that Iran is not an easy target,' said Nima Baheli, an Iranian political analyst. Economic Struggles and the search for alliances Iran’s economy, battered by years of sanctions and mismanagement, is nearing collapse. The regime’s allocation of billions to support its proxies has fueled public anger at home. 'The Iranian people see a government that cannot prioritize its economy,' Menashri noted. Seeking relief, Tehran is attempting to rebuild international ties. 'Iran needs agreements with the United States to alleviate sanctions and stabilize its domestic situation,' Baheli explained. He added that Elon Musk’s involvement in Trump’s administration could open new channels for dialogue. 'It’s unclear whether Musk’s actions reflect personal initiatives or coordinated policies, but his business-oriented mindset could facilitate negotiations.' Menashri recalled past diplomatic efforts. 'For four years, Joe Biden’s administration negotiated with Tehran. They even scheduled a meeting for October 9, 2023, which was postponed due to the ongoing war. Both sides have shown interest in dialogue,' he said. Nuclear ambitions and strategic calculations As its proxy strategy falters, Iran’s nuclear program has taken center stage, raising concerns in Washington and Jerusalem. 'Israel cannot act alone against Iranian nuclear sites; it needs US support,' Baheli said. 'Trump appears to favor diplomacy over military action, but Israel’s moves are closely tied to US policy.' 'Israel will follow Trump’s lead on this. Neither the States or Israel want a nuclear Iran, but each is hoping that the other would eventually do this dirty work,' Menashri added. Shifting Alliances and the ‘Cotton Road’ Amid Tehran’s challenges, Trump’s 'Cotton Road' initiative seeks to isolate Iran further. The project envisions stronger economic ties between Saudi Arabia, India, and other key players, sidelining adversaries like Iran and potentially Turkey. 'The Cotton Road aims to create an alliance that excludes Iran,' Baheli explained. However, Saudi Arabia’s participation hinges on progress toward resolving the Palestinian issue. 'The Saudis need at least a symbolic gesture toward a solution for the Palestinian cause,' Menashri said. The complex web of alliances illustrates how the Palestinian issue remains a linchpin in regional diplomacy. > This underscores how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains pivotal in regional diplomacy. 'The recent Gaza truce was strategically timed to affect Biden’s position and freeze the issue before Trump’s formal takeover,' according to Baheli. Menashri noted Trump’s complex approach. 'He pushes for Saudi-Israeli normalization while permitting settlement expansions. He wants to detach militarily from the region but has been more involved than before. We’ll have to wait to see his true intentions,' he said. A regime under pressure Iran’s trajectory reflects a mix of military setbacks, economic hardships, and waning influence. While its propaganda portrays resilience, the reality is of a regime struggling to adapt to evolving geopolitical dynamics. 'The region is in flux, with key developments hinging on new US policies, Iranian actions, and shifting alliances,' Baheli concluded. Menashri added, 'Iran’s internal and external challenges are interconnected. Resolving them will require a strategic shift — one the regime seems unprepared to make.'

Cease-fire extended in north: IDF to remain in Lebanon for anothe...	Following day of riots and the deaths of 22 Lebanese civilians by military gunfire, the White House announced the IDF would have 3 more weeks to withdraw, extending the agreement until February 18; Hezbollah rejects this; Israel, Lebanon and the U.S. will begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese who were arrested during the ground operation, including Hezbollah terrorists The cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon has been extended until February 18,the White House announced on Sunday night, minutes before midnight. The U.S. announcement came as the IDF had not yet withdrawn from southern Lebanon, and in the shadow of the riots there Sunday, in which crowds of Lebanese people rioted, most of them at the behest of Hezbollah. The IDF fired at them from a distance and, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 22 people were killed. According to the White House announcement, which states that the IDF will be required to withdraw from Lebanon in only about three weeks, Israel and the U.S. will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese terrorists captured during the IDF's ground operations in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese prime minister confirmed that his country would abide by the extended cease-fire, adding that he had forwarded the request for the release of the Lebanese detained by the IDF to Beirut. However, the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which serves as Hezbollah's mouthpiece, reported Monday that the terrorist organization rejects the agreements reached by Israel, Lebanon and the U.S. Official sources told the newspaper that Hezbollah is not willing to enter into any new negotiations, and that the mediators must force the 'enemy' to implement the agreement. 'What happened yesterday will continue today with additional displaced people,' it said. 'The people will not wait for approval. This could be a turning point in the conflict, and more people could die today. The people's decision is to continue.' It also said that the incidents captured on video Sunday 'confirm' the need for Hezbollah south of the Litani, as the U.S. 'does not want the Lebanese army to hold the south - otherwise it would put pressure on the enemy.'' Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, also addressed the extension of the cease-fire Sunday night. 'We announced the extension of the cease-fire. The Israeli government was wonderful. They are a wonderful partner. They did a pretty good job in Lebanon.' An Israeli political source said, 'We are in constant dialogue with the Americans, and we explain to them the security importance to Israel of Lebanon's full implementation of the agreement.' Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel 'will continue to firmly enforce the cease-fires in the north and south. Anyone who violates the rules or threatens IDF forces will pay the full price. We will not allow a return to the reality of October 7.' The cease-fire in southern Lebanon effectively ended on the night between Saturday and Sunday, without the IDF withdrawing from all areas. Still, in recent days, residents of southern Lebanon began to move en masse, in vehicles and on foot, toward the border villages and also to those from which the IDF had not yet fully withdrawn, precisely on the date on which the deadline was set. Within a short time, the clashes also began. Despite calls and warnings from the Lebanese army - which is supposed to implement the cease-fire agreement in the south of the country and demonstrate control over the area - residents of southern Lebanon crossed the army's checkpoints Sunday morning with almost no resistance. The Lebanese army placed fences at the entrances to several border towns to prevent the residents from passing, but they trampled the fence and passed without any interference. The bigger problem that the residents encountered, according to publications in Lebanon, were the IDF's embankments that blocked several roads, but the residents also crossed these. The Lebanese army, which failed to block residents of southern Lebanon from reaching the villages, changed its tone Sunday. Instead of requesting that they not approach the villages, it reported that 'army units are escorting residents' entry into the towns, in light of the Israeli enemy's insistence on violating Lebanon's sovereignty, its attacks against civilians, which have resulted in deaths and injuries, and its refusal to abide by the cease-fire and withdraw from the Lebanese territories it has occupied.' The army command also renewed its call for citizens 'to exercise restraint and act according to the instructions of the military units.' Hezbollah praised in an official statement the Lebanese who tried to return to their villages, despite the IDF's announcement that for now it would not completely withdraw from southern Lebanon. 'This is a glorious day. The great resistance has proven once again that they are a people rooted in their land and clinging to every grain of soil. The sights of the returnees to the villages, with the flags of the dead and the flags of Hezbollah, embody the highest meanings of steadfastness and victory. This confirms that this people, in its steadfastness, is the most powerful weapon of the resistance,' the terrorist organization said. 'The international community, led by the countries sponsoring the agreement, must take responsibility for the violations and crimes of the Israeli enemy and force it to withdraw from our lands.' The IDF emphasized Sunday that the army continues to operate in southern Lebanon in accordance with the directives of the political echelon and within the framework of the cease-fire agreement between the parties. IDF forces, the army said, are deployed in several areas while maintaining frontal defense and preventing the return of enemy elements or civilians beyond the agreed line. > A military source said Sunday that IDF forces responded with dispersal gunfire to riots in the southern villages in order to remove threats and prevent anyone from approaching the border fence area. During the operation, several suspects who approached the forces and posed a real threat were arrested, and they were taken for questioning in the field. The IDF confirmed reports that a Lebanese army soldier was injured. 'According to the agreement, the withdrawal of forces does not have to take place at the end of the 60 days, and the discussion about extending the period and the temporary location of the forces is taking place between the political echelon, the US and Lebanon,' the military source clarified. The Lebanese army, the IDF said, also did not sufficiently 'clean up' the areas controlled by Hezbollah, mainly in the eastern sector. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rka00zjv001x	2025-01-26T21:24:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/SJblpCQukg/SJblpCQukg_0_148_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Netzarim Corridor opens, crowds of Gazans move north	After release of Arbel Yehoud arranged and list of hostages' statuses handed over by Hamas, displaced Gazans were allowed to start moving to northern Gaza; IDF warns 'entry of armed men or transfer of weapons prohibited, violates agreement' After the crisis that threatened the continuation of the hostage deal was resolved , the IDF opened the Netzarim route at 7:00 a.m. on Monday morning, allowing masses of displaced Palestinians to begin to cross and return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip. The crossing was supposed to open on Saturday, but Israel decided to keep it closed until the release of Arbel Yehoud , a civilian woman who was supposed to be freed in the second release of the hostage deal on Saturday, was arranged. Hamas did not honor the agreement and released the IDF observers Karina Ariev, Naama Levy, Daniella Gilboa and Liri Albag, leading Israel to postpone the opening of the crossing. The IDF spokesman in Arabic, Lieutenant Colonel Avichai Adraee, informed residents of the Gaza Strip Sunday night that their passage to the northern Strip on foot would be allowed starting at 7:00 a.m., via a-Rashid Street, known as the sea route. Adraee announced that 'vehicles will be allowed to move to the northern Strip via the Salah a-Din Road after inspection (from 9:00 a.m.). The entry of armed men or the transfer of weapons to the northern Strip will be considered a violation of the agreement.' He added: 'It is prohibited to approach the Rafah Crossing area or the Philadelphi Corridor, it is prohibited to swim in the maritime area, and it is prohibited to approach Israeli territory or the buffer zone.' The Gaza Interior Ministry issued instructions to residents Sunday morning, saying that vehicles will be able to enter Salah a-Din Street starting at 9:00 a.m. 'However, the entry of vehicles will not begin until after contact has been made with the Egyptian security authorities,' it said. Regarding al-Rashid Street, 'Israel will not accept any attempt to pass a vehicle, truck, tuk-tuk or donkey-drawn cart through the street without inspection, and it may shoot at the vehicle on the grounds that it is carrying a weapon. Therefore, do not violate the instructions. There is a complete ban on transportation on the street and everyone must adhere to the instructions.' The vehicle crossing on Salah ad-Din Street in Netzarim will be secured by an American company, whose purpose is to prevent the return of armed men and weapons in cars. The company includes about 100 armed security personnel, most of whom are Americans and some of whom speak Arabic. The security personnel are veterans of elite units or former CIA personnel. The crisis that was resolved with the release of 6 hostages Starting on Saturday, crowds of Gazans gathered near the closed Netzarim Corridor, and since Sunday night, Palestinian media have released footage from the Gaza Strip, showing thousands of Gazans waiting on the sides of the a-Rashid highway, which is a main crossing from the south to the north of the Gaza Strip. Many Gazans even stayed overnight near the axis, hoping that the crossing would open early in the morning, but it remained closed. At the same time, the Palestinians reported that four Gazans were injured by IDF gunfire in the Nuseirat area, where displaced people were waiting to return to the northern Gaza Strip. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim addressed this, claiming in an interview with the Qatari channel Al Araby that 'Israel's preventing the return of displaced people to the north is a clear violation of the cease-fire agreement.' According to him, 'Israel is delaying and delaying, even though we have sent confirmation that the hostage Arbel Yahoud is alive. We demand that the mediators put pressure on Israel and force it to allow the return of the displaced people. Direct contacts are taking place with the mediators in order to find a solution and open the Netzarim Corridor.' The crisis in implementing the agreement, came to an end Sunday night when Qatar, followed by the Prime Minister's Office, announced the two rounds of hostage releases expected to take place this week, which include the release of six hostages. Israel announced that an agreement had been reached under which Arbel Yehoud would be released on Thursday, along with IDF lookout Agam Berger and another hostage - and that three additional men would be released alive on Saturday. Israel estimates that the hostage to be released on Thursday is American-Israeli Keith Siegel. Hamas also submitted the list containing the status of the hostages who are to be released in phase one of the deal, which it had also been supposed to submit on Saturday. > The Prime Minister's Office announced Sunday night that 'Following the conducting of vigorous and determined negotiations led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hamas has backtracked and will carry out an additional phase of releasing hostages this Thursday. In this phase, the civilian Arbel Yehud, the soldier Agam Berger and an additional hostage will be released.' The statement added that, 'in parallel, Israel has received from Hamas a list that includes the status of all of the hostages due to be released in the first stage. Under these agreements, Israel will – from tomorrow morning – allow the passage of Gazans to the northern Strip. The Prime Minister reiterates that Israel will not tolerate any violation of the agreement. We will continue to act for the return of all of our hostages, the living and the deceased.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sykmocnuyx	2025-01-26T20:56:16-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/B10OPpXO1e/B10OPpXO1e_0_233_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

In an unusual announcement, the Prime Minister's Office reported that the Minister of Diaspora Affairs was forced to cancel a planned visit to the European Parliament 'in light of concrete warnings, and according to the guidance of security officials'; The concern that led to the decision was not disclosed In an unusual announcement, the Prime Minister's Office reported that Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli was required to cancel his trip to Brussels 'in light of concrete warnings, and in accordance with the guidance of security officials.' The Prime Minister's Office did not disclose the specific suspicion that led to the dramatic decision to prevent Chikli from flying to an event at the European Parliament in the Belgian capital, where he was also expected to meet with the city's Jewish community. 'I regretted receiving instructions from security officials this evening to cancel my participation in the International Holocaust Remembrance Day events at the European Parliament. Unfortunately, the capital of Europe has become an unsafe place for Jews and Israelis,' Chikli said Sunday night. However, the Hind Rajab Foundation, which repeatedly files complaints against IDF soldiers around the world, claimed that Chikli avoided the visit because he was 'evading prosecution.' A post on the X platform published by the foundation read: 'The minister who threatened HRF chairman Dyab Aboujahjah canceled a visit to Brussels, citing 'security concerns.' We are convinced that this decision has more to do with avoiding justice and legal action. The Hind Rajab Foundation will continue its efforts to End Impunity.' Recently, the foundation has targeted soldiers and filed counter-complaints claiming that 'crimes against humanity' were committed in the war in Gaza. Two weeks ago, the same pro-Palestinian organization made its first attempt to arrest an IDF general, when it submitted a request to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for the arrest of Major General Ghassan Alian, the coordinator of government activities in the territories (COGAT).

Nor is anyone known to have threatened to file a lawsuit against the minister, since he is not a commander in the army and there is no arrest warrant against him from The Hague - unlike Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. In addition, a lawsuit filed in Belgium against the IDF attaché did not progress due to his immunity. The chairman of the European Jewish Organizations Association (EJA), Rabbi Menachem Margolin, said in response: 'The fact that even today, 80 years after the Holocaust, an Israeli minister is forced to cancel a visit to a Western country for security reasons indicates more than anything that all the leaders' 'Never Again' declarations are empty of serious commitment. This year's International Holocaust Remembrance Day will be the saddest since the Holocaust.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1jjcevojx	2025-01-26T14:22:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/28/Bk3rjX03xke/Bk3rjX03xke_0_114_1280_720_0_small.jpg
Agreement reached: Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger and 4 other hostages...	Qatari mediators announced that civilian Arbel Yehoud, soldier Agam Berger and one other hostage will be released Thursday, with three additional hostages freed Saturday; Hamas has provided status updates on 26 hostages to be released in first stage, as soon as Monday morning Israel will open Netzarim Corridor, allowing displaced to return to northern Gaza The crisis that threatened the hostage deal has been resolved. According to Qatari mediators, understandings have been reached between the parties stipulating that civilian Arbel Yehoud, lookout Agam Berger and one other hostage will be released on Thursday, followed by the release of three additional hostages on Saturday. Additionally, Hamas has provided a list detailing the condition of the 26 hostages who are supposed to be released during the first stage of the deal, as it committed to in the agreement. In return, Israel will open the Netzarim Corridor starting on Monday morning, allowing displaced Gazans to return to northern Gaza, the Prime Minister's Office announced. 'Israel has received from Hamas a list that includes the status of all of the hostages due to be released in the first stage. Under these agreements, Israel will – from tomorrow morning – allow the passage of Gazans to the northern Strip,' according to the statement. 'The Prime Minister reiterates that Israel will not tolerate any violation of the agreement. We will continue to act for the return of all of our hostages, the living and the deceased,' the statement concluded. A statement by Majed Al-Ansari, spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noted that 'Israel will provide, every Sunday during the first phase of the deal, a list of 400 Gazans who have been detained since October 7.' Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, on Sunday night said he was pleased about the resolution of the crisis between Israel and Hamas. 'It's wonderful, I spoke to the president about it. He was happy,' he said. 'Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani did an amazing job. I thank the Israeli government and those who were involved. It's a good day for the hostages.' Islamic Jihad had previously announced that an agreement had been reached to secure the release of Arbel Yehoud – who was initially supposed to be included in the second phase of the deal but was kept in captivity by Hamas in violation of the agreement. However, Israel denied this claim. Israel believed that internal disputes within Gaza – particularly between Islamic Jihad and the Resistance Committees, including disagreements over credit – were causing Islamic Jihad to complicate her release. During negotiations, Islamic Jihad claimed Arbel was a soldier and demanded the release of 30 prisoners serving life sentences in exchange. Israel strongly objected, and it was reportedly agreed that she would be classified as a civilian, not a soldier, for the purposes of the deal. The dispute also revolved around the timing of her release, with Israel insisting that she be freed by Wednesday. Arbel is not held solely by Islamic Jihad but — according to their own statements – also by the Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades, which is the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees, considered the third-largest terrorist organization in Gaza. The group has a jihadist-Salafist ideological orientation, and its operatives participated in the abduction of Gilad Shalit alongside Hamas operatives in June of 2006. The organization was also responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Eliyahu Asheri on the same day. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Over the years, the organization has carried out numerous attacks, including bombings in Gaza targeting both military and civilian locations before the implementation of the Disengagement Plan, as well as attacks inside Israel. The group has claimed responsibility for launching rockets at Israel during several rounds of escalation. Over time, Israel has eliminated several of its leaders, the most recent being Raafat Abu al-Halal, whose killing in Rafah was announced by IDF on October 19, 2023. On October 7, the terrorist organization participated in the massacre and also abducted Ohad Yahalomi, who is still being held in Gaza and is expected to be released as part of the first stage of the deal. His 13-year-old son, Eitan, was abducted along with his father but was released in the first deal conducted between Israel and Hamas in late 2023. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjujzee001g	2025-01-26T13:56:54-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/27/BykDGENdJx/BykDGENdJx_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Avraham Levine of the Alma Center says Israel and the U.S. aim to end the northern conflict, prioritizing the return of 65,000 displaced citizens over renewed fighting with Hezbollah Israel does not appear interested in resuming fighting with Hezbollah in the north, according to Avraham Levine, new media director for the Alma Center. He told ILTV that both Israel and U.S. President Donald Trump are seeking an end to the conflict in the north. The primary goal, he said, is to enable the return of the 65,000 northern residents who were displaced from their homes. 'It is not through more fighting and rockets and battles,' Levine said. 'The way to bring them back home is stability.'

She told ILTV that Israel 'has to do everything possible to ensure we bring back all the hostages.' 'That’s what we should do because that’s how we really win,' Hassan-Nahoum said. At the same time, she emphasized that Israel must reserve the right to resume military operations and finish the job, even if it takes a year or more.

Female IDF hostages weren't allowed to hold hands or cry | New de...	Families of the four liberated lookouts deliver a series of public statements, demanding the return of all hostages, accountability for the mistakes of October 7; Liri's father angrily called out government ministers who voted against the deal that brought his daughter home: 'I despise you' They weren’t allowed to hold hands or cry, but they found ways to support one another. A day after the emotional release of the four IDF lookouts from Hamas captivity – Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev, and Daniella Gilboa – new details emerged about their 477 days of suffering. Statements from their families at Rabin Medical Center, where the freed hostages are currently recovering, were broadcast live. Yoni Levy, Naama’s father, opened his statement by saying: 'For 15 months, I spoke to you many times. From the depths of my heart, I addressed decision-makers, the media, the people of Israel, and world leaders. I pleaded, as a father, trying to save his daughter from hell. This moment, standing here today, is the moment I prayed for, imagined, and hoped for during 477 days – not just for myself, but for all of us. On October 7, our country shattered into thousands of pieces, leaving families forever broken. That was the moment our personal lives were shaken, and we became known as ‘the family of Naama Levy, the abducted lookout.’' 'I am certain that the events at the Nahal Oz outpost will eventually be thoroughly examined through a state inquiry. Naama is now safe with us, surrounded by family and friends, but the fight is not over. There are still 90 hostages that we must bring home. They are our sons and daughters, the very foundation upon which our country is built. There will be no healing, no revival, until we know that the State of Israel is the father and mother of every one of us.' Orly Gilboa, Daniella’s mother, said: 'Our Daniella is home. How long I’ve waited to say that. How long I’ve waited for this moment, to give thanks that my Daniella has returned home and is now just meters away from me. My daughter came back thin and pale. She suffered in captivity, but she remains the same wonderful and talented girl she was before they took her. She hasn’t lost her spark of mischief or her pride as an Israeli, as you could see yesterday during the so-called ‘ceremony’ marking their release.' 'Daniella was abducted as Danielle. We added an extra vowel to her name on the advice of a rabbi during her captivity. She saw us at rallies, refusing to give up, and she knew we would do everything to bring her back alive.' 'This could have been any of our daughters left behind – someone’s beloved daughter who became part of this struggle, who became part of a true family we didn’t choose. We will not stop or give up until Agam is home – her and all the other hostages who must return by the end of this deal. Yesterday morning, I was still consumed by fear that the deal would fall apart, that Daniella wouldn’t come back to me. I ask and demand that the deal be fully implemented. Our new family, the family of the hostages, must receive everyone back. We owe it to them.' Eli Albag, Liri’s father, expressed gratitude for public support of the hostage deal but harshly criticized those in the government who opposed it: 'I’m emotional – Liri is back. Our Liri has returned. There are still 90 hostages: the Bibas family, Agam Berger, Arbel Yehoud. They should already be free. I thank the citizens of Israel – because of you, the hostages are starting to come home. We will not rest or stop until the last hostage is back. I want to tell Netanyahu and those who supported the deal: keep going until the end. To the opponents – this nation will hold you accountable. When you saw my daughter and the other three lookouts come out with proud smiles, where were you, those who voted against it? I despise you.' Sasha Ariev, Karina’s sister, said: 'We are so grateful that Karina is with us, but we cannot forget for a moment everyone we lost at Nahal Oz, everyone who isn’t with us today. She’s just beginning to process what she went through, but your support will help heal some of those wounds. We still have 90 brothers and sisters who are far from home. Karina knows how that feels and can’t stop thinking about them. 'We are still waiting for Agam, Arbel, Shiri and all our loved ones. We will not rest or stop until everyone is back. I want to give special thanks to President Trump. We are full of hope for the future and need your continued support to bring all our brothers and sisters home. And to you, dear Mr. Witkoff, you are a sensitive and special person – thank you for everything you’ve done. The spirit of our people is what gives us the strength to continue.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: At the end of the statements, all the families formed heart shapes with their hands, imitating the gesture Liri made from the window of an IDF helicopter after her release. Details from Captivity Naama Levy was held alone for a long period before being reunited with her friends. When she saw them, she asked if it was real and if they were alive. The four young women tried to pass the time by exercising and staying active, despite the harsh conditions and limited food. Their captors did not allow them to hold hands or cry, but they found ways to support one another. Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev were held together most of the time, and their bond – formed at their base before the abduction – grew even stronger. Just as the families of the lookouts supported one another through the ordeal, so did the young women themselves. At the Rabin Medical Center ward where they are staying, there are many shared spaces, and they spend time together, supporting each other and meeting the families and friends they spoke about while in captivity. Daniella didn’t hear Eden Ben Zaken’s song dedicated to her while in captivity, but she was deeply moved when it was played for her for the first time. For now, the four freed women are being updated on everything that happened in the last 15 months, and they are also sharing their experiences. The family of Agam Berger – the lookout who was abducted with them and remains in captivity in Gaza – visited the hospital this evening and met with the now-liberated lookouts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rycxegvdye	2025-01-26T13:00:25-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/SkMlyc9fuJx/SkMlyc9fuJx_0_0_1600_1048_0_small.jpg

What is the health status of the observer soldiers who were relea...	Ariella Lahyani: 'You can see these same girls on the day they were abducted. You see them covered in blood, injured, crying, terrified' The four observer soldiers released over the weekend are reportedly in stable condition, according to the director of Beilinson Hospital, where they were taken. However, as ILTV correspondent Ariella Lahyani noted, 'It is far too soon for the public to truly know what their condition is or to understand what their recovery will look like.' Following their release on Saturday, some pro-Hamas and anti-Israel activists claimed that the young women were not malnourished. While they appeared smiling and waving, it is critical to remember that such appearances are part of Hamas’s propaganda strategy. 'Hamas had the hostages on a literal stage for the whole world to see, and Hamas understood that what the world saw would be a reflection of how they’ve been treating the hostages for nearly 16 months,' Lahyani stated. 'So, yesterday was by no means an accurate presentation or indication of how the hostages are being treated. And all you have to do, really, is to look at the footage from October 7. You can see these same girls on the day they were abducted. You see them covered in blood, injured, crying, terrified. You see Naama Levy with a black eye and bloody pants, and we can expect that this is a more accurate representation of what these hostages have endured for nearly 16 months.' The hostages have already shared that they suffered severe physical and psychological trauma, including isolation and extreme hunger. They were often denied basic hygiene, such as showers. Crying and even holding hands were forbidden. They were forced to cook and clean toilets for their captors. 'The most important thing is to respect their privacy and to allow them the time and space to be surrounded by their loved ones, but what is for sure is that all hostages have a long road of recovery ahead of them,' Lahyani stated.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjap67vdyx	2025-01-26T12:52:39-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/yk14237568/yk14237568_0_23_1212_683_0_small.jpg

Irish president attacks Israel during ceremony, Jews who proteste...	Irish President Michael Higgins used his Holocaust Remembrance Day speech to criticize Israel, sparking protests from Jewish attendees who were forcibly removed; Jewish leaders had warned the president's participation was inappropriate, citing his dismissal of antisemitism concerns and anti-Israel rhetoric Irish President Michael Higgins, known for his anti-Israel stance, used his speech on Sunday during an International Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony to criticize Israel’s actions in Gaza. Jewish attendees protested loudly and were forcibly removed from the hall. Several Holocaust survivors attended the ceremony. A video from the event shows security personnel forcefully removing Jewish attendees who protested Higgins’ remarks. Higgins has a history of anti-Israel policies, having previously denied the existence of antisemitism in Ireland, criticized Israel’s embassy in Dublin, and condemned Israel’s actions against Hamas. His statements eventually led Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar to close Israel’s embassy in Dublin entirely. During the event, Holocaust survivors shared their stories of the atrocities they endured. Additionally, the names of relatives of Irish Jews murdered in the Holocaust were read aloud. In his speech, Higgins emphasized the importance of education to prevent future atrocities like the Holocaust and addressed the war in Gaza. During his remarks, Jewish participants turned their backs to the president in protest and were violently removed by security personnel. 'The grief caused to families by the horrific acts of October 7, and the response to them, is unimaginable. The loss of civilian lives, the displacement of people, the destruction of homes and institutions—all are beyond comprehension,' Higgins said. 'The current agreement must end the killing and urgently provide a massive increase in humanitarian aid to save more lives. It is essential that all remaining hostages are freed and that every stage of the agreement is fully implemented.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier this month, after it was announced that Higgins would be the keynote speaker at the International Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony, leaders of Ireland’s Jewish community voiced their opposition. Maurice Cohen, chairman of the Council of Representatives, described Higgins’ invitation as 'inappropriate.' 'This solemn occasion requires respect, sensitivity, and a commitment to honoring the memory of the victims. His participation may offend many in the audience, both Jewish and non-Jewish, who expect dignity and unity on such an important day,' Cohen said. Ireland’s Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Yoni Wieder, expressed concerns just a week and a half before the ceremony. 'President Michael Higgins ignores the current scourge of antisemitism in Ireland, let alone takes any action to address it,' Wieder said. 'He has not taken the concerns raised by representatives of the Jewish community seriously, and in May, he dismissed discussions about antisemitism in Ireland as ‘public relations.’ With this approach, I fear that his speech marking Holocaust Remembrance Day will cause anxiety for many Irish Jews.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hytegzvuje	2025-01-26T10:49:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/10/23/HyMx88Vzp/HyMx88Vzp_0_0_3000_1953_0_small.jpg

Justice Yitzhak Amit elected Supreme Court president; Justice min...	Judicial Selection Committee voted to appoint Justice Yizhak Amit as Supreme Court president, ending a 15-month standoff; but Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who tried to prevent the move citing journalist investigations including in Yediot Acharonot, boycotted the hearing; Levin does not intend to recognize Amit's presidency, which will hinder the judicial system The Judicial Selection Committee appointed on Sunday High Court judge Yizhak Amit as permanent Chief Justice. The vote on the 14th president of the Supreme Court comes after a series of delays over 15 months since the previous court president, Justice Esther Hayut, retired from the position. Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who serves as the chairman of the committee, boycotted the discussion, as did coalition representatives Minister Orit Struck and Knesset lawmaker Yitzhak Kreuzer. After hours of discussions in their absence, the most senior judge on the Supreme Court, Amit, 65, was elected to the position. The vote followed the tradition of elected the most senior justice to assume the presidency. Amit was prevented from participating in the discussion since it dealt with his appointment. In addition, the committee voted to appoint Justice Noam Solberg, 63, to the position of deputy president of the Supreme Court. Amit is accused by Levin and others of presiding over several cases in which he had conflicts of interest , after a Yediot Acharonot investigation found that he appeared in the cases involving a property he owns in Tel Aviv together with his brother under an assumed name. The hearing was held after the high Court ordered Levin to allow it to meet in order to appoint a president, after the Justice Minister refused to allow the committee to meet as he attempts to reform the judicial system. Levin, who was not present at the hearing, responded to the decision in a joint statement with Struck and Kreuzer. 'Today, the Judicial Selection Committee convened and supposedly 'elected' a Supreme Court president. We did not participate in the hearing. Electing a Supreme Court president while a heavy cloud hangs over the candidate's conduct in a number of different cases, including allegations of his alleged conflict of interest and construction irregularities in his residence, while giving contradictory answers to the allegations that were made, and without the basic obligation to conduct a professional and objective examination of those allegations, is a moral disgrace, contrary to all rules of proper administration and reeks of selective enforcement.' This means that the judicial system, which requires joint administrative decisions by the minister and the president, will not be made 'The Israeli public knows what has happened in the past, and even in the very recent past, with the fate of leading candidates for other senior positions, whose appointments were rejected and disqualified due to similar allegations. No less serious, the aforementioned 'selection' was made by virtue of an illegal order of the High Court of Justice, at the height of a fundamentally illegal process, which stripped the Minister of Justice of his statutory powers, and turned the Judicial Selection Committee into a rubber stamp of the High Court,' the statement said. 'The High Court's order was issued even though there is no real urgency in appointing a president to the Supreme Court, as the acting president has all the powers of the president; but the High Court judges have found a way to force this appointment through a forceful and illegal step. This is a sad day for democracy and a sad day for our legal system. A president who is 'elected' in such a way will not be able to gain the public's trust, which is necessary for the legal system as a fundamental condition for its existence. On behalf of a huge public whose democratic rights were trampled on in this illegal process, and whose expectation of a fair and moral legal system was also trampled on, we will not stop acting until we rectify this shameful situation from the ground up,' the statement concluded. President Isaac Herzog congratulated Amit. 'For decades and in various instances, Justice Amit has contributed greatly to the Israeli legal system, and I am confident that his many skills and rich experience will play a significant role in leading the Supreme Court and the judiciary with responsibility, discretion and dedication to the benefit of the State of Israel, and in the very important task of increasing public confidence in the legal system,' he said in a statement. 'The judicial system in general and the Supreme Court in particular are a critical part of our democratic fabric and the protection of human and civil rights. We must guard them with all vigilance. I believe that we must now move forward and put behind us the debate that has taken place in recent weeks surrounding the selection process for the president of the Supreme Court. We must look ahead, lower the flames of controversy, and strive to reach understandings as much as possible.' The High Court of Justice ruled on Friday that the Judicial Selection Committee must convene Sunday, after an extension was granted to discuss allegations against Amit, who was supposed to be elected on January 16 and has served as acting president until now. Levin decided to boycott the hearing in protest of the High Court order ordering him to convene the committee and also because of his firm opposition to Amit's appointment as president of the Supreme Court. Against the backdrop of the boycott by the Minister of Justice and coalition representatives, Amit is expected to receive the support of two Supreme Court Justices, Justices Solberg and Dafna Barak-Erez, two representatives of the Bar Association, Muhammad Na'amaneh and Yonit Kalmanovitz, and opposition representative Knesset lawmaker Karin Elharar. Levin believes that the High Court orders forced him to convene the committee to select a president, instead of discussing a compromise outline he proposed to the Supreme Court, which also includes the election of three judges who are currently missing from the Supreme Court. In the minister's opinion, these orders are illegal, and constitute a crossing of the line by the High Court in the face of the government and the Knesset. In the meantime, Levin made it clear that he will continue to insist that the allegations against Amit be investigated to the fullest extent, despite the words of Attorney General Gali Baharav Miara and the head of the police investigations division, Boaz Balat, who stated that there is no suspicion of criminality in the judge's actions. The disciplinary investigation demanded by Levin is based on about 15 newspaper publications, including the Yedioth Ahronoth exposé , which, in the minister's opinion, allegedly cast doubt on Amit's conduct, citing conflicts of interest in which he was involved during his tenure as a judge. This conflict of interest, the minister emphasizes, indicates his unsuitability for the position. Levin does not intend to recognize Amit's presidency, so until the end of his term he will continue not to cooperate with him in the field of court administration. This means that the judicial system, which requires joint administrative decisions by the minister and the president, will not be made. Among other things, decisions will not be made on the subject of selecting judges, adding budgets, selecting presidents and establishing search committees, building courts, and planning the system for the coming years. Therefore, by the end of Levin's term, only 10 justices will serve on the Supreme Court instead of 15. Some 4,800 objections were submitted to the Judicial Selection Committee against Amit's election. They were discussed by the committee about three weeks ago, where they were presented by members of right-wing legal associations who were invited in a precedent-setting manner to speak. These are the main allegations: Appeared under a different name in legal proceedings and did not report A Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth report revealed that in recent years Amit was a party to several civil legal proceedings concerning an apartment he and his brother own in south Tel Aviv, using his former name, Yitzhak Goldfreind, without reporting it and without the lawyers knowing that they were representing a Supreme Court judge. In one of the proceedings, an indictment was even filed against him. Also, a judge who heard one of these proceedings appeared on the Judicial Selection Committee while Amit was a member of it. At the same time, Amit heard cases from the law firm that represented him and his brother and in a case involving the Tel Aviv Municipality which was conducting proceedings regarding a property he owned. Amit, on the other hand, claimed that he became aware of the existence of the procedures mentioned only following the submission of the inquiry. According to him, his brother and he received from their parents as a gift two stores on Eilat Street in Jaffa, named after Dov and Yitzhak Goldfreind, as their names were at the time. In 2016, Amit gave his brother a general-notarial power of attorney to deal exclusively with the aforementioned properties, precisely in order not to be involved in anything related to them. He signed a power of attorney for his brother regarding a lawsuit to dissolve a partnership in the property filed by the developer and a number of rights holders in the property against dozens of other rights holders, including Amit and his brother. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another proceeding is a request for leave to appeal filed against the Magistrate's Court decision issued in the first proceeding. In this proceeding, Amit and his brothers, along with many others, appear as formal respondents only, in light of the fact that the order to dissolve the partnership was not issued against them. In any case, Amit had no knowledge of the existence of the proceeding, and no document was submitted in his name or on his behalf in the proceeding. In another proceeding, Amit signed by virtue of the power of attorney given to the entrepreneur, who initiated the administrative petition process, without informing Amit's brother about the procedure, and without the knowledge of the judge. Regarding the so-called 'concealment,' the reason Amit appears in the proceedings under his former last name, Goldfreind, is that the rights holder information for the purpose of filing court documents was taken from the original papers, where the judge appears under this last name. In the general-notarial power of attorney given by the judge to his brother, it is explicitly written Yitzhak Amit, not Yitzhak Goldfreind, so the claim that Amit 'concealed' his identity is unfounded.

Iranian cyberattack targets kindergartens, plays rocket sirens, t...	Iranian hacker group Handala claimed responsibility for breaching emergency button systems in educational institutions across Israel, using them to broadcast rocket sirens and terror-supporting songs; in addition, tens of thousands of fear-inducing text messages were sent to citizens, allegedly as part of the same coordinated attack An alleged Iranian cyberattack breached the emergency button system of Israeli company Maagar-Tec on Sunday, triggering rocket sirens, Arabic messages and terror-supporting songs across 20 kindergartens and educational institutions nationwide. The attackers, identified as the Iranian hacker group 'Handala,' claimed responsibility for the breach. They reportedly exploited Maagar-Tec's interfaces, responsible for emergency button systems, to carry out the coordinated attack. In addition to disrupting schools, the hackers sent tens of thousands of fear-inducing text messages to citizens by accessing a database linked to the company. Authorities instructed affected institutions to disconnect their devices from power until the situation is resolved. Maagar-Tech issued a statement confirming ongoing maintenance on its website, which remains temporarily inaccessible. Meanwhile, the National Cyber Directorate reported it is working closely with Maagar-Tech and the Ministry of Education to restore systems safely. 'Earlier this morning, the National Cyber Directorate received reports of a breach involving emergency buttons installed in several kindergartens. Investigations revealed that a cyber group had accessed the private supplier's system, using it to broadcast terror-supporting songs and alarm sounds,' a spokesperson said. The investigation confirmed the attack affected around 20 kindergartens. Additionally, another interface of the same supplier was used to send mass fear-mongering messages to citizens. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The National Cyber Directorate advised municipal system administrators using Maagar-Tec’s emergency buttons to update their passwords with more complex options.

Some 22 dead, dozens wounded as Lebanon alleges Israeli violation...	With 22 civilian casualties, southern Lebanon saw heightened tensions as residents returned to border villages despite warnings; Lebanese army struggles to enforce order, while Israeli forces maintained positions, citing operational needs and cease-fire agreement directives In the early hours of Sunday, the agreed-upon ceasefire in southern Lebanon ended without Israeli forces withdrawing. As anticipated in the neighboring country in recent days, residents of southern Lebanon began moving en masse, both by vehicle and on foot, toward border villages, including ones from which Israeli forces have not yet fully withdrawn. This despite the fact that on Saturday morning, in an official statement, the Lebanese army asked residents to delay heading to the southern border area due to 'the presence of landmines and suspicious objects left behind by the Israeli enemy.' Residents of southern Lebanon were urged 'to act responsibly and follow military instructions to ensure their safety.' The army added that 'there has been a delay in several stages due to the enemy’s stalling in withdrawing, complicating the army’s deployment preparations, though it remains ready to complete its deployment as soon as Israel withdraws.' In the evening, the army issued another statement about its deployment in several border villages, urging civilians 'not to approach areas Israeli forces have withdrawn from and to adhere to the guidance of military units.' Despite these warnings and calls from Lebanese army – tasked with implementing the cease-fire agreement in southern Lebanon and demonstrating control over the area – residents of southern Lebanon crossed military checkpoints Sunday morning with almost no resistance. The Lebanese army had placed barbed-wire fencing at several entrances to border towns to prevent residents from entering, but they lifted the fences and crossed without obstruction. The greater challenge for residents, according to Lebanese reports, was Israeli forces' dirt barriers blocking several roads, but even these were eventually crossed. The Lebanese army, unable to prevent southern residents from reaching the villages, changed its declarations on Sunday morning. Instead of requesting residents to stay away, it reported that 'army units are accompanying residents’ entry into towns, against the backdrop of the Israeli enemy’s insistence on violating Lebanon’s sovereignty, its attacks on civilians that have caused fatalities and injuries, and its refusal to adhere to the cease-fire agreement and withdraw from Lebanese territories it has occupied.' The army command also reiterated its call for residents 'to act with restraint and follow instructions from military units.' All discussions about clearing 'landmines and suspicious objects,' as well as the need for Lebanese army to enter villages before residents to secure their return were abandoned. Residents of southern Lebanon entered the towns without any oversight. Senior Hezbollah officials emphasized Sunday morning that it was the residents who cleared the roads for the army, using the opportunity to demonstrate how 'resistance is essential' in cooperating with Lebanese army. Meanwhile, Lebanon's Ministry of Health on Sunday evening reported that 22 people were killed and 124 injured in the south of the country, after IDF soldiers fired shots to disperse a threat. At least five Lebanese were detained or arrested by Israeli forces. One video circulating online shows a woman standing in front of a tank. Ghaleb Abu Zaynab, a member of Hezbollah’s political council, stated on Sunday that: 'This return is dangerous, but residents of the south insisted on coming back and taking their rights into their own hands. The people are moving forward, and the army is with them.' It seems that, lacking control, the army is now aligning with them. In its latest statement this morning, Lebanese army declared: 'Army units stand alongside citizens against the Israeli enemy, which continues to refuse to implement the cease-fire agreement and withdraw from Lebanese territory.' This, however, is not the army’s immediate mission in the south. Scenes from southern Lebanon on Sunday demonstrate that, despite responsibilities imposed on it under the two-month-old cease-fire agreement, the Lebanese army lacks the ability to control the area south of Litani River or to deter Hezbollah operatives and their supporters. It is also unclear whether the army even wants to fulfill this role. The Lebanese army does not want to be seen as 'complying' with Israel’s demands to dismantle Hezbollah or as standing between southern Lebanese residents and Israel. Hezbollah infused into Lebanese army Half of Lebanese army soldiers are Shiite Muslims. Over the past years, Hezbollah has gained significant control over the army. Even though the terrorist organization has weakened within the country, and even if Shiite Lebanese soldiers themselves do not support Hezbollah, those that surround them likely do. A source told the pro-Hezbollah Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar last week that Israel wants the 'Lebanese army to become a tool that works for it and for the monitoring committee,' with senior military officials refusing to act as 'officers operating under the enemy’s orders and clashing with residents.' Despite international declarations in recent months about strengthening the Lebanese army, there is no evidence that significant new capabilities were demonstrated on Sunday in the south. Returning residents, including Hezbollah operatives, are now in the villages, despite all army requests for them not to enter. 'This is the equation of the army, the people and the resistance,' said Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah on Sunday morning. 'The resistance fought here until the last day. The people liberated Aita al-Shaab and will liberate Marun al-Ras and Aitaroun. The people are opening the way for the army. The equation of the army, the people, and the resistance is not something written in ministers’ statements but is implemented on the ground.' Instead of acknowledging its failure to enforce order in the south, Lebanese officials have been blaming Israel since Sunday morning for violating the cease-fire agreement, supporting southern residents and attempting to project control. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun stated: 'I call on our people in the south to exercise self-restraint and trust the army. Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable. I am closely monitoring the southern residents’ situation at the highest levels to ensure their rights. The army remains committed to protecting you and ensuring your safety. I share with our people in the south the joy of the victory of truth.' Speaker of Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri accused Israel of wrongdoing, saying that 'Israel continues to violate Lebanon’s sovereignty and the terms of the cease-fire. The blood of southern Lebanese residents is an urgent call to the international community to compel Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon.' Lebanon’s incoming Prime Minister Nawaf Salam added: 'I fully share President Joseph Aoun’s trust in the army’s role in defending Lebanon’s sovereignty and ensuring the safe return of our people.' This is despite the army’s actual failure to ensure the safe return of residents. Meanwhile, Israeli forces emphasize that they continue to operate in southern Lebanon in accordance with directives from political leadership and within the framework of the cease-fire agreement between the sides. According to the army, Israeli troops remain deployed in several areas, maintaining forward defense and preventing the return of enemy forces or civilians beyond agreed line. 'Since this morning, hundreds of civilians, including Hezbollah operatives, have attempted to approach the first line of villages at several points, conducting provocative marches and attempting to create provocations,' a military source reported. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The source added that IDF troops are responding with warning fire to remove threats and prevent approaches to the fence area. During operations, several suspects who approached troops and posed a real threat were detained and taken for field interrogation. Israeli forces confirmed reports of injuries to a Lebanese soldier, but full details, including reports of fatalities, have not yet been clarified. 'According to the agreement, withdrawal of troops does not have to be completed within 60 days, and discussions about extending the period and the temporary positioning of troops are ongoing between political leadership, U.S., and Lebanon,' the military source clarified. He added that Israeli forces continue to closely monitor Hezbollah attempts to return to southern Lebanon and operate according to operational and political needs. Israel also stated that Lebanese forces has not adequately 'cleared' areas controlled by Hezbollah, particularly in the eastern sector. Israel has an operational plan and a range of options in case of escalation, which is currently deemed 'unlikely.' Lebanese reports mentioned gunfire directed at displaced people attempting to return to their homes, but Israel explained that fire was only directed at those posing a threat to troops. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hktkucx001x	2025-01-26T08:32:47-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/26/H111v2OXdkx/H111v2OXdkx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg

Islamic Jihad says Arbel Yehoud to be released early, Israel says...	The civilian Israeli hostage reportedly will be released in exchange for 30 life prisoners and the opening of the Netzarim Corridor for displaced people from northern Gaza; Israel confirms progress in talks to expedite her release but says no agreement yet Israel and Palestinian terrorists appear to be approaching a breakthrough that will lead to the release of civilian Israeli hostage Arbel Yehoud. The reports of progress come as crowds of Gazans are still stranded near the Netzarim Corridor, which remains blocked by Israeli troops, as they attempt to return to their home communities in northern Gaza. Israeli officials confirmed Sunday evening that there is progress in talks that will lead to the early release of the civilian hostage, who was supposed to be released from Hamas captivity on Saturday. However, the officials clarified that an agreement has not yet been reached. Previously, Sky News reported in Arabic that 'Hamas and Jihad agreed to release Arbel Yahud 24 hours before the third scheduled exchange on Saturday.' According to the same report, she will be released in exchange for the opening of the Netzarim Corridor and the beginning of the return of displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, and in exchange for the release of 30 terrorists serving life sentences. Arbel Yahoud is a civilian, so women and teenagers, not life prisoners, had been supposed to be released in exchange for her. The Saudi news outlet Al-Arabiya also reported that 'the mediators succeeded in overcoming the crisis of the kidnapped Arbel Yahoud.' On Sunday afternoon, a senior official in Islamic Jihad - the organization that apparently is holding Arbel Yehoud - said that 'we expect a breakthrough tonight in the surrounding crisis.' According to him, 'efforts are being made by the mediators to resolve the crisis, which may lead to the release of the kidnapped woman before Saturday.' Israel has not confirmed that any agreement has been reached. There is a great effort to resolve the crisis and pressure from the mediators, and President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, is also involved in the issue. At the same time, residents in the Gaza Strip were filmed 'looking' for Arbel Yehoud. 'All the people are waiting for Arbel,' one resident said in the video. Another resident added: 'Half a million people are sleeping on the streets because of her. Where is Arbel? Ten thousand prisoners in prison and not a single Arab has moved - and because of Arbel, all the nations have stood up.' The movement of displaced persons back to the northern Gaza Strip was banned following the crisis with Hamas over the release of Arbel Yehoud. She was supposed to be released in the second round, under the agreement which stated that live civilian women would be released before the female soldiers, but this did not happen, and therefore Israel announced that until the crisis is resolved no movement of displaced persons to the northern Gaza Strip will be allowed. The terrorist organization has meanwhile accused Israel of violating the agreement, stating that 'Hamas and the mediators are monitoring the occupation's prevention of the return of the displaced to the north, which is using the excuse of Arbel Yehoud - even though we announced that she was alive and gave all the necessary guarantees for her release.' However, Israel is still denying Hamas' claim that a sign of life was transferred from Arbel Yehoud. A political source clarified Sunday that 'Prime Minister Netanyahu stands firm on his decision not to allow Gazans to cross north through Netzarim until the issue of the closure of Arbel Yehoud is resolved.' In the meantime, Hamas has managed to violate the deal once again and did not present the list of hostages and their conditions as it was required to hand over by Saturday. Throughout Saturday night and Sunday morning, Palestinian media published numerous videos and photos from the Gaza Strip, showing thousands of Gazans waiting on the sides of the a-Rashid Road, which is a main crossing from the southern Gaza Strip to the north. Many Gazans even stayed overnight near the Netzarim Corridor, hoping that the crossing would open in the morning, but it remained closed. At the same time, Palestinians reported that four Gazans were injured by IDF gunfire in the Nuseirat area, where displaced people were waiting to return to the north of the Gaza Strip. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim addressed this, claiming in an interview with the Qatari channel Al-Araby that 'Israel's preventing the return of displaced persons to the north is a clear violation of the cease-fire agreement.' According to him, 'Israel is delaying and delaying, even though we have sent confirmation that the kidnapped Arbel Yahoud is alive. We demand that the mediators put pressure on Israel and force it to allow the return of the displaced persons. Direct contacts are taking place with the mediators in order to find a solution and open the Netzarim Corridor.' Israel is also striving to resolve the crisis, and according to a CNN report, they have turned to the person who many believe promoted the negotiations that led to the deal in the first place - Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East. According to an Israeli source, a message was sent to Witkoff, asking him to intervene in the crisis. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Hostages Directorate at the Prime Minister's Office announced Sunday morning that they were updated on the latest developments related to the implementation of the outline. According to the directorate: 'In parallel with the return to Israel of seven kidnapped women, four of whom are soldiers, Israel released the terrorist prisoners in accordance with the agreement. During the implementation of the cease-fire yesterday, Hamas committed two violations of the agreement: Arbel Yehoud has not yet been released and the list of the status of the hostages set to be returned in the first phase has not yet been submitted.' 'As a result, it was decided that the crossing of Gazans into the northern Gaza Strip will not be approved. Since yesterday until this hour, many efforts have been made with the U.S. and the mediators to bring about a settlement for the recovery of Arbel. It was expected that Hamas would create difficulties and continue psychological warfare on the way to implementing the agreement. We are determined to bring about the return of all the hostages, both living and dead.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ioo0qdjg	2025-01-26T07:34:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/SyapeARwJg/SyapeARwJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Returned hostages Emily, Doron and Romi released from hospital	Sheba Medical Center says Romi Gonen, Emily Damari, and Doron Steinbrecher, who were freed a week ago, were discharged after completing their medical evaluations; 'We will continue to support them' the hospital adds; 'We have a long road ahead of us, but we will keep working tirelessly to bring the remaining hostages home' Doron's father says Sheba Medical Center announced Sunday that Romi Gonen, 24, Emily Damari, 28, and Doron Steinbacher, 31, recently released after 471 days in Hamas captivity, have completed their stay and medical evaluations at the facility’s reintegration complex. 'The medical center will continue to support them and their families,' the hospital said in a statement. 'We remain ready and vigilant until the last hostage returns.' The released women are now headed to Kfar HaMaccabiah, where they will continue receiving medical care and emotional support while reuniting with their families. Roni Steinbrecher, Doron’s father, spoke of the overwhelming emotions surrounding the young womens' release and expressed gratitude to the Israeli public for its support and to the hospital for its care. 'We have a long road ahead of us, especially for Doron, but we will persist in advocating for the swift return of all remaining hostages,' he said. On Friday, the families of Gonen, Steinbrecher, and Damari shared their first Shabbat meals together after more than 15 months of separation. 'This is the first Shabbat in 67 weeks with Doron at our table,' said Roni and Simona Steinbrecher. 'While we are overjoyed, our celebration will only be complete when all hostages are home. This is a national mission, and we must keep up the momentum through public gatherings across the country.' The Steinbrecher family encouraged continued public demonstrations, emphasizing: 'Our Doron thanks everyone and urges you to keep attending rallies. We will not stop until every hostage is returned.'

Tensions over remaining hostages Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains dire, with 90 hostages still in captivity. According to the ongoing agreement, 26 of them are expected to be released in the next stage. However, negotiations have hit a snag over the release of Arbel Yehoud, initially slated for the second phase. Efforts to resolve the impasse are ongoing, though the Netzarim crossing, scheduled to open as part of the agreement, remains closed due to what Israeli officials have described as a breach by Hamas. Thousands of Gazans were seen near the crossing Sunday morning, some chanting, 'Where is Arbel? Everyone is searching for her.' The families of the freed hostages, while celebrating their loved ones’ return, continue to advocate for the release of all captives, urging the public and government to remain steadfast in their efforts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy9oxaqokl	2025-01-26T06:39:10-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/Byenqb2vyg/Byenqb2vyg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Women for Trump: 'Standing by Trump shows our connection to our h...	Hell hath no fury like a Jewish woman': Dr. Sheila Nazarian, Tanya Zuckerbrot and Siggy Flicker discuss advocating for Trump, his pro-Israel stance, efforts against antisemitism and standing firm in Jewish identity amid rising hate Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president of the United States brought together influential supporters, including three prominent Jewish women—Dr. Sheila Nazarian, Tanya Zuckerbrot and Siggy Flicker—who reflected on their advocacy for Trump, their connections to Israel and their personal journeys in activism. Nazarian, an Iranian-born plastic surgeon and activist, recalled braving freezing temperatures to attend the Liberty Ball on inauguration night. 'I like to think of it as conservative Disneyland,' she said. 'Once inside, it was great to be with other like-minded people. It was really fun to see all the MAGA hats and everyone so excited for the future of America.' Zuckerbrot, a nutritionist and mother of five, described the relief she felt on election night. 'I had a viewing party here at my home, and there was just so much elation, but even more so relief,' she said. 'The direction our country was heading in was concerning for so many reasons—national security, the economy—but as a Jewish woman with five children in college to see antisemitism on such a national scale and the Democratic Party's failure to make Jews feel safe. As a mom and as a Jewish woman, I was just so relieved that Trump won the presidency.' Flicker, born in Jerusalem to a Holocaust survivor, shared her unwavering loyalty to Trump, whom she has supported for nearly a decade. 'I left reality TV from day one. I left everything and my husband said, 'Siggy, go full force with Donald Trump,' and that was about 8 years ago and I got a lot of heat for it, but I knew in my heart Israelis trust their gut instinct. This is a friend of Israel. This is a friend of the Jewish people. This is the man who's going to save the world and get rid of jihad. Donald John Trump,' she said. Zuckerbrot added that she believes that standing by Trump 'shows our connection to our homeland Israel because Trump has been an advocate of Israel.' 'It's been shown in his policies—from the Abraham Accords and sanctions of Iran and also Trump's willingness to fight antisemitism here in the United States,' she said. 'So for me, this election was not so much about national issues but really my connection. I was a one-issue voter because Israel is our ancestral homeland and it is our obligation and our privilege as Jews in the Diaspora to do whatever is necessary to protect Israel's future. 'I went from ‘Boobs and Botox’ to Israel and the Jewish people.' Flicker praised the president's 'no BS' attitude and described him as a 'fearless' leader who speaks from the heart. Flicker, who has a personal relationship with Trump, highlighted his passion for America and strong stance against antisemitism. She recounted Trump’s frustration with being mislabeled as antisemitic, emphasizing his Jewish family connections. 'Not everybody has common sense,' she said, adding, 'He’s relatable, even as a billionaire.' Flicker also discussed her recent meeting with Trump following the October 7 Hamas attacks. She urged him to prioritize the return of Israeli hostages. 'President Trump kept on saying, ‘It would have never happened if I was president,’ and I believe him,' she said, emphasizing his commitment to supporting Israel. Nazarian shared her journey from posting about plastic surgery to becoming an outspoken advocate for Israel. She said she began addressing antisemitism on social media in response to growing hostility on U.S. college campuses. 'I went from ‘Boobs and Botox’ to Israel and the Jewish people,' Nazarian said. Her pivot intensified during May 2021's Operation Guardian of the Walls and again after the October 7 Hamas attacks. Despite backlash and threats, she continued her advocacy. 'I thought I was going to lose everything, and I was willing to lose everything, but not only did I get to keep everything, I have gained so much more. So I highly recommend following your soul, following your core values, being true to yourself. God rewards the authentic,' she said. Nazarian addressed a shift in Jewish American political affiliations, noting that Jews from Holocaust survivor families often lean left due to concerns about nationalism, while those from countries like Iran and Cuba lean conservative due to their experiences with socialism. 'A lot of Jews have switched to the Republican Party, and I hope more will switch. I hope that more people will wake up, and I know that these three women on this show with me today are going to be a huge factor in that,' she said. Nazarian highlighted Trump’s unwavering support for Israel, including the Abraham Accords and adding antisemitism protections under Title IX. Zuckerbrot explained why she took the unusual step of publicly endorsing Donald Trump, despite it being a contentious choice within the Jewish community. 'As a Jew, we feel that even our safety in this country was being challenged,' she said. 'Jews make up less than 1% of the world population. We are a minority, and there are such few voices standing up for the Jewish people.' Zuckerbrot emphasized the significance of advocacy, even at a personal cost. 'For the first time in my professional career, I publicly shared which candidate I was voting for and I did it because I felt that if I could sway even one person to come over to vote for Trump, then that would have been an impact,' she said. Zuckerbrot cited data to illustrate shifting allegiances: Trump's share of the Jewish vote in New York rose from 30% in 2020 to 45% in 2024, a 50% increase. 'I do believe that that increase was due to people like Siggy, Sheila and hopefully myself too, who explained why Trump was a friend to Israel and a friend to the Jews here in the U.S.,' she added. While acknowledging the Democratic Party’s history of supporting liberal social values, Zuckerbrot criticized what she described as 'double talk' on the campaign trail. 'I think that the threat to withhold arms from Israel was a turning point for many people, especially myself, where I could never go back,' she said. 'The United States should always present as an unwavering ally to Israel and to suggest that we would not give Israel what it needs to eradicate a terrorist organization, which they are doing on behalf of the world, was so disheartening to me, and there was no way I could ever vote for a candidate that would ever threaten Israel's future.' 'Hell hath no fury like a Jewish woman. There is nothing that makes me more proud than to stand up for the Jewish people in the State of Israel.' Flicker described how her father’s experiences in the Holocaust and warnings shaped her commitment to advocating for Israel and the Jewish people: 'I grew up in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. We moved there from Israel, and I remember at kiddush every Friday night my father would repeat story after story after story about the Holocaust, and I would say to my father, 'why do you keep repeating the same stories? We're in America, Daddy, we're safe.' And he said, 'Siggy, antisemitism is like cancer. It stays dormant, but when it comes out and it will come out, I want to make sure that you're strong enough to look at it in the face and defeat it.' Reflecting on recent events, Flicker noted the rise in antisemitism globally, including attacks on Jews in Europe, the U.S. and college campuses. 'Look where we are today, our children are afraid to wear their Star of David, Jews are being persecuted, we look at what's happening in Europe. Look what's happening all over the United States in our colleges,' she said.

What the Israelis have created in a land that has no oil underneath is absolutely remarkable. Hell hath no fury like a Jewish woman. You will not touch my people. You will not touch my children, and if I lose my life tomorrow, I lose my life in the way that I want to lose my life. There is nothing that makes me more proud than to stand up for the Jewish people in the State of Israel.' Flicker explained why she limits public interaction on her social media platforms. Despite addressing controversial topics like her support for Israel and President Trump, Flicker said she has not received direct threats. However, she emphasized her decision to avoid toxic exchanges. 'I will not give jihad a platform on my social media,' Flicker said, referring to anti-Israel sentiments and online abuse. 'I'm not interested in your comments, I'm not interested in having dialogue. If you want to have dialogue with me, send me a DM. I'll respond to you and then we can go on from there. But what a lot of people are doing is they leave their comments on and all the bots and all the jihadis come out there with their 'Free Palestine' and 'From the river to the sea.' Not interested in that.' Flicker said her focus is on sharing her own message and maintaining a positive space. 'I'm very passionate about what I feel and I feel like I have a phenomenal life because I do not allow toxic energy in my life, and that starts with social media,' she said, adding that avoiding negativity allows her to live a fulfilling life. 'I can't be on every day because I'm a fighter. If somebody comes on and says 'From the river to the sea,' I'm going to respond in a way that I can't repeat right now.' Nazarian expressed her belief that Trump would continue to strongly support Israel. While clarifying she does not have a personal relationship with Trump, Nazarian highlighted his track record and expected policies. 'I think the things that he for sure is going to do is bankrupt Iran so that there isn't all of this money to be given to the proxy terrorist organizations to be attacking Israel, which is great,' she said. 'I know he's going to be giving the 2000-pound bombs to Israel and those are the bunker busters to really be able to do some damage to the nuclear program if they need to. I don't think he's going to stand in the way of Israel and their right to defend themselves. He has said many times that he is a president of peace, peace through strength. But I don't think he's going to handicap Israel the way that the prior administration did.' She criticized the Biden administration’s decision to lift sanctions on Iran, stating it allowed Iran to grow $150 billion wealthier and fund destabilizing efforts, including anti-Israel protests on U.S. college campuses. 'When the revolution started in Iran, it started on the campuses,' Nazarian noted, describing parallels between tactics used then and the growing antisemitism she sees on American campuses today. 'They're using the same playbook—to create chaos and division here in the U.S. just like they did in Iran.' She also addressed criticisms of hostage negotiations with Hamas, calling it 'hostage extortion' rather than a deal. 'If somebody comes in and steals a child and you pay ransom to get your child back, that's not a deal, that's extortion,' she said. Nazarian voiced confidence that Trump would not force Israel into such positions, adding, 'Donald Trump has shown that he is a good friend to Israel. He's not going to be paying both sides. He's not going to handicap people who want democracy and freedom in the Middle East.' Flicker emphasized the president’s decisive actions in favor of Israel during his first term and his potential future impact. 'Israel's very significant to Donald Trump,' she said. 'I believe actions speak louder than words. When Donald Trump was president, Iran was broke, he bankrupted them, and he also bankrupted the Palestinian Authority. When you stop funding 'pay-for-slay,' you're stopping funding the killing of innocent Israelis. Trump recognized the Golan Heights, poverty in Judea and Samaria. Donald Trump is a man of little words and all action.' She also praised Trump’s business-oriented approach to governance, describing his vision for expanding peace in the Middle East as 'Abraham Accords on steroids.' She explained that Trump is fostering alliances with Arab nations that oppose extremist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. 'There are Arab nations who do not like the jihadis. They're done with it and they are coming on board and we will have peace in the Middle East which no one thought was possible. That is Donald Trump's dream. He is going to bring peace to the Middle East and he's going to wipe out all these little tentacles of Iran,' she said. 'Before October 7, everybody thought that the Palestinians really wanted peace and you saw what happened. It's impossible to have peace with the Palestinians because, from the age of three, they are taught that Jews are like dogs and they must die. We do not have a right to exist in their eyes. We must secure Israel and its borders, and it starts now with Donald Trump as president.' Zuckerbrot emphasized the importance of embracing Jewish identity as a powerful response to growing antisemitism. 'Trump said it best: it's the dawn of a new day. Standing proudly in our Jewish identity is the greatest act of defiance that Jews can make right now. It shows that we are not afraid, we are not backing down, we are here to stay forever,' she said. 'The losses are painful but Israel's facing an existential crisis and as Jews, we have a moral obligation to do whatever is needed to support Israel.' She praised the Jewish commitment to tikkun olam, or repairing the world, and lauded the contributions of Jews to global progress and innovation. 'I think that this administration is ushering in a decade of Jewish people feeling safe again to stand proudly in their Jewish identity and to fight the good fight,' she added. Zuckerbrot also shared the personal cost of her activism, revealing she had lost thousands of followers and a 30-year friendship due to her outspoken support for Trump. 'The losses are painful but Israel's facing an existential crisis and as Jews, we have a moral obligation to do whatever is needed to support Israel,' she said. 'I believe the work we are doing as Jewish people by supporting Donald Trump is God's work and therefore any friendships that have been lost, God has chosen to take those people out of my life and I'm very lucky to say that by being true to myself and my values.' She credited her alignment with like-minded advocates, such as Nazarian and Flicker, for giving her renewed strength in what she described as 'the fight of our life.' The panelists urged the Jewish community to stand together in solidarity, using their platforms to combat antisemitism and support Israel. 'Every voice matters right now,' Zuckerbrot concluded. 'Our brothers and sisters in Israel must know they have our unwavering support. You are not alone.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1kqysqdje	2025-01-26T06:08:29-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/B1QoVl2w1g/B1QoVl2w1g_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

13 Israels injured, 5 locals killed in serious bus accident in La...	A night bus driver in the East Asian country apparently fell asleep and the bus overturned into a ditch on the side of the road; 13 young Israelis were injured, 5 of them in moderate to serious condition. Some 13 young Israelis were injured Saturday night in a bus accident in Laos, including five who are in moderate to serious condition. Five people were killed in the accident, after the bus driver, who apparently fell asleep, crashed into a tree. The driver died from his injuries. The injured Israelis, aged 19 to 30, were on a night bus ('sleeper') that overturned in a ditch on the side of the road, on the way from the town of Vang Vieng to the town of Pakse. The dead are locals from Laos, and in addition to the Israelis, locals and about 10 Europeans also were injured. The injured Israelis received initial medical treatment at a small hospital nearby, then were treated in Pakse, and later - following the intervention of the MAGNUS International Search & Rescue team and the Foreign Ministry - they were transferred by ambulance to Thailand, for further treatment at a hospital with better medical facilities.

She is definately number one, Liri Albag's pround aunt says	Ruhama Albag tells ynet that she was not surprised to see her neices vigor and energy when she finally returned from 477 days of caprivity in Gaza; says she has a wonderful family that will help her on the long road to recovery Liri has returned home full of vigor, said her aunt Ruhama Albag on Sunday, 'I hope that continues and improves even more.' The proud aunt who joined Liri's parents and the rest of the families of hostages, in the struggle to bring about the captive's release said the fight would continue. Liri was released by Hamas on Saturday with Naama Levy, Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev in the second hostage release, part of the first phase of the cease-fire deal negotiated with Hamas. She was abducted from the Nahal Oz base where she had served as a lookout and was held by the terrorists in Gaza for 477 hellish days. Ruhama had not yet met her niece who had spent her first night out of captivity. 'I told her mom a long time ago that I was happy to wait for year to meet her if only I knew she was home. I don't need anything more than that,' she told ynet in an interview. 'Liri has personality and that does not change. I was not surprised to see her write Liri Albag number one and her wave out the window. But I was shocked at her energy. I guess this does not go away. She is a special child and we have never doubted her inner strength.' Liri's aunt understands that her niece has a long road to recovery ahead. 'She is home now and will be in full control of her life. She has a strong family and wonderful parents and in time things will work out and become clear.' But the struggle to bring all of the hostages is not over. 'All this euphoria lasts for the first 24 hours and the road is long. We all have a responsibility not just as a family. I think everyone has a responsibility to bring all of the hostages back. It is inconceivable that this is still going on after a year and three months. I imagine it would go on for nearly two years with all sorts of agreements.' Ruhama said that when the first group of hostages were released in 2023, the family heard how Liri was strong and holding the others together. 'But we don't know what happened after that, what conditions they were held under and what they had experienced.'

Incoming CIA chief says COVID-19 origin likely in China lab	John Ratcliffe appointed under the new Trump administration, says renewed look at reports indicates likelihood of virus leaking from Wuhan lab, contradicting predecessor's position Two days after incoming CIA Director John Ratcliffe assumed the role, the agency released an updated assessment on Sunday stating a high likelihood that the COVID-19 virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China. This marks a shift from its earlier neutral stance between the natural-origin theory and the lab leak hypothesis. The CIA clarified that the updated assessment wasn’t based on new intelligence but on a renewed analysis of existing data, including a deeper examination of the working conditions in Wuhan’s research labs prior to the outbreak. A spokesperson stressed that the possibility of a natural origin is still under review. Before taking office, Ratcliffe expressed firm support for the lab leak theory, calling the investigation into the virus's origin a 'top priority' for national security. 'I think our intelligence, our science and our common sense all really dictates that the origins of COVID was a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,' He said upon his swearing-in and vowed to push the CIA aggressively for more information. Reports suggest the updated assessment was developed during former U.S. president Joe Biden’s administration under former CIA Director William Burns, following National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s directive for a review of the pandemic’s origins. However, Ratcliffe decided to make the findings public, aiming to ensure the CIA’s involvement in the ongoing debate. Despite the shift, the assessment is classified as having 'low confidence,' indicating inconclusive intelligence. Intelligence officials warn that a definitive conclusion may never be reached due to limited data and China’s refusal to cooperate with international investigators. China has strongly rejected the CIA’s findings, accusing the U.S. of politicizing the issue. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson dismissed the claims as 'baseless rumors' and urged focus on scientific collaboration instead of accusations. The worldwide intelligence community remains divided on the issue. Some argue that the origin debate is secondary to China’s broader failures in regulating its live animal markets and research labs. Others view it as a critical intelligence question with far-reaching implications for U.S.-China relations. Since the pandemic's onset in 2019, conflicting reports from government and academic bodies have muddied the waters, with some supporting the lab-leak theory and others pointing to Wuhan’s live animal market as the likely source. Under the Biden administration, most intelligence agencies leaned toward a natural origin, albeit with low confidence. While agencies like the National Intelligence Council and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) supported a natural origin, the FBI and U.S. Department of Energy leaned toward the lab-leak hypothesis, albeit with differing specifics. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Amid these revelations, scientists and policymakers are calling for an independent investigation with unrestricted access to Chinese data. Many agree that uncovering the virus’s origin is vital for both scientific understanding and security, though some argue the growing pressure stems as much from geopolitical tensions as public health concerns. China continues to resist full cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Western entities, complicating efforts to resolve the mystery surrounding the pandemic’s origins. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjjgqq700kl	2025-01-26T02:40:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2020/03/19/9856564/9856564_0_94_1300_732_0_small.jpg
Crowds of Gazans gather at passages waiting to return to northern...	Israel and Gaza factions exchange blame over delay in allowing displaced residents of northern Gaza to move back while Hamas fails to release Arbel Yhoud or deliver details on the condition of the remaining hostages to be freed in the first phase of the deal A large crowd of displaced Gazans on Sunday gathered near the Netzarim Corridor waiting to cross to the northern parts of the Gaza Strip. Their passage had been delayed after Hamas failed to comply with its commitment to release Arbel Yahoud, a 28-year-old Israeli civilian on Saturday under the terms of the cease-fire agreement. Israel announced that until the release of Yahoud was clarified, and Hamas delivers a report on the condition of the remaining hostages, as it had committed to do, the IDF would not allow Gazans to return north. Images in the Palestinian media showed Gazans spending the night outdoors on the side of the A-Rashid road, waiting for their passage to be allowed and in the crowds that continue to gather there in the morning hours. They also reported that four people were wounded in IDF fire near the Nuseirat refugee camp. Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told the Qatari Al Araby network that Israel was in violation of the agreement. 'Israel is delaying and postponing although we sent the certainty that Arbel Yahoud was alive. We demand that the mediators pressure Israel to allow displaced Gazans to return home,' he said. 'There are discussions underway with the mediators to find a solution and for the roads to be opened.' According to a CNN report earlier, Israel asked Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy, to intervene. According to an official, Israel's message to Witkoff read 'Push Hamas to comply with the terms and free Arbel.' The directorate for the families of hostages in the Prime Minister's Office (MPO) said on Sunday that they were informed of the recent events around the implementation of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. 'Hamas violated the agreement twice on Saturday. Arbel Yahoud was not released and the list detailing the conditions of the other hostages to be freed in phase one of the deal, was not delivered,' the directorate said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Therefore, it was decided not to allow the passage of Gazans to the northern areas. Since Saturday efforts were underway with the United States and the mediators to arrange the return of Arbel. Hamas was expected to raise obstacles along the way.

Fight not over until all hostages home, grandfather of freed Naam...	Shaul Levy returns to stand in support of hostages return, this time holding the photo of Omer Wenkert after his own granddaughter was freed; 'All we could do is hug, no words, no questions,' he says of the reunion As he has done for the past 470 days, 78-year-old Shaul Levyi came on Sunday to the hostage square in Beer Sheva but this time he held up the picture of Omer Wenkert and not of his granddaughter Naama Levy who was released from Hamas captivity on Saturday. Hundreds stopped to give him a hug and talk for a bit and many who were in cars passing by, honked their horns in support of the granddad who had become a familiar feature and a symbol of the struggle for the hostages to be freed. Levy described the moment they met at the hospital. 'In this situation, all you can do is hug, and just be,' he said excitedly 'I waited a bit to give her a moment and not pressure her.' He said all he did was hug and kiss her and cry but did not ask her any questions. 'The most important thing is to give her time to understand what she had been through and that now she is safe and surrounded by love.' But the enormity of the situation was clear. 'I thought to myself now we are meeting her and this morning, the girls were sill in a tunnel, then made to participate in a show, to stand and be given release certificates.' He said there was a difficult emotion. 'But they came through it and the main thing is that they are home. 'One stone has been removed from the pile of weight,' he said adding that he had a need to come back and stand as he had before, at the square, for closure. A ceremony celebrating her release was held at Naama's old high school. Levy attended surrounded by hundreds of students who showered him with love and embraces. 'All my strength when I stand before you, is dissipating,' he told them. 'There is nothing that brings me more joy than Naama that I was fortunate to hug and feel yesterday. Without words. And your embrace today is huge. I am shaking. There is such a wonderful community here and there are you, the students that I love.'

PA's Abbas congratulates terrorist released in hostage deal	IDF continues to act trying to prevent celebrations following release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners after the release of additional Hamas hostages Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas called on Saturday to congratulate Yasser Abu Bakr, a senior operative of Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade after he was released from prison as part of the cease-fire agreement with Hamas. 'This is for the homeland, but they’ve [Israel] crossed the line with you,' Abbas told Abu Bakr, who replied, 'I think there’s no need to celebrate when thousands died in Gaza.' Abu Bakr was responsible for a 2002 terror attack in Netanya that killed two Israelis, including a 9-month-old baby, and was involved in other deadly strikes. Reports indicated that Fatah named a training program after him. Abbas's call sparked outrage in Israel. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X (formerly Twitter), 'Mahmoud Abbas remains a terror supporter and the Palestinian Authority is nothing more than a terrorist organization. His call to a murderer of Jews should be a wake-up call to those who still see the PA as an alternative to Hamas after the war.' Otzma Yehudit party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir added, 'You close your eyes to the PA rewarding murderers and teaching terror, release thousands of terrorists, stop the war in Gaza and retreat from Netzarim and northern Gaza. Give bulldozers to Hamas and don’t forget to tell us they’re deterred. It’s time to change the system.' Yisrael Beiteinu party leader Avigdor Lieberman wrote, 'Holocaust denier Abbas shows his true face again — a terror supporter congratulating vile murderers. Anyone embracing terrorists with blood on their hands is a terrorist and cannot be part of any process, let alone supervise the Rafah crossing.'

Trump, Netanyahu expected to meet, discuss Saudi deal	Prime minister expected to travel to D.C. early in February when negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza deal, begin; officials say Trump to use potential of normalization with Saudis and other Muslim nations to push PM not to resume war Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet U.S. President Donald Trump early in February although a date has not yet been set. Israeli officials say the meeting is important and the two nations would attempt to agree on a number of burning issues including the threat from Iran. Trump does not want to see an Israeli military strike but is willing to impose sever sanctions on Tehran while in Jerusalem, the officials said the sanctions must come with a credible threat of military action. Netanyahu's visit will coincide with the start of negotiations for the second phase of the cease-fire deal in Gaza. Trump has said he agrees that Hamas must not remain as the rulers in the Strip but had also said he wants to see the agreement fulfilled in full rather than a resumption of the war if the talks fail. The officials said Trump would urge Netanyahu to continue talks, using the Saudi deal as an incentive. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to visit Riyadh in the near future to finalize the details of the normalization deal. The United States is working on a normalization package that includes other Muslim states as well, such as Malaysia and Oman. The Americans believe that normalization of ties with the Saudis would make it easier for Netanyahu to convince the more extremist elements in his government to agree to the second phase of the cease-fire deal.

IDF stays put in Lebanon after withdrawal deadline, Hezbollah thr...	Israel says Lebanon army, Hezbollah have yet to implement the deal fully, therefore withdrawal will be coordinated with the U.S.; Macron calls both sides to comply with agreement IDF forces remained in Lebanon on Sunday. 60 days after the cease-fire with Hezbollah began, despite the requirement to withdrawa all troops by 4:00 a.m. and after Israel formally announced that the pullout would be delayed over violations of the agreement by Lebanon. The Lebanese army accused Israel of 'delaying' its withdrawal and said in a statement it’s 'ready to deploy immediately once the IDF withdraws.' It also warned residents near the southern border to 'exercise caution due to mines and dangerous objects left by the Israeli army.' IDF spokesperson in Arabic Col. Avichay Adraee posted a statement urging residents not to move south of the marked villages on the map provided by the military. 'The IDF has no intention of attacking you, but for now, movement south of this line is prohibited until further notice. Anyone crossing south does so at their own risk,' he wrote, listing over 60 villages off-limits to returnees. French President Emmanuel Macron called on both sides to honor their commitments 'as soon as possible to restore Lebanon's sovereignty.' In a conversation with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Macron stressed compliance with the agreement, to which Aoun responded, 'Israel must be forced to uphold the terms of the agreement to preserve regional stability.' Last Friday, the Prime Minister's Office said that the cease-fire agreement allows for the IDF’s phased withdrawal, which depends on Lebanon's enforcement of the deal, including Hezbollah's retreat north of the Litani River. 'As the agreement has not been fully implemented by Lebanon, the phased withdrawal will continue in coordination with the U.S. Israel will not endanger its residents and will ensure the safe return of citizens to their homes,' the statement read. On Thursday, Hezbollah threatened that any presence of Israeli forces in Lebanon beyond the 60-day deadline would be considered a 'blatant violation' and an 'attack on Lebanon's sovereignty.' The terror group warned it might use 'all means necessary' to reclaim the land. Israel says hat the Lebanese army has yet to deploy fully in former Hezbollah strongholds, leading the Security Cabinet to decide — without a formal vote — that the withdrawal won’t be completed for now. Ministers agreed the IDF would respond forcefully to any violations by Hezbollah. While Hezbollah has largely refrained from responding to Israeli actions in Lebanon, its messaging consistently warns that failure to withdraw could reignite conflict. Following Israel's announcement that its withdrawal would extend beyond 60 days, the U.S. expressed support for the actions.

Israeli officials say the sooner Arbel Yahoud is released the sooner Gazans would be allowed to return to the northern parts of the Strip; IDF Arabic language spokesperson posts urgent warning to stay away from Netzarim until further notice Thousands of displaced Gazans spent the night outside, sleeping on the streets, as they waited for the IDF to open the Netzarim Corridor and allow them to move back to the northern areas of the Strip. Israel announced on Saturday that the passage would remain closed after Hamas failed to release Arbel Yhoud from captivity on Saturday, as it had committed in the cease-fire deal. According to a report on CNN, officials asked Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff to intervene and 'push Hamas to comply with the terms of the agreement and release Arbel.' IDF Arabic Language spokesperson Avichai Adraee posted an urgent warning to Gazans not to approach the Netzarim Corridor. 'In light of the violations of the cease-fire by Hamas and to avoid friction and misunderstandings there has been no change to the instructions as they were in place.

Trump says Jordan, Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza	U.S. president he is looking at Gaza and seeing a demolition site 'its a real mess' adding that a removal of 1.5 million people to neighboring Arab nations would 'clean up the whole mess' U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza, Speaking to reporters on Air Force 1, when asked if this was a temporary or long-term suggestion, Trump said: 'Could be either.' Washington had said last year it opposed the forcible displacement of Palestinians. Rights groups and humanitarian agencies have for months raised concerns over the situation in Gaza. Washington has also faced criticism for backing Israel but has maintained support for its ally, saying it is helping Israel defend against Iran-backed militant groups like Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.

Former US ambassador: 'Saudis were very clear' about Palestinian ...	Jack Lew, who completed a year and a half as US envoy to Israel last week, claims the Saudis will not push the Palestinian issue aside like the Abraham Accords; In a farewell interview, he tells Ynet about the differences in the war between Netanyahu and Washington U.S. President Joe Biden's first request to Jack Lew to allow the president to appoint Lew as ambassador to Israel was in July 2023. In Israel, these were the peak days of protests against the judicial overhaul, but the Americans looked ahead, at the big geopolitical picture, and persisted in the quest to reach a normalization deal that would satisfy the U.S., the Sunni Muslim countries in the Middle East, and Israel. The announcement of Lew's appointment came in early September, but two months passed between confirmation in the Senate and his departure for Tel Aviv, and in the middle Hamas carried out the surprise attack on October 7. By the time Lew landed here, in a country stricken by shock, it seemed that an agreement with Saudi Arabia was the last thing on the agenda. His short tenure as ambassador, which ended last weekend with the change of administration in Washington, was focused mainly on the war; coordinating airlifts, defending international institutions, contacting families of hostages, and negotiating with Hamas. However, he insists that even during these 15 terrible months, he did not give up on the task of reengineering diplomatic relations in the Middle East. 'So when I came here, when President Biden asked me if I would accept this post, it was in July of 2023, so we're several months before October 7. The reason he asked me and that I accepted this post was to try and get Saudi Israeli normalization done,' Lew explained. 'Having the right people in the right place was going to make that more likely. I thought it was of huge strategic importance, and that was the, you know, that was the reasoning that brought me here. Originally, when I got here just three weeks into the war, it was in a very different circumstance. There hasn't been a day that I've been here that we haven't remained focused on Saudi normalization, where we have been very clear, even as we talked about the need to bring the cease-fire negotiations together. I mean, the hostage release and cease-fire could have created a window to complete Saudi normalization, and we now, obviously, in the last days, can't do it, but it is no less in the national interest of Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States to have Saudi normalization than it was in July of 2023 when I thought it was a good reason to change the same interest,' he said. I have never lived through a war day to day in the country fighting the war 'There hasn't been a day that I've been here that we haven't remained focused on Saudi normalization, where we have been very clear, even as we talked about the need to bring the cease-fire negotiations together,' Lew added. 'I mean, the hostage release and cease-fire could have created a window to complete Saudi normalization, and we now, obviously, in the last days, can't do it, but it is no less in the national interest of Saudi Arabia, Israel and the U.S. to have Saudi normalization than it was in July of 2023 when I thought it was a good reason to change the same interest. I think the interest is it.' 'Now, let me tell you what's changed before October 7, I believe that there was a need to address the issue of Palestinian self-governance. I don't know exactly what the required agreement would be, but it was not like the Abraham Accords, where you could just put that issue to the side. The Saudis were very clear about that. In my understanding, I think after October 7 all of the signals have been very much consistent with that, that there has to be a credible process to address those issues. Now I don't think that that requires doing anything that would create a risk to Israel's security. Then there's that any agreement would have to be predicated on Israel accepting it. It would have to be predicated on Israel being able to defend itself and have security.' When was the moment that you realized we are going to have a hostage deal? 'I thought there was going to be a hostage deal. I felt that over the last week, 10 days, it was clear that all the parties were trying to close. And a deadline helps in all difficult decisions. I will say that there had been enough hopeful moments that I believed it when both sides had actually approved it. It's been up and down and up and down. It's taken too long, and it's going to be a hard agreement to for all parties to continue to implement. So it's going to take ongoing focus and determination to get not just through the six weeks and the release of the 33 hostages, but to engage in the negotiation over phase two and to push those difficult issues to completion.' What was your involvement in the in the diplomatic contacts? Did you only get updates or you take active role in this process? 'So I've been closely connected to the U.S. diplomatic effort for the entire time that I've been here, I don't think a day has gone by when I haven't had conversations with our team directly or through members of my staff that were working with them. Sometimes it was advice to the team, sometimes it was coordinating the meetings between our leaders and leaders in Israel, so I can't say there was just one element to it.' 'It was a very long process, and I've been deeply engaged with the families of hostages, obviously the American hostage families, who are our first priority. But I can honestly say that I have not turned down meetings with any hostage families. I've met with the families of the young women soldiers. Quite a number of times I've been with families who are Israeli and not American. My feeling being here was that the things I could do directly were to make sure that the families knew we were doing everything that we could do.' 'I could answer questions as directly as possible to help them understand where I saw the state of the negotiations and when they asked me to do things, if they were things that I could do. Last Saturday night, just a week ago, I was in the Hostage Square with my colleagues, the ambassadors from UK and Germany. And it was because one of the families of the young woman soldiers said the world needs to know that these hostages come from your countries as well.' Is it really the same deal that was on the table in May? 'You don't have a deal until both parties want an agreement. Hamas did not want an agreement in May, no matter what was said here, you weren't going to have an agreement. I can't speak to what decision making went into, different moves made by the government of Israel, but it certainly was described to me that there was a desire for a deal. The action sometimes made it more challenging, as I just said, in terms of the public discussion of the Philadelphi Corridor, that's different from whether or not you are willing to accept a deal.' 'Fundamentally, Hamas made a decision, and I've said 1,000 times that whether we liked it or not, there wasn't going to be a deal if Hamas wouldn't accept a deal, because you couldn't unilaterally make a deal. So one can debate whether we could have moved things faster. We've never had any direct ability to influence Hamas. Hamas is influenced by the change of situation on the ground, and the war has obviously put pressure on them, the change of situation in the region, where the condition that after the very successful Israeli military operations in Lebanon, Syria, Iran, there's different reality in the region.' Do you think that Netanyahu will continue to the second stage? 'We're sitting here not even 24 hours after the government approved the agreement, I think there will be pressures in both directions. I personally believe that once hostages are released and they're reunited with their families there will be mixed emotions. We don't know exactly what condition they're in. We don't know exactly how everyone will feel when those moments come, but I think it will create a lot of pressure to give peace to the remaining families. I think if the negotiations can continue in the spirit that they've gone so far, there's a pathway here. It's a hard pathway, and it's going to require making decisions that need to be explained for the public to understand them, and that's what leadership is about.' There was no embargo Ambassador Lew is referring, among other things, to the conflict in the background of the UN Security Council resolution from last March, which approved a call for a cease-fire during Ramadan, mentioning the hostages, but without demanding their release. The U.S. abstained, but did not veto it. This led to a rift between Washington and Jerusalem, and Netanyahu's office was quick to announce the cancellation of the Israeli delegation that was supposed to go to the U.S. 'So if you have a resolution in the UN Security Council where the U.S. goal is to keep other countries on our side, saying a cease-fire has to be connected to the release of the hostages, if you change the language to get other countries to support you. You can choose to say, the US did not change its position. That was what we said. Or you can say, the US did change their position. That's what the government here said. I think that's a strategic mistake.' 'You can disagree with the language in private. You can say, I wish you wouldn't do that, but what we knew was we'd had no support in the UN if we went the other way. And subsequent to that, we've had to veto resolutions in the UN Security Council, because we can't get any other country to keep the ideas linked. So we took a change of grammar and it became daylight. I think that took a small difference and made it a daylight issue. It was not something that had to be daylight.' 'What was real was that the rest of the world was drifting, and we were trying to hold the rest of the world for as long as possible from drifting too far. The much discussed issue of munitions, we have provided more military support at a speed than we've ever done before. There was a different disagreement about one munition open public, the 2,000 pound bombs to describe that in public as an arms embargo, is completely exaggerated. The day that the shipment of 2,000 pound bombs did not go airplanes were delivering precision guided small diameter bombs. So it was a disagreement about an important, but a single, weapon system that for months colored the debate. Now I'm not saying there isn't a good reason.'

What did you discover that you didn't know before you came here? 'Look, I have never lived through a war day to day in the country fighting the war.

IDF blocks passage of displaced to northern Gaza over withholding...	Israel refuses to allow displaced Gazans to return to northern Gaza Strip without guarantees for Arbel Yehoud's release; Shots reportedly fired at displaced people attempting to return with one person killed by IDF fire Israel is trying to resolve the crisis of civilian Israeli Arbel Yehoud's prolonged captivity in Gaza despite the hostage return agreement. Arbel, who senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials have said is alive, was not released so far in the deal even though the agreement stipulated that civilians would be released before soldiers. It had been expected that she would be released Saturday in the second release of hostages in the first phase of the current agreement. The Prime Minister's Office announced that until her release is arranged, the Netzarim Corridor to the northern Gaza Strip will not be opened as stipulated in the cease-fire agreement. At the same time, Israel is working with the Americans to pressure Qatar to expedite Arbel's release. On Saturday afternoon, Palestinians reported that the IDF fired at displaced people who were trying to return to northern Gaza. At another location, on Salah a-Din Street, there was also IDF fire, reportedly killing one Gazan and wounding another. According to the IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari: 'Over the past day, IDF troops operated against threats posed to them in the Gaza Strip. IDF troops identified several gatherings of dozens of suspects that posed a threat to the forces. The troops fired warning shots to address the threat. ‏Contrary to the reports made over the past several hours, the IDF only fired warning shots to distance the suspects, and did not aim to shoot the suspects or to cause harm.' 'We emphasize that, as of now, we are unaware of any harm caused to the suspects as a result of the shooting. The IDF is determined to fully maintain the terms of the agreement to return the hostages. The IDF is prepared for any scenario and will take any necessary actions to thwart any immediate threat to IDF soldiers. The IDF calls the residents of Gaza to follow its announcements and avoid approaching the troops deployed in the area,' he added. A senior figure in one of the Palestinian terrorist organizations told the Al-Mayadeen network that 'Israel's lack of commitment to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza threatens to halt the implementation of the remaining terms of the agreement.' Meanwhile, an Egyptian source earlier told the AP that the issue of Arbel Yehoud's release and the withdrawal from Netzarim is a 'minor matter' that the mediators are working to resolve. The talks to resolve the issue are taking place behind the scenes, with Hamas claiming that the terror group has pledged to release Arbel next Saturday, while Israel is demanding guarantees for this. Israel is making it clear that the sooner Arbel is returned, the sooner the withdrawal from the Netzarim axis will begin. According to a source in the terrorist organizations, Arbel is a 'soldier' linked to the 'Israeli space program,' but these are unfounded claims. Israel has made it clear that Arbel Yehoud is alive and being held by another terror organization, but difficulties have arisen in transferring her to Hamas. Sources familiar with the details emphasized: 'Israel did not want to create a situation where it agrees to a violation. This is not frivolity, but insisting the agreement is upheld after consultations.' The prime minister's spokesman denied Hamas' claims Saturday evening that Israel received a sign of life from Arbel. Israel also asked the Americans to pressure the Qataris to promote a solution to the crisis. Mossad chief David Barnea is also holding intensive talks with the Qatari prime minister to find a solution. A White House spokesperson said that they continue to push for Arbel Yehoud's release through negotiation channels. One of the options being considered is that Hamas will give Israel a clear sign of life, or release her before the next time on Saturday. At the same time, there is concern that Hamas will further delay the list it was supposed to deliver on Saturday, which is supposed to list the number of living hostages. In Hamas' view, Israel is also currently violating the agreement, and therefore there is no certainty that they will agree to hand over this list. The Qataris are making an effort to find a solution that will prevent the deal from collapsing. Hamas has made accusation s against Israel, claiming that 'the occupation is still delaying the implementation of the cease-fire and prisoner exchange conditions, by continuing to close al-Rashid Street and preventing the return of displaced persons from the south to the north. We hold the occupation responsible for any disruption in the implementation of the agreement and its implications for the other stations.'

We are waiting and looking forward to the moment when we can hug our Arbel as soon as possible.' Meanwhile, NBC reported that Keith Siegel who holds American citizenship will be released in one week on Saturday as well as Sagui Dekel-Chen. The remaining freed American citizens are scheduled to be released in a second phase. In Israel, however, they say that both are on the list, but there is still no certainty that this will happen. 'There is no list yet,' an Israeli source said in response to the report. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkykw6gdje	2025-01-25T12:54:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/SyeuWJKGukx/SyeuWJKGukx_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
UN refugee chief calls for more help for Syria as refugees return...	The United Nations refugee chief said Saturday that some 200,000 refugees have returned to Syria from neighboring countries since the government of Bashar Assad was overthrown last month. The influx comes after an estimated 300,000 refugees returned from Lebanon late last year while it was under bombardment during the Israel-Hezbollah war. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi cautioned during a visit to Damascus during which he met with Syria's new de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, that many of the returnees may not stay unless living conditions in the country improve. He called for the lifting of Western sanctions on the country, many of which targeted Assad's government but have not been removed since it fell on Dec. 8 as the result of a lightning rebel offensive. There are more than 4.7 million refugees registered with the U.N. refugee agency, or UNHCR in neighboring countries. The largest number are in Turkey, with nearly 2.9 million, followed by Lebanon, with more than 755,000. In addition to returning refugees, some 600,000 out of an estimated 7 million internally displaced Syrians have gone home, Grandi said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjmt00cfoje	2025-01-25T12:35:22-08:00

The American billionaire, who caused a stir after being filmed performing a gesture reminiscent of the Nazi salute, said in a video speech at a conference of the far-right Alternative for Germany party: 'Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents' Billionaire Elon Musk made a surprise appearance via video link at an election event for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the eastern city of Halle on Saturday. Days before the world marks International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, Musk said that in Germany 'there is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that.' He said that 'children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents,' apparently referring to Germany's Nazi past. Speaking to an audience of 4,500 people, alongside party leader Alice Weidel, Musk added: 'We need to look at the future of Germany with optimism and enthusiasm. It's important to be proud of these German culture and values. It's about preserving German culture and protecting the German people. Convince people to vote AfD. Its (the party's) policies make sense.' Musk, who also spoke of suppression of speech under Germany's government, has previously attacked German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on X. Earlier this week, the American billionaire caused a stir after Donald Trump was sworn in as U.S. president. At the end of Musk's speech during the festivities he was filmed making a gesture reminiscent of the Nazi salute. Many were shocked by the disturbing gesture and accused Musk of fascism and antisemitism, with some even claiming that 'now the real Musk is starting to emerge.'

American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel reportedly slated for relea...	Senior US government source told NBC that the 65-year-old hostage, an American citizen, will be among the hostages released next Saturday; The source also said that Sagui Dekel-Chen, who has U.S. citizenship, will be released 'immediately after,' likely the next day Hostage Keith Siegel - who holds both American and Israeli citizenship - will be released in the next hostage return next Saturday, NBC reported on Saturday after the release of the four female from Hamas captivity. The network attributed the information to a senior American government official, who added that American-Israeli hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen will be released 'immediately after him.' The remaining American citizens are scheduled to be released in Phase II of the cease-fire and hostage release deal. Israeli officials, however, they say that both men are on the list, but there is still no certainty that when their release will happen. An Israeli source said in response to the report out of the U.S. that 'there is still no list' that would guarantee that Keith Siegel will indeed be released. In addition to Siegel in the next release, Hamas and Islamic Jihad promised to also release civilian Israeli woman Arbel Yehoud, who was supposed to be released in the current round. According to the agreement between Israel and Hamas, all the civilians were supposed to be released before the soldiers. In addition, IDF spokesman Brigadier General Daniel Hagari said that there is serious concern for the lives of Shiri Bibas and her children Ariel and Kfir. Hamas and Islamic Jihad confirmed that Arbel is alive. The Prime Minister's Office announced Saturday that until her release is arranged, the Netzarim Corridor will not be opened for the return of civilians to the northern Gaza Strip. In the afternoon, Palestinians reported that the IDF fired on displaced people who tried to return to the Netzarim Corridor area.

White House lifts embargo on sending heavy bombs, D9 bulldozers t...	Critical shipment for Israel unfrozen by the Trump administration includes 1,700 heavy bombs for the Air Force from Boeing and 134 D9 bulldozers from Caterpillar The White House on Saturday lifted the embargo on supplying 2,000-pound heavy bombs and D9 bulldozers to Israel. This means that the shipment that the Biden administration had delayed, out of fear that Israel would use bombs in population centers in Gaza, will now arrive in the country. The critical shipment that has now been unfrozen includes, among other things, 1,700 heavy bombs for the Air Force from Boeing, along with 134 D9 bulldozers from Caterpillar and other weapons. The IDF had already prepared in advance for the unfrozen embargo on this shipment, in preparation for Trump's entry into the White House. The bombs for the Air Force, which the defense establishment had already purchased from Boeing - using shekels and not in aid dollars - weighing close to a ton per bomb, were frozen, since the US was concerned that the IDF might harm civilians with them. The decision to freeze them was made shortly before the start of the ground operation in Rafah, due to American concerns about using them in such a densely populated area. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The use of the D9 bulldozer to flatten buildings in the Gaza Strip led to major internal criticism in the U.S., protests, and tremendous pressure on the Biden administration, which gave in and froze their delivery for months. The results on the ground were evident in both theaters of war: An examination conducted by Ynet in November revealed that many dozens of existing D9 bulldozers, which were most active during the IDF's operations in the Gaza Strip for months between November last year and the beginning and middle of this year, require maintenance. These bulldozers were also needed in southern Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryn2anmojl	2025-01-25T10:50:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/rybWjsAwJe/rybWjsAwJe_0_40_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
CIA now says COVID-19 'more likely' to have come from lab	I onclude whether COVID-19 was the result of a lab incident or it originated in nature. But in the final weeks of the Biden administration, former CIA Director William Burns asked CIA analysts and scientists to make a clear determination, stressing the pandemic's historical significance, according to a senior U.S. official. The CIA says it has 'low confidence' in its assessment that a 'research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely' and notes in its statement that both scenarios - lab origin and natural origin - remain plausible. China's government says it supports and has taken part in research to determine COVID-19's origin, and has accused Washington of politicizing the matter, especially because of efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate. Beijing has said claims that a laboratory leak likely caused the pandemic have no credibility. â€œThatâ€™s a day-one thing for me,' he said. 'Iâ€™ve been on record as you know in saying I think our intelligence, our science, and our common sense all really dictate that the origins of COVID was a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ugr2zdjx	2025-01-25T10:41:27-08:00

The move was widely expected. Biden put the hold on the delivery of those bombs due to concern over the impact they could have in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.

Families of 3 women who remain in Gaza celebrate return of 4 fema...	After the release of the four soldiers, three young women remain in Hamas captivity: Arbel Yehoud, 29, Shiri Bibas, 33, and soldier Agam Berger, 20, who is due to be released in the next round The Berger family said on Saturday afternoon that they are happy about the return of Naama Levy, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Liri Albag and are waiting for the return of Agam, who is due to be released in the next round, provided that Hamas abides by the agreement. Alongside Agam, Israel is demanding that civilian Arbel Yehoud, who was due to be released before the soldiers, be released in the next round - and even before her. According to reports, American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, 65, will also be released with them. The IDF spokesperson said there is serious concern for the life of hostage Shiri Bibas, and the lives of her young children Ariel and Kfir. Agam Berger's story and the family's response 'Thank you to the people of Israel for the warm embrace,' the family said. 'We are happy and excited about the return of our four daughters home, we are all one big family! We are waiting and looking forward to embracing Agam, with God's help, as early as next week. We will not rest until all the hostages are returned home safely.' Aharon, Agam's grandfather, spoke with Ynet at the Hostage Square in Tel Aviv. 'I look forward to seeing her next week, and hope that they will abide by all the agreements. The liaison officer informed us that it will be next week,' he saud. 'I am happy, but disappointed that Agam is not among them,' Aharon also said. 'But this is reality. What can be done? I am also disappointed with the entire conduct of the negotiations. More could have been done, and earlier. On the one hand, I am very happy for the families that we know well, and I know how the parents feel, but let's hope it will be okay. The enemy is unpredictable, like the Israeli government. Like they did the first time and blew the whole deal for nothing and it cost people's lives.' Did it encourage you to see them smiling and standing on their feet? 'Very much. Of course. What a question, I am also preparing to meet them, they knew that.' On the morning of October 7, when she fled to bomb shelter, Agam forgot her phone in the bedroom. She called her sister Bar from the phone of one of her friends, the late Shirat Yam Amar. In the first call, she told her parents that she was safe on base, that everything was fine. About 20 minutes later, she called again, and said one last sentence: 'Mom, they are shooting at us, there are terrorists, everyone is crying, but I am not afraid.' That morning, five female reconnaissance soldiers were kidnapped from the Nahal Oz outpost by Hamas. Noa Marciano was also taken but was murdered at Shifa Hospital and later recovered by the IDF. Ori Magidish was rescued alive by the IDF in a daring operation. Arbel Yehoud's story and the family's response Arbel Yehoud, 29, a civilian from Nir Oz, was supposed to be released, but Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed 'technical difficulties' before her release. Arbel's family said earlier that 'our hearts are filled with joy over the return of Karina, Daniela, Liri and Naama. We are waiting and looking forward to the moment when we can embrace our Arbel as soon as possible.' Israel has informed Hamas and Islamic Jihad that it will not allow the return of displaced people to the northern Gaza Strip until reliable guarantees are received for the release of Arbel, who is alive. On Saturday afternoon, there were reports in Gaza of fatal shots at displaced people who were waiting to travel to northern Gaza. There is optimism that the crisis will be resolved, since the Islamic Jihad confirmed that she was in their hands. The Yehoud family is a descendant of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz, and children Dolev, Neta and Arbel are the third generation who chose to start a family there. On October 7, all three of them were in their apartments on the kibbutz. Their parents left Nir Oz a few years ago, but remained connected to the community. During the kidnapping, the terrorists murdered the couple's dog, which they had adopted shortly before October 7. They named her Murph, after the heroine in Arbel's favorite movie, 'Interstellar' Arbel, the youngest, was kidnapped from her apartment with her partner Ariel Cunio, who has not been included at this point on the lists of hostages set to be returned in this phase of the release deal. Ariel's brother, David Cunio, was also kidnapped and held captive, while his wife Sharon and his two daughters were released in the first deal in November 2023. During the kidnapping, the terrorists murdered the couple's dog, which they had adopted shortly before October 7. They named her Murph, after the heroine in Arbel's favorite movie, 'Interstellar.' 'Arbel has a magnetic smile, no one can resist it,' said her father. 'She is in touch with the elderly on the kibbutz and always helps them with a lot of patience. I would come to the kibbutz once a week and leave with pride.' Dolev, the oldest, was murdered on October 7 after he went out to treat the wounded as a volunteer medic for Magen David Adom, leaving behind his three children and his wife, who was then pregnant with their fourth daughter. For months, the family thought Dolev had been kidnapped, until his body was found in June. Neta Yehoud, the middle brother, was besieged in a bomb shelter for 11 hours with his daughter. His wife Hodaya was abroad at the time. The terrorists entered and left their home three times and, despite this, the two survived. In the evening, He left his daughter in the kibbutz's compound and went looking for his siblings, Dolev and Arbel. He did not find his brother, but came across the bodies of friends and burned-down houses, including the house of the neighbors, the Bibas family. The Bibas family's story and the family's response Shiri Bibas and her children Ariel and Kfir were supposed to be released in the previous deal before it broke down. In this deal, they were supposed to be top priorities but Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not releasing them. Unfortunately, there are grave concerns for the lives of the Bibas family – Yarden, Shiri, Ariel and Kfir – which Israel has not received any indication. 'Morning 477, we did not rest tonight either,' the Bibas family said Saturday. 'Yesterday at 4:00 p.m. when the list of released hostages was published, our world collapsed on us. Although they had prepared us for this, we had hoped to see Shiri and the children on the list that was supposed to be a list of civilians.' They criticized the media for ignoring Shiri and the children, and reporting mainly about the fact that Arbel Yehoud from Nir Oz was not among the freed women. 'In the evening, when we turned on the news, our pain, our struggle and, especially, the important discourse about the complexity of not being on the list disappeared from the media. Dear supporters, who do not give up, continue to pray, hope and demand answers. An exciting and complex day lies ahead. Liri, Daniella, Naama, and Karina, we are waiting to see you smiling and wrapped up in your amazing families at home.' Shortly after the news was published, and after the release of the four soldiers, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari issued a statement to the media: 'We are committed to the return of Agam Berger, who is still in captivity. Hamas did not live up to the agreement in its obligation to return civilians first. We will insist that Arbel Yehoud return, as well as Shiri and the children of the Bibas family, for whom we have very serious concerns and we expect certainty in this matter, and that they return soon.' The Bibas family was kidnapped on October 7 from their home in Nir Oz. During the war, footage from the day of the kidnapping was released, showing Shiri, Ariel and Kfir being led through the streets of Khan Younis, and Yarden being led on a motorcycle through a Gazan crowd. Hamas claimed in late November 2023 that Shiri and her two children were not alive. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The terrorist organization did not publish any proof of this, and Israel did not signal at the time that there was any indication of this. It was claimed that they were being held by another organization.

Daniela, Liri, Naama and Karina were held together for much of the time and were often forced to loo after their captors' children and cook for the terrorists while receiving very little food for themselves; They are said to have met 'very serious Hamas figures' during their captivity and heard their parents interviewed on the radio and saw their pictures on signs in Israel Daniela Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev, who returned to Israel on Saturday after 477 days in Hamas captivity , were held throughout the period in civilian apartments and tunnels, in poor sanitary conditions, and often did not shower for long periods. They were forced to cook and clean for their captors, sometimes even while receiving little food for themselves. In addition, the four returned hostages were exposed to the media at times, when they were able to listen to the radio and heard their families on it. Therefore, when they met with their parents and sibings for the first time after their release, the young soldiers told them what heroes they were. 'You were truly my strength. I heard you so much, and you are truly the only ones who gave me hope,' Liri told her parents, after telling her family that she had heard them while she was in captivity. In addition, they also knew about the hostage release deal that took place in November 2023, and one of them heard her family members wishing her well on the radio on her birthday. At times, the four were held together, and at times they were forced to babysit the children of some of their captors. During their captivity, as could be seen in the psychological terror video released by Hamas after their release, they learned to speak Arabic. The Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation reported that all four female observers who returned Saturday were held together in captivity with Agam Berger, who is due to be released in the third round next Saturday, and that in recent days they were separated from her - a separation that was very difficult for them. It also noted that during the first days of captivity, an adult was with them who took care of their food and showering, and mediated between them and the terrorists. They were moved from place to place within Gaza City disguised as Palestinian women, and were held both in tunnels and in buildings. The public broadcaster reported that that the main media outlet to which they were exposed while in captivity was Al-Jazeera, and Hamas terrorists told them about the IDF's fighting in the Gaza Strip. Thus, they knew about the incident in which 21 fighters were killed in a building explosion, and said that they felt that December 2023 was the month with the most significant fighting. The public broadcaster's report also noted that Liri Abag was the one who took care of the group, spoke to the terrorists, and was the 'leader.' Regarding Hamas' attempt to humiliate them by releasing them by putting them on stage, an attempt that failed, they said: 'We showed them on stage, it didn't move us. We are stronger than that.' In the helicopter, they joked with the families, asking them to speak Arabic and saying that otherwise they wouldn't understand. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: According to a report on the Keshet network, some of the kidnapped women met 'very senior Hamas officials' during their captivity. It was also reported that they told their families that 'there were times when there was no food, and when the IDF attacked nearby places, it was scary. We supported each other and held each other.' In addition, according to the report, they told the families that the fight for them gave them hope, and also that 'we saw our pictures on the signs in Israel, we even laughed about the choice of pictures.' Liri said that she saw the hat her family took out, with the inscription 'Hope' like her tattoo. The same report also noted that Naama Levy was in captivity with Doron Steinbrecher, who was released last week, and they did sports exercises together to keep themselves fit. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skxrfnfdjg	2025-01-25T10:15:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/ryrLroMOyl/ryrLroMOyl_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

We can’t believe Liri is back with us': Freed hostage's parents ...	PM tells parents of freed hostage Liri Albag, 'My wife and I, along with the entire nation, embrace Liri and her friends'; parents express gratitude but add, 'There are still 90 hostages. Everyone deserves this moment' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Saturday evening with Shira and Eli Albag, parents of freed hostage Liri Albag, following her release alongside three other IDF lookouts. 'My wife and I, along with all Israelis, embrace Liri and her friends as they return to the light,' Netanyahu said, adding, 'This is a joyous day. Through great efforts by the IDF and everyone involved, we’ve achieved this outcome. We’re working to secure the release of all remaining hostages.' The Albags expressed their gratitude: 'We can’t believe Liri is back with us. The nation is joyous, and we feel immense happiness in our hearts.' Eli urged, 'There are still 90 hostages. We trust you’ll do everything to bring them home.' Shira added, 'This joy cannot be described. Liri and the others are heroes, and all captives deserve this moment.' Earlier, Liri reunited with her parents at the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva after arriving by helicopter. She held a sign reading, 'I love you, citizens of Israel, IDF soldiers and my family. I’m back!' Her landing was greeted by cheers from relatives wearing shirts celebrating their pride.

Families gathered at the hospital cheered as the helicopter landed, while others wore shirts celebrating their relatives’ service. Earlier, emotional footage captured their reunion with parents at a reception center near the Gaza border, where they embraced and shed tears of relief and joy. Liri Albag held a sign during her helicopter ride that read, 'I love you, citizens of Israel, IDF soldiers and my family. I’m back,' and signed a heart with her hands upon landing. The hospital confirmed the soldiers are undergoing sensitive medical and psychological evaluations. 'This is an emotionally and medically complex event for the returnees, their families and the nation,' said Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Health Ministry's Medical Division, emphasizing the importance of respecting their privacy during recovery. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Shin Bet head Ronen Bar, Mossad Director David Barnea and POW Coordinator Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon monitored the return process from a command center. 'Their return is part of our victory in this war,' said Halevi. 'We remain committed to bringing back all captives, soldiers and civilians.'

Hamas parades hostages in cynical show as terrorists stage unity ...	In Gaza City’s Palestine Square, where 4 hostages handed to Red Cross, armed terrorists and civilians gather in 'display of unity'; despite calls to avoid endangering them, women paraded onstage to wave; Israel says timing served Hamas propaganda Dozens of armed terrorists from Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and other factions gathered Saturday at Gaza City’s Palestine Square alongside hundreds of civilians in a display of force before the release of four IDF female hostages. The captives—Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev and Daniella Gilboa—were paraded on stage in uniforms, waving and smiling at the crowd in what Israeli officials called a cynical Hamas spectacle. The hostages were handed over to Red Cross vehicles in the square, surrounded by heavily armed terrorists and banners declaring 'Zionism will not win' in Hebrew. Photos of Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, were trampled on by attendees. The gathering sought to showcase unity among terrorist factions amid the ongoing phased prisoner exchange deal. Hamas terrorists, arriving in trucks and motorcycles, underscored their control by blasting propaganda songs and displaying banners supporting Jenin, where Israel continues operations targeting terror hubs. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had reportedly urged Hamas to avoid such displays, warning they endangered the hostages. ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said this week, 'We continue discussions to improve safety and security at every stage. Mechanisms must prevent unnecessary exposure of those returning to their families.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Hamas reportedly pushed for the early release of the four captives to showcase the prisoner swap as a victory. However, disagreements over the list of Palestinian detainees to be freed led to last-minute delays. A Hamas official told Qatar’s Al-Arabi station that Israel initially sought to alter the prisoner list but later retracted the changes. The Palestinian Authority's Prisoner Information Office claimed errors in the submitted list and said efforts were underway to correct them. Hamas claimed facilities at Khan Younis’ European Hospital had been prepared to receive freed detainees. Red Cross teams have also been stationed at the site. The IDF issued warnings to Gaza residents attempting to return north, citing the potential for friction with Israeli forces along the Netzarim Corridor and other areas. 'All existing directives remain in effect. Approaching IDF forces in Gaza poses significant danger,' the IDF said. The statement highlighted risks in southern Gaza near Rafah and the Philadelphi Corridor, warning against fishing or diving in coastal waters. Movement along the Netzarim Corridor remains contingent on Hamas adhering fully to the agreement. Hamas’ Interior Ministry called on its officials to facilitate the safe return of displaced civilians to their homes. Interior Ministry Chair Mahmoud Abu Watfa issued a statement praising staff efforts throughout the war while instructing readiness for the return process. 'We salute those who sacrificed and suffered throughout the 15-month war,' Abu Watfa said, adding that authorities would work to support returning residents and ensure their reintegration into Gaza’s communities. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ffdumojx	2025-01-25T03:29:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/rJluT7zuyl/rJluT7zuyl_0_209_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Reunited after 477 days: The stories of the four freed Israeli so...	Liri calmed everyone amid chaos; Naama kept her courage despite injured leg; Daniella asked her mom to pray for her; Karina urged her sister to stay strong for their parents; these are the stories of the 4 IDF lookouts who returned home from Hamas captivity On Saturday, IDF lookouts Liri Albag, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev were released from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip. However, Agam Berger, who was abducted with them, and Arbel Yehoud, who was supposed to be released in Saturday's exchnage, remain in captivity. Israel informed the mediators this constitutes a violation of the agreement, but ultimately decided to accept the list provided by Hamas. Seven IDF lookouts were abducted from the Nahal Oz outpost, becoming symbols of the atrocities of October 7. Ori Magidish was rescued by Israeli forces shortly after, while Noa Marciano was murdered in captivity, and her body was returned to Israel. Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Agam Berger, Karina Ariev and Daniella Gilboa endured 15 months in Hamas captivity, during which their families waged a relentless battle for their return. The sister of Shai Ashram, one of the lookouts who fell in Nahal Oz, shared a photo of her sister alongside Roni Eshel, Aviv Hajaj and Gilboa, who returned on Saturday. A mother's protest The mothers of the IDF lookouts have been particularly active in the Mothers' Protest – known as Watch 101. They gather at government buildings, dressed in white, silently demanding the return of their daughters and all the hostages. At a recent vigil, Naama's mother, Ayelet Levy-Shahar, said: 'The girls are out there in the rain and cold. Without coats, without their freedom and without their mothers. My heart can’t dwell on it for more than a few seconds – it’s unbearable. The entire nation owes these hostages their rescue.' Eli Albag, Liri’s father, shared Saturday morning: 'They’re standing on their feet, smiling – they’re heroes. It’s about time. We’re all so excited and want to hug her. She’s waiting for her ‘Abush’ – that’s what she calls me. I’ll tell her, ‘My sweetheart, my treasure.’ She’s okay. It’s important to remember, in this moment of joy, that there are families still worried, and our hearts are with them. We will never forget the families of the fallen, whose sacrifice brought us to this moment. And there are still 90 hostages who need to come home now.' Liri Albag Liri arrived at the base on Wednesday after completing the IDF lookouts course. 'We call her ‘Sara Davara’ because she’s always wandering around and exploring,' her sisters said in their first interview after her abduction. 'She has so many friends, and everything about her is calm and positive. ‘Don’t get upset, the world is beautiful,’ that’s what she always tells us.' When the attack began, Liri called her mother, Shira: 'She said, ‘Mom, there’s a crazy rocket attack here. We jumped out of bed; there wasn’t even a siren.’ I asked if she was okay, and she replied, ‘Everything is fine, people are alive here. We’re in the shelter.’ She even sent me a picture, and I saw that the shelter was open on both sides. I told her it wasn’t a proper shelter, and Liri replied, ‘Mom, everything’s fine. Everyone is here, all the girls. Don’t worry.’ Later, I learned that most of the girls were saying their goodbyes to their families. She didn’t say goodbye; she reassured everyone that everything was fine.' Liri also sent a selfie to her boyfriend, Nir, who had been severely injured in a car-ramming attack six months earlier during his military service. Liri stayed by his bedside and even got a tattoo of the word 'FAITH' to symbolize her belief in his recovery. After her abduction, her family also got the same tattoo. Nir managed to speak with her at 7:50 a.m., but by 8:10 a.m., she no longer responded. 'I was terrified,' he said. 'A few hours later, a friend sent me a video showing several girls in a military vehicle. One of them was badly injured and wearing a blue sweatshirt just like Liri’s. I completely broke down.' Naama Levy Naama’s family learned about her abduction from a Telegram video, which has become a symbol of October 7. Before enlisting, she attended the preparatory program at Be’er Ora, and she arrived at Nahal Oz just days after completing the IDF lookouts course. Her mother, Ayelet Levy-Shahar, recalled: 'I had a heavy feeling the day Naama enlisted. Naama, in contrast, felt very positive. She didn’t experience any shock and looked so sweet in her uniform. She even told me on her way to the base to schedule her an appointment to get her uniforms tailored for her first time home, and that it had to be ready that same day. It was very important to her that everything be tidy and organized.' The family, along with the rest of the world, later saw footage of Naama being led to Gaza in blood-stained pajamas, limping toward the vehicle that would take her to captivity. Her friends launched a project called Dressing Like Naama, and presented the initiative in the Knesset, wearing clothes identical to those she wore on the day of her abduction. The family of Naama, an athlete, participated in sports events to raise awareness about her captivity. Months ago, the family released a photo of Naama from her early days in captivity. 'She has a black eye and looks terrified,' her brother Amit said. 'You can still see her courage and kindness, which perhaps gave strength to others around her. But there’s a limit to what a person can endure – her time is running out.' Daniella Gilboa Unlike Liri and Naama, Daniella and Karina had already been serving at the base for some time when they were abducted. In fact, during their captivity, their official discharge dates from the IDF passed. Daniella, who was abducted under the name Danielle, is referred to as Dana by her friends. She plays piano, sings and writes. Shortly before her abduction, her family moved into a new home designed around a grand piano purchased for her, which she barely had a chance to play. On the morning of the attack, Daniella texted her mother, Orly, saying she could hear explosions and gunfire. 'I thought it was trivial since she’s near Gaza,' Orly said. 'I didn’t understand the magnitude of the event. I asked if she was in a shelter, and she replied with an emoji. Basically, she was telling me, ‘Mom, stop asking silly questions.’ Later, she texted, ‘Mom, pray for us,’ and that’s when it hit me. I tried calling her, but her phone could no longer be reached.' On the 107th day of her captivity, Hamas released a video of her and Karina along with now-liberated hostage Doron Steinbrecher. 'She seemed strong and assertive, but psychological diagnosis said she's in a rough mental state,' Orly said. Karina Ariev Karina spoke with her parents twice on the morning of the attack before sending them a farewell message. She also texted her sister Sasha: 'If I don’t survive, take care of Mom and Dad your entire life. Don’t sink into despair—live.' On the 54th day of the war, her sister Sasha shared: 'Karina always used to joke with me that since I’m older, I’ll die before her. I’m begging you to make sure of it. Make sure I die before her. I saw a video of her injured, and since then, I know nothing. Fifty-four days—has anyone treated her?' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She turned to women’s organizations and asked: 'Why are you silent? If something like this happened to you, to your sister, to your mother, to your daughters, you wouldn’t stay quiet. You must be the voice for the women who need you. Where is our sisterhood? Where is our humanity?' On Karina’s bed at her home in Jerusalem, birthday gifts from her best friend are still waiting for her. Her friend had ordered them from abroad for Karina’s birthday in August, but they were delayed and only arrived in October. While Karina was still at the base, her friend came to her room, arranged the gifts on her bed and left a note saying she loved her and couldn’t wait for her to come home and see the surprise. Karina never got the chance to see it. Next to those gifts are others brought by her sister from all the places she visited around the world as part of delegations advocating for the hostages. 'Everywhere I went, I bought something I thought she’d like, something to show her that we were thinking about her all the time,' Sasha shared. 'Every day, I go into her room and tell her I’m by her side. I tell her, ‘Just a little longer, I’m coming, and I won’t leave you.’ The moment she comes back, I won’t leave her side—whether she wants me to or not.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1wpsrfokg	2025-01-25T03:22:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/Sy7jLpBMO1e/Sy7jLpBMO1e_206_95_1056_595_0_small.jpg

Liri kept everyone calm amid chaos, Naama maintained her courage even with an injured leg, Daniella asked her mom to pray for her and Karina asked her sister to take care of the parents and avoid despair - These are the stories of the 4 IDF lookouts that have returned home from Hamas captivity On Saturday, IDF lookouts Liri Albag, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Karina Ariev were released from Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip. However, Agam Berger, who was abducted with them, and Arbel Yehoud, who was supposed to be released in this phase, remain in captivity. Israel informed the mediators this constitutes a violation of the agreement, but ultimately decided to accept the list provided by Hamas. Seven IDF lookouts were abducted from the Nahal Oz post, becoming symbols of both heroism and abandonment on October 7.

Liri stayed by his bedside and even got a tattoo of the word 'FAITH' to symbolize her belief in his recovery. After her abduction, her family members also got the same tattoo. Nir managed to speak with her at 07:50, but by 08:10, she no longer responded. 'I was terrified,' he said. 'A few hours later, a friend sent me a video showing several girls in a military vehicle. One of them was badly injured and wearing a blue sweatshirt just like Liri’s. I completely broke down.' Naama Levy Naama’s family learned about her abduction from a Telegram video, which has become a symbol of October 7. Before enlisting, she attended the preparatory program at Be’er Ora, and she arrived at Nahal Oz just days after completing the IDF lookouts’ course. Her mother, Eilat Levy-Shahar, recalled: 'I had a heavy feeling the day Naama enlisted. Naama, in contrast, felt very positive. She didn’t experience any shock and looked so sweet in her uniform. She even told me on her way to the base to schedule her a seamstress appointment for her first time home, and that it had to be ready that same day. It was very important to her that everything be tidy and organized.' The family, along with the rest of the world, later saw footage of Naama being led to Gaza in blood-stained pajamas, limping toward the vehicle that would take her to captivity. Her friends launched a project called 'Dressing Like Naama,' even presenting the initiative in the Knesset, wearing clothes identical to those she wore when abducted. Naama, an athlete, had her family participate in sports events to raise awareness about her captivity. Months ago, the family released a photo of Naama from her early days in captivity. 'She has a black eye and looks terrified,' her brother Amit said. 'You can still see her courage and kindness, which perhaps gave strength to others around her. But there’s a limit to what one can endure – her time is running out.' Daniella Gilboa Unlike Liri and Naama, Daniella and Karina had already been serving at the base for some time when they were abducted. In fact, during their captivity, their official discharge dates from the IDF passed. Daniella, who was abducted under the name Daniel, is referred to as Dana by her friends. She plays piano, sings, and writes. Shortly before her abduction, her family moved into a new home designed around a grand piano purchased for her, which she barely had time to play. On the morning of the attack, Daniella texted her mother, Orly, saying she could hear explosions and gunfire. 'I thought it was trivial since she’s near Gaza,' Orly said. 'I didn’t understand the magnitude of the event. I asked if she was in a protected area, and she replied with an emoji. Basically, she was telling me, ‘Mom, stop asking silly questions.’ Later, she texted, ‘Mom, pray for us,’ and that’s when it hit me. I tried calling her, but her phone was no longer available.' On the 107th of her captivity, Hamas released a video of her and Karina along with now-liberated hostage Doron Steinbrecher. 'She seemed strong and assertive, but psychological diagnosis said she's in a rough mental state,' Orly said. Karina Ariev Karina spoke with her parents twice on the morning of the attack before sending them a farewell message. She also texted her sister Sasha: 'If I don’t survive, take care of Mom and Dad your entire life. Don’t sink into despair—live.' On the 54th day of the war, her sister Sasha shared: 'Karina always used to joke with me that since I’m older, I’ll die before her. I’m begging you to make sure of it. Make sure I die before her. I saw a video of her injured, and since then, I know nothing. Fifty-four days—has anyone treated her?' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She turned to women’s organizations and asked: 'Why are you silent? If something like this happened to you, to your sister, to your mother, to your daughters, you wouldn’t stay quiet. You must be the voice for the women who need you. Where is our sisterhood? Where is our humanity?' On Karina’s bed at her home in Jerusalem, birthday gifts from her best friend are still waiting for her. Her friend had ordered them from abroad for Karina’s birthday in August, but they were delayed and only arrived in October. While Karina was still at the base, her friend came to her room, arranged the gifts on her bed, and left a note saying she loved her and couldn’t wait for her to come home and see the surprise. Karina never got the chance to see it. Next to those gifts are others brought by her sister from all the places she visited around the world as part of delegations advocating for the hostages. 'Everywhere I went, I bought something I thought she’d like, something to show her that we were thinking about her all the time,' Sasha shared. 'Every day, I go into her room and tell her I’m by her side. I tell her, ‘Just a little longer, I’m coming, and I won’t leave you.’ The moment she comes back, I won’t leave her side—whether she wants me to or not.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/b1wpsrfokg	2025-01-25T03:22:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/SJomU4zOJg/SJomU4zOJg_0_0_1600_1110_0_small.jpg

Four IDF hostages reunite with families after release from Hamas ...	Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Naama Levy and Daniella Gilboa reunited with their families in southern Israel after 477 days in Hamas captivity; military officials confirm medical checks conducted in Gaza, with no need for special intervention Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Naama Levy and Daniella Gilboa, four IDF soldiers held captive by Hamas for 477 days, were reunited with their parents on Saturday afternoon at a reception facility in Re’im. Their release followed intense negotiations and their transfer from Gaza to the Red Cross, then to Israeli forces. Military sources confirmed that the four underwent medical evaluations by IDF Medical Corps teams in Gaza after being handed over by the Red Cross. Officials reported their health as stable, with no immediate need for specialized treatment. At the Re’im facility, Chief Medical Officer Brig. Gen. Prof. Elon Glassberg and mental health counselors prepared to provide comprehensive care. Upon their release, the soldiers smiled and waved at their parents, who watched live footage of the transfer. A military officer told them their families were watching, and the hostages responded with emotional smiles and waves. The IDF released footage of the women discarding uniforms given by Hamas, embracing military officers and smiling as they returned to Israeli custody. The soldiers were among five female lookouts abducted from Nahal Oz on October 7. Their release included a staged presentation by Hamas in Gaza City’s Palestine Square, where they were paraded in uniforms, told to wave and walked across a terrorist-filled plaza before being handed over to the Red Cross.

We will not rest until we bring back all our sisters and brothers from the hell of captivity in Gaza – the living to their loving families, and the fallen and murdered to be laid to rest in dignity.

Will faith drive a 'golden era' for America and the Middle East?	Congressional Allies Caucus re-launches in festive event on Capitol Hill. Israel Allies Foundation president says 'we see the God of Israel in action' with inauguration of Donald Trump The 'people of faith' in the United States are ready to reclaim their influence in every branch of government and shape policy like never before. That was the central message this week in Washington, highlighted by a series of events culminating in the re-launch of the Congressional Allies Caucus at the Capitol. The event took place just one day after U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration. The Congressional Allies Caucus is part of a global network of 54 caucuses and 1,500 legislative leaders, which originated with the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus in 2004. In Washington, the caucus has been active since 2006 but experienced a significant surge in prominence during Trump's first term in office from 2017 to 2021. Today, the group boasts 70 members, nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. While it is a 'working caucus,' as Israel Allies Foundation President Josh Reinstein described, this week's events were as much a celebration as they were a reflection of the group's shared vision: renewed support for Israel and a transformative agenda under the new administration. More than 15 members of Congress attended the re-launch on January 21, including key figures poised to take on top roles in the White House. Among them was Dr. David Weldon, a founding member of the caucus, recently nominated to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'There is one thing that brought us all to this room today, and that is faith,' Reinstein said during his remarks. 'We are people of faith, and because we're people of faith and we believe in God, we stand together.' Reinstein highlighted the resilience of Israel and its supporters following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack that claimed 1,200 Israeli lives. The people who support Israel were 'shocked' and 'saddened' but 'not broken,' he said. 'The people of Israel united, and Christians worldwide united and stood up strong for Israel,' Reinstein added. 'We did this because we knew what was coming next, because we believe in the Bible, in the prophecies, and know that it's true.' Reinstein described this moment as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy and credited Trump's inauguration with ushering in a new era of action for Israel. 'We see the God of Israel in action,' he said. Reinstein noted that Trump had already nominated several caucus insiders for influential roles. In addition to Weldon, Rev. Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas Governor and recipient of the Israel Allies Foundation award, was nominated as the first evangelical U.S. Ambassador to Israel. Pete Hegseth, who spent years advocating for Israel's story, was tapped as Secretary of Defense. 'All of these people are now the leadership of the United States, and it's a miracle,' Reinstein said. He emphasized how Trump had achieved goals the caucus had pursued for decades with a single stroke of a pen. For example, Trump through an executive order this week defunded the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), a goal the caucus had championed for nearly 20 years. The caucus also pushed for sanctions on the International Criminal Court, which Trump likewise enacted earlier this week. The sanctions would place the court under investigation for 90 days to evaluate its future relationship with the U.S. 'We will have to find new ways to stand with Israel that we haven't thought of because the ones we've been working on are either happening, just happened, or are about to happen,' Reinstein said. 'It's because of men and women of faith who got involved in the process and brought their faith to diplomacy.' The Congressional Israel Allies Caucus is co-chaired by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), Rep. Brad Schneider (D-IL), and newly appointed co-chair Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX), all of whom were in attendance at the Capitol. 'There has never been a more critical time for bipartisan support for Israel from the Congressional Israel Allies Caucus. Between the ceasefire with Hamas and the staged release of the hostages, Israel needs America's commitment to its qualitative military edge more than ever,' said the caucus's U.S. director, Jordanna McMillan. 'It is an honor to serve as co-chair of the Israel Allies Caucus in the 119th Congress. Strengthening the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel has always been a priority for me,' said Schneider. 'I am proud to help lead this bipartisan effort to advance our shared values, support Israel's security, and promote peace and prosperity in the region.' On the Brink of Transformation The re-launch comes at a pivotal moment, a theme echoed throughout the room, as the Middle East stands on the brink of transformation. With the weakening of the Iranian axis and growing prospects for peace and stability, this is a critical time for the region. Pastor Jim Scudder of Illinois, who attended the event, explained that several key issues are already on the table for the caucus. At the forefront is 'squeezing Iran.' 'We have to strangle the money flow and impose sanctions,' he said. 'We're calling on Trump to do so.' Another priority is Judea and Samaria. A delegation of leaders was in Washington, D.C., to launch a new caucus, the Judea and Samaria Caucus, which aims to push for sovereignty over the area Christians regard as the Biblical heartland. That caucus will work closely with the Congressional Allies Caucus. According to Yesha Council international spokeswoman Eliana Passentin, the day before the inauguration, the council ran an electronic billboard campaign in Times Square to express appreciation for Trump's support for the State of Israel. Additionally, the council sent a letter of blessing to the president. Congressman Mike Lawler (R-NY) told attendees that the Biden administration 'failed miserably concerning strengthening and expanding the Abraham Accords.' He shared that he recently sent a letter to Trump urging him to fill the role of special envoy for the Abraham Accords—a position Lawler helped create on a bipartisan basis. 'It is vital we get Saudi Arabia to the table, and we need to normalize relations between the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia together to ensure lasting peace and prosperity,' Lawler said. Congressman Don Bacon (R-NE) explained his support for Israel in three ways: spiritual, moral, and practical. 'When we sell weapons to Israel, they make them better and send them back to us,' he said. 'It's a win-win relationship. Their technology helps us, our technology helps them. Our trade helps each other. Their intelligence helps our intelligence, and vice versa. So we have a win-win relationship with the only democracy in that region.' However, some cautioned against becoming overly optimistic, emphasizing that much work remains. 'We have the potential of this being the beginning of a golden era,' said Dr. Susan Michael, who pioneered the American branch of the International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem. 'But believe me, we still have a lot of work to do. We're going to be doing the work with the wind behind our back. It is going to be a bit easier, but there is still a lot of work.' She highlighted misinformation campaigns against Israel on college campuses and the rise of antisemitism as key challenges her team plans to help tackle. Faith as a Driving Force Faith has been a cornerstone of Trump's leadership approach since his first term. His top faith advisor, Rev. Paula White, has built a network of more than 60,000 faith leaders to support the White House. This time, she is expected to take on an official role focused on faith-based diplomacy. During Trump's first term, around 10,000 faith leaders engaged with the White House—not just for celebrations or events, but to sit at the table with the president and his advisors to help shape policy. 'This is going to be just the most amazing, historic, largest faith effort of any administration in all history,' White said. 'There is such great momentum, and I believe there's been so much prayer for this to come forth in America. People have been struggling with faith in America. I believe this movement is going to be able to counter what we have seen here in the United States.' White added that if faith leaders felt Trump's first term was successful, 'we will do so much better this time around.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj4rgbfo1e	2025-01-25T02:07:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/25/Hkga11rrGu1g/Hkga11rrGu1g_59_0_622_351_0_small.jpg

Israel demands UNRWA’s removal from Jerusalem within days	UN Palestinian relief agency ordered to halt all operations in Jerusalem by Jan. 30, citing ties to terror groups; UNRWA pledges to continue operations in Palestinian areas despite legal and logistical hurdles As the freshly-minted law banning the United Nations Palestinian relief agency UNRWA goes into effect, Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon informed UN Secretary-General António Guterres Friday night that the agency must cease all activities in Jerusalem by Thursday, January 30, as mandated by the new legislation, and vacate all buildings from which it operates. The proposed legislation, which passed with an overwhelming majority in the Knesset with 92 votes in favor and 10 against, was introduced following suspicions that some UNRWA operatives in Gaza were involved in the October 7 massacres. Under the new law, UNRWA will no longer be allowed to operate any offices, provide any services or conduct any activities—directly or otherwise—within Israel’s sovereign territory. This effectively ends UNRWA’s operations in East Jerusalem, with its responsibilities and control transitioning to Israel. 'Hamas and other terrorist organizations infiltrated UNRWA long ago,' Danon said. 'The secretary-general’s persistent and principled refusal to deny or even acknowledge the evidence provided by Israel regarding the organization’s lack of neutrality and involvement in terrorism has forced Israel to act responsibly toward its citizens, respond and end its cooperation with the organization.' Secret ties between UNRWA and terrorist organizations 'These developments are a direct response to the severe security risks posed by the infiltration of Hamas and other terrorist organizations into UNRWA, as well as the agency’s refusal to address the serious and material concerns raised by Israel and correct the situation,' Danon emphasized in his letter. He argued that UNRWA has 'irreversibly compromised its fundamental obligation of impartiality and neutrality.' Danon did not address in his letter another law passed by the Knesset, which prohibits Israeli entities from collaborating with UNRWA or its employees, effective from the same date, January 30. This legislation could also jeopardize UNRWA’s operations in Gaza and the West Bank. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Earlier this week, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said that once the law comes into effect, 'the agency intends to remain and continue its work in the Palestinian territories.' However, he added, 'If there is no bureaucratic or administrative relationship, it makes the operational environment far more complicated.' Israel pushes for other UN agencies to take over UNRWA’s responsibilities, but the international body maintains that the agency is 'irreplaceable,' particularly in its mission to provide essential services to Palestinians, such as healthcare and education. Earlier this month, UN Secretary-General Guterres emphasized in a letter that, in the event of a forced cessation of UNRWA’s activities in the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, Israel, as 'the occupying power,' is obligated to ensure that the services provided by the agency continue uninterrupted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryynb4m00jg	2025-01-25T01:44:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/03/11/rk95njhTT/rk95njhTT_0_31_1500_845_0_small.jpg

Hamas airs 'war film' showcasing leadership and October 7 plannin...	In a bid to assert dominance in Gaza, Al Jazeera airs report featuring footage of slain Hamas leaders, interview with Gaza Brigade Commander and leaked 'operational document' allegedly issued 2 days before October 7 attack In a bid to assert its dominance in Gaza after over 15 months of war, Hamas released new footage and interviews over the weekend, aired as part of Al Jazeera’s investigative program The Tip of the Iceberg. The broadcast featured images of slain Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, alongside a previously unseen interview with Gaza City Brigade Commander Az al-Din Haddad. The footage included what Hamas claimed to be Deif in a command room prior to October 7, saying, 'We can change history,' though his face remained obscured. Sinwar was also purportedly shown in Rafah on the day of the attack, disguised and armed. The program ended with a still labeled 'top secret,' showing Deif’s image—hinting he might still be alive despite Israeli claims of his elimination. A document reportedly authored by Deif, labeled the 'Operational Plan for October 7,' detailed attack logistics, including the specific launch time: 6:30 a.m. The broadcast also highlighted surveillance of Israeli border zones and footage of Hamas operatives inside an IDF Namer armored vehicle. Haddad, in an interview, claimed that Israel would 'have no choice but to yield to our demands' during negotiations, which include halting the war, withdrawing from Gaza, releasing Palestinian prisoners, lifting the blockade and rebuilding the enclave. He alleged that Hamas strategically misled Israel by feigning compliance with perceived easing measures while keeping the timing of their assault restricted to a select few.

Eyal Eshel, whose daughter Roni fell at Nahal Oz during the October 7 attacks, posted the so-called operational document and condemned Israeli leadership for failing to act on apparent warning signs. 'This note, part typed, part handwritten, circulated in more than half of Gaza,' he wrote. 'How is it that Hamas knew everything about us, yet our leadership and intelligence knew nothing?' Eshel recalled his last conversation with his daughter before the attack: 'She told me, ‘Dad, they know everything about us.’ I put my hand on her shoulder and said we have a strong army; nothing will happen. Three days later, everything exploded, and Roni was gone.' He directly criticized Israeli officials, including IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and other top commanders, for what he described as catastrophic failures. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy002bzg00yx	2025-01-24T22:36:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/24/HkAnBK11Okg/HkAnBK11Okg_218_0_869_489_0_small.jpg

Hamas has recruited over 10,000 new operatives since October 7, r...	Despite losing 20,000 fighters during the war, terror group recruits 10,000-15,000 new operatives, most of whom lack military training; US and Israeli officials emphasize ongoing challenges posed by Hamas while noting limitations in weaponry and operational capabilities Hamas has recruited between 10,000 and 15,000 new operatives since the outbreak of the war on October 7, 2023, Reuters reported on Friday, citing two congressional sources briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies in recent weeks. According to Israeli intelligence estimates, Hamas has lost approximately 20,000 of its fighters during the war. Despite the organization's extensive recruitment efforts, the congressional sources noted that most recruits are young and lack sufficient military training, serving primarily in basic security roles. 'Although numbers are high, this is not a force with significant operational capabilities,' one of the sources told Reuters. On Sunday, a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas came into effect after 15 months of fighting that began with the deadly surprise attack by the terrorist organization. Since the cease-fire began, Hamas has started rebuilding basic services in Gaza and implementing new security measures, while also dealing with the widespread destruction caused during the war. 'Every time Israel completes its military operations and withdraws, Hamas terrorists manage to regroup—because there is nothing to fill the void,' former U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month. According to him, Hamas has managed to recruit nearly as many fighters as it has lost, which could lead to 'persistent insurgency and ongoing warfare.' Last July, Hamas spokesman Abu Ubaida claimed that the organization had succeeded in recruiting 'thousands of new fighters.' Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon responded to Blinken's remarks on Wednesday, saying, 'While Hamas is indeed recruiting young people, without weapons and training infrastructure, they do not pose an immediate threat.' He added, 'Yes, these young people can be incited against Israel, but cannot become effective terrorists because they cannot be equipped with weapons or rockets.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, said in his farewell speech this week that despite the severe blow dealt to Hamas, 'the organization has not been completely destroyed, even though most of its commanders have been killed. IDF will continue its efforts to dismantle its infrastructure.' Collecting accurate data on Hamas remains a significant challenge for intelligence agencies due to the lack of direct access to Gaza and the organization’s dynamic recruitment methods. However, U.S. intelligence estimates indicate that prior to the start of the fighting, Hamas had between 20,000 and 25,000 fighters. Nonetheless, Israel emphasizes that the organization suffers from severe shortages in weaponry and training facilities, which makes it difficult to transform new recruits into 'effective fighters.' Incoming U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said last Sunday, 'Hamas will never govern Gaza. That is completely unacceptable,' adding, 'If Hamas reneges on the hostage deal, the U.S. will support Israel in whatever it needs to do.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1delzguyl	2025-01-24T22:07:44-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/10/06/S1eS4ck1Jx/S1eS4ck1Jx_0_0_3000_2067_0_small.jpg

Four hostages expected to return in hours	Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev and Liri Albag, 4 of 5 to be transfer from Hamas to Red Cross and then to Israeli custody; parents will reunite with them at border before being taken to hospital Four of the five female IDF observers abducted from Nahal Oz on October 7 are expected to be released Saturday as part of the ongoing hostage exchange deal. The women—Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, Karina Ariev and Liri Albag—are anticipated to cross the border from Gaza as early as the early afternoon, unlike the first phase of the exchange. Al Jazeera reported Saturday morning an International Committee of the Red Cross convoy had already departed Gaza for the Kerem Shalom crossing. However, it remains unclear if these vehicles are en route to the designated handover point. An Israeli security official said the military estimates that preparations for the hostages' release in Gaza will begin within hours. The IDF released a statement confirming readiness for the hostages’ return: 'The IDF, led by the Personnel Directorate and the Medical Corps, has completed preparations for the second phase of receiving hostages from Gaza. Initial reception centers have been established to provide medical care and personal support. Afterward, the returning hostages will be transported to hospitals to reunite with their families.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The release is part of the second phase of the hostage exchange deal, following the release earlier this week of Emily Damari, Doron Steinbacher and Romi Gonen. The four are expected to be handed over to the Red Cross before being transferred to Israeli forces. Unlike the previous release, Saturday's transfer may occur as early as midday. At the border reception point, the freed hostages will meet IDF officers, medical personnel, psychologists and mental health professionals. Families of the hostages, including fathers who were not allowed at the previous reception, will greet them at the border. After reuniting with their families, the hostages will be flown to Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva for medical evaluations. Hospitals in Ashkelon and Be’er Sheva are also on standby for urgent cases. The Health Ministry has prepared a protocol for treating returning hostages, which includes physical examinations, psychological care and documentation of their captivity. Priority will be given to female medical staff for examining the returning women. Security concerns remain, with officials wary that Hamas may alter the agreed-upon list of released hostages as part of its psychological warfare tactics. Families of the observers and those of Arbel Yehoud, who was expected but excluded from this phase, have been briefed on this possibility. Public gatherings are planned to mark the hostages' return, including a viewing event at the Hostages' Square starting at 10 a.m. and a solidarity rally at 8 p.m. However, 90 hostages remain captive in Gaza, including Shiri Bibas and her two young children, whose fate remains uncertain. In exchange for the four hostages, Israel will release 200 Palestinian prisoners, including 120 serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. Unlike earlier releases primarily involving women and minors, this group includes high-profile inmates, many of whom will be deported. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skhzpwgdkx	2025-01-24T21:57:36-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/24/SJVboObukl/SJVboObukl_196_0_2665_1500_0_small.jpg

Operation Good Neighbor: Israel's humanitarian mission during Syr...	In every moment, I knew I could be shot at,' says Lt. Col. (res.) Eyal Dror, head of the Good Neighbor initiative that operated in Syria between 2016 and 2018 in which Israel risked much, saved thousands of Syrians—and gained significantly in return; 'I met with rebel leaders, and they worked for our security,' adds Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, who commanded the Northern Command during the civil war 'We transferred a nine-year-old girl with Type 1 diabetes for treatment in an Israeli hospital back in 2016. One day, I met her and I was talking to her mother waiting for the doctor when the girl asked me, ‘How do you draw an Israeli flag?’ I explained. She asked for a marker and a sheet of paper and started drawing a Star of David. It wasn’t working out for her. She started getting annoyed and disappointed. It took her nine tries. At the top, she wrote ‘Wiam ❤️ Abu Yaakov,’ the name by which the Syrians knew me. This sums up the whole ‘Good Neighbor’ story: A girl from an enemy state, dedicating a drawing to an Israeli officer who saved her life.' This quote is from Lt. Col. (res.) Eyal Dror, who headed the ‘Good Neighbor’ unit during the Syrian civil war. The December 8 overthrow of the Assad regime was indeed a stunning and unexpected ending to the 13-year civil Syria. Israel, however, had prepared for this moment years ago. The popular uprising against Assad kicked off in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring sweeping Middle East dictatorships. By 2015, Assad had lost control of most of his country’s territory, and it looked like his days were numbered. Israel prepared accordingly. With the help of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, Assad restored most of the territory he’d lost, pushing the rebels back to north-west Syria’s Idlib region, from where last month’s large-scale attack was launched. More than half a million people have been killed in this war and millions of Syrians became refugees either in their own country or beyond its borders. Israel, for its part, quickly adapted to the new situation unfolding - with a border on whose other side some 250,000 people live every day in a combined state of chaos, danger, distress and uncertainty. But alongside the new threats posed were also new opportunities, including the potential for rare cooperation with the civilians across the border. The aim of 'Operation Influence,' as it was branded by Lt. Col. (res.) Dror was to provide humanitarian aid in the recipients’ darkest hour - and also to try to make them realize the extent to which their perception of Israel was wrong. 'Cynics may say we’ve exploited their suffering,' says Dror, 'but we’ve chosen to invest resources and risk lives for humanitarian aid. I knew they may well shoot me at any moment.' It was named 'Operation Good Neighbor.' As the civil war waned, however Assad, who had regained control of Syria, was looking like the great victor. Now, with his fall, our Syrian neighbor’s identity is, once again, changing before our very eyes. Although there’s no war going on in Syria right now, the nature of the emerging regime and the extent to which rebel leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa (Abu Mohammad al-Julani) has truly changed is, as yet, uncertain. Meanwhile, as Israel has taken control of the Syrian Hermon and the buffer zone, it would appear that the seeds planted back during Operation Good Neighbor, are still apparent on the ground. Syrians generally avoid confrontation with Israeli forces and have even been collaborating with them and requesting to be annexed to Israel. According to foreign reports, Israel’s relationship with the Syrians was conducted along two axes, civilian and intelligence. 'I took on the role of commanding the Northern Command four months into the Syrian revolt,' says Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, now Chairman of The Democrats party. 'What was guiding us then, was the fear that the rebels would invade Israel.' Only a month earlier, in May 2011, dozens of Syrians broke across into the Golan and were heading to Majdal Shams. In this incident, at least four Syrians were killed and dozens were wounded. 'Our approach was that of fear and concern of further incursions,' says Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Golan. 'So, we also reinforced the barrier, but I understood that cooperating with the rebels would better protect us. In this situation of ever-increasing chaos, the most important thing was having good relations with rebel militias east of our shared border. Militias who collaborated with us, whose operational activities we can trust so that we can be present in the field. They essentially acted in the interests of Israel’s security.' These militia didn’t act out of Zionist sentiment. 'Through a series of meetings held along the fence at my initiative, we understood that what they most needed was medical care,' says Golan. 'They did have further needs - mainly food, clothing, and fuel for winter - but medical care was the most urgent. I tried advancing the idea with then Chief of Staff Benny Gant and was told no. In the end, we found ourselves facing a clear choice: One night, they simply placed six stretchers at the border. Then, 36th Division Commander Tamir Hayman called asking me what to do. I decided, not exactly with the Chief of Staff’s approval, to bring them in and send them to Ziv Hospital, and that’s what we did.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Contrary to Golan’s version of events, Gantz’s people say that Chief of Staff Gantz approved evacuating the wounded. 'At first, due to opposition from the political echelon, Gantz personally approved admitting selected wounded - until he managed to convince the political echelon on the matter' they stated. 'Later, in consultations headed by then Chief Medical Officer Brig. Gen. Itzik Kreis, Chief of Staff Gantz approved setting up a field hospital. The ‘Good Neighbor’ unit was later set up.' Either way, what started as a pilot program, Golan says, resulted in the IDF treating more than 4,000 wounded Syrians over five years. The vast majority were wounded in the civil war, some extremely seriously. A smaller number showed up with other problems, such as childbirth complications. This is how the Syrians took off. According to reports, this was accompanied by intensive intelligence gathering, primarily by the Military Intelligence Directorate’s HUMINT Unit 504, responsible for obtaining human intelligence. Golan says that collaboration with the rebels has been very fruitful. 'It helped us understand that not everyone is Al-Nusra Front and Al Qaeda. They’re not all Muslim extremists to be feared, but rather quite the opposite' he says. 'Most of the groups along the borders were Syrian Sunnis simply wanting to be rid of the violent and coercive Alawite rule and were so fighting the regime. In these years, they cleansed the border of all extremist elements, be it Hezbollah trying to infiltrate or extremist Sunni Islamic elements. They guarded the border alongside, not instead of, Israel, and did an impressive job. As the Assad regime suffered blow after blow, Israel needed to cooperate with the new forces in Syria to continue its intelligence activities. As mentioned, the rebels provided Israel with a great deal of intelligence regarding what was going on inside Syria, in chaos at the time. These good relations led to Israel expanding its humanitarian aid, until it became somewhat of an institution with the 2016 founding of the Good Neighbor unit. With its establishment, Lt. Col. (res.) Dror was appointed to command the unit, effectively creating a separation between the humanitarian aid and intelligence axes. Dror 'borrowed' the new position from the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) responsible for activities with the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This was due to the nature of the COGAT role, which involved contact with civilians, international organizations, government ministries, etc. 'At the end of the day, dealing with the civilian world is a profession unto itself,' says Dror. You need to be able to map out needs and adapt to each international organization according to its capabilities and requirements. So, someone from COGAT was chosen to head this unit and the job was precisely mapping the Syrian side, replete with its pressures and constraints.' When you think about it, the IDF set up an HMO of sorts for the civilians across the border. Dror tells us that an Israeli doctor, along with his Syrian counterparts, professionally broke down what’s known as 'Medical Care.' So, children with chronic illnesses were taken to the hospital and a ‘doctors’ visit’ of sorts was set up for specialist treatment. As it soon became apparent that women giving birth needed help, they were hooked up with international organizations that helped set up a special maternity hospital in the area. As family medicine was noticeably lacking, the IDF brought in an international organization to set up a field clinic where Dror says at least 7,000 Syrians were treated on an ongoing basis, and remote contact was made. 'It’s not direct Israeli-Syrian contact, CT,' he says, 'but for the Syrians, it’s clear who’s bringing them the treatment.' The project treating children with chronic illnesses was the broadest. Approximately 1,400 children aged one month through to 15 were treated, usually accompanied by a family member. 'At the end of the day, these are simple people,' says Dror. 'Some are illiterate. Their lives are hard even without the war. In rural Quneitra, the standard of living is very low.' He says that lifesaving treatment was provided to 4,500 men, women,n and children, alongside the 7,000 treated in the field hospital, and that 1,000 babies were born in the field hospital. Alon (assumed name) was a young Military Police soldier stationed for a month in 2017 at Nahariya’s Galilee Medical Center to protect the Syrian wounded coming into Israel. 'I was still on the course. I’d been in the army for around three months' he says. 'We were posted to an underground hospital ward. We were in civilian clothing with guns, and our job wasn’t necessarily to safeguard the environment from them but rather to protect them. We were instructed to protect them from the Druse, as some of them had fought in Syria and there was fear of retaliation. One day, as I was accompanying an injured patient in a wheelchair to surgery, suddenly a huge Druse guy started talking to him in Arabic. Before we understood what was going on, he pounced on him, knocked him off the wheelchair onto the floor, and started beating and punching him. We managed to separate them.' He says that most of the wounded were men. 'They explained to us that some of them would simply show up at the Israeli border and lie down, and IDF soldiers would bring them i,n,' he says. 'Many were severely wounded. Some had lost limbs. Others had been blinded. They all declared that they’d been fighting against the Assad regime, but we had no way of knowing whether that was true and we occasionally interrogated them.' He says that most of the wounded were nice and tried talking to the soldiers, but that the language barrier made this hard. 'Some did learn a little Hebrew and they mainly said thankyou and expressed their appreciation for our saving them,' he says. 'They got the kind of medical treatment they could only dream of. Some, when told they’d recovered and could be released, burst into tears, not wanting to go back, begging to stay.' 'I had 12-hour shifts,' he says. 'I’d sit at an empty nurses’ station and would accompany patients from place to place. It could be for treatment, tests, surgery, or going out for a cigarette. Think about it, I was following 20 Syrians going out of the hospital for a smoke.' What do you most remember about that month? 'I was once called in to receive wounded. We waited in the parking lot for the ambulance, and a couple from Syria who had stepped on a landmine showed up. The husband had improvised a makeshift wooden leg brace with screws for himself. His wife was heavily pregnant and had lost her legs, but she gave birth to a healthy baby in Israel. I’ve always wondered what happened to her and what they did with the baby. I wonder whether they received Israeli citizenship.' With Assad’s renewed control of the area in 2018, the Good Neighbor unit’s activity came to an end, despite the situation in border communities not improving much. 'The Assad regime has restored these communities over the past six years,' says Lt. Col. Dror. True, an Al-Rafid villager can make it to Damascus, which he couldn’t during the war, but this doesn’t mean he’ll receive services there. The area is poor and weak and the people there remember Good Neighbor and how they received help from Israel. We also have indications for this. We see it today. The big question is: What about the future? The situation today is fundamentally different as there’s no war there.' Golan is certain that activity back then affords Israel credit points in Syria even today. 'On an irregular basis, once every two or three weeks, I’d meet rebel leaders and visit the Syrian wounded in hospitals,' says Golan. 'Many told us, ‘We thought you were the devil, and here, you’re saving our lives’. When we add up all the activity, the contribution to Israel’s state security is enormous' Golan says, 'Another important thing, somewhat eroded in the current war, is that we did the human, ethical right thing. We saved lives. We provided humanitarian aid. When you work correctly, at the end of the day, it also strengthens Israel’s security – and certainly Israel’s standing in international and regional arenas.' Dror says that there are '1,001 scenarios' for the future of relations. 'There’s no doubt in my mind that we’ve sown seeds that will yield fruit. I said this before Assad fell. I’m hearing this from Syrians overseas. The discourse regarding Israel is optimistic and they remember. The Lt. Col. (res.) tells us that, while addressing a synagogue in Canada, he suddenly heard shouting in Arabic. He turned around and saw a man running toward him, who later turned out to be Syrian. 'He said that he had to co, me,' says Dror. 'He’d fled Syrian in 2015 and said that he’d read about what we were doing on the border, and just couldn’t come to hug me. He was a Muslim in a Jewish synagogue in Canada, simply sitting there listening to my talk. This was the moment I said to myself, ‘We’ve done something here’.' There was another instance in 2018 when Syria downed an Israeli F-16, and a Syrian contacted Dror to ask him how the soldier who had been hit was doing. 'Good Neighbor still affects a 17-year-old boy for whom we implanted a prosthetic limb seven years ago', says the reservist officer. 'That’s not the kind of thing you forget so quickly.' Nonetheless, he says that more patience is needed. 'I don’t know whether it prevented firing at our forces. There are lots more questions. Both sides, have to decide. The infrastructure exists. So does the professional know-how. Right now, it’s not a war border. In the past, we operated at night time, under heavy security, knowing that ISIS could attack us. This is the scenario we envisaged. The situation’s different now. I’m sure that if both we and they decide to move forward, we could do it on a gentle learning curve, and get it up and running in a short time.' Syria, however, is not the only sector in which Israel has been operating on the civilian front. On October 7, the illusion of success in the Gaza Strip was shattered. This, inevitably also raised questions about the situation in other sectors, including Syria, as well as a great deal of skepticism as to whether reaching out a helping hand would, indeed, bring about stability and security. 'The facts are that humanitarian efforts that also served for the defense were successful during Good Neighbor,' says Dror. 'I can’t say what lies ahead. We all learned a lesson in modesty and humility on October 7.' That said, Dror says that Gaza and the West Bank are fundamentally different from Syria and, although we mustn’t just stick with what we know, this is a tool that’s right to utilize. 'Whenever I’d go down to the border during Good Neighbor and, in every interaction with the population, I’d factor in that the day may come that some guy might take advantage of the situation and turn it on me,' he says. 'There’s no contradiction between the two and you have to manage by the situation assessment, consideration thinking critically, constantly checking yourself.' Golan says, 'In real life, nothing’s certain. It’s not like if the economic situation improves, you suddenly get more security. At the end of the day, it all rests on a tapestry of relationships, interests, trust, and worldviews. The overwhelming majority of people with whom we came into contact weren’t Islamic extremists, so the conversation was more on a personal and security level and less ideological. We yielded enormous security gains and, and the end of the day, ethically, we did the right thing. Amid what’s going on now, in Gaza and in general, that’s important to remember.' 'In the Gaza Strip too, not all Gazans are radical Hamasniks and nor are all Palestinians in the West Bank,k,' says Golan, as mentioned, now The Democrats party leader. 'I think we need to be very wary of these dark areas. We should learn from our history and not implement an all-encompassing approach to Syria the Palestinians or any foreign entity on our borders. At the end of the day, these approaches don’t bring about security for Israel.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjovnkb00ye	2025-01-24T12:34:38-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/25/ryii11vtHyl/ryii11vtHyl_0_0_1280_719_0_small.jpg

Agam Berger's IDF lookout friends to be released, but she remains...	Agam Berger is one of five female soldiers abducted from the Nahal Oz military post, and despite her friends being released, she remains in captivity and likely be part of the third phase of the agreement While her friends are set to be released on Saturday, Agam Berger, 20, will remain in captivity in Gaza and is expected to be part of the next phase of the agreement, likely next Saturday. Agam is one of five female soldiers abducted from the Nahal Oz military post who remain in Hamas captivity. Four of them are slated for release in the second phase of the deal. Two other soldiers from the post—Noa Marciano, who was killed at Shifa Hospital and later recovered by the IDF, and Ori Megidish, who was rescued alive—highlight the grave toll of the October 7 terror attack. Agam’s path to becoming a lookout soldier was unexpected. 'She wanted to be a basic training commander,' said her mother, Meirav. 'But she decided that if this was her role, she’d do her best.' Initially stationed at Kerem Shalom, Agam was reassigned to Nahal Oz just a week before her training course ended. 'She asked me, ‘Mom, is this a good thing? Why now?’ I told her some things are beyond our control,' Meirav recounted. At the end of the course, Meirav sent her daughter a voice message wishing her well, ending with, 'Wherever you are, this is your purpose.' Two days later, as those words still resonated, Agam was abducted. On the morning of October 7, as Hamas attacked, Agam left her phone in her room while fleeing to a shelter. She borrowed a phone from her friend Shirat Yam Amar who was killed on October 7, to call her sister Bar. In her first call, Agam reassured her parents she was safe in a secure area. Twenty minutes later, she made a second and final call, saying, 'Mom, they’re shooting at us. There are terrorists. Everyone’s crying, but I’m not afraid.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: On November 26, Agam Goldstein Almog, a fellow captive, was released and called Agam Berger's family before flying on the helicopter back to Israel. 'She insisted on reaching us, even before boarding the helicopter,' Meirav said. Goldstein Almog described the psychological warfare Hamas used against them, leading captives to believe they had no one waiting for them. Agam had secretly passed her family's phone number along, enabling the call. 'She told us she was hungry, prayed often, refused to light a fire on Shabbat, and stayed calm despite everything.' Meirav added that the family’s faith deepened this past year, inspired by Agam’s steadfastness in captivity. 'Many have heard of her incredible bravery—how she refused to violate Shabbat, even in captivity. We consulted with rabbis, including representatives of the military rabbinate, and they ruled it permissible for us to travel on Shabbat to welcome her home.

They are to be freed after 476 days in Hamas captivity. The four female IDF lookouts were kidnapped from the Nahal Oz military post during the October 7 terror attack. Hamas sent the list of hostages to be released around 4:00 p.m., but it differed from the one Israel expected, with Arbel Yehud not included, despite the fact that civilians were supposed to be released before the female soldiers. Hours later, an Israeli official announced that Israel had decided to accept the list to avoid derailing the agreement. However, Israel made it clear to the mediators that this constituted a violation of the agreement, which was unacceptable.

According to a Gaza-based source close to Hamas, Yehud is held by a Salafi group. In light of this, Israel decided not to break off the deal and to agree to this phase, despite concerns that Hamas might not be telling the full truth. 'We learned from the previous deal not to break the agreement, especially since the violation wasn't major,' the source said. Despite accepting Hamas's list, Israel remains concerned that the list may change as part of Hamas's psychological warfare tactics.

Cant defeat terror with defense': West Bank OP commanders say	Deputy commander of elite Duvdevan unit shares about fighting the terror cell in Jenin, how it recruits teens, and how prisoner release celebrations will be prevented Since the signing of the hostage deal and the cease-fire agreements in both the north and south, the West Bank has emerged as the IDF’s primary front. This shift is no coincidence, as just two days ago, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi visited the area to oversee the Central Command's operations. Since the launch of Operation 'Iron Wall' on Tuesday, Israeli forces have eliminated over ten terrorists and arrested some 20 suspects. One of the busiest units in the West Bank is the elite Duvdevan unit, which has also been involved in operations in Gaza and Lebanon. Speaking with Maj. M., the unit’s deputy commander, sheds light on the current mission in Jenin and the elimination of two key perpetrators of a deadly terror attack in Funduq. 'We had been tracking this cell for a long time, waiting for the right moment to close the circle,' Maj. M. said. 'It was a bold and highly complex operation in a challenging area. We waited for them to make a mistake, and then we acted decisively.' How long did it take to neutralize them? 'The entire operation, from start to finish, lasted just a couple of minutes. The final stages took no more than one or two minutes. The area was filled with explosive devices, so precision was key. When other methods failed to force them out, we advanced engineering tools to collapse the house. We began by calling out to them, deploying drones, and allowing family members to persuade them to surrender. When all else failed, we escalated.' Did they exit through the main entrance? 'Yes, they barricaded themselves inside the house, and we determined that advancing heavy engineering equipment was the only remaining option. During the operation, a soldier behind an armored vehicle was lightly injured. The gunfight lasted mere seconds, and the terrorists were killed just outside their doorway. They realized they were walking into an ambush. Their bodies were found with magazines for both short and long-range weapons. I’m glad we settled the score with two of the three leaders of this cell. It sends a clear message.' How Iron Wall differs from previous operations Maj. M. described the operation as more organized and informed than similar missions earlier in the year. 'The ‘Summer Camps’ operation in August was one of the first major missions since the Second Intifada’s Operation Defensive Shield. Commanders and soldiers are now more experienced. While the tactics remain largely the same, we execute them with greater precision and coordination.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: So far, the IDF has neutralized three terrorists in the operation. Maj. M. highlighted that the primary motivation for the terrorists is ideology, making it a long-term challenge. 'As long as their beliefs don’t change, this will continue. However, these operations show civilians that supporting terrorism doesn’t pay off. We’ve seen residents cursing the terrorists, similar to how Gazans have turned against Hamas.' With an estimated 100-200 armed terrorists operating in the region, how do they continue to survive? 'Our mission is like mowing the grass. After ‘Summer Camps,’ we saw that when you’re not present and active, the threat slowly regrows. These operations are crucial to prevent another October 7 scenario in the West Bank. Offensive action is the only way to defeat terrorism—you can’t win by playing defense.' Maj. M. addressed criticism surrounding an operation where the unit used a vehicle marked as an ambulance. 'While I can’t comment on the specifics, I can say our unit commander is one of the most capable and ethical leaders I’ve worked with. Every decision is made after careful consideration and thorough analysis.' A Broader perspective from the field Lt. Col. (Res.) A., who oversees operations in the Menashe Brigade, provided additional context on the evolving situation in Jenin. He noted the challenges posed by terrorist rehabilitation during a 21-day absence by Israeli forces, allowing the terrorists to regroup. 'Terrorist cells in Jenin have seen a significant escalation. We’ve located hundreds of explosive devices and weapons, and over 400 terrorists have been apprehended. While the state may view this as a secondary front, for us, it’s a central battleground.' The commander highlighted a shift in terrorist tactics, including support from surrounding villages and refugee camps. However, he emphasized the ongoing IDF efforts to systematically dismantle the terrorist infrastructure, saying, 'We are operating with a larger force, going house-to-house, not just based on intelligence. While we may not reach every house, the goal is to thoroughly sweep the camp and surrounding areas.' Regarding the upcoming release of prisoners, including Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent figure in Jenin, Lt. Col. A. expressed confidence in maintaining control. 'They won’t be able to celebrate in the streets of Jenin. There might be gatherings in private homes, but there will be no public processions or displays of arms because they know we’re here, and they fear us.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by7gh8zoye	2025-01-24T09:19:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/24/ryNkL5fb00ke/ryNkL5fb00ke_1_167_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu suffers health challenges, court documents reveal	Prime minister attorney in his criminal trial for corruption tells Jerusalem District Court Netanyahu sufferd from an infection after an operation to remove his prostate gland and was unable to sit, stand or work for more than 3 hours without rest Court documents filed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's defense team on Friday revealed that the prime minister had suffered a severe infection after his prostate gland was surgically removed earlier last month. Netanyahu submitted a request to the Jerusalem District Court where he is on criminal trial for corruption, to reduce the number of days he would testify next week, after he was allowed to delay his testimony for his operation and recovery. His defense attorney Amid Haddad wrote in the request that Netanyahu's physicians said he must avoid any activity lasting for more than three hours without rest in the coming week and also avoid traveling a long distance, sitting or standing for extended periods.

Israel says delaying withdrawal from Lebanon amid violations of d...	In statement PMO says Lebanon army not deployed to the south to enforce Hezbollah's removal north of the Litani, says gradual withdrawal of troops in cooperation with U.S. The Prime Minister's office (PMO) announced Friday that the IDF withdrawal from Lebanon would be delayed. The military was supposed to complete its pullout of troops by Sunday, 60 days after the cease-fire agreement in the war with Hezbollah was signed. 'The agreement was articulated with the understanding that the process may take more than 60 days,' the PMO said. 'It is conditioned on the Lebanese army is deployed in South and effectively enforcing the terms of the deal, as Hezbollah withdraws its forces north of the Litani River. According to the PMO, since that has not yet been fully enforced by Lebanon, Israel will continue a gradual l its commitments under the deal, and while Hezbollah forces would be pushed out of the region, north of the LItani River. Since that has not been fully enforced by Lebanon, the gradual withdrawal of troops would continue in full cooperation with the United states.' The cabinet decided on Thursday that it would react forcefully to Hezbollah's violation of the cease-fire agreement, but the ministers do not believe this would put the deal at risk. Although the Shi'ite terror group accused Israel of violations and speakers for the group warned that the war could resume, it only once used military force in response to the IDF's fire. Leaders in the opposition also urged a delay in the IDF withdrawal, citing the danger to the residents of the north if the cease-fire terms are not fully implemented. 'The IDF must continue and increase its actions in the face of even the slightest Hezbollah violation of the deal. We must insist that the resident of the north would never again be under threat,' former defense minister Benny Gantz said.

Paula White on Trump’s Second Term: ‘God Is Moving in America’	The reverend said, 'there is a return and a hunger for God. God is moving in America, and He is not done with America' Rev. Paula White has been reappointed to serve as U.S. President Donald Trump’s lead faith advisor, overseeing a portfolio that manages all matters of faith in the White House. On Tuesday night, she delivered a keynote address at the Israel Allies Caucus kickoff event held in the Capitol. Speaking to an audience of more than 100 people, White emphasized that faith is not only the single most unifying element among diverse individuals, but it also provides value at scale to societies. She added that faith-based diplomacy is essential for the future of America, Israel, and the world. White also highlighted the importance of politics, saying, 'Politics matter because policy matters, and policies matter because people matter.' 'There is such great hope, because God is moving,' White told ILTV News. 'We saw that. I tell people, when you watch mainstream media, as President Trump says, ‘fake news,’ and you actually see, you're on the ground. We had thousands and thousands of pastors that we went to throughout this country. I went with my husband on tour to Pennsylvania three times, Wisconsin—we were all over grassroots. And you see, there is a return and a hunger for God. God is moving in America, and He is not done with America, and that's exciting.'

Trump's first 100 days could redefine U.S. policy on Israel, Iran During Trump’s first term, White built the National Faith Advisory Board, which grew to include more than 60,000 members representing people of faith across the country. Under her leadership, 10,000 faith leaders passed through the White House in just four years—not only to attend events or celebrations but to sit at the table and help the president and his advisors craft policy. Those faith leaders were instrumental in several historic achievements, including moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizing the Golan Heights as sovereign Israeli territory. Now, White told ILTV that the next four years under President Trump’s leadership promise even greater impact. 'As he continues to say—not only the golden era of America, which it is—but it's going to impact the world. We see that with the hostages,' White said. 'We see that from the moment he won as president-elect, now president, even before he’d taken the oath, how much transition and change he began to bring. So it's only going to be good things, great things from here on out.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sktivcloyg	2025-01-24T00:51:42-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/24/ByqGG11100ke/ByqGG11100ke_0_43_799_450_0_small.jpg
Israel awaits Hamas names, information on hostages	Terror group to deliver names of next four women to be freed Saturday and a report on the condition of 26 others; Israel could face cruel dilemas if Hamas returns to psychological terror tactics Hamas is expected on Friday to deliver the names of the four hostages to be released in the afternoon on Saturday, according to terms of the agreement, along with another list detailing the condition of all 26 remaining hostages to be freed in the first phase of the cease-fire deal. Israeli officials believe eight of them are no longer alive. But after the list is revealed, Israel could find that the information provided by the terror group contradicts that of the evaluation of the intelligence agencies and would have to quickly attempt to verify the facts or deduct that Hamas is continuing its psychological terror tactics. If Israel learns that Arbel Yahud, a civilian expected to be among those freedon Saturday is not on the list Israel would again face the need to respond. In the first hostage release in November 2023, Hamas used manipulations, during the pause in the fighting, to avoid releasing mothers and their children and even claimed it was not holding any live women. A senior official told Ynet that the dilemma decision makers faced at the time, was cruel. In addition to the 29-year-old Yahud, Hamas may also release Shiri Bibas, although the terror group claimed in 2023, that she and her two small boys, Kfir and Ariel, were dead. Israel never confirmed that claim. Other names that could be included among the released are Liri Albag, Naama Levi, Agam Berger, Daniel Gilboa and Karina Ariev the IDF soldiers whow were abducted from the Nahal Oz base where they had served as lookouts. The families of hostages said that they are besieged by worry that the hostage exchange agreement would not be fully executed. On Friday, Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod, an IDF soldier was among the abducted warned that continuing the war after the completion of the first phase of the deal, would be a death sentence for the rest of the hostages. 'No one should be left behind,' she said. 'Even now, there are those in the government who are doing everything the can to thwart the second phase of the deal by effecting public perception. We must ensure that that phase too is fulfilled. We will not rest until every last hostage is home.' Ella Ben Ami, who was released in the 2023 exchange and whose father Ohad is expected to be freed in the first phase also called for the full implementation of the deal. 'I am filled with anxiety that the agreement that would bring my father back, may not return all of the hostages,' she said. 'It must not be stopped.

During the meeting, the ministers also received an overview of the cease-fire in Gaza, the preparations for the start of the withdrawal from the Netzarim Cooridor, and the pilot that will begin on Sunday in cooperation with the U.S.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj118glldye	2025-01-23T14:37:50-08:00	
Hamas is trying to rebuild and run Gaza, making peace difficult	The Islamist organization has resumed building rockets in underground tunnels and is financing itself through the selling of humanitarian aid; despite heavy losses since October 7, 2023 the terrorist organization remains extensive in numbers, arms, and commitment to fighting As a new cease-fire takes hold in Gaza, Hamas fighters, who normally dress as civilians during combat, have seized the opportunity to wear their uniforms and parade through the streets in a show of force. The images shared online of Hamas brandishing weapons atop trucks and surrounded by civilian supporters, cheering them on amid the ruins, make clear that despite heavy losses since October 7, 2023and the elimination of Hamas leaders, the terrorist organization remains extensive in numbers, arms, and commitment to fighting. For now, however, they may focus on rebuilding their ability to fight while trying to continue controlling Gaza. While the first phase of the cease-fire deal is still in its early days, many experts are questioning the sustainability of the situation, given the possibility of Hamas remaining entrenched in Gaza, and doubting the possibility of rebuilding the razed area. According to Yoni Ben-Menachem, a senior Middle East analyst for the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, 'Israel dismantled 24 military battalions in the Gaza Strip, killing between 20,000 to 25,000 of Hamas’s military wing operatives' over the last year and almost four months. However, he added, during the last three months, while Israel was also fighting Hezbollah on its northern border, the army 'eased the pressure on Hamas with many troops transferred to southern Lebanon. This shift gave Hamas the opportunity to rebuild, and just last month Hamas recruited 4,000 new terrorists to replenish their ranks using money generated from selling humanitarian aid that enters Gaza,' according to Ben-Menachem. The returning Palestinians are but a 'drop in the bucket' he added, cautioning that 'Hamas is rebuilding, and it’s possible they’ll try to maintain control of Gaza. With the cease-fire, Hamas can do whatever it wants, and it has survived militarily,' Ben-Menachem said. Israeli security estimates suggest that Hamas still has around 25,000 armed terrorists in Gaza, and it is the increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza that is enabling them. 'As of yesterday, 600 trucks carrying aid are entering Gaza daily – a significant increase. Hamas will exploit this aid by selling it and using the money to recruit more terrorists,' added Ben-Menachem. Professor Eyal Zisser, vice-rector of Tel Aviv University and an expert in Middle Eastern studies and security, said that he believes this situation only exists because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government failed to plan a 'day after' strategy for Gaza. 'If Hamas continues to exist, achieving peace will be very difficult. But the real question isn’t whether Hamas will survive – it’s whether there is an alternative to Hamas. Unfortunately, the current Israeli government doesn’t seem interested in planning for the ‘day after,’ and this plays into Hamas’ hands,' he said. For Yohanan Tzoreff, a senior researcher at the Institute of National and Security Studies in Tel Aviv, this cease-fire deal could be very short-lived. 'Israel is currently in the first stage of this agreement, and both sides are committed to continuing negotiations for a second stage. The problem will become very sensitive during the second stage because Hamas is asking for the war to end, while Israel is demanding the dismantling of Hamas’ military power by either leaving Gaza or putting down their weapons,' he said, adding that 'from Israel’s perspective, there is no way weapons can remain in Gaza, especially after October 7.' There are ways to stop or at least delay Hamas’ rebuilding efforts. Zisser underscored the critical role of international cooperation in containing Hamas. 'If Israel and Egypt can coordinate and control the Philadelphi Corridor, preventing smuggling tunnels and weapons transfers, it could significantly delay Hamas’ rebuilding efforts,' he explained. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Other actors potentially involved in building a sustainable 'day after' for Gaza also hold great sway in this process, according to Tzoreff. He noted the potential role of global and regional actors in shaping Gaza’s future, including the United States and Gulf countries. 'The Gulf states and even Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas are unwilling to engage in Gaza’s reconstruction unless Hamas dismantles its military power,' he said. Abbas’ criticism of Hamas has grown louder in recent months. He has already indicated that the PA would not return to Gaza unless Hamas dismantles its military power. Furthermore, in a show of disapproval, he publicly asked whether freeing 1,000 Palestinian prisoners justifies the deaths of over 50,000 people in Gaza, revealing a broader anti-Hamas sentiment within the PA.

Senior UN official curses Netanyahu in social media post: 'F*** h...	UN health envoy Dr. Tlaleng Mofokeng curses at Netanyahu following the delay of the implementation of the Gaza cease-fire against the backdrop of her pro-Hamas agenda South African Dr. Tlalang Mofokeng, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, often uses crude language on social media including profanity, curses and racist slurs. After a series of unbridled statements, this week the senior UN official broke a record when she cursed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a tweet on X: 'F*** him.' Mofokeng's blunt tweet was posted in response to an Israeli statement on Sunday, which reported that Prime Minister Netanyahu had ordered the cease-fire in Gaza to be postponed by a few hours due to Hamas' violations. Mofokeng's ugly tweet was later deleted. Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Office in Geneva, demanded that she be condemned. A day later, when UN Watch Director-General Hillel Neuer called on the UN to take action against her for violating the code of conduct, Mofokeng responded on X with a series of tweets with racist insults, calling Neuer, a Jew, 'human scum' and an 'evil white man.' Neuer's tweet against Mofokeng received 600,000 views. Mofokeng works closely with Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, who has been previously denounced for antisemitism. Beyond her foul language, Mofokeng has previously spoken out in favor of Hamas and against Israel. In various tweets, she claimed that Hamas are not terrorists, and even called for imposing sanctions on Israel and severing all diplomatic ties with it. Mofokeng's use of slurs and profanity is not new. In 2021, she clapped back at a Twitter user who challenged her and in 2024, she wrote rude responses to a commenter. On other occasions, she cursed journalists and critics in particularly blunt language. International organizations, including UN Watch, are now calling on the UN to launch an investigation into Mofokeng for violating the code of conduct that requires its representatives to speak in respectful language and maintain political objectivity. Mofokeng's language and behavior harm the status of the UN and public trust in the organization,' said Neuer. Mofokeng later tried to defend her discourse, saying that she was expressing herself in this way out of personal pain and anger at the human suffering she sees in her role. 'The loss of life and devastation in Gaza is heartbreaking and deeply personal for those of us engaged in human rights work. I am in touch with victims of the violence everyday and grieve deeply for those detained & killed and the destruction of the health infrastructure in Gaza,' tweeted the senior UN official. 'The tone of my communications online and offline are influenced by this pain and grief. In this critical juncture, between heartache and hope, I remain committed to fostering thoughtful and respectful dialogue, particularly on matters as urgent and sensitive as human rights.'

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to release classified documents related to the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Trump pledged during his first term to release all classified information in these files, but he said pressure from security agencies and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo led to a delay in their publication.

No life, no hope: Gaza prepares for mass return of displaced resi...	In parallel with the second wave of the release of the kidnapped women on Saturday, the IDF will begin withdrawing from the Netzarim Corridor and allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to the northern Gaza Strip; There, destruction and devastation await Taking over the Netzarim Corridor was one of Israel's significant strategic achievements in the war, but as part of the hostage deal with Hamas the IDF is expected to withdraw on Saturday from the western part of the corridor that bisects the Gaza Strip in its center, thereby enabling the mass return of Palestinian refugees to the northern Strip. In Gaza City, tent camps are already being prepared for the refugees who will return to the ruined city, and the desperation there is evident everywhere. 'Life is very difficult – there's no life, no hope,' Wael Jundiya, one of several who set up a tent complex in an open area of ​​the city, surrounded by ruined buildings, told Reuters. He prepared a tent for his children, who are now staying in the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone on the coast in southern Gaza, the area where hundreds of thousands of refugees have gathered in the past year. An now, a large part of them are expected to return to the north. Wael is worried that the conditions in the tent will be too difficult and crowded for his family. 'Is this the tent that we dreamed of? he asks sarcastically. 'Really, is this adequate space?' 'The tent barely fits two people, and I have eight family members. Each of my children has 5, 6, 7 family members. I used to have a five-story house, it was completely lost, and now after being homeless and suffering for a year and a half, I will live in a tent, with neighbors who hear our voices, and my house exposed to them? Is this the life we ​​dreamed of?' he added. He demanded that the reconstruction of the Strip be 'accelerated.' 'This is not a place to live, this is not a place fit for humans.' He estimates that the entire complex he and his friends are currently building will only have room for up to 200 people, but '1.5 million people will return from the south, where will they go?' Another Palestinian woman who spoke to Reuters there, Safa Dado, also expressed great frustration: 'Our families will return from the south to their blessed land in Gaza City, but they will not find their homes, because they were destroyed by the Zionist occupation. They will find tents that were erected to provide the most basic needs.' She added that 'our people will suffer – they have already suffered from the destruction, the bombings and the fear caused by the occupation, and now they will suffer from tragic displacement and tents. The tents will not protect from the cold now or the heat in the summer. This is not a livable situation, but this is what we have now.' An estimated 2.1 million people now live in the Gaza Strip (a decrease of about 160,000 from the figure before the war began), and the vast majority of them were displaced from their homes at the beginning of the war – while those who fled from the north to the south have not been allowed to return until now via the Netzarim Corridor, a route that the IDF has turned into a real territory with permanent outposts over the past few months. Now, according to the agreement, the IDF is required to gradually withdraw from the route. On Saturday, in parallel with the implementation of the second phase of the deal in which four hostage women (one civilian and three female IDF observers) will be released in exchange for dozens of terrorists, the IDF will be required to withdraw from the a-Rashid coastal road east of the Salah a-Din road, and dismantle the military installations in the area. Hamas power and rule: 'We will rebuild every house that is not completely destroyed' This will begin the return of the displaced Palestinians northward via the same road that crosses the Strip along its length near the Gaza coast. The agreement stipulates that there will be no security checks on those walking – but only on vehicles moving north, checks that will be carried out by a private American company that will cooperate with an Egyptian company. The U.S. company will send about 100 armed security personnel, most of whom are Americans and some of whom speak Arabic. The security personnel will be from elite units or former CIA personnel. On the 22nd day of the agreement, the withdrawal from the Netzarim Corridor is scheduled to continue and the forces are required to leave the Salah ad-Din Road as well, and dismantle the military installations in this area. In a statement released Thursday by Hamas ahead of the return of the displaced to the north, it emphasized that it will begin on Saturday after the release of the kidnapped women is completed; Israel expects that the civilian Arbel Yehoud will be one of them. In its statement, Hamas emphasized that refugees returning to the north are not allowed to carry weapons, but no one would be surprised if the terrorist organization tried to violate the terms of the agreement and transfer weapons to the north through covert means. Hamas, which has been trying to demonstrate its power and governmental capabilities since the ceasefire began on Sunday , including deploying armed police in various areas of the Gaza Strip, is now also trying to present itself as working to help the refugees, and announced that it will help set up tents for those returning to the north. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters Thursday that the terror organization is in talks with several Arab countries and 'international parties' about helping the refugees return, including providing tents. Abu Zuhri promised that Hamas would immediately begin rebuilding homes that were not completely destroyed. 'We are going to invest all our capabilities to help our people. Municipalities have plans in place to welcome the families returning to the north, including setting up tents for them,' he said. There is not a single house standing: 'The smell of dead bodies in the streets' Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim claimed Thursday that the expected return of the refugees is an expression of Israel's apparent 'failure' in the war, and its attempt, he said, 'to uproot the Palestinian people from their lands.' In an interview with the Palestinian news agency Shehab, he added: 'The steadfastness and courage of the Palestinian people in Gaza have thwarted Israel's plan to uproot the Palestinian people from their lands. The demands of our people are clear, and they are the right to establish an independent state on the liberated lands. No force will destroy our march toward freedom and independence.' Since the cease-fire began, crowds of refugees already in the north have returned to their neighborhoods – and are shocked by the extensive destruction. In Jabaliya, some are now living right in the rubble, trying to warm themselves on freezing nights around bonfires. 'They are talking about a truce, a cease-fire, and the delivery of aid. It has been three days since we came back, and we cannot find water to drink. We cannot find covers to keep our children warm. We depend on bonfires all night. We wish to have some firewood for the bonfire, we use plastic, which causes diseases,' said Mohammed Badr, a father of 10. His wife, Umm Nidal, said she was still in shock at the destruction in Jabaliya. 'There is nothing left, you cannot walk in the streets. Houses collapsed on top of each other. You get lost, you don’t know if this is your home or not,' she said. 'The smell of dead bodies, and the martyrs are in the streets.' At the same time, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, relatively unusual footage was released Thursday of a gunfight between armed men – whose identities are reportedly unclear – around a humanitarian aid truck that had gotten stuck. According to Reuters, the battle lasted about 10 minutes. In the Rafah area, the Hamas government also claimed Thursday that two Palestinians were killed by Israeli tank fire, and the IDF said that the claims were being investigated. As part of the deal, Israel allowed a surge in the volume of humanitarian aid flowing into the Gaza Strip – and although according to the agreement the number is supposed to be 600 trucks a day, on Wednesday, according to reports, 897 trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, as part of its attempts to demonstrate its governing capabilities in the Gaza Strip, and thus claim victory over Israel, which promised to destroy the terrorist organization, Hamas also promises to help secure the aid convoys and prevent their looting. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'We want to prevent any kind of security vacuum,' said Ismail al-Thawbata, director of the Hamas government's communications office in the Gaza Strip. He claimed that about 700 Hamas police officers would help protect the aid convoys, and that since the cease-fire began, not a single truck had been looted - in contrast to the numerous cases of looting and robbery by gangs during the war. A UN spokesman confirmed to Reuters that, as of Tuesday, no cases of looting of aid trucks had been reported. Al-Thawbata also claimed that, although Israel has eliminated many Hamas operatives throughout the war, it still employs about 18,000 workers 'who provide services to civilians on a daily basis,' as he put it. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjce6qxokx	2025-01-23T13:40:12-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/23/rybhzkxuyx/rybhzkxuyx_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Trump to appoint Mideast envoy Witkoff to handle the Iran portfol...	Before reactivating 'maximum pressure' campaign against the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, Trump plans to examine whether he can reach a diplomatic settlement with Iran, the Financial Times reports; Trump: 'It would be nice if the Iranian issue could be resolved, without Israel attacking military facilities on its territory' U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to appoint his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff , as responsible for handling Washington's diplomacy with Iran, the British Financial Times reported on Thursday. Sources familiar with the details claimed that the move indicates that Trump is willing to consider a diplomatic solution before increasing pressure on the Islamic Republic. A former senior Israeli official told the newspaper that 'I don't see the administration using force at the beginning of their term before at least trying to exhaust other means. This does not fit with the approach that war started with Biden and he's going to end them.' Meanwhile, on Thursday Trump said while signing more executive orders that 'it would be nice if the Iranian issue could be resolved, without Israel attacking military facilities on its territory.' Witkoff, who played a crucial role in reaching agreements on the hostage deal and cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, is expected to head the team that will handle the U.S. response to the Iranian nuclear program, as part of Trump's promise to 'stop the wars' in the Middle East, according to the sources. In his first term, Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement with Iran in 2018, imposing severe sanctions on the Islamic Republic, warning that if it fought Washington and worked to obtain nuclear weapons, 'that would be the official end of Iran.' After the November election, during the period between administrations, Trump’s team outlined plans to relaunch the 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran, whether through new sanctions or toughening existing measures. However, Trump and his aides have expressed a desire in early meetings to leave room for avoiding a full-scale confrontation with Iran, and several administration officials have told foreign diplomats and their counterparts that they expect Witkoff to lead efforts to see if a diplomatic settlement can be reached with Iran. However, Witkoff's main focus is expected to continue to be the implementation of the Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal. At the same time as speculation has risen about Witkoff, Trump appointed Morgan Ortagus, State Department spokeswoman in his first term, as Witkoff's deputy. Ortagus previously served in the Middle East and is familiar with the region. U.S. officials say that Trump's approach toward Tehran, and Witkoff's powers, have not yet been clarified, but several of the new president's appointments hold positions that negotiations with Iran should be considered, and have also expressed doubts about attacking its nuclear facilities. Among the new appointments are Michael DiMino, a senior Trump administration official in the Pentagon on Middle East issues, who previously served in the CIA, and who has expressed support for implementing a restrained policy toward Tehran. Elbridge Colby, Trump's nominee for undersecretary of defense for policy, has also warned against any military action against Iran. The two stand against more hawkish elements in the new administration, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said in his Senate confirmation hearing that he would support 'any arrangement that allows us to have safety and stability in the region but one in which we’re clear-eyed.' White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said that 'we have no announcements to share at this time,' when asked about the new administration's approach toward Iran. At the same time, Western sources believe that Iran is in its weakest position in decades, after the destruction of the Hamas terror army in the Gaza Strip and the severe blow that the IDF inflicted on Hezbollah in Lebanon. Added to these is Israel's extensive air attack on Iran, which resulted in the destruction of most of its air defense systems. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Iran, for its part, has also signaled that it is open to negotiations, although analysts estimate that any dialogue with the Islamic Republic will be difficult for it and for Trump. Iran’s vice-president for strategic affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif recently said at the Davos forum that he hopes Trump will be 'more serious, more focused, and more realistic' with Iran. He noted that the sanctions have imposed a heavy economic burden on Iranian citizens and its government, but refused to admit that his country has a hand in the terrorist activities of organizations such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen. 'We have never had 'proxies,'' he claimed. At the same time, the Saudi Al-Hadath TV channel reported that the Iranian foreign minister said that the Islamic Republic is 'ready for negotiations with Washington.' Witkoff's appointment as Iran special envoy has sparked opposition from some of his opponents in Congress and in Washington in general, who worry he will be too quick to drop pressure on Iran in trying to achieve a possible deal. 'He’s already lifting pressure on Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, and in the process abandoning American hostages and endangering Israel,' said a senior Republican Congressional staffer. 'He keeps saying he knows what Trump wants, but he doesn’t understand what Trump believes.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skkt7medje	2025-01-23T11:46:40-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/11/ry6eo1xv1x/ry6eo1xv1x_1_314_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Palestinian-supporting reporter ambushes IDF general in London	A British pro-Palestinian journalist accosted the IDF Operations Chief, Major General Oded Basiuk, who arrived in London to discuss cease-fire; Meanwhile, anti-Israel Hind Rajab Foundation files another complaint in Central Europe against IDF reservist who served in Gaza A pro-Palestinian journalist in London accosted the head of the IDF Operations Department, Major General Oded Basiuk, at the entrance to a research institute building in the city. 'Are you a war criminal?' Basiuk was asked on Wednesday. He seemed surprised by the encounter, but did not answer and entered the building. Basiuk reportedly was accompanied by Brigadier General Elad Goren, the head of the humanitarian-civilian effort in Gaza, and other officers. The journalist who accosted Basiuk reported that the Israeli delegation arrived in Britain to review the cease-fire efforts with the local army, and to discuss what would happen if it collapsed. 'General Basiuk, what did you discuss at the Ministry of Defense? Are you worried that you will be investigated by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for war crimes?' journalist Alex Morris also asked. After the Israeli delegation entered, Morris tried to follow it into the building and was pushed back by the guard. In a video he posted, he reported that 'I photographed Israeli General Oded Basiuk, who was the head of the operations in Gaza as part of Israel's brutal genocide in the last 15 months in Gaza. He entered the RUSI building in Whitehall, London.' The foundation that 'hunted' soldiers Meanwhile, in recent days, the anti-Israel Hind Rajab Foundation, which is behind a global campaign against IDF soldiers, which is behind an attempted legal battle against IDF soldiers, has filed another complaint in Central Europe against another reservist who served in combat engineering in the Gaza Strip. D., 35, a Tel Aviv resident against whom the complaint was filed, told Ynet 'I think they are focusing on images of combat engineering soldiers because it is easiest to get caught up in this. In engineering work, you see the destruction of houses which are terrorist infrastructures. Every house we have destroyed is a terror house, which we have intelligence for.' The Hind Rajab Foundation, an offshoot of the pro-Palestinian March 30 movement, was established by two Lebanese nationals, Dyab Abou Jahjah and Karim Hassoun, now residing in Belgium. Named after a six-year-old Palestinian girl allegedly killed in Gaza by the IDF on January 29, 2024, the organization claims to focus on bringing justice to Palestinians. D. said that no one in the IDF or the Defense Ministry has contacted him. 'Yesterday, reporters and friends sent me messages and I understood the problem I was in. Six months ago, I saw photos of me that were distributed on antisemitic websites. This is the state forsaking IDF soldiers, ignoring obvious things. It does not make sense that reporters and friends get information before our security agencies,' he said. According to him, 'Another point is the diplomatic problem. If I am arrested abroad, it is true that it will be unpleasant for me, but the entire State of Israel is in trouble. With proper work, this too could have been easily avoided. Again, the State of Israel thinks that if you ignore a problem, it will disappear. It will not disappear. There is a complex issue here that needs to be addressed. What mother would want to send her son to be a combat soldier if she knows that he is exposed to lawsuits? He has no protection. This can hurt you if you are traveling, or if you want to work for an international company. The first thing that will come up about you on the internet is that you took part in genocide.'

I don't know what would have happened if this had been filed before I returned, I might have been arrested in a foreign country. This is a big problem, especially when no official has bothered to contact me until now. I am worried about the next time this happens to me, when I want to travel, and also in terms of career and investments. Even in the future, this thing will exist.

UK teenager jailed for minimum of 52 years for 'harrowing' Southp...	A British teenager who killed three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event was jailed for at least 52 years on Thursday, for an attack Prime Minister Keir Starmer called one of the most harrowing moments in Britain's history. Axel Rudakubana, 18, admitted killing the girls and stabbing 10 others last July in the northern English town of Southport, an atrocity that shocked Britain and was followed by days of nationwide rioting. Prosecutor Deanna Heer told Liverpool Crown Court that Rudakubana was obsessed with violence and genocide, and two of his victims suffered such terrible injuries they were 'difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature.' Judge Julian Goose said Rudakubana should serve a minimum of 52 years. He said he could not impose a full life sentence as Rudakubana was 17 when the attack took place but he was unlikely ever to be released.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rygqt11x00je	2025-01-23T09:42:10-08:00

Netanyahu responds to Nazi salute uproar: 'Musk is being falsely ...	Just days after American tycoon Elon Musk caused a stir when he made a gesture reminiscent of a Nazi salute, the prime minister stood by him. 'Elon is a great friend of Israel,' Netanyahu wrote on the X platform, owned by the billionaire who is close to President Trump Three days after Elon Musk made a gesture that was reminiscent of a Nazi salute and caused a stir, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is addressing it for the first time, and expressing support for Elon Musk . 'Elon Musk is being falsely smeared,' Netanyahu wrote in a tweet on the X platform, owned by Musk, who is close to U.S. President Donald Trump and is considered one of his senior advisers. About 20 minutes later, Musk retweeted Netanyahu's comment and added 'Thank you.' The prime minister wrote that 'Elon is a great friend of Israel. He visited Israel after the October 7 massacre in which Hamas terrorists committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. He has since repeatedly and forcefully supported Israel’s right to defend itself against genocidal terrorists and regimes who seek to annihilate the one and only Jewish state. I thank him for this.'

Many were shocked by the disturbing 'gesture' and accused Musk of fascism and antisemitism, with some even claiming that 'now the real Musk is starting to emerge.' On the other hand, Musk's supporters, now joined by Netanyahu, offered a host of arguments in his defense, ranging from 'he actually intended to do the Roman handshake' to 'he is diagnosed with Asperger's and was unable to control his emotions.' Others suggested that this was simply an innocent gesture stemming from excitement and related to the last sentence that Musk said in his speech: 'My heart goes out to you.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1ebjegukx	2025-01-23T08:46:46-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/SyxYKJHnwkx/SyxYKJHnwkx_0_46_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Jerusalem and Moscow are working together to release three hostages who are not included in Phase 1 of the release deal; One of them, she noted in an interview with a local news website, is Maxim Herkin, whose daughter and mother hold Russian citizenship; The names of the other two hostages were not given Israel's ambassador to Moscow, Simona Halperin, revealed Thursday in an interview with the Russian news website RBC that Israel and Russia are working together to release three Russia-connected hostages being held in the Gaza Strip who are not included in Phase 1 of the deal. She noted that one of them is the kidnapped Maxim Herkin, a 36-year-old native of the Donbas region from Tirat Carmel, who does not hold Russian citizenship, but his daughter was born and lives in the Russia. After Herkin was kidnapped, his mother also received Russian citizenship. The names of the two other kidnapped people whom Moscow and Jerusalem, according to the ambassador, are working to free were not disclosed. 'We really hope that the Russian side can help with this. I truly believe that if the Russian side demands it persistently enough, it will be able to facilitate the release of these three hostages,' Halperin emphasized. The ambassador noted that Sasha Trupanov, a Russian national whose name is included in Phase 1 of the deal, is expected to be released at this stage, not thanks to Russian efforts, but due to the fact that he was injured during his kidnapping on October 7. Since the morning of the massacre, several videos and signs of life have been received from Trupanov -who is being held by Islamic Jihad, the last of which was in November. According to the ambassador, his inclusion in the humanitarian deal was discussed at the beginning of the negotiations with Hamas and the other terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip.

Kidnapped Israeli Elizabeth Tsurkov is alive in Iraq and efforts ...	Iraqi's foreign minister announced that the government in Baghdad is working to release the researcher, who was kidnapped two years ago by a pro-Iranian militia; New push comes with Israel increasing efforts to free her in the background, and optimism in the shadow of Trump's return to the White House and the hostage deal with Hamas Elizabeth Tsurkov, the Israeli researcher who was kidnapped in Iraq almost two years ago, is alive and the Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al Sudani, is working to free her, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein told the American news website Axios Thursday. Tsurkov, 36, an Israeli national with Russian citizenship who was living in the United States during her Princeton University doctoral studies, was abducted on March 26, 2023, in Baghdad while conducting research. Authorities believe she is held by Kataib Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian militia, though the group denies involvement. The Iraqi foreign minister's comments come about two weeks after a senior Israeli official told the Washington Post that Israel had recently stepped up efforts to free Tsurkov . He said that Israel's allies are also involved in these efforts, and the issue was even raised at a meeting of special envoys for hostage affairs in Jerusalem this week. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The Israeli official said that the envoys came from the U.S., Britain, Germany, Austria and Canada, and met with members of the Tsurkov family. Israel asked them to use their embassies in Baghdad to put pressure on the Iraqi government to seek a way to begin negotiations. Since Israel and Iraq do not have diplomatic relations, the government official said that he hopes that other countries will assist in the efforts. 'Many countries have embassies and relations with Iraq,' he said. The senior Israeli official who spoke to The Washington Post added that, after months of covert efforts, Israel now believes that 'changes in the region' have created an opportunity to act publicly for Tsurkov's release. Alongside the strategic blow suffered by Iran and its proxies during the war, another major change that has sparked optimism is the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House, and the deadline Trump set has already helped reach the hostage deal with Hamas and its actual implementation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjn0xkxuke	2025-01-23T07:13:08-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/07/06/rkkLYCXFh/rkkLYCXFh_0_210_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

ICC prosecutor seeks arrest warrants for two Taliban leaders in A...	The International Criminal Court prosecutor said on Thursday he had applied for arrest warrants for two Taliban leaders in Afghanistan including supreme spiritual leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, accusing them of the persecution of women and girls. A statement issued by the office of chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said investigators found reasonable grounds to believe that Akhundzada and Abdul Hakim Haqqani, who has served as chief justice since 2021, 'bear criminal responsibility for the crime against humanity of persecution on gender grounds.' They are 'criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women...and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women,' the statement said. Persecution has taken place across Afghanistan from at least Aug. 15, 2021 - the day that Taliban forces captured the capital Kabul - to the present day, the prosecutor said. Since the Islamist group returned to power in 2021 it has clamped down on women's rights, including limits to schooling, work and general independence in daily life. There was no immediate comment by Taliban leaders on the prosecutor's statement, which was welcomed by groups defending women's rights. It will now be up to a three-judge panel at the ICC to rule on the prosecution request, which has no set deadline. Such procedures take an average of three months. It was the first time ICC prosecutors have publicly sought warrants in their investigation into potential war crimes in Afghanistan, which dates back to 2007 and once included alleged crimes by the U.S. military there. PERSECUTION OF GIRLS Khan said his office was demonstrating its commitment to pursuing accountability for gender-based crimes and that the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic sharia law could not be a justification for human rights abuses or crimes. 'Afghan women and girls as well as the LGBTQI+ community are facing an unprecedented, unconscionable and ongoing persecution by the Taliban. Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable,' the prosecutor said. Zalmai Nishat, founder of the UK-based charity Mosaic Afghanistan, said if ICC warrants were issued it may have little impact on Akhundzada, who rarely travels outside Afghanistan. 'But in terms of international reputation of the Taliban, this basically means a complete erosion of their international legitimacy, if they had any,' he said. COURT IN CRISIS Khan's move came amid an existential crisis at the court, opened in The Hague in 2002 to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing new economic sanctions against it for issuing an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged crimes in Gaza. Moscow struck back at the ICC for its 2023 warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin by issuing a warrant of its own for Khan. Despite the recent string of high-profile arrest warrants, courtrooms in The Hague are virtually empty and Khan is under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct in the workplace, which he denies. The ICC has no police force and relies on its 125 member states to make arrests. But several European member states have expressed doubts about detaining Netanyahu and this week Italy arrested an ICC suspect, but failed to hand him over.

Military sets up checkpoints to prevent drive-by shootings; security officials warn disruption of traffic cannot last long and would eventually raise tensions, provoke further violence West Bank traffic was delayed in massive traffic jams caused by IDF roadblocks and checkpoints set up to bolster security ahead of the release of terrorists from Israeli prisons on Saturday, as part of the cease-fire agreement in Gaza. The move aims to minimize the risk of drive-by shooting attacks on roads shared by Israelis and Palestinians but has resulted mounting frustration among Palestinian residents. 'I left work at noon and didn’t arrive home until 8 p.m. There’s no explanation—just an attempt to make life harder for innocent Palestinians,' Ahmad, a resident of Nablus said. Ahmad also added that he has stopped going to work due to the gridlock. 'These traffic jams have become living spaces. People pray, eat, and wait outside their cars until the roads clear.' Ahmad noted that the impact has been particularly hard on women. 'There are no bathrooms, and they are left with no choice but to endure the humiliation.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Said Issa, a resident of Yatta near Hebron, shared a similar experience: 'I was stuck from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. for no apparent reason. When I finally passed, no one even checked my car. It’s absurd—what should be a five-minute trip takes hours.' The situation has disrupted daily life and business. Taxi driver Omar Burayni, who operates the Ramallah-Nablus route, said ridership has plummeted. 'There used to be 200 taxis a day; now, it’s barely 40. Everyone is waiting for this nightmare to end.' Security concerns and rising tensions The checkpoints coincide with the first phase of a hostage exchange deal but were implemented earlier to counter the threat of shooting attacks from passing vehicles. The IDF, the Shin Bet, and the Border Police have held situational assessments with Central Command Chief Maj. Gen. Avi Blot to prevent armed demonstrations during the prisoner release, which could provoke further violence. Seven additional battalions have been deployed to reinforce the region. Initially, the West Bank was considered a secondary front in the ongoing conflict, and security forces succeeded in preventing widespread unrest despite Hamas' efforts to incite violence. However, with most fronts now under ceasefire and the IDF focused on operations in Jenin, attention has returned to the West Bank. Palestinian sources report that major checkpoints causing gridlock are located near Ramallah, Qalqilya, Nablus, the Jordan Valley, and Tubas. According to the Palestinian Authority’s Committee Against the Separation Wall and Settlements, the number of Israeli checkpoints and gates in the West Bank has risen to 898 since the start of the war. While the measures aim to enhance security, some Israeli defense officials acknowledge the risk of prolonged unrest.

Security officials warn against delaying IDF withdrawal from Leba...	Some in political circles say Netanyahu may try to slow walk to delay pullback amid pressure from far-right Finance Minister; the officials say it would be devastating to the extraordinary military achievements in the war Senior security officials warned on Thursday that a delay of the IDF withdrawal from Lebanon would be devastating. According to the cease-fire agreement negotiated to end the war with Hezbollah, that stipulated that the terror group must be kept north of the Litani River, IDF troops must leave South Lebanon on Sunday, 60 days after the agreement came into effect. 'The IDF is effectively enforcing the deal,' the officials said. 'IF we don't show the Americans and the Lebanese that we are complying with the terms of the agreement, we are putting our outstanding military achievements at risk,' the officials said amid their concerns that Hezbollah will rebuild its strength if Israel does will not stay true to its commitments to Lebanon. Some in political circles believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to slow walk or delay the military withdrawal, because of among other things, pressure from his far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich. The security officials pointed to the presence of American's in Lebanon as one of the clear advantages in the deal, that could be in danger. 'The current American administration could reexamine its position there, if the deal collapses. The fact that they are there, provides a high level of certainty for stability,' they said. 'There is today, an extraordinary and historic potential, the best since the 1980s, to reduce the terrorist forces including Hezbollah and achieve calm. There is Saudi and American will to rebuild there and a new president whom Israel may be able to work with,' the said warning that chance must not be lost. They claimed the IDF would continue to enforce the terms of the deal and initiate attacks over any violation from Hezbollah. According to the cease-fire agreement, only Lebanon's army forces will be allowed to bare arms or use military force in South Lebanon, as of Sunday. They must work to dismantle any military or terror infrastructure built by Hezbollah in the areas south of the Litani. According to Arab media reports, the Lebanon Army was trying to deploy to the South according to UN resolution 1701 but were coming across Israeli forces in some areas. In one report, a Lebanon army force was surprised to encounter three IDF tanks in the South Lebanon village of Talusa and delayed its deployment there. Lebanese troops completed preparations to deploy elsewhere in the area and were preventing the return of villages from areas where IDF troops had not left. Lebanon's former prime minister Njib Mikati said earlier this week that in a meeting of the international Cessation of Hostilities Implementation Mechanism, the committee that oversees the compliance with the cease-fire deal, the American chairman Major General Jasper Jeffers told him that the Israeli withdrawal might be delayed by a number of days.

Zubeidi, a former commander of Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin jailed for invilvement in multiple shooting attacks and attempted to escape Gilboa prison; IDF warns that if he engages in terrorism or posseses a firearm, would be targeted Israeli officials anticipate that Zakaria Zubeidi, a former commander of Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin, will be among the Palestinian prisoners freed in exchange for four Israeli hostages on Saturday. The release, part of the second phase of a negotiated agreement, comes 477 days after the hostages were abducted to Gaza. Among those expected to return to Israel are Arbel Yehud and three female lookout soldiers. The IDF is preparing for Zubeidi’s release, given his symbolic status in Jenin, and will maintain intelligence surveillance over his activities. Officials have issued a clear warning: if Zubeidi or any other released prisoners engage in terrorism or possess weapons, they will be targeted. Zubeidi was arrested in 2019 for involvement in multiple shooting attacks near Beit El. In September 2021, he made headlines after escaping from Gilboa Prison with five other Islamic Jihad inmates. He was recaptured five days later and sentenced to five years in prison. Zubeidi has previously spent extensive time in Israeli custody.

US security firm readies to inspect Gazans returning to north ami...	Hostage and cease-fire deal stipulates displaced Gazans returning north by foot would not be inspected while all traffic will be held for searches in efforts to prevent terrorists and weapons from moving into the area Representatives from U.S. security company tasked with conducting security inspections on the Netzarim Corridor to prevent the return of terrorists and weapons in vehicles to northern Gaza have arrived in Israel in recent days. Preparations for the company’s first inspection pilot, scheduled for Sunday, are underway. The company employs about 100 armed personnel, mainly Americans, including some Arabic speakers. Many are veterans of elite units or former CIA operatives. Under the cease-fire agreement in Gaza, the IDF is required to withdraw from the coastal Al-Rashid Road eastward to Salah al-Din Road by Saturday, the seventh day of the agreement, and dismantle its military installations in the area. The move will allow displaced Palestinians to return northward. The agreement stipulates that inspections will apply only to vehicles heading north, conducted by the private security firm, while pedestrians won’t be inspected. By the 22nd day of the agreement, the IDF is expected to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor, vacate Salah al-Din Road and dismantle additional military installations in the area. Vehicle inspections will take place at a designated inspection facility secured by an Egyptian security company. Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) will oversee the entry of the American team and coordinate their operations in Gaza. A multinational commission has been established to manage and oversee the safe passage of vehicles, facilitating the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza. It includes Safe Reach Solution (SRS), a strategic planning and logistics firm; UG Solutions, a recognized global provider of integrated security solutions and the Egyptian security and inspection company. A statement from the consortium stressed its neutrality, commitment to high professional standards and role in supporting the cease-fire agreement while promoting long-term stability in Gaza. Funding for the consortium and involved companies does not come from Israel but is managed by the deal’s mediators — Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. Qatar is believed to provide the majority of the funding. As part of the agreement, the IDF will withdraw from populated areas while maintaining control over a 700-meter buffer zone along the border with Gaza, within Gazan territory.

Afghan migrant behind fatal stabbing attack kiling a child and a ...	Chancellor Olaf Scholz expresses outrage at the attack and calls it an 'act of terror' as looming elections could mean support for far-right AfD party A 28-year-old Afghan migrant was behind the fatal stabbing attack in Germany on Wednesday, killing a toddler and a man in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria. The attacker targeted a group of children in a park midday, resulting in the deaths of a 2-year-old Moroccan boy and a 41-year-old German man who tried to intervene. A Syrian girl and two adults were injured and hospitalized. German authorities arrested the assailant after a 12-minute chase. The motive remains unclear, but German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the attack 'an unbelievable act of terror.' The attacker, an asylum seeker slated for deportation, had evaded bureaucratic processes. He had previously been brought before authorities three times for violent assaults, referred for psychiatric evaluation and released. Arriving in Germany in late 2022, he applied for asylum in early 2023. His request was denied, but authorities closed his case after he claimed he would leave voluntarily — a promise that wasn’t enforced. He continued living in refugee housing. A search of his room revealed no signs of religious radicalization but medications indicated mental health issues. The incident deals a significant blow to Germany's centrist parties, just a month before federal elections, as voter support increasingly shifts toward the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Immigration is expected to dominate campaign discussions amid rising violence linked to migrants. A series of knife attacks by Syrian and Afghan migrants has already prompted the German government to decide on deporting offenders to their home countries. Three weeks ago, a Syrian migrant stabbed two men in Berlin’s Charlottenburg neighborhood, leaving one critically injured. Chancellor Scholz expressed frustration after the Aschaffenburg attack, saying: 'I am sick of seeing such acts of violence occurring in our country every few weeks, by perpetrators who have actually come here to find protection here. Tolerance shouldn’t be mistaken for weakness in such cases. Authorities must explain why this attacker was still in Germany. Talking isn’t enough — we need action.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Peter Neumann, an expert on Islamic terrorism and radicalization, posted on his X account, writing: 'In my opinion, the horrific attack in Aschaffenburg is the result of a broken system that keeps large numbers of young men in refugee shelters for years. This leads to radicalization, violent crime and mental health issues. No one benefits — not society, nor asylum seekers who genuinely need help.' He added, 'Society and politics face a choice: either we commit to integrating migrants with greater effort, as we’ve said we can, or we acknowledge that we can’t and change the system. Either way, this cannot continue.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syoq2u1u1x	2025-01-23T01:17:45-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/23/SJgLDVPkuyx/SJgLDVPkuyx_336_550_2522_1420_0_small.jpg
Nukhba exhibit' sows confusion and terror in Kfar Saba	Police dismantle installation showing puppets dressed in Hamas terrorists' grabs placed in a pickup truck after worried locals informed forces Police forces on Thursday launched an investigation after a display featuring dolls resembling Hamas’ Nukhba terrorists on a pickup truck was set up in Kfar Saba. Residents passing by Tel Hai Street near the Kfar Saba municipal building were alarmed by the sight of the pickup truck and the 'terrorists' inside, prompting some to call the police. The display was dismantled and the circumstances behind the incident are being examined. Right-wing activist Ayelet Lash, a resident of the West Bank, posted a photo of the display on X (formerly Twitter), writing: 'This morning in Kfar Saba – a display showing a glimpse of what will happen if the State of Israel doesn’t quickly conquer Jenin, expel its terrorists and establish Jewish settlements there. No operation, no halfway measures. All-out war or the girls of Kfar Saba will be dragged to Jenin.'

Despite IDF warning of rocket strike, Nova party not shut down, n...	Protecting intelligence sources prioritized over indications of possible rocket attack, cross border incursions and fire on gas rig; only minor steps taken, according to new details in miliary probes of Oct. 7 failings On the night before the October 7 Hamas massacre, an IDF intelligence unit collected signs of preparation for rocket fire on Israel. The unit also observed unusual activity of the Hamas aerial force that could indicate a transition of the terror group, to emergency mode. Those indications, especially the possible rocket fire and others gathered, were discussed in IDF consultations in the following hours but did not bring about a decision to raise the alarm over a possible Hamas assault or to any significant steps being taken. This information was included in documents reviewed by senior government and security officials and presented in their arguments for the resignation of Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. Contrary to earlier reporting, the IDF not only estimated that Hamas was preparing for a military exercise or to defend against a possible Israeli attack but had seriously considered the possibility that the terror group was about to launch an assault on Israel. Despite that, the IDF decided on a limited number of actions. Amid calming indications and a wide consensus across the military and intelligence, the IDF opted to avoid exposing sensitive intelligence sources rather than preparedness. These revelations expose a central and dramatic aspect of that night. A participant in recent consultations on the matter defined them 'a nuclear bomb.' Since the massacre, other indications that the intelligence had, came to light including the use of Israeli SIM cards and the deployment of emergency assets in the Strip, used during the 2021 conflict two years earlier. But the preparation to launch a rocket attack, 'were a worrying sign on its own, and more so when it is added to other concerning indications.' The military is continuing its review and inquiries into the failings on that night. A person present in conversations about those inquiring said an senior officer had asked why there were no steps taken to prepare for a rocket attack, including moving the thousands of people from the Nova music festival grounds near the border where there were not enough shelters to protect against a rocket and mortar strike? There is also a question of whether instructions that were given, such as launching an intelligence flight over Gaza, were carried out? At 2 am, the Air Force duty command center was notified about the unusual activity in the Hamas aerial units. At the same time more indications of preparations for a rocket strike were received. All of that information was discussed in a call that Yaron Finkelman, the chief of the Southern Command held with other senior officers, Shin Bet representatives and a representative of the Air Force. Their evaluation written in simple terms read 'unusual activity was identified.' Finkelman said there were three possibilities, the third being an assault. IDF prioritizes protecting intelligence sources As Ynet reported last Novermber, Finkelman gave a serious of orders but all were to be carried out while protecting sources and were to prevent Hamas from realizing Israel was aware of its unusual activities and to avoid 'miscalculations.' An official close to the government said the Southern Command was aware of the Nova festival and had given the organizers the license for it. 'If the information, not about the assault but about possible rocket fire, not meet the standard to stop the party, what would have?' 'Protecting sources was prioritized,' said a senior officer, to explain the gap between the general consensus that there was low probability of an assault and the indications in the report. 'If someone would have thought that there was really a danger, preventing it would have been prioritized over any of the intelligence sources and that is why a limited group was involved in the discussions.' Missing from them were the chief of military intelligence and the Commander of the Air Force. Summary of the Southern Command's consultations was delivered to Chief of IDF operations General Oded Basyuk who conducted a number of telephone calls. 'After consulting the deputy head of Shin Bet, commander of the Southern Command, operations commander and intelligence research department chief, there are three possible scenarios,' he wrote. 'A Hamas drill, increased preparedness to defend against an Israeli attack, preparations for an operation against Israel in the coming hours including incursion from the sea or a strike on the gas rig, breeching the border, abduction, shooting attack, rocket attack and an incursion from the air.' He ordered a number of actions including a review of Israel's aerial defenses around the gas rig but although he understood that there was a risk of a rocket strike, abduction or 'an unusual terror attack, the conclusion was that there must be careful preparation to protect sensitive sources and coordinate actions with military intelligence.' (Later review showed that the Intelligence forces' operational brigade was not tapped about the possible deployment of forces along the border in the overnight hours and there is an ongoing debate about the responsibility for that.) Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The chief of staff who held consultations with Basyuk and Finkelman at 4 am, ordered an aerial intelligence flight and said that if Hamas was conducting a drill, this would be an opportunity to gather information.

His office summoned some senior commanders for 8.30 am. The IDF said in response to this report that the details in it are not from the official IDF probe. 'The IDF will complete its inquiries into the Oct. 7 massacre in the coming weeks and will present their findings to the public.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syyu6fkd1g	2025-01-23T00:55:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/08/14/r1lrBOLqqC/r1lrBOLqqC_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

Local authorities bring Layal Alekhtiar in for questioning before releasing on bail; military court judge says she remains under investigation Layal Alekhtiar, a Lebanese journalist and presenter for the Saudi TV network Al Arabiya landed in hot water in October 2023 after her interview with IDF spokesperson in Arabic Col. Avichay Adraee. During the interview, Alekhtiar referred to Adraee as 'the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces' and 'Mr. Adraee,' sparking a media campaign against her led by Hezbollah supporters. The Lebanese military prosecution subsequently filed a legal case against her, alleging a violation of Lebanon's anti-Israel boycott law. On Wednesday, Alekhtiar, who had been abroad during the intervening period, arrived at Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut and was taken directly to the military court for questioning. According to a Lebanese report, her return to Beirut aimed to resolve her legal status. Alekhtiar was released on bail of 50 million Lebanese pounds (approximately $558), with Judge Fadi Sawan saying she remains under investigation. Alekhtiar, a prominent presenter known for her opposition to Hezbollah, has faced significant criticism over the years. Following the 2023 interview and subsequent controversy, she took to the social media platform X, calling the situation a 'political persecution and judicial oppression.' She stressed, 'This has nothing to do with truth or justice. I’m not afraid because I’m Lebanese until Judgment Day – until my last breath. You will not touch my freedom, my dignity or my beliefs, no matter what you do.' Al Arabiya also condemned the attacks on the journalist, expressed support for her and said that Alekhtiar sought to cover all sides professionally. 'At Al Arabiya, we stress that what Alekhtiar has faced is an attack on journalism, its values and the pursuit of balanced and professional news coverage,' the network said.

IDF kills terrorists behind fatal West Bank attack	Mohamad Nazzal and Katiba Shalabi, residents of Qabatiya, who were affiliated with the Islamic Jihad were killed during the Shin Bet and IDF counter terrorism operation in Jenin after troops surrounded the building where they had barricaded themselves Security forces late on Wednesday killed two terrorists who carried out the fatal attack in the West Bank earlier this month, murdering three people.

As Trump begins second term, his youngest son moves into the spot...	At 18, Barron Trump receives public attention with intelligence, wit, and reserved charm. Fluent in two languages and raised in privilege, he remains a mystery as his father begins a second term as President of the United States For nearly a decade, the Trump family has occupied a curious corner of Israeli pop culture. While some may still fondly remember Donald Trump’s cameo in Home Alone 2, his family—particularly his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka—has become a regular feature in gossip columns. But now, the spotlight shifts to Barron Trump, the youngest of Donald’s five children, who recently turned 18. Barron has long kept a low profile compared to his older siblings, Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany. But his story is no less intriguing. Back in 2005, just six months after their wedding, Melania and Donald learned they were expecting. Melania vividly remembers breaking the news to her husband: 'He came home, and I told him he was going to be a father. At first, he needed time to process it—it was a real surprise—but he was very happy.' Donald, for his part, admitted he wasn’t entirely caught off guard. 'I expected we’d have kids, but I was surprised by how quickly it happened.' He was born in March of 2006. Donald, however, chose not to be present at the birth, explaining he thought Melania would be more comfortable without him there. Melania later shared that the delivery, which lasted eight hours, was 'very easy.' Donald also selected the name Barron, claiming he’d always liked it but hadn’t had the chance to use it with his other children. Melania initially resisted but ultimately agreed. As Barron grew, his education reflected his privileged upbringing. He attended elite schools, including Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School in Manhattan. Even after his father became president in 2017, Barron stayed in New York to finish his schooling. During his final year, in classic Trump fashion, Barron treated his entire class to a tour of the White House, complete with Secret Service agents and a personal meeting with his father. In May 2017, Barron moved to the prestigious Episcopal School in Maryland, where tuition set his father back $40,000 a year. More recently, after Donald’s presidency, Barron transferred to Oxbridge Academy in Palm Beach. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Fluent in both English and Slovene, Barron has led a relatively private life, thanks to his mother’s protective efforts. 'Barron is a shy, reserved boy,' shared a family insider. 'Melania is a very hands-on mother, focusing all her attention on Barron and her family.' Fast forward to this week’s inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States, where Barron once again caught public attention. While Melania’s wide-brimmed hat—blocking Donald from kissing her cheek—stirred social media memes, Barron’s sharp, tailored look sparked curiosity. Nathan Pearce, CEO of Pearce Bespoke, shared insights about working with Barron on his suit for the event. 'He’s incredibly intelligent; it’s fascinating to talk to him,' Pearce told Women’s Wear Daily. 'He’s sharp, mature, and knowledgeable about history.' Pearce continued: 'He’s funny, approachable, and warm—those words define him. He’s incredibly nice but also sharp and witty. Put him in a room of business heavyweights, and he’ll hold his own. He’s smart and has a dry sense of humor.' As Donald embarks on his second term, the world will be watching. Maybe this time, Barron’s humor and intellect will step out of the shadows to reveal the man behind the name. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rynl3tcpjx	2025-01-22T20:11:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/S1NGBmCDkl/S1NGBmCDkl_0_0_1024_683_0_small.jpg
Trump designates Yemen's Houthis as a 'foreign terrorist organiza...	White House says Trump directs USAID to end ties to entities assisting the houthis 'while turning a blind eye toward their terrorism and abuses' U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday re-designated Yemen's Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, as a 'foreign terrorist organization', the White House said. The move will impose harsher economic penalties than the Biden administration had applied on the group. The the Iranian poxies were resonsible for 300 missile and drone attacks on Israel, attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and against U.S. warships defending the critical maritime chokepoint, since the Hamas October 7 massacre. Earlier on Wednesday, the group released the crew of the Galaxy Leader commercial ship more than a year after they seized their Bahamas-flagged vessel off the Yemeni coast, after signaling in recent days that they were scaling back attacks in the Red Sea following the multi-phase cease fire deal between Israel and Hamas. 'The Houthis' activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade,' the White House said in a statement. 'The President will direct USAID to end its relationship with entities that have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis's terrorism and abuses,' the White House said. The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, have carried out more than 100 attacks on ships plying the Red Sea since November 2023, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians over the war against Hamas in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers. The attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa for more than a year. The group has targeted the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which are joined by the narrow Bab al-Mandab strait, a chokepoint between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. military sought to intercept Houthi attacks to safeguard commercial traffic and waged periodic strikes to degrade Houthi military capabilities. But it did not target the group's leadership. At the start of his presidential term in 2021, Joe Biden had dropped Trump's terrorist designations to address humanitarian concerns inside Yemen. Confronted with the Red Sea attacks, Biden last year designated the group as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' organization. But his administration held off on applying the harsher FTO designation. British charity Oxfam said the move would worsen the suffering of Yemeni civilians, disrupting vital imports of food, medicine, and fuel. 'The Trump administration is aware of these consequences but chose to move forward anyway, and will bear responsibility for the hunger and disease that will follow,' Oxfam America's director of peace and security, Scott Paul, said in a statement. David Schenker, who was assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the first Trump administration, said Trump's move on Wednesday was an obvious, early step to respond to what he described as one of Iran's leading proxy forces in the Middle East. 'While the redesignation likely won't have a positive impact on the group's behavior, the measure suggests the new administration is not looking to induce (or cajole) the Iranians to negotiations through blandishment,' Schenker told Reuters.

Beit Hanoun Battalion chief Hussein Fayyad filmed Wednesday speaking at a Gaza funeral; IDF announced he was killed in Jabaliya tunnel in May, admits intelligence 'not sufficiently accurate'; terror group calls it blow to Israeli intelligence Israeli military and intelligence agencies are reassessing their previous claim that Hussein Fayyad, commander of Hamas’ Beit Hanoun Battalion, was killed during a May operation in Gaza after he seemed to reappear on Wednesday. Fayyad, presumed dead following an Israeli strike on a tunnel in Jabalyia, appeared at a funeral in northern Gaza, delivering a speech about Gaza’s 'victory' over Israel in the war. His appearance, documented in video footage, has sparked controversy, with both Hamas officials and analysts confirming the footage was taken after the cease-fire. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In a rare admission, the IDF acknowledged errors in its earlier intelligence assessment. 'Following a reevaluation, it appears the intelligence upon which the IDF and Shin Bet relied was not sufficiently accurate,' the statement read. Fayyad’s reemergence caught even Hamas by surprise. A relative of a senior al-Qassam Brigades commander killed in 2009 called Fayyad’s appearance 'an unexpected blow to the enemy’s intelligence.' Gazan analyst Saeed Ziyad referred to Fayyad as a 'leader with seven lives,' highlighting his survival despite multiple Israeli assassination attempts. In May, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari announced Fayyad's supposed death, crediting 98th Division combat units and Air Force special forces for eliminating the commander in a Jabaliya tunnel. Fayyad was accused of directing numerous anti-tank missile operations and mortar fire on Israeli border communities during the war. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyelmy100je	2025-01-22T12:35:06-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/HJxEwEjRDJg/HJxEwEjRDJg_199_219_869_490_0_small.jpg
What’s the next step?': Report exposes Hamas' lack of strategy a...	Turkish outlet reveals Hamas leaders celebrated Oct. 7 attack during meeting in Istanbul, drawing silence and sharp questions from Turkish intelligence; report blasts Hamas over Gaza devastation and handing Netanyahu grounds for massive retaliation Members of Hamas' political bureau met with Turkish intelligence officials on October 7, 2023, the same day Hamas launched a devastating attack on Israel, killing over 1,200 people, Turkish news outlet 10HABER reported on Tuesday. The report includes rare, pointed criticism of Hamas, accusing it of causing catastrophic consequences for Gaza while failing to prepare for the aftermath. 'What victory are you celebrating? You brutally murdered 1,200 Israelis and handed Netanyahu the excuse to kill 46,000 people,' the report read. According to the article, the Hamas delegation arrived at the headquarters of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT) in Istanbul on the morning of October 7. As news of the assault on Israel unfolded, members of the Hamas delegation reportedly shouted 'Allahu Akbar' and celebrated, unaware of the full scale of the massacre. Turkish officials present at the meeting were said to have remained silent as the delegation expressed their elation. Turkish officials question Hamas' strategy The report noted that while Hamas representatives exulted, MIT officials maintained silence. A senior Turkish intelligence officer reportedly asked the Hamas delegates: 'You’ve carried out an extraordinary, unexpected operation. But what’s the next step? Have you thought about that? You’ve gone 1-0 against Israel, but this won’t just end at 1-1. Do you have a second phase or a plan to follow this?' The Hamas delegation, the article claims, did not respond to these questions. The Turkish official persisted: 'Understand that Israel won’t leave the score at 1-1. It won’t end at 2-1, 3-1, or even 4-1. We know Netanyahu and Israel. They’ll take it to 10-1, or even 12-1. Do you have a strategy for what comes next?' The article states that Turkish intelligence officials concluded Hamas’ delegation had no awareness of the massacre’s scope and had not planned for the aftermath. The MIT’s message to Hamas during the meeting was reportedly clear: 'Do not place too much trust in Iran.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The article’s author offered an unflinching critique of Hamas, accusing the organization of causing immense suffering in Gaza. He revealed that he had been aware of the meeting’s details for some time but decided to publish them now. 'I watched for minutes as masked men in Gaza celebrated and raised their hands in victory. I stared in disbelief,' he wrote. 'I kept shouting internally, ‘My friends, what victory is this?’' Addressing Hamas directly, the author added: 'Don’t you see the devastation behind you? What victory is this? Do you never look at the balance sheet? Forty-six thousand people are dead. More than 100,000 are injured, many of whom will live with those injuries—amputated hands and legs—for the rest of their lives. Over a million people have been displaced from their homes. Ninety percent of Gaza’s homes and workplaces are in ruins. Schools and hospitals have been flattened. Electricity is gone. You’ve lost all your regional allies. Your leadership has disappeared. Hezbollah, your closest supporter, is not even on its knees—it’s flat on the ground.' The author continued: 'Israel has entered Lebanon. Tons of bombs fall daily on your allies in Yemen. Assad, the only leader who supported you militarily, has fled. His successors now say, ‘We won’t allow further actions against Israel from Syria.’ Your entire leadership team has been killed. Two, even three future generations have been destroyed. Yet you stand there making victory signs. What kind of victory is this? Can there ever be victory in such a war?' A condemnation of Hamas’ actions on October 7 The writer posed pointed questions about Hamas’ motivations: 'Friends, why did you carry out the bloody attack on October 7? Why did you brutally murder 1,200 people—young and old, men and women, including those enjoying a music festival? Why did you abduct hundreds, causing dozens to die underground? Why did you give a savage like Netanyahu the excuse to mercilessly kill 46,000 people? The war is over now. Let us be clear: the fingers that yesterday pointed at Israel will now point at Hamas.' He continued his condemnation: 'Tell me, did you gain anything from this ruthless campaign? What did you win? Global public opinion? The world didn’t support you; it supported the children, women, elderly, and innocent civilians who died. Don’t think for a moment that those protesting Netanyahu worldwide supported your barbaric attack, in which you killed 1,200 people and took hundreds of hostages. Now the bloodshed has stopped.' The article concluded with a stark warning for Hamas. 'Be sure that the fingers pointing at Netanyahu worldwide will now also turn on you because we now know that if Hamas’ irresponsible military wing doesn’t reform, the Palestinian people will never see happiness. Anyone seeking true peace in Gaza must now deliver the necessary message to these reckless individuals who make victory signs with their two open fingers. Netanyahu is a war criminal. But Hamas, you are not innocent either.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1p2mrcwjx	2025-01-22T12:09:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/HJXAnuAowkl/HJXAnuAowkl_0_145_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Israel expects to receive Friday names of 4 female hostages—1 civilian and 3 military observers—set for release Saturday as part of hostage deal; IDF reports threats to troops in Gaza, leading to elimination of Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist Israel is gearing up for the second phase of the first stage of the hostage exchange deal, with Hamas expected to deliver the names of four female hostages—one civilian and three military lookouts—on Friday. The exchange is set to occur Saturday afternoon, with the hostages transferred to the Red Cross and then to Israeli forces. Israel anticipates the release of civilian Arbel Yehoud as part of this stage. Hamas is also expected to provide a full list by Saturday detailing which of the 33 hostages are alive or deceased. Israeli estimates suggest at least 25 are alive. Following the release of three hostages earlier this week and four more anticipated Saturday, the remaining number of hostages is believed to be 18. The Israeli military reported continued activity against threats in Gaza despite the ongoing cease-fire. In the past 24 hours, IDF forces identified and neutralized armed suspects in southern Gaza, including Akram Ataf Farhan Zanon, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative. Masked suspects were also observed approaching Israeli positions, prompting warning shots. 'The IDF remains committed to the cease-fire agreement to secure the release of hostages while ensuring its readiness to counter immediate threats,' the military stated. Israel is preparing for the second stage of negotiations, officially set to begin on February 4 but already underway behind the scenes. Senior intelligence officials, including Mossad Director David Barnea and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, recently held discussions in Cairo with Egyptian counterparts. Topics included cease-fire mechanisms, security on the Philadelphi Corridor, and the management of the Rafah crossing. COGAT Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian also visited Egypt to discuss implementation details.

Reports suggest Witkoff played a critical role in convincing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to the initial deal. Witkoff said he would participate in monitoring efforts along the Gaza Strip and expressed optimism about advancing regional normalization efforts. Israel and Egypt are negotiating the reopening of the Rafah crossing, scheduled to resume operations 14 days after the third phase of hostage releases. Plans call for 12 non-Hamas Palestinian workers vetted by the Shin Bet to manage the crossing, with oversight from the international EUBAM mission. Movement through the crossing will be limited to individuals, with hundreds of Gazans allowed to seek medical treatment in Egypt under pre-approved lists. Netanyahu’s office emphasized stringent security measures, saying, 'No one will cross without prior approval and supervision by the IDF and Shin Bet.' Palestinian Authority involvement will be minimal, limited to stamping passports under international agreements. This arrangement will be reassessed after the first stage of the plan. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1j8rr0p1g	2025-01-22T11:42:22-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/SyapeARwJg/SyapeARwJg_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Shin Bet security blunders under the microscope after Tel Aviv te...	Moroccan-born US Green Card holder enters Israel despite being flagged at airport, only to carry out stabbing spree days later; incident exposes gaps in security protocols, prompting investigations into Shin Bet and border control failures Less than a day after the stabbing attack in Tel Aviv, new details have emerged about how the attacker, a 29-year-old Moroccan citizen with a U.S. Green Card, managed to enter Israel. These revelations raise serious concerns about what appears to be a major security lapse. Despite being flagged and initially denied entry by a border control officer at Ben Gurion Airport, the attacker was ultimately approved by Shin Bet after undergoing questioning and a security screening at the Israeli consulate in New York. The attacker, Kaddi Abdelaziz, carried out a stabbing spree in Tel Aviv's bustling Nahalat Binyamin area, crowded with nightlife-goers as usual. Five people were injured in the attack—one seriously, one moderately and three lightly. The attacker was neutralized by soldiers from the elite Sayeret Matkal unit, who responded to the screams of one of the victims, an American tourist. Surveillance footage captured Abdelaziz buying pizza on Allenby Street just moments before launching his attack, three days after arriving in Israel on January 18. Haim, owner of the pizzeria, recounted his encounter with the attacker: 'He bought two slices for himself, grabbed a drink, and left. Then he returned to bring back the plate—which Israelis never do—and was very polite. He said, 'Thanks,' and walked off. When he ordered the pizza, he spoke English with an Arabic accent. He had an Arab appearance but spoke English. My employee and I thought he seemed strange. This was at 8:30 PM, and just a few minutes later, the attack happened. When I heard the screams, I didn’t connect it at first. Later that night, I saw his picture on the news. It was exactly what he had been wearing—and how he looked. I was in shock. I immediately called my employee, and neither of us could believe it.' It soon became clear that a series of missteps had allowed him to enter the country. Upon his arrival in Israel on a connecting flight from Poland, a border control officer at Ben Gurion Airport grew suspicious and refused to approve his entry. Her concerns were based on his inability to provide a convincing answer about where he intended to stay during his visit and the fact that he was carrying little money. A police officer on the scene also noted his 'tense body language' as suspicious. The attacker was referred to Shin Bet for further questioning, but after their interrogation, they determined there were no security grounds to deny him entry. Shin Bet has since announced that the incident will be thoroughly investigated. 'Upon his entry into Israel, a security evaluation was conducted, including both questioning and additional checks, and it was determined there was no basis to deny his entry on security grounds. This case will be reviewed,' Shin Bet said. However, warning signs may have been apparent even earlier. Before flying to Israel, the attacker had visited the Israeli consulate in New York with his Moroccan passport to apply for a tourist visa. He made several visits to the consulate and was asked to provide various documents. According to sources familiar with the visa process, the purpose of the consular review was to ensure that he did not intend to settle in Israel illegally. At the request of the consulate, he provided documentation proving he was a successful Uber driver with a five-star rating and nearly 3,000 completed rides. He also showed bank statements reflecting a balance of over $10,000, demonstrating financial stability. Additionally, his possession of a U.S. Green Card suggested he intended to return to the United States to continue his naturalization process. As a Moroccan citizen, his visa application was forwarded to Shin Bet for review, following standard protocol. Shin Bet approved the application within two days—a notably quick response. Based on this approval, the consulate issued his visa. Sources familiar with the process maintain that there were no irregularities in the consulate’s handling of the case or in the conduct of the Foreign Ministry. Nevertheless, key questions remain unanswered—chief among them, whether anyone had reviewed his Facebook profile. A cursory glance at the page, which was deleted immediately after the attack and his identification, would have revealed posts that were overtly anti-Israel and supportive of Gaza. In the posts, the attacker accused Israel of 'starving northern Gaza' and claimed that 'half a million Gazans face death by starvation.' He shared a video praising Islam with the caption 'Free Palestine' and an image of Ibrahim al-Nabulsi, a terrorist killed in Nablus in 2022. Following the October 7 massacre, he posted, 'What is happening now may double the number of martyrs for Islam.' Security officials involved in the visa process argue that reviewing his Facebook page falls squarely under Shin Bet’s purview. Consular officials, they claim, are neither authorized nor trained to evaluate security threats or incitement on social media. 'The consulate has no authority over security matters. Their role is to assess whether the individual has a stable economic life to return to and does not intend to settle illegally. Security checks are the responsibility of Shin Bet,' said one official. Kaddi Abdelaziz lived in Brooklyn, and his U.S. ID indicated he was born in Morocco. In a Facebook post from September 14, 2022, he uploaded a photo of himself flying from New York, captioning it, 'Alhamdulillah.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Another pressing question is why, despite the suspicions raised by the border control officer, the Shin Bet ultimately allowed his entry after the interrogation at Ben Gurion Airport. It is important to clarify that this was not a case of the Shin Bet overriding a border control decision to deny entry. Shin Bet is not authorized to approve entry—it can only recommend denial based on security concerns. In this instance, the border control officer flagged the individual for further review, and Shin Bet conducted its checks, concluding there were no grounds to deny his entry. The incident is now under investigation. Preventing entry to Israel requires concrete evidence or clear indications of malicious intent, neither of which were apparent in this case. A senior security official highlighted the challenges of screening the large number of foreign arrivals to Israel: 'Tens of thousands enter Israel each week, over a million annually. Of these, tens of thousands undergo detailed Shin Bet screenings, and hundreds are denied entry each year. Wartime protocols have tightened screenings significantly, leading to a rise in denials. These decisions often lead to legal appeals, and in rare cases, the decisions are overturned.' Former senior Shin Bet official Dvir Kariv acknowledged the agency’s limitations: 'Shin Bet is not infallible—it learns and investigates thoroughly, but mistakes do happen. While it prevents the majority of threats, it is not a machine with a 100% success rate.' Speaking about the interrogation at Ben Gurion Airport, he added, 'I’ve conducted hundreds, maybe thousands, of interrogations in my career. Only three times did I recommend denial based on a gut feeling that I was dealing with someone problematic. It’s possible the officer here simply misjudged this time.' Adv. Tomer Warsha, head of the Immigration Committee of the Israel Bar Association, criticized the handling of the case. 'This serious incident raises heavy questions about the performance of both border control and the Foreign Ministry. Despite clear signs of suspicion, the attacker was allowed entry with a Moroccan passport and a pre-issued visa. This was a case where denial should have been unequivocal, based on existing protocols,' he said. Shin Bet reiterated: 'Upon his entry into Israel, a security evaluation was conducted, including questioning and additional checks. It was determined there was no security basis to deny his entry. The case will be thoroughly investigated.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkv8nncvye	2025-01-22T11:12:37-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/SJAkfcTv1l/SJAkfcTv1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Jewish Americans, Israelis hope Trump will deliver peace to Israe...	Hebrew could be heard at several watch events and on the streets of Washington, DC; 'We need someone in power who can speak the language that terrorists understand' America, Israel and the Jewish people are 'back together again,' declared Josh Reinstein, president of the Israeli Allies Foundation. For Christians and Jews who have long prayed for the peace of Jerusalem, Reinstein says the moment has arrived to witness those prayers taking shape. Reinstein, who traveled from Mevaseret Zion near Jerusalem with his wife to attend President Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, radiated excitement on Monday as Trump was sworn in. Despite the bitter cold that numbed every exposed extremity of the tens of thousands gathered in Washington, DC—including visitors from sunny Israel—the atmosphere was electric. The chill in the air was no match for the warmth of hope and celebration. Tears of joy flowed freely, cheers erupted and elaborate watch parties buzzed with energy. At these gatherings, supporters praised Trump’s leadership and shared high hopes for a brighter future—not just for America but for Israel and the world. 'We always talk about how the best is yet to come for faith-based diplomacy and how it’s growing worldwide. But if you look at the cabinet coming in with the Trump administration, it’s the who’s who of faith-based diplomacy,' Reinstein told The Media Line. Reinstein highlighted prominent appointees, including Rev. Mike Huckabee, who is slated to become the U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee, who has publicly stated that the Palestinians had their chance at a state in Gaza and failed, advocates for Israel annexing Judea and Samaria. Another key figure that Reinstein noted is Peter Hegseth, the incoming U.S. secretary of defense. A committed Bible-believing Christian, Hegseth has unapologetically supported Israel’s military actions in Gaza. Other notable appointments include Marco Rubio, who was sworn in on Monday as secretary of state, and Elise Stefanik, who was widely recognized for her fight against antisemitism on college campuses. Stefanik was named the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on Tuesday. 'These are people who have been in our network for two decades, and now they are becoming the government of America,' Reinstein said. He and his team have already crafted an agenda for the new administration, though he was not ready to share the details. However, he hinted at initiatives Trump began implementing on Monday night, such as sanctioning the International Criminal Court and defunding UNRWA—again. 'We see this as the beginning of four years of incredible success and security, not just for the Middle East, but for the world,' Reinstein added. 'We’re excited to see all the different things that will happen.' Surprisingly, Hebrew could be heard at several watch events and on the streets of Washington, DC. Nicole Levine, from Herzliya, was dressed to the nines and smiling from ear to ear. 'We are extremely happy and relieved, especially with the situation in the Middle East now that the current administration is gone,' she told The Media Line. 'We need Trump. We need someone in power who can speak the language that terrorists understand.' Levine expressed that under the Biden administration, Israelis felt unable to sleep peacefully, constantly plagued by anxiety. She recalled how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a calculated risk in supporting Trump’s candidacy, both behind the scenes and publicly. Now, with the House, Senate and White House controlled by Republicans, she said, 'it cannot be a better time.' Several members of the Knesset, including MKs Ohad Tal and Simcha Rothman of the Religious Zionist Party, also came to Washington to meet with U.S. legislators, hoping to establish strong connections as the new administration took hold. Both Israeli leaders, outspoken critics of the recent hostage-for-ceasefire deal Trump pushed and celebrated during his inauguration, nonetheless expressed their support for the U.S. president. They were optimistic that Trump would help advance their Zionist agendas. Tal, who attended a Prayer Breakfast at Mar-a-Lago days before the inauguration, said he had voiced his opposition to the hostage deal during the event. However, after hearing insights from high-level Washington insiders, he suggested there might be more to Trump’s decision than meets the eye. 'We’re trying to be very optimistic, and we’re hoping to see more steps from this administration [against Hamas],' Tal told The Media Line. He emphasized Trump’s understanding of the critical distinctions between good and evil, particularly regarding Iran. 'In Tehran, they’re chanting every single day, ‘Death to Israel, death to America,’' Tal said. 'I think America and Israel will stand together in this struggle against Iran.' Shortly after Trump announced during his inauguration speech that he desired to be remembered as a peacemaker and unifier, Tal commented that the statement led to speculation that the president might reconsider a U.S.-led strike on Iran. 'We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end,' Trump said. 'And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.' Eliza Laganas, who recently moved to Florida from New York and describes herself as a 'political refugee,' told The Media Line: 'Donald Trump fought for our country and fought for us so we could take back our country. And as a Jew, it’s even more important because Trump’s protection and love for Israel and the Jewish people are the greatest gift that we could have right now.' Laganas asserted that the events of October 7 would never have occurred if Trump had been in office. She added confidently, 'The next four years, it’ll never happen again.' Her daughter, Jaymes Laganas, echoed her mother’s sentiments, explaining that she also voted for Trump to restore American conservative values. 'I couldn’t ask for a better president to protect women’s rights,' Jaymes Laganas said. 'I think that [Trump] is definitely a president that will protect us as women, keep men out of women’s sports, [and] keep men out of women’s bathrooms.' On Monday night, Trump signed 78 executive orders, swiftly undoing several policies from the Biden administration. These actions underscored his administration’s unwavering support for Israel. Among the orders, Trump revoked sanctions on Israelis living in Judea and Samaria, reinforcing U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the region. He reimposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court, paused U.S. foreign aid programs—such as those benefiting UNRWA, accused of ties to Hamas—for a 90-day review to ensure alignment with his administration’s policies, and authorized the deportation of visa holders involved in pro-Hamas protests, riots, fundraising, or other activities promoting hateful ideologies on U.S. campuses. These measures sent a clear signal: Trump’s administration intends to prioritize Israel’s security and strengthen its standing on the global stage. 'We’re going to see what we can do to make Israel secure, safe and prosperous together with America,' Reinstein concluded. 'Everyone knows that America and Israel are back together.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syor3pav1e	2025-01-22T11:04:56-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/SyAIhYhD1x/SyAIhYhD1x_0_58_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
If only it had come sooner': Aid trucks flood Gaza amid cease-fi...	UN reports hundreds of aid trucks entering Gaza daily since cease-fire began, with 897 trucks crossing into enclave on Tuesday alone The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs confirmed that 897 aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, marking the third day of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Humanitarian aid began flowing into Gaza on Sunday, immediately after the cease-fire took effect at 11:15 a.m. That day, 630 trucks entered the Palestinian enclave. The number increased to 925 on Monday and reached 897 on Tuesday. The UN reported these figures based on information from Israeli authorities, Arab nations involved in brokering the cease-fire—Egypt and Qatar—and the United States. Under the cease-fire agreement, Israel is obligated to facilitate increased aid deliveries to Gaza, allowing up to 600 trucks daily during the first six weeks of the truce. Among the daily shipments are 50 trucks carrying fuel. Additionally, half of the aid trucks are designated for Gaza's northern region, the focal point of intense Israeli operations in recent months. Data from the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) showed that in December, 2,892 aid trucks entered Gaza. Much of the aid remains on the Gazan side of the border with Israel, awaiting distribution by UN agencies.

Israel negotiates Rafah crossing control to advance hostage deal,...	IDF liaison to Palestinians meets with Egyptian officials in Cairo to advance Gaza truce, focusing on reopening Rafah crossing under international oversight, while Israel continues security checks on aid trucks Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, met with Egyptian officials in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss the implementation of the next stage of the hostage deal and the Gaza cease-fire. Topics included continued humanitarian aid deliveries and the future reopening of the Rafah crossing, as stipulated in the framework agreement. Israel has agreed to allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks daily into Gaza under international oversight and to facilitate Rafah’s reopening as part of efforts to extend the deal and secure further hostage releases. The Defense Ministry emphasized that every truck entering Gaza undergoes Israeli security checks. Regarding Rafah’s reopening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that Palestinians crossing through the terminal in the future would require security clearance from the IDF and Shin Bet. 'The crossing will be managed by Gazans unaffiliated with Hamas, vetted by Shin Bet, with oversight from the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM),' the statement added. Netanyahu and his Cabinet have ruled out official Palestinian Authority (PA) involvement at Rafah. Israeli security officials have been tasked with identifying Gazan administrators unaffiliated with both Hamas and the PA to manage the crossing alongside the international mission. The crossing, previously controlled by Hamas, was destroyed by the IDF during operations in Rafah at the start of the war. Israel has firmly rejected any Hamas or Hamas-linked presence on the Gazan side of the crossing. According to the Saudi daily Asharq Al-Awsat, Israeli intelligence chiefs Mossad Director David Barnea and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar held extended talks in Cairo this week with Egyptian counterparts, including intelligence chief Hassan Rashad. The discussions reportedly focused on the management of Rafah and security along the Philadelphi Corridor, which stretches along the Gaza-Egypt border. A source from the joint cease-fire monitoring committee told the newspaper that 'an agreement has been reached for the PA to manage the Palestinian side of Rafah, with international oversight by the UN.' However, no timeline for reopening the crossing has been finalized, and disagreements remain over security arrangements for the Philadelphi Corridor.

The Egyptian delegation included senior intelligence officials overseeing Palestinian affairs. 'The remaining issues are technical and logistical, and they will be resolved,' the source said. Rafah has been a key conduit for aid into Gaza but has been closed since its capture by Israeli forces earlier in the war. Meanwhile, the team of U.S. President Donald Trump, now in his second term, is accelerating talks to solidify the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, is expected to arrive in Israel in the coming days to advance discussions on the matter. Reports suggest Witkoff was instrumental in convincing Prime Minister Netanyahu to approve the initial hostage deal. The envoy said he would be part of what he described as an inspection team deployed in and along the Gaza Strip to ensure cease-fire compliance. In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff also said he believed all countries in the region could get 'on board' to normalize ties with Israel. Asked to identify specific countries, he singled out Qatar, saying the Gulf country was a critical player in reaching the Gaza cease-fire deal. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk8s2napje	2025-01-22T09:59:14-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/19/Hkgk7FFvVT/Hkgk7FFvVT_0_36_1564_881_0_small.jpg

IDF soldier symbolically invites fallen friend who saved his life...	Harel Saidov, severely injured in Khan Younis building collapse last March, rescued by Eliya Hilel, who noticed he was still breathing; Hilel killed in West Bank ramming attack 2 months later; ahead of his wedding, Saidov places invitation on his grave When Harel Saidov lay beneath the rubble of a building in Khan Younis, bleeding and covered in broken concrete and dust, everyone thought he was dead. The helicopter, loaded with wounded soldiers, was preparing to take off when his teammate, Eliya Hilel, noticed his faint breathing and shouted, 'He’s alive!' Doctors doubted Saidov would survive, but he defied the odds and returned to life. On Thursday, as Saidov stands under the wedding chuppah, guests will notice an inscription on the pristine fabric: 'In memory of Eliya Hilel, may God avenge his blood, Iyar 22, 5784.' On May 29, 2024, three months after saving Saidov’s life and sustaining injuries himself, Staff Sergeant Eliya Hilel was killed in a ramming attack in the West Bank. He had been planning to propose to his girlfriend, Hadas, and had even purchased a custom engagement ring, but he never got the chance. Before Hilel’s funeral, his mother gave the ring to Hadas. Two days after his death, one of Hadas’ friends received a marriage proposal. 'It was painful for her that Hadas never got to experience that moment,' says Hilel's mother, Hannah. 'She approached me and said, ‘I want to get married under a canopy in Eliya's memory.’ We raised the funds and designed the canopy together. I was there at the wedding, and it was incredibly moving.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: 'Then, that same friend suggested offering the canopy to other couples who wanted to get married in Eliya’s honor,' Hannah continues. 'We posted about it on Facebook, and, thank God, our schedule is now full through April. Weddings are happening all over the country. Our pain is eternal, but there’s comfort in knowing that even though Eliya never had the chance to stand under a canopy, he is now a source of shelter for couples starting their lives together in Israel.' Wedding invitations at the gravesites It seemed almost inevitable that on the day of Harel Saidov’s wedding to his fiancée, Idan Rafaeli, the ceremony would take place beneath the canopy created in Hilel’s memory. Hilel’s parents, Dror and Hannah, will be honored guests. But Saidov didn’t stop there. This week, Saidov’s mother, also named Hannah, placed wedding invitations on Hilel’s grave at Mount Herzl Military Cemetery. 'We left invitations on the graves of all my friends who fell in the war—three at Mount Herzl, one in Rehovot, and one in Shlomi,' Saidov shares. 'Since I’m a cohen and not allowed to enter cemeteries, my parents took care of it.' During the same incident in which Saidov was wounded, three of his teammates were killed: Sergeant Dolev Malca, Sergeant Afik Tery and Sergeant Inon Itzhak. In his wedding speech, Saidov plans to say, 'Just as we break a glass under the canopy to remember the destruction of the Temple during the happiest moment of our lives, so too, I will remember my friends who made this moment possible.' As he recites their names, Hilel’s will be among them. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hynt3crwjl	2025-01-22T08:56:30-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/yk14232001/yk14232001_0_116_472_266_0_small.jpg

Palestinian media released on Wednesday footage showing Hamas commander Hussein Fayyad attending a funeral in northern Gaza, raising questions about an IDF claim that he had been killed in May during a strike in Jabaliya. In May, the military announced that Fayyad, the commander of Hamas’ Beit Hanoun Battalion, had been eliminated. The IDF said that Fayyad was responsible for planning and executing multiple anti-tank missile operations targeting Israeli territory during the war, as well as for mortar fire directed at Israeli communities in Gaza's northern border region. The release of the footage has prompted speculation about whether Fayyad survived the strike or if reports of his death were inaccurate.

Settlers say police officer fired wantonly in West Bank clashes	One of four settlers injured in shooting accuses police officer of 'firing in all directions' during clash; his lawyer criticizes officer’s release to house arrest as 'troubling' A settler injured during violent clashes in the West Bank accused a police officer of reckless behavior after opening fire on a group of settlers during confrontations in the villages of Funduq and Jinsafut. The settler, one of four injured in the incident—two critically—spoke out Wednesday, describing the chaotic scene. 'There were about 40 of us. Suddenly, we started getting shot at from all directions,' he said. 'Then we realized it was a police officer, firing in all directions like he’d lost control of his weapon.' The settler, who suffered a gunshot wound to the jaw, added, 'Miraculously—thank God—I’m still here. I’m scheduled for surgery to remove the bullet. Thankfully, it didn’t hit any arteries.' The shooting occurred after settlers clashed with Palestinians in what became a flashpoint since a shooting attack there earlier this month that killed three Israelis: police officer Elad Winkelstein, 35, and civilians Rachel Cohen, 70, and Aliza Reiss, 73. Reports suggest the officer, who was reportedly pepper-sprayed during the confrontation, opened fire as tensions escalated. The officer has since been questioned by the Department for Internal Police Investigations and released on house arrest under restrictive conditions. The investigation is ongoing, but concerns about a potential cover-up are already being raised. Attorneys Nati Rom and Haim Bleicher, representing the wounded settlers, have demanded access to the officer’s body camera footage and police communication recordings. They are also calling for the officer’s arrest until the investigation is complete. 'It’s troubling that the officer was only placed on house arrest,' Adv. Rom said. 'We hope there won’t be any attempts to cover this up, as has happened before. This is a grave incident that demands an immediate and serious investigation.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Police confirmed Tuesday night that no arrests have been made in connection to the incident, revealing that both a police officer and a soldier were involved. Military Police have joined the investigation, and the officer is now under scrutiny for alleged unlawful discharge of a firearm. The officer has been placed on house arrest until Friday, barred from entering police facilities for eight days, and prohibited from contacting others involved in the incident. Witnesses reported a heated argument between the officer and settlers before the shooting. Accounts from the scene suggest the officer and soldier appeared shaken after the incident, with reports that the soldier also fired his weapon. Questions persist regarding the officer’s claim that shots were intended to create distance, as the victims sustained injuries to their upper bodies. Defense Minister Israel Katz addressed the incident at a meeting of Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, saying, 'I strongly condemn any violence or attacks against Palestinians, and I deeply regret the tragedy that resulted in injuries.' He called for accountability, emphasizing, 'Those who break the law must face criminal proceedings, not administrative orders. Settlers must be subject to the same laws as anyone else in Israel.' Katz also urged settler leaders to condemn violence in the region, amid rising tensions following clashes in nearby Palestinian villages. Investigations into both the shooting and the broader unrest are ongoing. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjz00qfavkx	2025-01-22T08:18:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/S1ZOYEnDkl/S1ZOYEnDkl_0_415_961_541_0_small.jpg
Clock ticks down on IDF's Lebanon pullout, but job remains unfini...	IDF plans to withdraw from Lebanon next week, 60 days after cease-fire began, but delays likely; terror infrastructure remains widespread, and Lebanese army struggles to meet IDF demands; Israel requests 'additional time' to complete objectives Thousands of IDF soldiers are stationed along the Lebanon border, from Rosh Hanikra to Mount Dov, and within the Shiite villages of southern Lebanon. They are working tirelessly, day and night, to uncover and destroy weapons and extensive terrorist infrastructure left near Israel's northern frontier. These soldiers are on high alert, awaiting instructions from Israel’s political leadership regarding the continuation of operations in southern Lebanon next week. On Sunday, under a cease-fire agreement, all Israeli forces are expected to withdraw, leaving Lebanon. At that point, Israel will have to rely on promises from the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) to remove Hezbollah and to dismantle the 'hell zones' where IDF forces have operated for months to thwart Hezbollah's stated plans to seize the Galilee. However, the work in Lebanon is far from over. Even today, IDF troops uncovered and confiscated a large cache of weapons during operations conducted by the 810th Brigade’s Combat Team, under the command of the 210th Division. The forces recently raided the complex terrain of Lebanon's Mount Dov area. The IDF has requested additional time from Israel’s political leadership to address the seemingly endless terrorist infrastructure hidden in numerous villages and areas that Israeli forces have not yet reached. Tomorrow, Israel’s Security Cabinet is expected to discuss the extension of IDF operations in southern Lebanon and the implementation of the cease-fire agreement. Political considerations and US influence Israel's political leadership is also awaiting signals from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump regarding expectations for Israeli actions in Lebanon starting next week. In recent weeks, the IDF has intensified efforts to destroy terrorist infrastructure and confiscate thousands of weapons, including rockets, anti-tank missiles, explosives and firearms, from villages that were cleared and ostensibly secured. For instance, IDF forces withdrew from the village of Naqoura, adjacent to UNIFIL’s main headquarters, earlier this month. There, Israeli troops uncovered a fully operational attack outpost system constructed by Hezbollah right under UNIFIL's watch. Similar operations were completed in central Lebanon, in areas such as Tayr Harfa and Yaroun. Now, IDF activities are concentrated in the eastern sector. The process of withdrawing IDF troops and handing control over to the Lebanese Armed Forces has proven to be complex and prolonged, defying the expectations of the United Nations and the United States. It seems likely that Israel will be granted an extension to complete its efforts to 'cleanse' the region of terrorist infrastructure. The IDF has refrained from setting a definitive timeline for completing its mission, emphasizing the need to ensure the security of Israel’s northern residents. However, military officials estimate that approximately 30 additional days will be required. Despite recent claims by UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces of 'achievements' in destroying Hezbollah's weapons, they have struggled to fully address the IDF's demands to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. Sunday marks the expiration of the 60-day deadline set in the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah. Under the agreement, only Lebanese security forces are permitted to operate south of the Litani River, and they are obligated to dismantle all Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure in the area. According to the Alma Research and Education Center, which studies security challenges in northern Israel, the agreement's real test will be the LAF's ability to operate south of the Litani, where the IDF did not maneuver and significant terrorist infrastructure remains intact. Alma President Lt. Col. (res.) Sarit Zehavi said, 'The coming days will test whether Lebanon has truly changed. Although a president and prime minister were recently appointed without Hezbollah’s direct endorsement, the presence of Hezbollah in the government would make meaningful change unlikely.' Zehavi also noted that while Joseph Aoun’s election as president marks an improvement for Lebanon, it is unlikely to affect Hezbollah’s military operations. 'As LAF commander since 2017, he has not curbed Hezbollah’s actions. During that time, Hezbollah expanded its military capabilities and acted freely in southern Lebanon while the LAF did nothing.' Despite Hezbollah’s current challenges in rearming, particularly due to disrupted smuggling routes from Syria, Zehavi remains critical of the ceasefire agreement, arguing that it demands an Israeli withdrawal before the full implementation of UN Resolution 1701. She emphasized the lack of a clear deadline for removing Hezbollah from south of the Litani River. 'The global context offers some opportunities, as the Shiite axis is weakened, and there is an international push for transparency and adherence to agreements. However, the burden remains on the IDF to ensure that Hezbollah cannot rebuild,' Zehavi said. Local leaders in northern Israel echo her concerns, demanding that the IDF maintain its presence in southern Lebanon for at least another year to establish a 'security zone.' Moshe Davidovich, head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council and chairman of the Frontline Forum, stated, 'The residents of the north have lost faith in the security system. The IDF must stay in key positions, and every violation must be met with force. We cannot trust anyone but the IDF.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: David Azoulay, head of the Metula Local Council, expressed deep concern over the security situation as the deadline approaches. 'No one is speaking with us. The army declared victory, but no one can tell me what happens next or how security will be ensured.' Tensions in Lebanon Lebanese media outlets have extensively covered the impending deadline, with reports suggesting that the IDF continues operations in southern Lebanon, including house demolitions and drone strikes. For instance, Al-Akhbar, a Hezbollah-affiliated publication, reported an Israeli drone strike in Wadi Khansa in southern Lebanon this morning. Meanwhile, Hezbollah-aligned networks have been sharing images of IDF vehicles in Lebanese border villages. The LAF has reportedly encountered Israeli forces in areas such as Tallousa, where the presence of IDF tanks delayed their entry. Despite the challenges, Lebanese leaders, including newly elected President Joseph Aoun, insist that Israel must adhere to the withdrawal timeline outlined in the ceasefire agreement. Hezbollah has also issued warnings. Galeb Abu Zeinab, a member of Hezbollah’s political council, threatened, 'If Israel does not fully withdraw from all Lebanese territories by Sunday, Monday will be a different day.' Hezbollah Secretary-General Naeem Qassem added, 'Our patience is not unlimited. Israel should not test it.' The situation remains tense, with residents of southern Lebanon preparing to return to their villages, some vowing to do so forcefully if Israel does not withdraw. As the deadline looms, uncertainty persists and the region remains on edge. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjafjfcpkg	2025-01-22T07:20:07-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/S1AdjcrAD1x/S1AdjcrAD1x_0_136_1601_901_0_small.jpg
Iraq approves law amendment amid outcry over potential child marr...	Parliament approves amendment allowing marriage laws to be governed by Islamic frameworks, sparking fears of child marriages as young as nine Iraq's parliament announced Tuesday the passage of an amendment to the Personal Status Law, triggering a wave of criticism over fears it could facilitate child marriages. While the amendment maintains the legal marriage age at 18—or 15 with judicial approval—it grants Iraqis the choice between civil or religious frameworks, including Shiite and Sunni laws, for managing family matters such as marriage. Critics argue that this shift risks undermining safeguards, potentially enabling unregistered marriages and child unions under certain interpretations of Shiite Islamic law. Some lawmakers present at the vote alleged procedural flaws and vowed to appeal. 'This decision threatens women’s rights and violates international principles of equality,' independent lawmaker Mohammed Abd al-Amir Anouz told AFP, warning the law could sidestep existing protections for women and girls. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Human rights organizations have condemned the amendment. Human Rights Watch stated in August that it could 'have disastrous effects on women’s and girls’ rights, allowing marriages for girls as young as 9,' and criticized the amendment as a significant setback for equality under Iraqi law. Amnesty International echoed the warning in October, cautioning that unregistered child marriages could leave women and girls without protections in cases of divorce or inheritance. The backlash extended to social media, where users decried the law. One widely shared post featuring a blindfolded girl read, 'Approving the Personal Status Law legitimizes injustice.' Another post condemned the amendment for 'placing marriage agreements in the hands of clerics without any rights for women.' Supporters of the law argue that it ensures freedom of belief by allowing Iraqis to choose their preferred legal framework. However, critics remain alarmed over its potential implications, with some viewing the amendment as a 'devastating step backward' for the rights of Iraqi women and girls. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/symkdwaw1l	2025-01-22T06:33:52-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/rJeO00cUAv1l/rJeO00cUAv1l_0_60_735_414_0_small.jpg

Katz to begin selection process for next IDF chief of staff	After Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi announced his retirement, defense minister will begin interviewing candidates Sunday for next IDF chief; Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Maj. Gen. (res.) Tamir Yadai shortlisted Defense Minister Israel Katz announced Wednesday that he will begin the selection process for the next IDF chief of staff following Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi’s decision to retire. Starting Sunday, Katz will interview candidates for the position, including Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir and Maj. Gen. Tamir Yadai. 'I intend to conduct an orderly and swift process to allow the incoming chief of staff to prepare for the numerous security challenges Israel faces at this time,' Katz said. He emphasized his goal of choosing the most suitable candidate to lead the IDF during a challenging period, citing David Ben-Gurion’s famous statement that every Israeli mother should know her sons are in the hands of capable commanders. Zamir is widely considered a leading candidate due to his extensive experience, professionalism and firm stance against downsizing the IDF. A close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Zamir has gained support for his leadership during wartime and his handling of arms procurements from the United States during the war. These efforts included acquiring fighter jets, munitions and boosting domestic defense production. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Zamir served in the IDF for 38 years, holding numerous senior combat and command roles. As deputy chief of staff from 2018 to 2021 under Aviv Kochavi, he oversaw the multiyear 'Momentum' plan and led military assistance to civilians during the COVID-19 pandemic and May 2021's Operation Guardian of the Walls. Despite being considered for the chief of staff position in 2018, Zamir lost to Halevi, partially due to limited General Staff experience at the time. Deputy Chief of Staff Amir Baram is also vying for the position. Known for his operational expertise, Baram served as Northern Command chief and grew within the Paratroopers Brigade alongside Halevi, though they have represented different General Staff factions. Despite his involvement during the October 7 Hamas attack, Baram has distanced himself from its failures, earning respect for his support of Halevi during the war’s aftermath. Maj. Gen. Tamir Yadai, another candidate, brings significant field and operational experience but faces stiff competition from Zamir and Baram. The new Chief of Staff will inherit an IDF recovering from the unprecedented challenges of the October 7 Hamas assault and preparing for evolving threats in Gaza, Lebanon, and the West Bank. As the decision looms, Katz is under pressure to select a leader who can restore public confidence and strengthen the military during a critical period. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ry00wntapje	2025-01-22T06:02:51-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/HyDWWF0Pke/HyDWWF0Pke_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Younes Amital, a 38-year-old resident of the Bedouin village of Bir Hadaj, has been indicted for transporting a package using a drone into the Gaza Strip. According to the indictment, at the beginning of the month, Amital arrived with two other people at the border fence with the Gaza Strip. The three flew a drone over the border fence into Gaza territory, and attached a package to it. IDF forces later arrived at the scene and began chasing the three, who tried to escape. During the chase, the defendant's vehicle collided with the military vehicle, and the two other suspects fled the scene.

Abraham Shield Plan is roadmap for meeting the regional dynamics ...	A comprehensive strategy proposed by Israel’s Coalition for Regional Security aims to stabilize the Middle East through Saudi normalization, Palestinian separation and a united front against Iran As Israel’s war in Gaza appears to be reaching an end, Israeli thinkers are hard at work developing a strategy to meet the new regional dynamics that have resulted from the war. Marking his inauguration the day after the first release of Israeli hostages as part of the current cease-fire-hostage deal, the Coalition for Regional Security sent U.S. President Donald Trump its Abraham Shield Plan. This comprehensive strategy outlines a bold roadmap to stabilize the Middle East, neutralize regional threats, and secure lasting peace and prosperity for Israel and the region. The plan seeks to capitalize on the momentum generated by Israel’s military achievements and the unfolding hostage and cease-fire deal to reshape the region’s security framework, foster economic integration and establish a durable alliance between Israel and moderate Arab states. According to the coalition, this initiative is pivotal to uniting Israel with moderate Arab nations, forging an 'iron shield' against Iran and its proxies, and charting a new regional order that prioritizes stability and collaboration. The Coalition for Regional Security has urged bold U.S. leadership to ensure the success of the Abraham Shield Plan, highlighting the stakes of normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia while advancing a separation framework with the Palestinians. Brig. Gen. (res.) Udi Dekel, a founding partner of the coalition, described the plan as an opportunity to transform the Middle East. 'President Trump’s leadership is essential to realizing this vision and seizing this historic moment,' Dekel said. Polling data underscores strong public backing in Israel, with 72.5% of respondents supporting a U.S.-led initiative under Trump’s leadership to achieve hostage returns, Saudi normalization, and the formation of a regional coalition to counter Iran. Coalition’s vision for postwar stability The Coalition for Regional Security, established one year into the war, aims to chart a new path in the Middle East, rooted in the belief that Israel’s military successes must be translated into a comprehensive strategy for the 'day after' the conflict. The initiative, formed by five prominent Israeli figures – Dekel, Lianne Pollak-David, Koby Huberman, Moty Cristal, and Attila Somfalvi – focuses primarily on Israeli security, regional order and economic opportunities, with the goal of ensuring stability and long-term peace for the region. 'Our goal is to translate the unbelievable military achievements that Israel was able to obtain throughout this war into a future that provides a new regional order,' according to Pollak-David, one of the founders of the coalition and a former adviser in Israel’s National Security Council. Broad support for the coalition The coalition has already gained significant support from Israeli society, with over 100 senior figures backing its efforts. Pollak-David said that notable backers include former ministers, security experts, businesspeople, tech leaders, and diplomats. According to its leaders, the coalition’s ultimate goal is to create a stable environment that allows for lasting peace. 'This war is over, Gaza is in ruins, and Hamas as a fighting force is threadbare. It’s vital to have a plan for the ‘day after’ that brings peace in this area of the globe,' said Josh Hantman, former adviser to Israel’s Defense Ministry and a partner in the coalition. Normalization and separation plans As part of its plan to achieve security and stability, the coalition proposes pursuing normalization with Saudi Arabia and carrying out 'a gradual, responsible, secure path of separation from the Palestinians.' Pollak-David cited research showing that more than three-quarters of Israelis support peace with Saudi Arabia and around two-thirds support separation from the Palestinians. One of the plan’s conditions for separation from the Palestinians is that Hamas will not be represented in Palestinian political bodies. Pollak-David described Hamas in Gaza as 'almost completely eradicated,' but according to Hantman, there’s no guarantee that the group won’t see a resurgence. 'If we leave a vacuum, Hamas will simply return,' he said. Stabilizing Gaza through regional cooperation The Coalition for Regional Security plan proposes establishing a technocratic government in Gaza, aimed at providing essential services and overseeing reconstruction efforts. 'This government would be tasked with ensuring the smooth rebuilding of Gaza and the management of humanitarian aid, all while maintaining stability in the region,' Pollak-David explained. She outlined the role that Arab states could play in stabilizing Gaza. 'Egypt and Jordan will be useful to monitor security inside the strip through a police and security system,' she said, explaining that Israel’s military won’t remain in Gaza under their plan. Pollak-David also noted that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have both successfully led internal deradicalization efforts that could be relevant for Gaza’s future. The coalition hopes to harness those countries’ successes in rebuilding Gaza. Role of Arab nations in regional stability Danny Ayalon, former ambassador of Israel to the U.S. and a partner in the coalition, also underscored the importance of Arab nations in the region’s future. 'Moderate countries such as the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain must be involved in stabilizing the Palestinian situation and contributing to the regional economy,' he said. Economic opportunities: The Cotton Road initiative Beyond security and governance, the coalition also seeks to establish economic cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, which could further solidify regional stability. Cooperation, while largely behind the scenes, has already begun in various sectors, including technology and infrastructure investments. Ayalon described the vision of an economic corridor between Asia and Europe via Israel. This 'Cotton Road' would provide a strategic alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, enhancing trade and economic ties between the Gulf, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Europe, and the US (where goods would be shipped after arriving in Europe). For Israel, potential economic opportunities include sharing innovation and technology with other countries in the region. 'Israeli advancements in water tech, food tech, and agri-tech can enable immense cooperation with Arab partners in the region, especially in the Gulf,' Ayalon said. Ayalon’s own company, Silver Road Capital, is prepared to invest billions in Palestinian high-tech startups and other industries that could foster economic growth and regional partnerships. 'We are ready to introduce and push economic opportunities in the region, starting from the Palestinian territories, once stability is reached,' he explained. He also highlighted the potential for joint tourism initiatives, particularly in regions of Israel and the Palestinian territories rich in biblical and archaeological significance. Addressing settlements and long-term peace Settlements remain a sensitive issue, one that the coalition seeks to address pragmatically. Pollak-David acknowledged the challenges posed by Israeli settlements in the West Bank, particularly considering the broader regional context. 'The violence of the settlers has to end right now,' she said. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: She said that a practical division of settlement blocks and illegal settlements must be discussed in future negotiations. Hantman described the issue of settlements as tied to final-status negotiations, which aren’t emphasized in the coalition’s plan. 'The coalition’s focus is on ensuring security and avoiding steps that undermine the overall stability,' he explained. By focusing on Israeli security, regional collaboration, and economic integration, the Coalition for Regional Security has set out to build a new regional order—one that could potentially reshape the region’s geopolitical landscape. Only time will tell whether the initiative will succeed.

Victory for Prince Harry as Murdoch papers admits wrongdoing by S...	Prince Harry settled his privacy claim against Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper group on Wednesday after the publisher admitted unlawful actions at its Sun tabloid for the first time, bringing the fiercely-contested legal battle to a dramatic end. In a stunning victory for Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles, News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, also admitted it had intruded into the private life of his late mother, Princess Diana. Harry's lawyer, David Sherborne, said the publisher had agreed to pay the prince substantial damages. A source familiar with the settlement said it involved an eight-figure sum. Harry had been suing NGN at the High Court in London, accusing its newspapers of unlawfully obtaining private information about him from 1996 until 2011. The trial to consider the royal's case, and a similar lawsuit from former senior British lawmaker Tom Watson, was due to start on Tuesday but following last-gasp talks, the two sides reached a settlement, with NGN saying there had been wrongdoing at The Sun, something it had denied for years.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hymwnuadyx	2025-01-22T02:23:15-08:00

Inbar Rosenfeld says former hostage wished to see her oldest friend and adds that her physical condition is fine despite her injuries, but he worries about her mental health Inbar Rosenfeld, 28, a childhood friend of former hostage Emily Damari, 28, who was released from Hamas captivity on Sunday alongside Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher, shared his experience meeting her at Sheba Medical Center. 'It was incredibly emotional. I needed someone to touch me with a stick to believe it was real,' Rosenfeld told Ynet. Rosenfeld, a resident of Kibbutz Kfar Aza and a lifelong friend of Emily, said that Emily's 'brother called me and said she wanted to see me. Emily is still Emily — that's her personality. But there are many things that have changed. You can see it in her eyes and body language. There’s a significant change, naturally. Still, her humor and joking — that’s who she is and it’s what kept her going.' Rosenfeld addressed Emily’s 471 days in Gaza, saying: 'She had some awareness, listened to a bit of radio and saw a little TV. She knew about her friends from Kfar Aza who were murdered but wasn’t fully informed. She was curious but only slightly connected to the outside.' Now the whole world knows that Emily lost two fingers due to terrorist gunfire on October 7. 'It seems everything's okay, though she has injuries to her leg and hand. But like all of us, we're wounded on the inside. Those things aren't visible — they need time to settle,' he said. Emily’s mother, Mandy, shared the first photo of her daughter without the bandages on her fingers tht she returned with from Gaza. 'Thank you to everyone in the UK and worldwide for the support campaign to bring Emily home,' she wrote on X. 'You’re amazing and we love you all. There are still 94 hostages who need us.' Emily, a British citizen, quickly became a symbol of resilience. Upon her release, she reportedly pushed one of the Hamas captors as she exited the vehicle at the Red Cross handover point. She also demonstrated her defiance in a phone call with her brother, showing him her amputated fingers.

IDF officer who lost his hand in Gaza was injured in Tel Aviv sta...	Captain A., who was injured in the war in Gaza and lost his right hand, went out in Tel Aviv with friends and intervened where a Moroccan national with a US Green Card, stabbed some of his friends Captain A., an armor officer who was injured in the war in Gaza and lost his right hand, was slightly injured on Tuesday night in the stabbing attack in Nahalat Binyamin in Tel Aviv. 'Today I am at the Tactical Command College, in a company commander course. I went out with my friends from the course to Nahalat Binyamin, and during the outing a terrorist came and tried to stab one of us. As soon as I noticed the incident, I tried to hit the terrorist and we chased him. I was injured and am currently being treated at Ichilov Medical Center with a minor hand injury, and I expect to return to the course tomorrow and continue as usual,' A. said on Tuesday. The IDF reported that A. acted to neutralize the terrorist at the scene, and was taken to Ichilov Hospital for treatment. The terrorist, Kaddi Abdelaziz, a 29-year-old Moroccan citizen, held an American Green Card and arrived in Israel only three days before the attack. When he entered Israel through Ben Gurion Airport, the border inspector thought he was suspicious and pulled him over for questioning. He was refused entry and transferred to the Shin Bet, but they eventually approved his entry. In Tuesday's attack, the terrorist stabbed five people in Tel Aviv. One was seriously injured, one moderately injured and three lightly injured. The terrorist was eliminated by soldiers passing by the area. Abdelaziz stabbed the victims during Nahalat Binyamin Street's bustling hours on a regular evening. He also stabbed an American tourist after stabbing four Israelis. Soldiers from the elite Shaldag unit, who heard the American tourist's screams, came down from their house, one of them in uniform and another in pajamas and neutralized the terrorist. 'We came down from the house, and saw him knocking a civilian to the floor. We shouted at him to stop and shot when he refused. We fired four bullets in total,' according to one. Bystanders who heard the gunshots of the terrorist being neutralized panicked, entered restaurants and hid under tables. The Shin Bet said that the terrorist's entry to Israel would be investigated. 'When the subject entered Israel, he underwent a security assessment that included his interrogation as well as additional tests. Finally, it was decided that there was no reason to prevent his entry into Israel. The case will be investigated,' the agency said. It was enough to look at his social media posts to understand that his entry could be problematic. The terrorist had previously shared posts in favor of Gaza, and against Israel. Among other things, he accused Israel of starving the northern Gaza Strip, and claimed that 'half a million Gazans are in danger of dying of hunger there.' He shared a video praising Islam with the caption 'free Palestine' and a picture of the terrorist Ibrahim Nablusi, who was eliminated in Nablus. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: His American ID card states that he was born in Morocco, and on his Facebook page on September 14, 2022, he shared a picture of himself flying from there to New York - and wrote 'Alhamdulillah.' After the October 7 massacre, Abdelaziz published a post in which he wrote: 'What is happening now may be the reason for doubling the number of martyrs who are being tortured for Islam.' Shortly after Tuesday's attack his identity was published and the terrorist's Facebook was deleted. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkoau4ad1e	2025-01-22T01:04:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/HkZicIFTwkx/HkZicIFTwkx_0_92_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Palestinian Authority reportedly to manage Gaza's Rafah crossing ...	Netanyahu publicly opposes the arrangement, but according to a source in the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, during the visit of the Mossad and Shin Bet heads in Cairo, an agreement was reached that has Palestinian Authority managing crossing on the Gaza side 'under international supervision'; There are still remaining disputes - and the question of withdrawing from Philadelphi Corridor: 'We want to return to the situation that existed before the war' Following the visit of Mossad head Dedi Barnea and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar to Egypt, the London-based Arabic language Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported that an agreement had been reached on the control mechanism at the Rafah Crossing, which the IDF took over in May. According to a source in the joint cease-fire monitoring team, the talks also dealt with security arrangements on the Philadelphi Corridor, and not just the issue of the Rafah Crossing on the Gaza side. 'The parties reached an agreement regarding the management of the crossing on the Palestinian side. It was agreed that it would be managed by the Palestinian Authority, under international supervision and monitoring by the UN,' claimed the same source, who spoke to the newspaper on condition of anonymity, noting that it had not yet been decided when the crossing would be returned to operation. In addition, according to the source, no agreement was reached regarding the Philadelphi Corridor. The Rafah Crossing served as a central hub for transferring aid to the Gaza Strip at the beginning of the war and has been closed since it was taken over by the IDF. The appendix to the cease-fire agreement, signed last week in Qatar, stated that Israel would now be required to work to reopen it, and that its forces would 'redeploy around' the crossing based on maps to be agreed upon between the parties, without specifying whether there would be an actual withdrawal from there. The maps themselves, which depict the IDF’s gradual withdrawal and redeployment of its forces during the cease-fire, have not yet been revealed. Netanyahu has previously opposed the possibility of Palestinian Authority representatives activating the crossing, and the appendix did not specify exactly how it would be activated. 'The crossing will be activated based on the discussions from August 2024 with Egypt,' the appendix stated, without elaborating. According to the Saudi report, the meetings that began in Cairo on Monday lasted until the early hours of Tuesday morning - and were attended by Barnea and Bar, as well as Egyptian intelligence chief Hassan Rashad, and a number of senior officials responsible for the Palestinian issue in Egyptian intelligence. 'The remaining disputes are technical and logistical and they will be resolved,' the source said. Regarding the Philadelphi Corridor, the report claims, Israel has proposed implementing partial withdrawals from the axis, but Egypt insists on a full withdrawal. 'Cairo wants to return to the situation that existed before the war,' the source noted. 'We also discussed in the meeting the possibility of changing the crossing agreement later. What has been determined now is temporary and concerns this stage only.' Meanwhile, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said that 'the responsibility to maintain the cease-fire in Gaza is the responsibility of all of us in the region.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israel did not commit to a full withdrawal from the corridor in the first phase of the deal and cease-fire, but only to a 'reduction' of its presence. According to the appendix to the deal, the details of which were obtained last week, the withdrawal from there is supposed to begin only on the last day of the first phase, day 42, when the last hostages of 33 hostages will be released as part of that phase. However, since that agreement was signed, Israeli officials have insisted that there will be no actual withdrawal - and their statements cast doubt on the fact that the agreement stipulates that even if an agreement on Phase Two is not reached by the end of the first phase, the temporary cease-fire will continue as long as the negotiations continue - with the mediators, including the U.S., committed to guarantee this. Last week, Palestinian Authority officials claimed in a conversation with Ynet that President-elect Donald Trump asked Ramallah to control the Gaza Strip's crossings, and 'especially' the Rafah crossing, in coordination with Israel and Egypt. > annex	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rks8f4cdkg	2025-01-22T00:56:48-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2023/11/19/Hkgk7FFvVT/Hkgk7FFvVT_0_66_1564_881_0_small.jpg

Between fear and hope: Hostages' relatives talk about deal's seco...	Daniel, grandson of hostage Oded Lifshitz, and Alon, father of captive IDF soldier Tamir Nimrodi, talk with Ynet and express their faith in the new deal and frustration that it is taking place so late Following the release of the three first Israeli hostages as part of the second hostage deal with Hamas on Sunday, 30 additional captives are expected to be released throughout the deal’s first phase including Oded Lifshitz, abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. His grandson Daniel, in an interview with Ynet, described the tension and anxiety he and the rest of the family felt during his more than 15-month captivity and expected return. 'Every piece of information has us jumping from the chair. And as much as it was so hard, we've been waiting for that. So I receive it with a blessing and with love. It's much better than looking to the skies and praying or going to Doha and DC or the Knesset,' he said. When asked if his family is already preparing for Oded’s return as part of the deal, he said: 'We've been speaking about it on Friday dinner, but it's very difficult. We don't have a solution on how to prepare for receiving someone either for a festival or for a funeral. So for the moment we are not preparing, it's too hard.' 'Today is the day of new history, also the return of the body of Oron Shaul after more than 10 years and the three hostages that I've seen that Hamas already passed the list to the mediators and to Israel and hopefully, Arbel Yehud will be on the list and we will be able to have that closure and some more families will have closure, but it's unimaginable.' He also addressed the family’s frustration at the possibility that the deal could have taken place months ago. 'If I look back, I think so many things could have happened months ago, I think this phase to release the women, the elderly and the wounded should have been done after a week or two weeks with my grandmother. The world really failed us. This deal could have happened maybe in May or July.' 'We are really lucky that we got [President Donald] Trump because his election changed everything and the work [Mideast envoy Steve] Witkoff has done when he came here over both sides: Prime Minister Netanyahu and from the other side, suddenly the Qataris place much more pressure and from what I've heard, Witkoff and Al Thani, the Prime Minister of Qatar, were the main ones that let this deal happen,' he added. When asked how his grandmother Yocheved Lifshitz, who was released in the first hostage deal in November 2023, felt about the new deal, he said, 'I think she's surprised that this deal happened. She was very pessimistic. But now when it's starting, she will be so happy to see everyone come home and she's really waiting for the 97 hostages to come home. She will do a countdown until the last one. When the last one will be here, then she can move on mentally.' Alon Nimrodi, father of captive IDF soldier Tamir Nimrodi, also spoke with Ynet about the current deal and his hopes that his son will return to Israel in the deal’s second phase. 'I hope so, but as I said a few months ago, this will be a horrible agreement. And it's a horrible agreement because we didn't discuss all of the hostages. We needed to write all the 98, now 97 names of hostages to bring them back home,' he said. 'The second phase is horrible because we didn't start it nor the first phase. We don't know if there were any violations since the agreements were signed and we still don't know how we’ll proceed with the agreement. The second phase will take a longer time but we hold onto faith,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Alon also expressed his frustration over the fact that IDF soldiers taken hostage will remain imprisoned until the deal’s second phase. 'We are frustrated because my son and all the hostages were sent by the country, by the army to serve there and nobody cared about them. It's been 471 days and they were left behind even after the last Thai hostages returned home,' he said. 'It's a disaster, we can't handle it, it's terrible,' he added. 'I don't know how the government can sleep at night with those choices.' When asked what his message was to decision-makers and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he said: 'Bring them back all home now, make agreements, talk about the second phase right now. You must put all the names on the list and stop bullsh*tting us.' 'You must do it. You are talking about human beings. You are talking about the future of the world because all those young people left behind are the future of Israel so you must talk about them right now and bring them back as soon as possible,' he concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byam4qcvyx	2025-01-22T00:14:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/22/S1DnL7RDyx/S1DnL7RDyx_52_0_340_192_0_small.jpg

Go to Gaza; maybe there’s a mall there.' The mother and daughter responded: 'You’ve crossed all lines. No saleswoman ever called us wh*re before.' 'A few days ago, we bought a coat from the store and wanted to return it because the size didn’t fit,' the mother told Ynet. 'The saleswoman told us, ‘I’ve closed the register and I can’t accept anything,’ even though there was still an hour and a half until closing time. 'I asked to speak to the manager and she called someone, then came back claiming: ‘You’ve worn the coat, and it has cigarette marks.’ We told her that wasn’t true, that we’re well-mannered and don’t deceive people,' she recounted. 'We’ve been shopping at this place for years. At that moment, I was shocked when the saleswoman said, ‘Why are you shouting?’ — even though I wasn’t shouting. She continued to curse at me and my daughter, calling us wh*res and saying, ‘Go to Gaza.’ Her words deeply hurt us.'

Trump's team said working on Phase 2 of Gaza cease-fire	They acknowledge that there may be difficulties in implementing the second phase of the deal, which is supposed to include a permanent cease-fire; Trump: 6 months ago, there were 11 more hostages alive U.S. President Donald Trump's new foreign policy team has already begun working on formulating the second phase of the cease-fire in Gaza, which should lead to the release of the rest of the hostages and a permanent cease-fire in the Strip. According to a report on the Politico website, Trump's people admitted that there may be difficulties on the way to the next phase - and blamed the previous administration of Joe Biden. 'What Biden left us with is the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end,' said one official involved in the negotiations. On Tuesday night, Trump was asked if he planned to travel to the Middle East, and said: 'We’re thinking about going to the Middle East — not yet. We have a thing called ‘the hostages are coming back’ going on right now. Some of them were badly hurt. You see this young woman with her hand that was shot . It was terrible. If I weren’t here, that they wouldn’t be back ever. They would all be dead. If it had been done a year earlier, if Biden had done it a year and a half, two years earlier, it wouldn't have happened.' 'October 7th was not supposed to happen. But through weakness, they let it happen. It's a disaster. JYou go back just six months, many of these young people were living, there were 11 more hostages alive,' Trump said. 'You know, young people don't die like that at 22-23, but now they're dying, And you wonder why they're dying; they're being killed, really killed, and they're just dying. But Biden couldn't make it end, and it was only when I set a deadline - they did it,' Trump continued. 'It's a very sad situation. It should never have happened.' According to Trump, what is happening in the Middle East would not have happened under him. 'Iran would have been poor, they had no money. There was no money for Hamas and there was no money for Hezbollah. October 7 would not have happened, but these are the cards that were dealt to me - and we're getting the hostages back - which would never have happened under Biden. They would never have come back, they just died slowly,' he said. According to the report, Trump's people plan to emphasize and prioritize efforts to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Those who will deal with this will be Trump's new Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and his national security adviser Mike Walz - who said last week that this is a priority for the new administration in Washington.

Negotiations on the second phase will not begin until the 16th day of the first phase, and in order to reach it, Hamas is demanding an end to the war and a complete withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza – while Israel will demand the end of Hamas rule and the exile of its leaders, and insists that it can return to fighting if the negotiations fail. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy00lxmrwyl	2025-01-21T22:17:11-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/HykysYnP1g/HykysYnP1g_0_27_800_451_0_small.jpg

Kaddi Abdelaziz in social media posts accused Israel of starving Gazans and shared images glorifying a terrorist; Despite failing to provide clear answers to border control officials at Ben Gurion Airport, Shin Bet approved his entry after further questioning; 3 days later he stabbed 5 people The terrorist who stabbed five people in Tel Aviv’s bustling Nachalat Binyamin area on Tuesday night has been identified as Kaddi Abdelaziz, a 29-year-old Moroccan man with a U.S. green card. He arrived in Israel just three days prior to the attack, and raised suspicions at Ben Gurion Airport. According to a border control officer, Abdelaziz could not provide a clear reason for his visit, failing to explain his purpose and say whom he was meetin or whether he intended to work in Israel. His evasive responses led to an immediate referral to the Shin Bet for further interrogation. Despite the concerns raised, security officials ultimately approved his entry. Interior Minister Moshe Arbel noted that border control officers from the Population and Immigration Authority identified Abdelaziz as a threat in real time and sought to prevent him from entering Israel. He was transferred to Shin Bet security officials for further questioning, who ultimately allowed him to enter Israel. 'I commend and appreciate the border control officers of the Population and Immigration Authority who identified in real time and sought to prevent the entry into Israel of the terrorist from the attack in Tel Aviv upon his arrival at Ben Gurion Airport on 18.1.25 and transferred him for questioning to security officials who unfortunately decided to allow his entry into Israel,' Arbel said. 'Unfortunately, security authorities decided otherwise. I urge Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar to investigate this grave incident and draw conclusions swiftly,' he added. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In response, the Shin Bet stated that Abdelaziz underwent a comprehensive security evaluation, including questioning and additional checks, before determining there was no sufficient basis to deny him entry on security grounds. 'The case is under review,' the agency added. Officials clarified that Shin Bet does not grant entry permits but only advises against entry when clear security threats are identified. Further investigations revealed that Abdelaziz had previously shared inflammatory posts on social media, including pro-Gaza and anti-Israel content. In one post, he accused Israel of starving civilians in northern Gaza and claimed that 'half a million Gazans are at risk of dying from hunger.' He also shared a video praising Islam accompanied by the slogan 'Free Palestine' and a photo of slain terrorist Ibrahim al-Nabulsi. Abdelaziz’s American documentation indicates he was born in Morocco. His Facebook activity suggests he traveled to New York in September 2022, where he posted, 'Alhamdulillah,' alongside a photo of himself. Following the October 7 Hamas terror attack, Abdelaziz shared a post referring to the events as a potential reason for 'doubling the number of martyrs for Islam.' Shortly after the attack and the release of his identity, Abdelaziz’s Facebook profile was deleted. The incident has sparked public debate over border security protocols and the handling of individuals flagged as potential threats, particularly during heightened tensions in the region. Faisal Marjani, a Moroccan citizen and the president and founder of the Moroccan Coexistence Association, condemned the attack, telling Ynet: 'I heard about the incident and it saddened me. The Moroccan Coexistence Association condemns the cowardly act of terrorism that harmed innocent citizens in Israel, and confirms its firm position rejecting any form of violence and terrorism. This despicable act reflects the escalation of incitement and hate speech led by several media outlets, led by Al-Jazeera, which continues to broadcast misleading discourse and spread hatred against Jews and Israelis. Terrorism, which does not recognize borders or religious affiliation, is a global state scourge that all forces must confront by all legal and moral means.' He added: 'The association confirms that this person of Moroccan origin who committed this heinous act represents only himself and his personal extremism, while the entire Moroccan people stand united against terrorism and extremism. The Moroccan Coexistence Association confirms that Morocco adopts a strict policy in dealing with all forms of violence and terrorism and is committed to applying the law firmly to anyone who dares to threaten the security and stability of societies. Moroccan law constitutes the first line of defense against all forms of extremism and hatred and constitutes a fundamental pillar in promoting values ​​of tolerance and coexistence between the various components of society.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkpwxipv1g	2025-01-21T14:01:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/SJAkfcTv1l/SJAkfcTv1l_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF must now withdraw from Lebanon: 6,000 Lebanese soldiers said ...	Under cease-fire agreement, the IDF must complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon by Sunday; Western diplomats report that the Lebanese Armed Forces have already carried out 100 operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure, noting, 'It’s likely some requests came from the IDF' Under the terms of the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, the IDF is required to complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon and redeploy along the Israeli side of the Blue Line, the internationally recognized border, by Sunday, January 26. 'The deadline itself is not critical, but it’s important to create a sense of momentum, and we hope it can be maintained as the IDF continues its withdrawal,' a senior Western diplomat said. The diplomat noted that Israel has already withdrawn from two areas: Al-Khiam in December and Al-Naqoura in early January, following a meeting of the cease-fire enforcement mechanism and a visit by U.S. Special Envoy Amos Hochstein to Lebanon. 'We expect further Israeli withdrawals and a new deployment,' the diplomat added. The cease-fire enforcement mechanism is preparing a plan for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to redeploy in areas vacated by the IDF, including detailed timelines and locations. Since the cease-fire began, the LAF has deployed 6,000 soldiers in southern Lebanon, conducting over 100 operations to neutralize Hezbollah infrastructure, including the destruction of rocket launchers, buildings and other facilities. According to Western diplomats, about one-third of these operations were initiated by the LAF, with the remainder carried out at the request of the U.S.-led enforcement mechanism. It is believed that some of these requests originated from Israel. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Diplomats emphasized that the withdrawal process requires political commitment from both sides. 'The IDF is acting based on decisions from Israel’s political leadership. We believe they understand what needs to be done, but it’s difficult to predict how it will unfold,' one diplomat said. 'The LAF must continue dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure, while the IDF needs to facilitate the LAF’s access to vacated areas. It’s a parallel process that must move forward together,' the diplomat added. Lebanon has entered a period of political opportunity following the appointment of a new president and prime minister. 'Our message to Israel is to support – or at least not hinder – the efforts of Lebanon’s new government. They deserve a chance,' said the diplomats. Meanwhile, Syria’s new government issued a statement pledging to maintain stability along its shared border with Lebanon. Syria has also signaled to the international community and Israel its intent to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from resuming arms transfers from Syria into Lebanon. This development is seen as a significant step forward for both Lebanon and Israel. As the deadline approaches, all eyes are on the region to see if the delicate balance of military withdrawal and political cooperation can be sustained to ensure long-term stability. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sygfivap1l	2025-01-21T13:04:34-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/27/BkBMmbGhHkl/BkBMmbGhHkl_0_167_1600_901_0_small.jpg

Yemen Red Sea port capacity down sharply after hostilities, UN sa...	Operations at a Red Sea port in Yemen used for aid imports have fallen to about a quarter of its capacity, a UN official said on Tuesday, adding it was not certain that a Gaza cease-fire would end attacks between the Iran-backed Houthis and Israel. Houthis have launched attacks on international shipping near Yemen since November 2023 in solidarity with Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. This has prompted Israel to strike port and energy facilities, including the Red Sea port of Hodeidah. '(The) impact of airstrikes on Hodeidah Harbour, particularly in the last weeks, is very important,' Julien Harneis, U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Yemen told a U.N. meeting in Geneva on Tuesday via videolink. Four of the port's five tugboats needed to escort the large ships bringing imports had sunk, while the fifth was damaged, he said, without attributing blame. 'The civilian crews who man them are obviously very hesitant. The capacity of the harbor is down to about a quarter,' he added, saying the port was used to transit a significant portion of imported aid. Since a Gaza ceasefire agreement last week, Yemen's Houthis have said they will limit their attacks on commercial vessels to Israel-linked ships, provided the Gaza cease-fire is fully implemented.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj7hsftdkg	2025-01-21T12:03:32-08:00

It is unclear what the motive for the shooting was, and who was responsible for it. On Sunday, the 60 days of the first phase of the cease-fire in the north are set to end, after which the IDF must, according to the agreement between Israel and Lebanon, complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon and deploy on the Israeli side of the border. 'The deadline is not important in itself, but it is important to create a sense of dynamism and we hope that it can be maintained and that the IDF will continue to withdraw from the positions it holds,' said a senior Western diplomat about the date by which the IDF must complete the withdrawal.

Trump launches presidency with bold executive orders. What comes ...	Live from Washington: Trump expressed belief in the potential for peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia U.S. President Donald Trump wasted no time advancing his agenda and fulfilling the promises he made to the people of the United States. Trump took swift action to honor his campaign commitments, rolling back nearly 80 executive orders signed by the Biden administration. Among these were measures emphasizing his administration’s strong support for Israel. Trump revoked sanctions on Israelis living in Judea and Samaria, reinforcing U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty. He restored sanctions on the International Criminal Court, paused U.S. foreign aid programs—such as those benefiting UNRWA, accused of ties to Hamas—for a 90-day review to ensure alignment with administration policies, and authorized the removal of visa holders involved in pro-Hamas protests, riots, or fundraising on U.S. campuses, as well as those supporting hateful ideologies, among other orders. These actions came just hours after Trump was inaugurated. In his speech, he expressed satisfaction that the day before he took office, Israeli hostages had begun returning to their families. During Monday night’s inaugural parade, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff welcomed the families of American and Israeli hostages onto the stage. Witkoff, a key figure in brokering the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal, received a standing ovation alongside the families as they shook hands with First Lady Melania Trump. However, when Trump signed his executive orders, a reporter asked about his confidence in the Gaza deal progressing to Phase III, which aims to return the remaining 94 hostages to Israel. Trump admitted he was not confident. On a more optimistic note, Trump expressed belief in the potential for peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. When asked by a reporter, 'Will you push Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations?' Trump responded, 'I don't think I have to push them. I think it's going to happen.' Trump emphasized his desire for a legacy as a peacemaker and unifier, leading some to speculate he may no longer pursue a U.S.-led strike on Iran. In his inaugural speech, he stated: 'We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end. And, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.' The entire environment was electric, and there were certainly many Jews from across the United States who came to Washington to attend the celebrations, as well as a number of Israelis. Here’s what some of them had to say: 'We fought, fought, and we won, won, won,' said Santo Aquila of New York. 'We trust his ability to speak the language that terrorists can understand,' said Nicole Levine, who came to D.C. from Herzliya for the inauguration. 'Let's make America great again. And you know what? Let's make the world a safer place.' 'The three hostages that came home yesterday are only the start,' noted Eliza Laganas of Florida. 'I truly believe that had Trump been in office, October 7 would have never happened, and now I know for the next four years it will never happen again.' Yifat Schnur from New Jersey said, 'I think that Trump is going to be wonderful for the world, for the United States, and also for Israel.' There were also Israeli Knesset members on the ground, such as Religious Zionist Party MK Simcha Rothman. He said, 'I came here for the inauguration of President Trump, to meet with all the people that are getting into office, getting ready, as they say, to make America great again, but also to see how to make Israel great.' 'I came here because I think it's a historic event,' added MK Ohad Tal. 'These are historic days. It's important not just for America. I think it's important for the world, definitely for the free world, because now finally, we have in the White House a leader who knows to differentiate between good and evil.' And what did Manuel Vilar have to say? 'Strength, independence, security, empowerment—and making America great again. And Israel great again too, while we're at it.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syh0jvtwkx	2025-01-21T10:01:41-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/S12FhPTPJx/S12FhPTPJx_1_34_1038_585_0_small.jpg

Emily's mom posts message to world, and 1st photo of her daughter...	Mandy Damari thanked citizens in the UK and around the world who called for her daughter's release from captivity, emphasizing: 'There are 94 more hostages who need us' Mandy Damari, the mother of Emily, who was returned from Hamas captivity on Sunday, posted a message to the world on the X platform - including the first photo of her daughter without the bandage covering her shot off-fingers that she returned with from Gaza. 'Thank you to everyone in the UK and around the world who supported the campaign to bring Emily home, and for all your messages here on X. You are amazing and we love you all. 94 hostages still need us,' she wrote in her post. Emily, a British citizen, immediately became a symbol of heroism upon her release, when, among other things, she pushed one of the Hamas terrorists out of the vehicle that brought her to the Red Cross collection point - and also provided a special victory image, when she showed her brother her severed fingers in a phone call. Emily was the only Gaza hostage holding British citizenship and, until her release, there has been no sign of life from her during her time in captivity. On the morning of October 7, Hamas terrorists invaded her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, killed her dog, and abducted her from the Young Generation neighborhood of the kibbutz.

Not a second goes by that we don't think of you, pray for you, fight for you to come home alive.' One of the campaigns for Emily's release was by fans of her beloved English soccer team, Tottenham, who made sure to release yellow balloons into the air at every game, wave her picture, and wish for her return and the return of the other hostages. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1qfgvtpkg	2025-01-21T09:19:17-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/SyYMTIpv1l/SyYMTIpv1l_0_179_900_507_0_small.jpg
Israel's Iron Wall operation in West Bank: IDF strikes terrorists...	The IDF struck a terrorist cell using a drone as part of fresh operation Iron Wall; Military plans to deploy bulldozers in the city to expose and clear booby-trapped routes The IDF eliminated a terrorist cell in Jenin on Tuesday as they were planting explosive devices in Jenin. The attack was carried out with drones as part of Israel's counter-terrorism Iron Wall operation in the West Bank. Palestinian sources initially reported air raid sirens sounding throughout the city as the operation began with drone strikes, followed by a combat helicopter assault. The Palestinian Authority's Health Ministry reported six fatalities and at least 35 injuries from IDF airstrikes, with casualties ranging from mild to critical. Following the drone strike, IDF bulldozers, including D9s, are expected to enter the area to clear roads suspected of being booby-trapped. The operation, which began with targeted strikes on infrastructure, continued with ground forces entering Jenin. It is anticipated to continue for several days, involving significant military resources, including special forces, the Shin Bet security agency, and Border Police units. The IDF aims to maintain operational freedom across the West Bank, dismantle terrorist infrastructure, and neutralize imminent threats. The decision to launch the operation was approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet on Friday. The timing reflects the influence of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who reportedly pressured Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to action following a shooting attack in the northern West Bank Palestinian village of Funduq that killed three Israelis, including two women in their 70s. Initial concerns about potential international backlash, particularly from the Biden administration, delayed the operation, despite months of planning by the IDF as part of its offensive strategy. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: The IDF has also intensified arrests across the West Bank, with Palestinian sources reporting 11 arrests in Idna near Hebron and seven in Qalqilya. Earlier in the day, the Palestinian news agency WAFA claimed that Israeli forces tightened restrictions in Ramallah and Al-Bireh, closing additional roads. The operation coincides with the winding down of an unprecedented six-week crackdown by Palestinian security forces targeting terrorist activities in the Jenin refugee camp. According to an IDF source, the Palestinian Authority sought to demonstrate its ability to curb terrorist presence and assert control. 'They signaled to the Palestinian public and the international community – especially the U.S. and EU – that they can exercise authority, even in areas heavily impacted by Hamas,' the source said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjglusawyl	2025-01-21T08:37:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/rJb00Ivfavkg/rJb00Ivfavkg_0_96_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Turkish ski resort fire kills 66, guests forced to jump from wind...	Eyewitnesses say the flames engulfed the hotel in half an hour, as people tried to climb down using bedsheets; Hotel guests said they fled through smoke-filled corridors and heard no alarms A fire at a ski resort hotel in Turkey's Bolu mountains killed 66 people and injured 51 others on Tuesday, forcing panicked guests to jump out of windows in the middle of the night. 'It was like the apocalypse. The flames engulfed the hotel immediately, like in half an hour,' said Mevlut Ozer, who witnessed the incident at the Kartalkaya ski resort in northwest Turkey. The fire began around 3:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) on the restaurant floor of the 12-story Grand Kartal Hotel, authorities said. Several fire engines and ambulances later surrounded the charred, wood-fronted building, with white bed sheets tied together and dangling from at least three upper-floor windows where people tried to flee. 'People all started to jump with panic. One friend jumped from the 11th floor - may God have mercy on him,' said Omer Sakrak, another witness and employee of a neighboring hotel.

An investigation was underway into the fire, which coincided with school holidays when many families from nearby Istanbul and Ankara headed to the Bolu mountains to ski.

Iran's axis is weakened, but threats persist	While Tehran's control in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza has been severely impacted during the war, Iran and its proxies make efforts to portray victory in cease-fire and hostage deal The hostage release and Gaza cease-fire agreement took effect on Sunday, with the Iranian-Shiite axis continuing its rhetoric of boasting and threats. Despite significant setbacks in Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere, 'victory speeches' persist in Iran and elsewhere. Iranian officials, allied militias in Iraq, Hezbollah and the Houthis have issued statements celebrating the cease-fire, claiming it as a triumph. 'The people of Gaza stand firm like a mountain. Despite the loss of figures like Yahya Sinwar, the resistance front will not falter. Hamas is alive and will remain alive,' Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei posted on X in Hebrew. He attached a video showing Hamas terrorists and the release of three Israeli hostages Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian added: 'We congratulate the resilient people of Gaza and Palestine on this victory. The Palestinian people stood with strength and dignity against Israel and achieved a great accomplishment.' Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqaei declared that 'the Gaza cease-fire is a complete defeat for the Zionist entity and its allies, another example of the triumph of resistance and confrontation against the occupation.' Iranian Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri called the cease-fire a sign of Israel’s 'collapse of authority' and an 'important turning point for the region and the Islamic world.' He claimed, 'The resistance axis emerged victorious, imposing this agreement on the enemy.' Iranian Revolutionary Guard Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani also claimed that Israel 'was forced to accept Hamas's terms, the same ones it proposed in earlier negotiations.' Meanwhile, Iranian outlets showcased military capabilities, with the Tasnim news agency revealing a strategic naval base and Mehr agency highlighting new defense systems added to Iran's navy. According to the Iranian news agency IRNA, a military drill began in the Kermanshah region of western Iran on Tuesday and will last nine days. The drills aim to enhance military readiness, demonstrate the forces' defensive capabilities, improve regional security and signal the army's readiness to defend Iran. Hezbollah, which reached its own agreement with Israel nearly two months ago, echoed similar sentiments. In an official statement, it praised the cease-fire as a 'political and military victory' that demonstrated Israel’s failure to achieve its goals. It thanked Iran, Iraqi resistance factions and the Houthis, reaffirming its commitment to supporting Palestinians 'until the occupation ends.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: In Yemen, the Houthis hailed the agreement as a 'historic victory,' vowing to monitor its implementation and confront any Israeli escalation. 'We will limit attacks in the Red Sea to Israeli-linked vessels,' the terror group’s military spokesperson Yahya Saree said, while reaffirming ongoing support for the Palestinian cause. Hezbollah’s acting Secretary-General Naim Qassem, who replaced Hassan Nasrallah after he was killed during the war, said in a recorded speech that the 'Palestinian resistance achieved its goals, while Israel failed to meet its objectives. Violations by Israel cannot continue and our patience toward them is given to allow time for Lebanon and the mediators.

Trump also suspended the CPB One app, which had legalized asylum requests for nearly a million migrants, leaving thousands stranded at the Mexican border. For many, this app was the only legal way to seek asylum. Migrants like Margelis, a Venezuelan mother, pleaded for compassion: 'Have compassion and let us cross.' Others, like Maria, an Ecuadorian fleeing cartel violence, and Imane, a Cuban migrant, shared similar despair. Critics warned that Trump’s mass deportation plans could tear families apart, hurt businesses and cost taxpayers billions. With Maria, for example, violence of drug cartels forced her family to flee Ecuador. On Trump’s inauguration day, the family was supposed to enter the United States, but they are now stuck in Mexico. 'I am not asking for anything from the world, only from God: Please let us in,' she said, crying. Trump also proposed ending birthright citizenship, limiting it to children of permanent residents – a move likely to face legal challenges for violating the U.S. Constitution. Additionally, he suspended the U.S. refugee program indefinitely, canceling resettlement for 1,660 Afghans, including unaccompanied minors and relatives of U.S. service members, many of whom fear Taliban retaliation for aiding the U.S. Another polarizing decision was Trump’s pardon of 1,500 people involved in the January 6 Capitol riots. He called them 'hostages' who were treated unfairly, granting full pardons to non-violent offenders and commuting sentences for far-right group members. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move as a blow to democracy. According to data from the U.S. Department of Justice, 1,583 were prosecuted for offenses related to the Capitol breach. Over 600 were charged with assaulting police officers or resisting law enforcement, including 175 accused of using weapons or causing serious harm to officers. Trump decided to grant full pardons to those who participated in breaching and illegally entering the Capitol but were not charged with violent crimes, and to commute the sentences of those convicted of assaulting police officers. This decision reduced the sentences of 14 members of far-right groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who had been sentenced to long prison terms. However, their convictions still stand.

Trump must confont Iran'	Israeli-Canadian philanthropist Sylvan Adams expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration are preparing a strong response against Iran Israeli-Canadian philanthropist Sylvan Adams expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration are preparing a strong response against Iran, which he described as the greatest threat to Israel and the entire region. 'We cannot allow a fanatical regime, where they believe martyrdom is a goal to pursue in life, to have weapons of mass destruction,' Adams told ILTV News on the day of Trump’s inauguration. Adams emphasized that Iran continues to pose a significant strategic threat despite Israel’s successful efforts against both Iran and its proxies. Over the past year, Israel has retaliated against missile attacks carried out by Iran, striking Iranian targets in response. 'Iran has never been weaker,' Adams said. 'But Iran remains a threat.'

Live from Washington: Trump's first 100 days could redefine U.S. ...	U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn in using two Bibles It was absolutely frigid in Washington, D.C., where U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn in using two Bibles—one given to him by his mother in 1955 and another that belonged to President Lincoln in the 1860s. The cold weather in Washington forced the inauguration ceremony indoors, significantly reducing the number of people able to attend. Despite this, the atmosphere in the city remained festive, with hundreds of watch parties and events taking place throughout the area. Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, a celebratory event was held to mark Trump’s inauguration. For many Israelis, the new president’s term brings high hopes and anticipation for strengthened ties with the U.S. The night before the swearing-in of U.S. President Donald Trump, he criticized the Biden administration, claiming he had accomplished more in the Middle East in recent months than his predecessor did during his entire term. Speaking at a rally on Sunday night, Trump praised the recent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which he described as 'epic.' He attributed the agreement to the Republican victory in the November U.S. elections, calling it a 'first step towards lasting peace in the Middle East.' Trump also announced plans to direct the military to begin construction of an 'Iron Dome' missile defense shield once he takes office. He emphasized that the system would be built in the United States. With Trump’s inauguration, Republicans now control all three branches of policymaking government—the House, the Senate, and the White House—giving them the chance to fulfill promises to combat antisemitism and support Israel. In his first 100 days, Trump is expected to issue dozens, if not hundreds, of executive orders addressing both domestic and foreign policies. His administration has signaled an immediate reversal of what he labeled as 'every radical and foolish executive order of the Biden administration.' On Monday, Trump had already revoked Biden-era sanctions on Israeli citizens and nonprofits in Judea and Samaria, among other pro-Israel moves. Trump has also suggested he will confront Iran’s growing nuclear capabilities, a move many expect to at least in part define his foreign policy priorities. Israel should see what the future holds fairly quickly. ILTV will be in Washington for the next couple of days and provide additional coverage.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1wdtg6dkg	2025-01-21T04:03:59-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/03/Syb86DZBW1l/Syb86DZBW1l_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Israel must return to Gaza to finish war against Hamas'	Amir Avivi: 'As long as we go back to fighting and finishing the job, this will be a momentary setback' Israel will need to return to Gaza and finish the war against Hamas after the hostages return to Israel, according to Brigadier General (Res.) Amir Avivi. He told ILTV that he and his team at the Israel Defense and Security Forum recently met with the Defense Ministry leadership. 'I was very happy about what I heard. It is crystal clear that Israel needs to win this war decisively, and winning the war means bringing the hostages home and also eradicating Hamas, ensuring that Israel and the South are safe for generations to come.' Avivi acknowledged that releasing thousands of terrorists with blood on their hands is a 'kind of setback' that goes against Israel’s goal of eradicating Hamas, but he believes it is only temporary. 'As long as we go back to fighting and finishing the job, this will be a momentary setback and not something that will have long-term repercussions,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1fdrgtvyx	2025-01-21T03:41:53-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/20/B1zR00ge3Pyg/B1zR00ge3Pyg_1_0_1601_901_0_small.jpg

IDF launches counterterror operation in West Bank city of Jenin	Shin Bet and border police join effort to eliminate terror infrastructure and seize illegal weapons as Palestinian Authority operation nears conclusion The IDF, Shin Bet and Border Police on Tuesday launched a counterterrorism operation in the West Bank’s Jenin. The operation began with a drone strike in the city. Palestinians reported alarms in Jenin, claiming the discovery of an 'Israeli special forces unit' and the arrival of military vehicles from the Dotan checkpoint. The operation, which began with airstrikes targeting terror infrastructure and continued with ground forces entering the area, is expected to last several days and involves numerous Israeli forces including special units, Shin Bet and Border Police. The mission’s goals were said to be maintaining operational freedom across the West Bank, dismantling terror infrastructure and neutralizing 'ticking time bombs.' The Palestinian Health Ministry, operated by Hamas, reported one fatality and at least ten injuries from the strikes. Earlier, Palestinian news agency WAFA claimed Israel intensified actions across the West Bank, including road closures near Ramallah and al-Bireh. Arrests continued prior to the Jenin offensive, with 11 individuals detained in Idna near Nablus and seven in Qalqilya. 'The threat to settlements and residents in the West Bank and the seam line is growing.' Defense Minister Israel Katz told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 'Our enemies see this as the only open front now, a space for confrontations, gunfire and terrorism against Israel.' 'The Iranian axis continues to fund, direct and arm these activities.' Katz said he directed the IDF to 'act forcefully to protect all communities and residents, to strike hard and prevent terrorism.' Overnight masked men entered Palestinian villages in the West Bank, vandalizing property and setting buildings, cars and shops on fire. Two people were hurt during clashes with security forces that arrived on the scene, according to initial invetigations, a police officer shot and seriously wounded the two after he was attacked with pepper spray and fired to push back the crowd. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority's (PA) extensive security operation targeting terrorism in Jenin’s refugee camp, ongoing for over a month and a half, is nearing completion. The IDF observed a decline in arrests and activity in the past two weeks, with a military source saying the operation achieved its goal. 'They demonstrated to Palestinians and the world that they won’t tolerate such terrorist presence.' The source added, 'It’s also their signal to the U.S. and EU that they’re capable of controlling parts of Gaza in place of Hamas, particularly areas hit hardest by the IDF.' However, the operation resumed in recent days after pausing under Palestinian pressure following Israeli strikes in the area. Senior figures in the camp reached agreements with the Palestinian Authority, which aims to tackle illegal arms and crime in a region plagued by weapons trade and money laundering. Still, terrorist Jenin Brigades members aligned with Islamic Jihad detonated two explosive charges against PA security vehicles on Monday. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: | Apple App Store: Israeli security sources reported that the Palestinian security forces arrested around 340 terrorists, eliminated 10 (including a senior figure described as the camp’s second-in-command) and seized 290 explosives, 23 car bombs and numerous drones intended for military use. Six Palestinian security personnel were killed and 59 armed terrorists were injured during the operation. Unlike IDF protocols, Palestinian forces adopted a different approach to homes used for shooting during clashes by torching them. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk11e8wtvye	2025-01-21T03:26:55-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/01/21/S1bjrWTw1x/S1bjrWTw1x_81_81_1230_693_0_small.jpg
