He's not a Netanyahu fan, but he doesn't threaten him either: Isr...	From his childhood in small village to his rise in Likud, Katz has seen both successes and setbacks; Critics say that Israel’s global standing has declined under his watch at a critical juncture; He brings experience from his time in the cabinet, but can a mere captain in the reserves handle a 7-front conflict? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Foreign Minister Israel Katz as the country's new defense minister Tuesday, replacing Yoav Gallant, who was dismissed for the second time in the current administration and in the middle of a war. This marks the most senior position Katz has held to date and one that could bolster his path to potential leadership, following his two terms as foreign minister and previous stints as finance, transportation, energy, agriculture and intelligence ministers. Katz, 69,has not been among Netanyahu's closest allies, yet he has shown loyalty in the current government, proving himself to be non-threatening in Netanyahu’s eyes. The prime minister likely believes that appointing Katz, a seasoned political figure, will alleviate public surprise and discontent over Gallant’s dismissal, as Gallant was widely seen as a competent defense minister with favorable ratings among Israelis. Netanyahu understood that an alternative appointment, such as Avi Dichter, might not receive public approval. Over the years, Katz has built a reputation as a political 'bulldozer,' especially during his tenure as transportation minister. However, in the past year, he faced significant criticism, particularly over the perceived decline in Israel’s international standing. Katz has since lowered his profile, focusing his efforts on consolidating his influence within the Likud party. From rural beginnings to the political summit Katz was born in Ashkelon in 1955 to Holocaust survivors from Romania who lost most of their families in concentration camps. He grew up in the farming community of Kfar Ahim, studied at the Or Etzion yeshiva, and served in the IDF paratroopers, reaching the rank of captain. As a student, Katz chaired the Hebrew University Student Association in Jerusalem, actively fighting what he and colleague Tzachi Hanegbi labeled as 'incitement and violence against Israel' by Arab students on campus. Their actions received media coverage calling them violent, with allegations that Katz disrupted gatherings of Arab students using iron chains and once took a microphone from a dean during a university debate, leading to a clash with Rector Gideon Shpitz. He was later charged in a disciplinary trial but acquitted. In March 1981, Katz locked the university's rector in his office as a protest, resulting in his suspension from school for one year. Rise through Likud Party ranks Early in his political career, Katz aligned with Ariel Sharon, establishing the 'Sharon Camp' in the Likud Party following the Lebanon War and Sharon's ousting as defense minister. Katz later became Sharon’s assistant at the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Since 1998, Katz has served in the Knesset, holding numerous influential roles. Twice, he was elected president of the Likud convention and twice as chairman of the Likud Secretariat, most recently in 2013, when he won by a landslide over Miri Regev. Katz remains in that role today. Achievements and unfulfilled plans Among Katz’s notable achievements is the 'Open Skies' agreement with the European Union in 2013, which made low-cost flights to Israel more accessible. He also proposed the 'Separation Plan' from Gaza, envisioning an international artificial island with a seaport and essential infrastructure linked to Gaza via a bridge. This plan, which aimed to lessen Israel's responsibility for Gaza's civilian life, did not materialize, and the status quo between Gaza and Israel remained. Katz also initiated the Regional Peace Rail Project. Foreign relations and controversy Katz was appointed acting foreign minister in February 2019 and later as permanent minister in May 2019. On his first day in the role, he sparked a diplomatic crisis with Poland, saying, 'Poles suckle antisemitism with their mothers' milk.' Navigating the pandemic as Finance Minister In May 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Katz was appointed finance minister. He authorized three lockdowns with limited financial support for businesses, resulting in the closure of around 70,000 small enterprises. Under Katz's leadership, the Ministry of Finance faced high-profile resignations, including the director of the Budget Department, the Accountant General, and the Ministry's CEO, all of whom criticized Katz's management. Foreign policy challenges Returning as foreign minister in early 2023, Katz faced challenges related to Israel's declining global standing. His term coincided with the Gaza conflict and the recognition of a Palestinian state by Spain, Norway and Ireland. Katz recalled Israel's ambassadors from these nations, escalating diplomatic tensions. He further declared UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres persona non grata and barred EU foreign minister Josep Borrell from visiting Israel. He publicly criticized Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, sharing AI-generated images of Erdoğan with Hamas leaders, which garnered millions of shares in Turkey. However, Katz’s term has also seen efforts to secure Israel’s international legitimacy, including pushing for a ceasefire contingent upon the release of hostages. Relationship with Netanyahu and questions surrounding the appointment Katz understands the dynamics with Netanyahu, leaving U.S. relations to Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer while focusing on the EU and the UN. Recently, Netanyahu has drawn Katz closer, inviting him into Israel’s wartime decision-making forum. Though Katz has experience as a member of the Security Cabinet, questions remain about whether a former IDF captain like Katz has the requisite experience to lead the Defense Ministry amid a multifront war. Some argue, however, that high-ranking military credentials have not guaranteed successful defense ministers, suggesting it may be time for a civilian leader less beholden to military norms. In the coming period, Netanyahu is expected to play a dual role as both foreign and defense minister, with Katz as a figurehead defense minister.

NY voters pass constitution change to protect abortion, trans rig...	New York voters have approved an amendment to the state's constitution barring discrimination based on things including 'gender identity' and 'pregnancy outcomes', changes supporters say will further protect transgender and abortion rights. Supporters and opponents disagreed sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1. It was fiercely opposed by conservatives who said it would enshrine a legal right for transgender athletes to play on girls' sports teams. The amendment adds language to the state constitution saying someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or 'reproductive health care and autonomy.' Previously, the constitution forbid discrimination based on race, creed or religion.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjewpud11yg	2024-11-05T18:09:39-08:00	
Chinese accounts boost Russian election disinformation	Russian disinformation aiming to reduce trust in the U.S. election received some last-minute help from China, according to research from the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. Investigators identified several videos linked to Russia that made false claims about voting. Some of the videos mimicked legitimate U.S. news outlets and featured fake audio clips of law enforcement officials supposedly acknowledging widespread voter fraud. The researchers found the videos were being amplified by a network of fake social media accounts that originated in China. The accounts had spread pro-China propaganda in the past and shifted their focus to the U.S. election only recently.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk2bhlu11yg	2024-11-05T18:03:45-08:00

NYT's 'The Needle' is back and predicting a Trump victory	The statistical tool that predicts the results of the US presidential election indicates an advantage for the Republican candidate in the battle for the presidency but Harris is expected to win the popular vote Four years ago, 'The Needle' feature of the New York Times was perhaps the main statistical tool for predicting the results of the elections, from the moment the votes began to be counted. Tonight, while in the various states the polling stations close one after the other and the counting begins - and with it the intermediate results that sometimes do not reflect what is expected in the end - the famous 'Needle' is back. Shortly after 4 a.m. on Wednesday, when, according to the interim result, Donald Trump had a large advantage over Kamala Harris in the number of electors the needle showed that Trump, at least for the moment, was on his way to victory in a close battle. According to the forecast currently appearing in the Times, Trump will win 281 electors and return to the White House, while the Democratic candidate Harris will win 257 electors. At least for now, the vice president is expected to win the majority of votes cast - almost a million more than Trump - but according to the American electoral system, this will not help her. The decision in the battle for the presidency will come down to seven key states: Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. These seven states 'equal' 93 electors; And if Harris wins in all the states that are considered blue - she needs 44 electors from those four states to become the first female president in the history of the United States. Trump needs 51 electors out of those 93 to become the first since the 19th century to win a non-consecutive second term.

Jordan has spent the run-up to the election campaigning for Republicans across the country. Many see his activities as a shadow race of sorts to become GOP leader, particularly if it loses the majority and members seek a fresh start. Jordan denies he's running for any leadership job. Jordan made an unsuccessful bid to become speaker when eight Republicans joined with Democrats in ousting then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Trump endorsed Jordan, but more centrist Republicans viewed him as too extreme and objected to rewarding someone on the party's right flank after some had helped oust McCarthy.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1oahs00bje	2024-11-05T16:58:19-08:00

Democrat Josh Stein won the North Carolina governor's race on Tuesday, Fox News projected, defeating Republican Mark Robinson, whose candidacy imploded following a CNN report that he had called himself a 'Black Nazi' and made other offensive remarks on a pornographic website. Robinson, the Southern state's lieutenant governor, has denied the allegations and filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN. Robinson was endorsed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who previously praised him as 'Martin Luther King on steroids' but whose campaign distanced itself after the scandal broke in September. Robinson advocated for bringing back slavery for some people and posted 'gratuitously sexual and lewd' posts on the site, CNN reported, comments the Republican has denied making. Stein, the state's attorney general, will be the first Jewish governor of North Carolina. He has said he will prioritize helping the western part of the state recover after Hurricane Helene devastated the region in September, and has proposed investing more in public education	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bymd6vubyx	2024-11-05T15:52:27-08:00

They described the move as 'bizarre and incomprehensible.' Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder emphasized Gallant's role as a reliable partner throughout his tenure as Israel's Defense Minister, reaffirming the U.S.'s unwavering commitment to Israel's security and continued collaboration with Gallant's successor. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council also acknowledged Gallant's contributions to Israel's defense and pledged ongoing cooperation with the incoming Defense Minister Israel Katz. New Hope party head Gideon Sa'ar is set to take over Katz's previous role as Foreign Minister. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of Gallant's dismissal and the ensuing cabinet reshuffle incited widespread protests including in the streets of Tel Aviv and the rest of the country and intense political debate. The dismissals prompted discussions among business leaders and the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) about potentially striking the economy on Wednesday. However, there were doubts about the feasibility of a broad strike, with many large union branches under the influence of the ruling Likud party. Some in the business sector expressed regret over past strikes against the prime minister's political actions, noting the lack of participation in recent strikes demanding the release of hostages. A senior economic figure told Ynet that a strike is unlikely at this juncture. In a media statement, Gallant attributed his dismissal to three key issues: 1) His firm stance on mandatory military service for all eligible individuals, which he deemed vital for Israel's security and future; 2) The urgency of securing the release of hostages held by Hamas, asserting it is achievable with IDF support; 3) The absence of a state inquiry into the October 7 massacre. Gallant stressed the importance of learning from both triumphs and failures, warning of ongoing challenges from Iran and its affiliates in the north. He vowed to defend the IDF from top to bottom, emphasizing its crucial role in safeguarding the nation.

Philadelphia DA contests Trump' claim of'massive cheating' in cit...	Ahead of poll closures in Pennsylvania, Trump said on his social media platform that there was 'talk about massive cheating in Philadelphia' and said law enforcement was on the way. He did not provide details, and there was no immediate indication of what he was referring to, and his spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment about what he meant. Election Day voting had proceeded relatively smoothly across Pennsylvania, with a few counties reporting problems with ballot tabulators. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner issued a statement responding to Trump's post, saying the only suggestion of cheating was coming from the Republican presidential nominee. 'There is no factual basis whatsoever within law enforcement to support this wild allegation,â' Krasner said.'We have invited complaints and allegations of improprieties all day. If Donald J. Trump has any facts to support his wild allegations, we want them now. Right now. We are not holding our breath.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1jnhmo11ye	2024-11-05T14:40:48-08:00	
Trump could torpedo Harris' victory in Congress: These are some U...	US elections polls reveal a tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, but the contest could also result in a decisive victory for one of the candidates; Here are the scenarios at play and Trump's expected behavior if he loses Polls in the U.S. elections indicate a tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with the candidates statistically tied in several battleground states that will determine the winner. Despite this deadlock, it's possible that one of the candidates could secure a decisive victory in a majority of those states, leading to a significant overall win. Several scenarios are at play: A narrow victory for Kamala Harris: This outcome could lead to the greatest tension. Trump may declare victory Tuesday night, even before official results confirm it, and he is unlikely to acknowledge a Harris win. Throughout his campaign, Trump has maintained that the only result he considers legitimate is his own victory. If Harris wins by a slim margin, it is anticipated that Trump's camp would file numerous lawsuits, ultimately bringing the matter before the Supreme Court. This is not unprecedented; In 2000, a slim conservative majority on the Supreme Court halted a recount in Florida, awarding the presidency to George W. Bush over Al Gore. Even if the legal challenges fail, the certification of the results will still need congressional approval on January 6. Prior to the events of January 6, 2021, this date was a symbolic celebration of American democracy, but the Capitol riot changed everything. If Democrats secure a majority in Congress, the certification process will likely proceed without issues. However, if Republicans retain control of the House, it is possible that House Speaker Mike Johnson could refuse to bring the certification to a vote. Trump has already hinted at a 'secret plan' with Johnson. A landslide victory for Harris: While Trump is unlikely to accept this outcome, the chances of him successfully contesting the results would be significantly lower. Any victory for Trump: In this case, Harris is expected to concede gracefully, regardless of the margin. As the sitting vice president, she would also sign the results on January 6.

Elon Musk is sued over $1 million election giveaway	Elon Musk was sued in a proposed class action on Tuesday by registered voters who signed his petition to support the Constitution for a chance to win his $1 million-a-day giveaway, and now claim it was a fraud. The complaint filed by Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty in the Austin, Texas federal court said Musk and his America PAC organization falsely induced voters to sign by claiming they would choose winners randomly, though they were predetermined. She also said the defendants profited from the giveaway by driving traffic and attention to Musk's X social media platform, and by collecting personal information such as her name, address and phone number that they could sell. McAferty sued one day after a Philadelphia judge denied a request by that city's district attorney Larry Krasner to end the giveaway, which Krasner called an illegal lottery. The world's richest person opened the giveaway to voters in seven battleground states who signed a petition to support free speech and gun rights. Tuesday's lawsuit seeks at least $5 million in damages for everyone who signed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy8dsqo11ke	2024-11-05T14:09:46-08:00

Massive vote turnout on Election Day goes smoothly, Trump promise...	Despite some concerns about irregularities regarding voting amid massive turnouts in early voting, reports suggest it has gone relatively smoothly, with few noticeable incidents; Donald Trump says he will accept a loss if it is 'fair election' After an election season marked by concerns over disinformation, foreign influence and worrisome threats to election workers and voting systems, Election Day unfolded relatively smoothly nationwide with only scattered disruptions and delays. Leading into Tuesday, more than 82 million Americans had already cast their ballots in a largely successful early voting period with high turnout despite some hiccups and frustrations in the presidential battleground of Pennsylvania. And when the final day of voting came, the problems that cropped up were 'largely expected routine and planned-for events,' said Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. She said the agency was not currently tracking any national, significant incidents impacting election security. Issues affecting voters on Tuesday included typical election mishaps, from a worker forgetting a key in Arizona’s largest county to an election judge failing to show up at the polls in Pennsylvania’s Allegheny County. Some precincts around the country faced issues with voter check-in processes and e-pollbooks, causing some delays for voters trying to cast ballots. Some areas had ballot printing mistakes and were printing new ballots and extending voting hours accordingly. Extreme weather across the midsection of the country also caused flooding and some other isolated problems, including knocking out power for at least one Missouri polling place that resorted to a generator to keep voting up and running. Still, in various states affected by rain, voters enthusiastically huddled under umbrellas as they lined up to cast their ballots, not deterred in a presidential election that many U.S. voters view as crucially important to the future of U.S. democracy. Congressional election updates: Senate, House control could be decided by handful of races In the western part of the key swing state of Pennsylvania, a few counties saw reports of issues with tabulator machines that scan and count paper ballots filled out by voters. A Pennsylvania state judge ordered polls to remain open for two extra hours in Cambria County, which voted 68% for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The county sought the extension after a software malfunction affected the ballot-scanning machines, though county officials said no one was turned away from the polls and all ballots would be counted. It was yet to be seen how the extension might affect vote-counting timelines in the tight battleground. In Georgia, another presidential swing state, fewer than a dozen precincts were set to stay open late because of delayed openings or evacuations due to alleged bomb threats that were found to be non-credible, according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. That included two precincts in Cobb County, which is northwest of Atlanta. They were staying open until 7:20 p.m. because they opened late due to equipment issues. The FBI on Tuesday afternoon said it was aware of multiple non-credible bomb threats to polling locations in several states and said many of them appeared to originate from Russian email domains. The massive early voting turnout before Tuesday — slightly more than half the total number of votes in the presidential election four years earlier — was driven partly by Republican voters, who cast early ballots at a higher rate than in recent previous elections after a campaign by Trump and the Republican National Committee to counter the Democrats’ longstanding advantage in the early vote. The early voting period faced minimal problems, even in western North Carolina, which was hammered last month by Hurricane Helene. State and local election officials, benefiting from changes made by the Republican-controlled legislature, pulled off a herculean effort to ensure residents could cast their ballots as they dealt with power outages, lack of water and washed out roads. That appeared to continue on Tuesday, with the North Carolina Board of Elections reporting no voting issues. Besides the hurricanes in North Carolina and Florida, the most worrisome disruptions to the election season so far were arson attacks that damaged ballots in two drop boxes near the Oregon-Washington border. Authorities there were still searching for the person responsible. The absence of any significant, widespread problems has not stopped Trump, the Republican nominee, or the RNC, which is now under his sway, from making numerous claims of fraud or election interference during the early voting period, a possible prelude to challenges after Election Day. Trump on Tuesday suggested he wouldn’t challenge the results of the election — as long as it’s 'fair' 'If it’s a fair elections, I’d be the first one to acknowledge' the results, Trump said, though what meets that definition wasn’t clear. A late effort by Republicans to challenge Atlanta-area election offices’ collection of mail ballots last weekend after early voting had ended was rejected as 'frivolous,' with Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge R. Stan Baker saying the GOP argument 'does not withstand even the most basic level of statutory review and reading comprehension.' Trump’s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, has urged voters not to fall for Trump’s tactic of casting doubt on elections. She was spending Tuesday afternoon turning out her own vote at a phone bank hosted by the Democratic National Committee, and said phone banking represents 'the best of who we are.' This is the first presidential vote since Trump lost to Joe Biden four years ago and began various attempts to circumvent the outcome and remain in power. That climaxed with the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to halt certification of the results after Trump told his supporters to 'fight like hell.' Even now, a solid majority of Republicans believe Trump’s lie that Biden was not legitimately elected, despite reviews, audits and recounts in the battleground states that all affirmed Biden’s win. Through four years of election lies and voting-related conspiracy theories, local election officials have faced harassment and even death threats. That has prompted high turnover and led to heightened security for election offices and polling sites that includes panic buttons and bullet-proof glass. While there have been no major reports of any malicious cyberactivity affecting election offices, foreign actors have been active in using fake social media profiles and websites to drum up partisan vitriol and disinformation. In the final weeks, U.S. intelligence officials have attributed to Russia multiple fake videos alleging election fraud in presidential swing states. On the eve of Election Day, officials issued a joint statement with federal law enforcement agencies warning that Russia in particular was ramping up its influence operations, including in ways that could incite violence, and likely would continue those efforts well after the votes had been cast. Jen Easterly, the nation’s top election security official, urged Americans to rely on state and local election officials for information about elections. 'This is especially important as we are in an election cycle with an unprecedented amount of disinformation, including disinformation being aggressively peddled and amplified by our foreign adversaries at a greater scale than ever before,' she said. 'We cannot allow our foreign adversaries to have a vote in our democracy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkytjzu111l	2024-11-05T13:51:01-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/15/r15pfn460/r15pfn460_0_0_1985_1361_0_small.jpg

How Israel's future ties with the U.S. hang on Tuesday’s vote	Experts say US election results could significantly change US-Israel elections, and how Biden will handle the region until inauguration The outcome of Tuesday’s U.S. elections could significantly alter the future of U.S.-Israel relations, predicts Dr. Eric Mandel, founder and director of the Middle East Political and Information Network (MEPIN). However, another critical question is how President Joe Biden will approach the Middle East from November 5 until the January 20 inauguration. In an interview with ILTV News, Mandel explained that if Vice President Kamala Harris secures victory, Biden is likely to seek stability in the region over the next three months. But if former President Donald Trump wins, the situation becomes less predictable. Biden has long identified as a strong supporter of Israel, even calling himself a 'Zionist.' Mandel suggested that Biden might want to solidify this legacy by supporting a resolution to the Iranian nuclear threat. Alternatively, Biden could follow a path similar to former President Barack Obama, whose administration endorsed UN Security Council Resolution 2334, declaring Israeli settlements beyond the Green Line illegal. However, Israelis shouldn’t assume that a Trump return to office on January 20 would bring the same policies or peace as during his first term, warns Bar-Ilan University Professor Eytan Gilboa. 'We know from history and the theory of presidential elections and behavior that a president in a second term is very different from a first term, especially in this case, where Trump lost the 2020 election and is now coming back in 2024,' he explained. 'Many things have happened, both in the United States and Israel. And so I think the expectation that the golden age of the first term will repeat itself is uncertain.' Gilboa advised Israel to 'prepare itself' for the possibility of a different Trump in office or a Harris presidency. He stressed that Israel needs 'a plan for how to deal with all kinds of constraints that the country is going to be under, primarily due to pressure from the progressive branch of the Democratic Party' if Harris wins. Under Biden, Gilboa explained, this progressive constituency was largely ignored. But Harris, who would seek re-election, may align more closely with this group, which he described as 'hostile to Israel and often antisemitic.' 'This would be a major challenge for the Israeli government,' Gilboa said. Watch the full episode of Insider here.

Harvard University must face narrowed lawsuit over antisemitism	A U.S. judge overseeing lawsuits accusing Harvard University of antisemitism on Tuesday narrowed but refused to dismiss a case by two advocacy groups accusing the Ivy League school of making it unbearable for Jewish students to study there. U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns said the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and Jewish Americans for Fairness in Education can pursue a hostile educational environment claim on behalf of students. The Boston-based judge dismissed claims that Harvard directly discriminated against Jewish and Israeli students, and retaliated against them for complaining about antisemitism. In August, Stearns refused to dismiss a related lawsuit by Jewish students who accused Harvard of letting its Cambridge, Massachusetts campus become a bastion of rampant antisemitism. Both lawsuits accused Harvard of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars federal funds recipients from allowing discrimination based on race, religion and national origin, and sought to stop further violations. Tuesday's decision primarily concerned Harvard's alleged mishandling of incidents from the spring and fall of 2023.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjfb00m00wyx	2024-11-05T13:12:14-08:00	
Election night: Trump vs. Harris showdown running down to the wir...	As US election campaign enters its final hours, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are locked in a fight for undecided voters, with polls showing a tight race in key battleground states; 82 million Americans have cast their ballots in early voting The U.S. presidential election unfolded against the backdrop of the ongoing Gaza war, which played a central role in the campaigns of both major parties. Candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump each emphasized their support for Israel while pledging to end the war. Supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are hoping for a Trump victory, fearing potential friction between Netanyahu and Harris if she wins. Trump's popularity remains high in Israel compared to the rest of the world, with billboards supporting him appearing in Tel Aviv, including one that paraphrased his campaign slogan: 'Make Israel Great Again.' U.S. Capitol Police arrested on Tuesday a man attempting to enter the Capitol Visitor Center carrying a flare gun and emitting a strong smell of gasoline. He was stopped during security checks, and an investigation has been opened. Donald Trump will watch the election results from his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, surrounded by a small group of family and friends, including tech billionaire Elon Musk. CNN reported that Trump’s campaign is discussing the timing of his departure from Mar-a-Lago to deliver a public statement. Campaign officials are preparing for a tight race against Kamala Harris, which, according to polls, could remain undecided by the end of the night. However, Trump expressed confidence earlier Tuesday, telling voters at a Florida polling station that he expects a large victory, claiming that the race against Harris 'won’t even be close.' The FBI issued a warning on Tuesday about three fake videos circulating online, falsely claiming to be from the bureau, which warn of terror threats and urge voters to avoid polling stations and vote remotely. Another video falsely claims the FBI is warning of vote rigging in prisons in several swing states. The U.S. presidential race is unfolding under the shadow of warnings from the American government about foreign interference, particularly from Russia, attempting to influence the election results. In recent months, U.S. intelligence agencies have cautioned the public about disinformation campaigns on social media aimed at undermining trust in American democracy.

US to test hypersonic nuclear missile on election night, report s...	US military to conduct routine test of unarmed Minuteman III ICBM from Vandenberg Space Force Base just hours after polls close; officials say test, scheduled years in advance, demonstrates nuclear readiness amid rising global tensions The U.S. military is set to conduct a test launch of an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) late Tuesday night, hours after polls close in the U.S. presidential election, the UK's Daily Mail reported. The missile is scheduled to launch between 11:01 p.m. and 5:01 a.m. Pacific Time from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base. Some Americans have raised concerns about the timing of the test coinciding with election day, but military officials emphasized that the launch is routine and was planned years in advance. The test is intended to demonstrate the readiness of U.S. nuclear forces and to maintain confidence in the country's nuclear deterrence, especially amid growing global tensions. The missile will travel 4,200 miles from California to Kwajalein Atoll in the North Pacific in approximately 22 minutes. Capable of reaching speeds over 15,000 mph, the ICBM can hit targets worldwide within 30 minutes of launch. The test comes amid rising fears of potential conflict with Russia and China, both seen as major threats to U.S. security. The Minuteman III is one of two types of nuclear missiles currently deployed by the U.S., alongside submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The Minuteman III has been in service for over 50 years but is set to be phased out by 2029, replaced by the LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM. The U.S. Air Force has said that the Sentinel system is a cost-effective solution for maintaining a secure land-based nuclear deterrent and is expected to remain in service through 2075. This test follows a similar launch conducted from Vandenberg in June. Col. Bryan Titus, vice commander of Space Launch Delta 30, described the test as a significant moment for the base, saying, 'These tests are vital not only for our national defense but also showcase the exceptional capabilities of our team.' The test also comes just days after North Korea reaffirmed its support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, and amid warnings from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the U.S. and Russia are on the brink of direct military conflict.

Outgoing defense minister expresses pride in Israel's recent military achievements but emphasizes need to learn from past mistakes, underscoring his commitment to national security Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, responding to his dismissal earlier Tuesday, said that he was fired due to disagreements with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on key security issues. In a special statement, Gallant said his firm stance that all Israeli youth must serve in the IDF, his push for the recovery of hostages, and his call for a national inquiry into the security failures that led to the events of the October 7 Hamas attack. 'There is no forgiveness for abandoning the hostages. We can bring them back,' Gallant stressed, while also highlighting his responsibility for both successes and failures during his tenure. 'My priorities have always been clear: the State of Israel, the IDF, and the defense establishment—only then comes my personal future,' he said. Gallant emphasized that his dismissal follows what he described as 'remarkable achievements' by the defense establishment. 'We struck in Gaza and Lebanon, eliminated terrorist leaders across the Middle East, and for the first time ever, delivered a precise, lethal and swift blow to Iran. I am proud of the defense establishment's accomplishments.' He also highlighted the importance of learning from past mistakes. 'I am responsible for the successes—but also for the failures and the pain,' he said. Gallant concluded by underscoring his unwavering support for the IDF and other security agencies, stating, 'I have not, and will not, allow any harm to come to the IDF, its commanders or its soldiers—from the highest ranks to the last soldier.' He urged political leaders to follow the moral compass of the defense establishment, saying, 'In times of darkness and uncertainty, we must navigate by our compass.' Gallant ended his statement with a salute to the fallen and their families. Gallant believed as recently as Monday in private conversations that Netanyahu would hesitate to fire him, not wanting to position himself as the moderate and pragmatic figure in an increasingly hardline Cabinet. Nevertheless, Gallant conveyed to those close to him a sense of satisfaction with how he managed the war, saying that he was at peace with himself and calling it 'the most important role of his life.' Netanyahu reportedly informed Gallant of his dismissal just 10 minutes before the public announcement. The meeting lasted only a few minutes, after which Gallant’s chief of staff arrived to collect the official dismissal letter. Gallant's associates were not surprised by the move, acknowledging that the decision to fire him had already been made in principle. However, they were caught off guard by the timing, which they believe is tied to both the daycare funding bill—a derivative of the draft exemption law for Haredi men, which Gallant strongly opposed—and a new security investigation involving events following the October 7 massacre, with a senior Netanyahu aide under scrutiny. They also believe the timing was influenced by the U.S. elections, claiming that 'Netanyahu thought the move would catch the protest movement off guard while everyone’s attention was focused on America.' Netanyahu had considered firing Gallant as early as September, intending to replace him with Minister Gideon Sa'ar, but the pager operation in Lebanon, which saw thousands of Hezbollah pagers explode simultaneously, thwarted the plan. Netanyahu realized that firing a defense minister on the eve of a war would be seen as irresponsible. The dismissal was delayed due to Israel's unprecedented air raid in Iran, and even now, Netanyahu is taking a calculated risk in removing Gallant ahead of a possible Iranian retaliation.

Sources close to PM suggest IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar next on the chopping block; 'We are not there yet,' says senior official close to Netanyahu Following the dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and his replacement by Israel Katz, sources close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested on Tuesday that additional changes in Israel's security leadership could be forthcoming. Netanyahu is reportedly considering replacing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar in the near future. However, a senior official close to Netanyahu said, 'We are not there yet,' but did not rule out such moves down the line. In a statement released shortly after Gallant's firing, Netanyahu said that while there had been productive cooperation in the early months of the war, significant differences in strategy had emerged between him and Gallant in recent months. 'At a time of war, full trust between the prime minister and the defense minister is critical,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, this trust has eroded, and attempts to bridge the gaps have failed.' He noted that the differences were not only made public in an 'unacceptable manner' but had also reached Israel's enemies, who had 'derived great benefit' from the situation. The prime minister announced that Foreign Minister Israel Katz will assume the role of defense minister. Gideon Sa'ar is set to take over as foreign minister. In response to his dismissal, Gallant issued a brief statement on X, writing, 'The security of the State of Israel has been and will always remain my life’s mission.'

IDF shifts tactics in Gaza offensive, causing higher Hamas casual...	Military says 1,000 Hamas terrorists killed in Jabaliya, with around 500 remaining alongside thousands of civilians; elite Ghost Unit using low-cost tech to target terrorists; 'Hamas booby-trapped 200 buildings, but only detonated two,' officials say Israeli forces have entered the second month of their prolonged operation in Jabaliya, in the northern third of the Gaza Strip, effectively placing the area under siege, the IDF confirmed Tuesday. During an overnight sniper operation, Givati, Kfir and 401st Brigade units eliminated around 50 Hamas terrorists near the city’s refugee camp. These casualties add to the roughly 1,000 Hamas terrorists killed since the operation began over a month and a half ago, according to figures from the 162nd Division leading the offensive. The IDF estimates that 500-600 terrorists remain entrenched within the core of Jabaliya’s refugee camp or in nearby towns such as Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, with some blending into the civilian population still present in the area. Meanwhile, of the approximately 70,000 Palestinians originally in the Jabaliya region, the IDF has managed to evacuate around 55,000 southward, mostly to Gaza City. The army continues to apply heavy pressure on those remaining, urging them to move south. 'There is no humanitarian aid reaching the besieged area,' an IDF official said. 'Jabaliya is collapsing, and we are neutralizing the remaining hundreds of terrorists. The enemy is on the run and resorting to guerrilla tactics to strike at us.' The IDF also addressed allegations of civilian casualties and the burning of a school in the area, denying any such incidents. 'We’ve investigated claims of mass civilian deaths and the burning of a school—these did not happen,' the army emphasized. Additionally, the IDF acknowledged the creation of a new cross-Gaza corridor that stretches from the northern border to the sea, effectively cutting the northern part of the Palestinian enclave off from Gaza City. The army is not ruling out maintaining a permanent presence along this corridor. Hundreds of booby-trapped buildings and elite Ghost Unit at work in Jabaliya Despite most residents having been evacuated, Israeli forces continue to face numerous challenges in their prolonged operation in Jabaliya, with explosive traps posing the greatest threat. Since the beginning of the raid, IDF forces have discovered over 200 booby-trapped buildings in the area. In two incidents, explosives were triggered inside homes, killing six soldiers—two from the Givati Brigade’s Shaked Battalion and four from the elite Ghost Unit. For the past several months, the Ghost Unit has been operating in Gaza as part of the 162nd Division’s special forces. Established in 2019 to develop and implement advanced combat techniques and technologies for IDF ground forces, the unit suffered the loss of its commander, Lt. Col. Roy Levy, who was killed in battle at Kibbutz Re’im on October 7. The unit, small in size with just a company and a half crossing into Gaza, faces the challenge of compensating for limited munitions. With resources diverted to the northern front in Lebanon, forces in Jabaliya have fewer munitions, D9 bulldozers and air support compared to earlier operations. To counter these shortages, Ghost fighters deploy large reconnaissance drones when unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are unavailable, providing continuous surveillance of the built-up areas for soldiers on the frontlines. In a recent operation, the unit identified and eliminated a group of terrorists attempting to ambush Givati forces. 'Instead of firing missiles from a Hermes 450 drone, we’ve killed dozens of terrorists using Iron Ball, a drone that drops simple fragmentation grenades on terrorists and tunnel shafts,' said Lt. Col. Y., commander of the Ghost Unit. According to him, the unit began using this weapon in January, and while it initially presented accuracy and safety challenges, the soldiers’ intelligence and professionalism have significantly improved its effectiveness. 'Now, IDF brigades are using Iron Ball in southern Lebanon as well,' he added. In recent days, the unit also eliminated 10 terrorists hiding in a building using two precision mortar bombs. 'These mortars are cheaper and more available than fighter jet bombs. We provide collection and fire capabilities that replace high-level operations, achieving more for less,' Lt. Col. Y. said. In addition to its impressive offensive capabilities, the Ghost Unit has also been developing methods to avoid triggering explosives, including identifying tripwires that activate traps. The terrorists, it was found, have been using simple pressure plates made of blinds with foam strips. 'We’re taking extra precautions before soldiers enter for searches, even converting old armored personnel carriers (APCs) for various autonomous uses without soldiers inside,' officials added. As the operation continues with no clear end in sight, commanders in the field are unsure how long they will need to remain in Jabaliya. 'In previous operations, we didn’t reach Hamas’ core areas here, but that’s what we’re doing now,' they explained. 'Hamas has surrounded these areas with large rings of booby traps, and in recent days, civilians have been killed by these devices. According to testimonies from hundreds of detainees, Hamas terrorists have also executed civilians who attempted to flee the city.'

Netanyahu dismisses Gallant, appoints Katz as defense minister	PM cites breakdown in trust as reason behind dismissal; 'At a time of war, full trust between the prime minister and the defense minister is critical,' he says, adding Israel's enemies 'derived great benefit' from situation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant Tuesday evening, citing a breakdown in trust during the country's ongoing war. In a statement, Netanyahu said that while there had been productive cooperation in the early months of the war, significant differences in strategy had emerged between him and Gallant in recent months. 'At a time of war, full trust between the prime minister and the defense minister is critical,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, this trust has eroded, and attempts to bridge the gaps have failed.' He noted that the differences were not only made public in an 'unacceptable manner' but had also reached Israel's enemies, who had 'derived great benefit' from the situation. The prime minister emphasized that while open debate is part of his decision-making process, the public nature of the trust issue had made it impossible to continue the current working relationship. 'This crisis has become public knowledge and prevents the proper management of the war effort,' Netanyahu said. He added that most members of the government and the Security Cabinet shared the same sentiment. Netanyahu announced that Israel Katz, the foreign minister and a veteran politician who previously served as finance and intelligence minister, would replace Gallant as defense minister. Describing Katz as a 'bulldozer' with a combination of 'responsibility and quiet determination,' Netanyahu praised his extensive experience and leadership, saying Katz was well-equipped to lead the defense effort during this critical period. Additionally, Netanyahu revealed that he had invited former Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar to join the coalition as foreign minister. Sa'ar, a longtime member of Israel's Security Cabinet, is seen as bringing valuable experience in policy and defense matters. Netanyahu expressed confidence that Sa'ar’s inclusion would strengthen the government and coalition stability, which he described as essential during wartime. 'I am convinced these steps will reinforce the government and the Cabinet, ensuring they work together in harmony for the security of Israel and the victory of the nation,' Netanyahu concluded.

Israel offers $5 million and safe passage for release of Hamas ho...	Netanyahu meets with hostage families and sets price for each released captive, offering safe passage for captors to third country as part of deal; sources say communication with mediators ongoing, hoping to reach deal while Biden still in office Israel has offered $5 million for the release of each hostage held by Hamas, along with safe passage for the captors to a third country, in a bid to secure their freedom, sources familiar with the matter said Tuesday. Officials are working to publicize the offer through various channels, hoping to incentivize those holding the hostages. Israeli officials also believe that a 'renewed momentum' for advancing a deal could emerge after the U.S. elections. The sources said that communication with mediators is ongoing, primarily to explore whether Hamas can be persuaded to soften its demands, which currently include ending the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Several options are reportedly on the table, including a limited initial deal (similar to Egypt's proposal), a phased agreement or a single comprehensive deal. However, all options face significant challenges. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held an extended assessment on the hostage situation Sunday night, with more talks expected in the coming days. Netanyahu also met with families of the hostages Monday evening. Officials anticipate that the U.S. election results will greatly impact negotiations, with President Joe Biden reportedly determined to finalize a deal before his term ends in January. The election outcome could influence mediators—Egypt and Qatar—as well as Hamas, as all parties seek to demonstrate their willingness to reach an agreement and end the war. 'There will be no deal right now' A senior member of the negotiating team for the hostage deal updated families this week, saying that Israel and Hamas have been unable to reach any agreement or compromise on ending the war in Gaza. 'There is someone to talk to, but nothing to talk about,' the official said, describing the current state of negotiations. 'There is a clear understanding within the defense establishment that the hostages will not be returned unless the war in Gaza ends, and right now, there is no willingness from the government to end the war.' Reports Monday from Jerusalem indicated significant pessimism regarding the negotiations. Hamas informed mediators that it refuses to agree to any deal short of a complete cessation of the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The terror group has effectively rejected proposals for smaller, more limited deals. 'The truth must be acknowledged—there will be no deal right now. Not a small one, not a big one, not even a partial one,' sources familiar with the matter said. 'The real question is whether the time has come to save the remaining hostages and end the war in Gaza. That is the entire discussion, and this is what’s happening behind the scenes. There will be no deal without a decision to end the war in Gaza. We must face the facts.' Despite this, the prevailing understanding in Jerusalem is that if Prime Minister Netanyahu opts for a deal tied to ending the war, his government would likely collapse, making such a scenario highly unlikely. There is speculation that Netanyahu may seek to link a major deal to normalization with Saudi Arabia, but that could take many months to materialize. In the meantime, the hostages, who are in constant danger, may not survive long enough for such an agreement to be reached. As the parties await the outcome of the U.S. elections—and its impact on the negotiations—former hostage survivor Maya Sham called on the next U.S. president, whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, to do everything in their power to secure the hostages' release. 'I came here to cry out to the world and to the world's greatest superpower, to demand that whoever is elected in the United States must do everything to release the hostages—not some, not a few. These are our brothers and sisters, suffering every day, every hour, with no one answering their cries,' Sham said at the 'Shurat HaDin' Conference on Combatting Antisemitism. The Hope Forum, representing some of the hostage families, welcomed the setting of a financial offer for the release of the hostages. 'The value of the hostages' lives outweighs the importance of strict justice, especially when it protects the lives of other Israeli citizens. We support this initiative and want to see all of our children brought home,' the forum said.

Knesset approves bill banning teachers who support terrorism, cut...	Terror supporters can no longer be teachers in Israel - it is regrettable that this took us nearly two years, but better late than never,' says bill sponsor MK Amit Halevi The Knesset on Tuesday approved a bill that would ban the employment of educators and cut funding to schools that express support for acts of terrorism or terrorist organizations. The bill, proposed by MKs Zvika Fogel (Otzma Yehudit) and Amit Halevi (Likud), passed with 55 votes in favor and 45 against. 'Terror supporters can no longer be teachers in Israel,' Halevi said. Under the legislation, the director-general of the Education Ministry will have the authority to summarily dismiss a public school teacher without prior notice if the teacher has been convicted of a serious security offense, terrorism-related crime or has publicly expressed support for an act of terror or called for one to take place. The director-general can also refuse to approve the hiring of such educators, with the decision subject to a hearing process. Additionally, the bill grants the education minister the power to reduce or revoke state funding for schools found to have expressed or supported acts of terror or terrorist organizations, if the school administration should have been aware of such activities. This decision would also be subject to a hearing. Presenting the bill to the Knesset, Education Committee Chairman MK Yosef Taieb (Shas) said, 'The purpose of this legislation is to eradicate support for and identification with terrorism within educational institutions in the Jewish state. The influence of such sentiments on students is deeply troubling. This bill is essential and has been carefully deliberated. We cannot allow teachers in Israel who support or align with acts of terrorism.' MK Fogel, who chairs the Knesset’s National Security Committee, added: 'Teachers are among the most influential figures on children and youth in Israeli schools. This bill aims to ensure that educators do not exploit their influence to encourage students to engage in terrorist activity and that schools do not condone such actions.' MK Halevi emphasized, 'Today, the Knesset is taking a crucial step in the fight against our enemies by targeting the strongest foundation of terrorism—education. Terror supporters can no longer serve as teachers in Israel, and schools that align with terrorism will have their funding revoked by the education minister. The law ensures that Israeli students will be educated in justice, science and compassion—not in terrorism, injustice and barbarism. It is regrettable that this took us nearly two years, but better late than never.'

Israel lauds new UK opposition leader as she appoints pro-Israel ...	Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the British government for stopping some export licenses to Israel One day after becoming the head of the UK’s opposition Conservative Party, newly elected leader Kemi Badenoch appointed a steadfast backer of the Israeli government, Priti Patel, as the party’s foreign affairs chief. Chris Newton, a former advisor on defense policy to the Conservative Party, stated that Badenoch appointed Patel a 'staunch supporter of Israel,' which was in line with the Conservative leader’s track record of strongly backing the country. Patel was forced to resign from her post as the international development secretary in 2017 for holding unofficial meetings with Israeli officials without the approval of the UK government. Newton believed Badenoch would 'amplify the party’s support for Israel' and expected her to criticize the Labour government for dropping the previous Conservative government’s plans to oppose the International Criminal Court’s request for arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Newton, however, cautioned that there would be some internal disputes over the UK’s positions on the war in Gaza. 'There’s a minority in the parliamentary party who are highly critical of Israel’s conduct of the war, and they will no doubt air their disagreements with Badenoch. But I don’t think this will affect the party’s overall position,' Newton warned in a message to The Media Line. The Israeli government has praised Badenoch, who has accused the Labour government of weak leadership over the war in Gaza and emboldening Iran. On platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Netanyahu congratulated Badenoch on Sunday, writing, 'I am sure she will continue the great tradition of Israeli-British partnership and friendship.' Foreign Minister Israel Katz also stated on X that Badenoch was a 'true friend of Israel.' After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in October, Badenoch wrote on X that the world is a better place without him, calling Sinwar a terrorist. 'Israel defended the peace-loving world in ridding humanity of this evil. Let us now work for the release of the remaining hostages and an end to the cycle of violence that has plagued the region. Sinwar’s death aids that noble pursuit,' her account stated. In September, she accused the Labour government of 'weak leadership' on Israel after the party suspended 30 arms export licenses, writing on X that 'it will have emboldened Iran' and undermined British national interests. She wrote in an op-ed for the British tabloid newspaper The Sun that the UK benefits from its security relationship with Israel, such as Israeli weapons protecting British personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq, and that intelligence from Israel has stopped and fought against Iranian-sponsored attacks and threats in the UK and Europe. 'When I was Business and Trade Secretary, I made a decision to maintain all existing licenses for arms exports to Israel. We had numerous protests outside my department. On one occasion, the building was stormed,' she wrote. Badenoch came under the spotlight in September when she stated that 'not all cultures are equally valid' when considering who can immigrate to the UK. In an article that month for the Sunday installment of The Daily Telegraph, she wrote that she was 'struck, for example, by the number of recent immigrants to the UK who hate Israel. That sentiment has no place here.' When questioned by journalists about who she was referring to, she insisted she did not mean all Muslims and said she had met many Muslims who love Israel. Following Badenoch’s Conservative Party leadership victory, the Conservative Friends of Israel stated on X: 'Thank you for your staunch support for Israel and the UK’s Jewish community during your time in Government and throughout the leadership contest. We look forward to continuing to work together to promote.'

US ultimatum to Israel nears, arms delivery at risk	Israeli officials say Biden administration looking for ways to act in accordance to law without withholding arms; believe chances of ban are higher with Harris in charge Israel will be required to respond to the severe letter sent by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, threatening an arms embargo on Israel, on November 14. The letter, sent to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer in October, presented an American ultimatum to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza or the Biden administration will activate the national security memorandum (NSM 20) and halt arms transfers to Israel in accordance with law. if Israel does not cease blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza within 30 days. According to the memorandum signed in March 2024, Israel committed to allow humanitarian aid to reach Gaza and to not interfere with international humanitarian efforts that the U.S. supports. The U.S. is also demanding that Israel allow International Red Cross visits to Palestinian prisoners and freeze legislation against UNRWA. Political sources said that the Blinken and Austin letter indicated that the Americans don’t want to punish Israel with an arms embargo but are seeking a solution to the severe humanitarian situation in northern Gaza — as they have done in previous letters, after which improvement was noted. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Dermer to draft a response on all issues. Israel now believes that the chances of a U.S. arms embargo are low but still present — if the U.S. State and Defense Departments conclude that Israel is still blocking humanitarian aid, they would be obligated to enforce the law and halt arms deliveries. U.S. state Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that while there has been some improvement, Israel still hasn’t done enough. He said the administration believed that the legislation severing ties with UNRWA, which angered the Americans, won’t help in avoiding the embargo. 'There’s about a week left until the deadline that Blinken and Austin set in their letter to Israel to increase the flow of aid to Gaza, and there’s still a lot more they need to do. The results are not good enough today,' Miller said. Political sources said that the likelihood of enforcing the law and imposing an embargo would be higher should U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris win the election. On the other hand, Trump — if elected — could lift the embargo on his first day in office in January 2025, should one be imposed by the Biden administration.

Chaos or military rule: Scenarios for replacing UNRWA in Gaza	Analysis: Israel's law banning UNRWA in the country leaves several options to replace the UN body in the Strip, including international bodies, Gazan clans and the Palestinian Authority Following Israel’s legislation banning UNRWA’s activity in the country, replacing the 13,000 employees of the UN organization in delivering humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza will be a challenge. The international community, the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israeli officials in the country are all considering alternatives as the 90-day period until UNRWA's activities become outlawed nears its end. According to Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), over 600 aid trucks are waiting to enter the Gaza Strip. Even now UNRWA is struggling to receive the aid and deliver it where it is needed due to the fighting between the IDF troops and Hamas terrorists, especially in northern Gaza Who could be an alternative UNRWA noted that Israeli authorities have encouraged many aid organizations to assist Gaza since the beginning of the war to take part in aid distribution but only a few have been able to operate. There’s a significant systemic failure on the ground, officials in UNRWA said. Many organizations distributed aid to their close associates. An example of this is the aid provided by the United Arab Emirates, managed by associates of a senior former Palestinian official Muhammad Dahlan. 'Most of the aid is sold in markets and not distributed properly,' one displaced Gazan told Ynet. 'There’s no law; Hamas and Dahlan's men are enjoying all the aid that enters while we, Gazans who are not affiliated with any faction, only receive leftovers.' The official page of the UAE aid operation in Gaza previously responded to the claims, saying, 'We oppose what some of the displaced are doing — selling tents and aid that we distributed to them.' The World Central Kitchen organization (WCK), whose seven employees were accidentally killed in an unintentional IDF strike in April, is also operating in the Strip in a limited capacity, running two main kitchens in Gaza and 65 additional community kitchens. It’s capacity, however, isn’t enough to feed the thousands of refugees in Gaza. Another organization considered smaller is the British Human Appeal, which distributes food packages. Most of its employees are Gaza residents. Another charity is the American Anera, which primarily distributes cooked meals to the displaced in Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis. Most of its employees are also residents of the Strip. The Turkish Islamic Relief Organization IHH is still operating in Gaza. Turkish volunteers and Gaza residents are involved in food distribution and assistance with shelter supplies throughout the Strip. Hamas criticized these international relief organizations at the beginning of the war, many of which asked their employees to leave the Strip immediately due to the real danger to their lives. In addition to the continuous aid entering Gaza, a coalition of six countries is regularly providing aid to the Strip via airdrops. Planes from Jordan, Egypt, the U.S., Belgium, the Netherlands and France are dropping aid, usually consisting of foodstuffs and ready-to-eat meals. This method has not proven effective, as a significant number of displaced individuals have been killed by the drops. Military rule Lawmakers in Jerusalem have previously instructed security officials to prepare for the possibility that IDF forces will need to distribute humanitarian aid to the residents of the Strip due to difficulties in its distribution. This option imposes a reality of establishing military law, which would require purchasing basic food products at a cost of NIS 5 billion ($1.3 billion) per year, while risking IDF soldiers in the process. Military officials aren’t enthusiastic about this possibility, but it remains as long as Israel doesn’t present an alternative to UNRWA and Hamas. It’s likely that significant international pressure will be exerted on Israel to avoid establishing military rule in the Gaza Strip. Israeli agreement with Gazan clans Israel has already developed a plan for postwar Gaza centered on cooperation with large clans and influential local families who will take part in governing the Strip. Contacts between Israel and the Gazan clans were already initiated at the beginning of the war, but they encountered many difficulties including threats from Hamas and the assassination of clan leaders. The Palestinian Authority Egypt, as a mediator supporting Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas's rule, has repeatedly invited the Fatah leadership to reach some framework for control over the Strip following the War. Cairo is counting on a national Palestinian agreement between Fatah and Hamas so that the Palestinian Authority can govern the Strip. Egypt hopes the PA’s rule will be able to oversee Gaza’s and aid distribution. Fatah and Hamas have yet to reach an agreement thus far. The Palestinian Authority wishes to regain control over the Strip in all respects, but it seems that Israel isn’t interested in this possibility, fearing Hamas might regain control over the area. While the PA is nearly collapsing economically, its leaders don’t rule out the possibility of returning to govern the Strip, potentially dismantling Hamas's rule via its security mechanisms currently operating in the West Bank.

Tuesdays top headlines: Israel on high alert as US votes, ends UN...	IDF says Israel is poised to meet any potential security challenge on Election Day What are Tuesday’s top headlines? On US Election Day, Israel is on high alert for a potential Iranian missile strike, possibly from an Iraqi proxy, following last month’s Israeli attack on Iran. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Israel Katz has announced Israel's formal exit from the 1967 UNRWA agreement, ending the agency’s operations in territories captured in the Six-Day War after a recent Knesset vote. In other news, the IDF has issued 7,000 additional draft notices to Ultra-Orthodox men, seeking to address recruitment shortfalls after a summer effort enlisted only 230 of the 3,000 Haredi men initially targeted.

US voters head to polls as turbulent campaign concludes	Either of the candidates would make history if they win, Harris as the first woman, Black woman, Asian woman president; Trump as first twice impeached, criminally indicted and former president to serve non-consecutive term The dizzying presidential contest between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris hurtled toward an uncertain finish on Tuesday as millions of Americans headed to the polls to choose between two sharply different visions for the country. A race whipsawed by unprecedented events - two assassination attempts against Trump, President Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal and Harris' rapid rise - remained too close to call, even after billions of dollars in spending and months of frenetic campaigning. Trump told rallygoers that the results should be announced by the end of the day on Tuesday. His campaign has suggested he may declare victory on election night even while millions of ballots have yet to be counted, just as he did four years ago. The former president has repeatedly said any defeat could only stem from widespread fraud, echoing his false claims from 2020. The winner may not be known for days if the margins in key states are as slim as expected. The real drama of the day will begin in the early morning hours on Wednesday, Israel time when the counting of the ballots in a number of key battle count states will begin. Network Pollsters will keep a close eye on the exit polls and decision desks will announce the winners of individual states as they are determined, giving electoral college votes to the candidates. No matter who wins the White House, history will be made. Harris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century. Opinion polls in the campaign's final days have shown the candidates running neck and neck in each of the seven states likely to determine the winner: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows a significant gender gap, with Harris leading among women by 12 percentage points and Trump winning among men by 7 percentage points. The contest reflects a deeply polarized nation whose divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race. Trump has employed increasingly dark and apocalyptic rhetoric on the campaign trail, while Harris has warned that a second Trump term would threaten the very underpinnings of American democracy. Control of both chambers of Congress is also up for grabs. Republicans have an easier path in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats are defending several seats in Republican-leaning states, while the House of Representatives looks like a toss-up. The candidates spent the final weekend barnstorming the swing states in search of every available vote. Trump staged his final rally on Monday evening in Grand Rapids, Michigan, while Harris held twin rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. More than 80 million Americans had already voted before Tuesday, either via mail or in person, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Dark Rhetoric During the campaign, Trump hammered first Biden and then Harris for their handling of the economy, which polls show is at the top of voters' concerns despite low unemployment and cooling inflation. But he showed a characteristic inability to stay on message, at one point questioning Harris' Black identity and vowing to protect women 'whether they like it or not.' His unbridled approach seemed designed to fire up his supporters, rather than expand his appeal. Even more than in 2016 and 2020, Trump has demonized immigrants who crossed the border illegally, falsely accusing them of fomenting a violent crime wave, and he has vowed to use the government to prosecute his political rivals. Polls show he has made some gains among Black and Latino voters, despite the historic nature of Harris' candidacy. Trump has often warned that migrants are taking jobs away from those constituencies. By contrast, Harris has tried to piece together a broader but challenging coalition of liberal Democrats, independents and disaffected moderate Republicans, describing Trump as too dangerous to elect. She campaigned on protecting reproductive rights, an issue that has galvanized women since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 eliminated a nationwide right to abortion. Harris has faced anger from many pro-Palestinian voters over the Biden administration's military and financial support for Israel's war in Gaza. While she has not previewed a shift in U.S. policy, she has said she will do everything possible to end the conflict. After Biden, 81, withdrew amid concerns about his age, Harris sought to turn the tables on Trump, pointing to his rambling rallies as evidence he is unfit. Her campaign's embrace of viral memes and a parade of celebrity endorsements gained her traction with young voters seen as a critical voting bloc. Trump countered the likes of Harris supporters Taylor Swift and Beyonce with Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who played an increasingly visible role as a surrogate and a top donor to Trump's cause. Tuesday's vote follows one of the most turbulent half-years in modern American politics. In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to a porn star. Four weeks later, Trump and Biden met for their only debate, where the incumbent president delivered a disastrous performance that supercharged voters' existing concerns about his mental acuity. In July, Trump narrowly escaped a would-be assassin's bullet at a Pennsylvania rally, just before the Republican National Convention. Barely a week later, Biden exited the race, bowing to pressure from Democratic leaders. Harris' entry into the race re-energized her party, and she raised more than $1 billion in less than three months while erasing Trump's lead over Biden in public polls.

Iran religious group recognizes Israel, causing outrage	Reformist assembly in Qom says the 'Zionist regime' should return to pre-1967 Six Day war borders and for a Palestinian state to be established alongside it A Muslim religious institution caused outrage in Iran after it called for a 2-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, thereby recognizing the Jewish state's right to exist. The Assembly of Lecturers and Scholars in Qom, a reformist group of religious clerics, issued a statement calling for 'the Zionist regime,' to return to 'the legal borders before the aggressions of 1967, and for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State.' Iran has never supported a 2-state solution opting to aspire to the annihilation of Israel. Tehran did not take part in a summit conference in Riyadh on a 2-state solution, with the participation of most countries in the region. In August, Iran's deputy president Mohammed Jawad Zarif was quoted as saying that the Iranian people are tired of a government that is more Palestinian than the Palestinians are themselves. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei prompted pushback in 2020 when he portrayed his future for Jerusalem to have Palestinian and Hezbollah troops guarding the holy Muslim site on the Temple Mount and pictures of the father of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khomeini, slain IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani and Hezbollah leader, since slain, Hassan Nasrallah. The caption read Palestine Will be Free' and 'The final solution – armed resistance until referendum' Following the expressions of outrage, the reformist group in Qom issued a second statement that was not a retraction but added a sentence referring to 'the despicable crimes of the Zionist state.' The group reiterated its opinion that the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel would end the violence and bloodshed.

Security expert: Iranians are on a ‘revenge mission’	Interview with former MK Ksenia Svetlova Iran is expected to launch an attack on Israel to demonstrate its strength and power, according to one security and political expert. Former Knesset member Ksenia Svetlova told ILTV News that 'the Iranians, by now, have their own score.' She explained that Iran is no longer solely focused on Hezbollah, Hamas, or on retaliating for Israel’s targeted assassinations of these proxies' leaders. 'Right now, this is about the survival of the Iranians,' Svetlova said. She added that if Israel signs a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah, there could be enough pressure on Iran to delay any attack, refrain from attacking, or at least conduct a milder response. However, she believes the Iranians are on a 'revenge mission.' 'Israel has to be very smart and strong about it,' Svetlova said. Iran previously attacked Israel in April and October, prompting Israeli retaliation. Most recently, Israel conducted 'precise strikes' on military targets in Iran. 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran,' Israel’s military spokesman Daniel Hagari said.

How invested are Israelis in the U.S. election?	Man on the street: ILTV asks Tel Avivians how they feel about the American election With the U.S. election kicking off in the United States on Tuesday, ILTV asked Tel Aviv residents for their opinions on former U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, and whether they even care about the outcome of the U.S. election. While opinions were divided between Trump and Harris supporters during interviews, a poll released Monday by the Israel Democracy Institute showed that Israelis predominantly support Trump. According to the survey, 65% of Israelis believe Trump would better serve Israel’s interests, compared to 13% who favor Vice President Kamala Harris, while another 15% see no difference.

Germany arrests 8 far-right activists plotting revolt	Suspects are part of a Saxonian militant antisemitic group training in warfare, planning ethnic cleansing, in future Nazi-inspired system, prosecution says German police have arrested eight suspected members of a right-wing militant group driven by racist ideology and conspiracy theories who had been training in warfare for the downfall of the modern German state, prosecutors said on Tuesday. The suspects are part of an organization formed no later than November 2020 called 'Saechsische Separatisten', or Saxonian Separatists, the federal prosecutor's office said in a statement. 'It is a militant group of 15 to 20 individuals whose ideology is characterized by racist, anti-Semitic and partially apocalyptic ideas,' the statement added. Convinced that Germany is nearing collapse, with the fall of government and society prophesied for an undetermined 'Day X', the group had been training to use force to establish a new system in the country's east inspired by National Socialism, according to investigators. 'If necessary, unwanted groups of people are supposed to be removed from the area by means of ethnic cleansing,' the statement said. Those arrested include four suspected founding members, identified as Joerg S., Joern S., Karl K. and Norman T. The suspects are part of an organization formed no later than November 2020 called 'Saechsische Separatisten', or Saxonian Separatists, the federal prosecutor's office said in a statement.

Expert: U.S. election unlikely to ‘dramatically’ influence Israel...	ILTV speaks with Prof. Zachi Shalom of Misgav Institute An Israeli expert on U.S.-Israel relations has suggested that the outcome of the U.S. election is unlikely to have any dramatic influence on Israeli policy, particularly regarding the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. 'When you look at what happened in the last year, there were ups and downs. Yes, there were disagreements and embarrassing moments,' admitted Prof. Zachi Shalom of the Misgav Institute. However, he added, 'you see that Israel has done what it wanted to do.' For example, while the United States opposed the entry of Israeli soldiers into Gaza, Israel proceeded. The U.S. also opposed the capture of Gaza hospitals, yet Israel captured them. America requested that Israel not enter Rafah, but Israel did. The U.S. further opposed an Israeli attack on Iran, which was ultimately carried out by American forces. 'I don’t belong to those who think there is going to be a dramatic change if the winner is going to be [former U.S. President Donald] Trump or [Vice President Kamala] Harris,' Shalom stated. 'It all depends on us, on our unity in Israel, on our resilience, on our standing, and on what we want to do.' Shalom expressed concern that the winning candidate might not secure a sufficient margin, leading to a contested outcome. 'The main problem in the United States is not who is going to win, but whether the other side will accept the outcome,' he explained. 'The question is whether [one side] will try to challenge the election by violent means.'

IDF can take only limited number of Haredi men, but economy needs...	Israeli-American David Hagar who invested in IDF's Haredi battalion says the military is already struggling with meeting the needs of ultra-Orthodox men who cannot serve with women; says the cost of a Haredi family to taxpayers is 1,7000 shekels each month David Hagar, an Israeli-American businessman who has been advocating for the Haredi draft says it is unrealistic to expect all ultra-Orthodox men of conscription age, would be able to serve in the IDF. In an interview with Ynet Hagar said the military already struggles to accommodate the Haredi soldiers among its troops, even in the one dedicated battalion set up to allow them to continue within the confines of their religious belief. 'You cannot believe the headache it causes the military,' he said. Every battalion must allocate soldiers for specific training that is held in mixed male and female groups and is often given by women soldiers,' he said adding that senior IDF officers told him the military would only be able to handle two more such battalions and no more. How many soldiers would two more battalions include? Between 1,000 and 1,200 only. How has the war changed the situation? After the war began, the IDF decided to establish a Haredi brigade and claimed it could absorb 3,000 ultra-Orthodox soldiers in the first year so not all Haredi men must enlist simply because the military cannot take them in. This is a more complex issue than how many are drafted and there must be equality among all sectors. Let's talk about the Haredi community. What has to change there? There is a change from the bottom up. I recently asked a prominent rabbi why Yeshiva heads don't tell men who do not study full-time, to go into the army and he told me those who do not study, should enlist, which is a major shift, But he also argued that no one can decide how many hours of study is enough to be considered a Yeshiva student. Some study 12-hour days others less. Hagar was among the people behind the establishment of the IDF's Haredi battalion and invested a great deal of money over the past 25 years, in the effort. He says he expected it to bring more ultra-Orthodox men to serve in the military. That money could have been invested elsewhere I used to sit with then chairman of the Israel Bank, Stanley Fischer and would tell him that I believed that within four decades, the burden on Israel's economy from Haredi's absence from the job market would require more taxes on the rest of the population. A Haredi family today costs the Israeli taxpayers some 17,000 shekels each month.	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sy4rpvdbyl	2024-11-05T01:20:02-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/23/BJ14iyau0/BJ14iyau0_0_289_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Macron is losing his way': Israeli companies display at Euronava...	Several Israeli companies manage to set up stalls in the prestigious arms exhibit following prolonged battle against government-issued ban overturned by French court; officials slam Macron's actions Israeli defense companies set up booths in the 2024 Euronaval exhibition, one of the largest events of naval arms manufacturing in the world held in France, after the Paris Commercial Court overturned a decision by the event to ban Israeli companies from participating. The significant drama surrounding Israel's participation in the exhibition was seen as yet another sign of the recently tense relationship with France. The French National Security and Defense Council, equivalent to Israel’s National Security Council, clarified on October 15 to the exhibition organizers that while it wasn’t boycotting Israel, it would refuse displays of Israeli products and companies. This decision followed a statement from French President Emmanuel Macron, who called 'to halt arms shipments used in fighting in Gaza.' Consequently, the council refused the display of arms involved in IDF operations in Lebanon or Gaza. The Manufacturers Association of Israel, Israel Shipyards and the France-Israel Chamber of Commerce petitioned the commercial court, which ruled that the Israelis could exhibit in Euronaval as 'commercial companies seeking to establish connections with others should not be discriminated against.' 'We analyzed the situation and decided to assume we could take part,' said Israel Shipyards CEO Eitan Zucker. 'Here we are.' The company showcased new missile boat models and patrol boats, designed for coastal defense in shallow waters and proven effective during the recent conflict. Some countries turned a cold shoulder to Israeli companies at the exhibition, though others displayed a friendly attitude. Representatives from Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which set up a booth in just two days, also reported growing interest. 'We developed cutting-edge systems during the war,' said Yoram Israeli, the company’s head of marketing. 'We’re engaged in asymmetric warfare against terrorist organizations that use both advanced weapons from major powers and items bought online. We’ve created solutions for both challenges, with weapons capable of targeting drones and gliders. It’s important for us to participate in this exhibition,' he added. Despite the successful appeal, two Israeli companies — Israel Aerospace Industries and Elbit Systems — chose not to set up booths. An exception was DSIT, one of the few Israeli companies permitted to exhibit even before the court ruling. 'We were hesitant; we didn’t want to be isolated here,' said DSIT’s vice president of marketing Amir Alon. DSIT sells underwater sonars for detecting divers and hostile vessels and they, too, feel the varying responses from different countries. 'Some companies are waiting for the dust to settle to resume work with us, while others recognize the proven value of our technology and come to visit,' Alon noted. Orbit had already faced a last-minute court ruling this year regarding the Eurosatory arms exhibition, which prevented it from setting up a booth in time. 'We decided to bring our equipment this time,' explained Orbit’s sales manager Aryeh Vered. 'We face challenges entering new markets in Scandinavian countries, but European companies we work with, like Italy’s Leonardo, are glad to see us here.' Israeli participation in the event wasn’t a given. After their legal victory at the Eurosatory fair, Israel and France prepared for another legal round. 'At the last fair, the appeal was filed a day before opening. This time, we heard rumors about a possible ban, but we couldn’t enter proceedings without an official statement,' explained Manufacturers Association of Israel chairman Ron Tomer. 'Fortunately, the document prohibiting Israel from setting up booths was leaked about two weeks before the fair. At that point, we began discussions with the official bodies, as there were procedures we needed to exhaust,' he added. 'We don’t accept the idea that Israelis can’t take place in exhibits anywhere in the world. Criticizing Israel is acceptable but creating a situation where France — a sovereign and friendly nation to Israel — denies it rights is unacceptable,' he said. Patrick Klugman, the lawyer who led the Israeli legal team for the petition, claimed he wasn’t sure of victory. 'At Eurosatory, the organizing company said it was under pressure from government policy but didn’t provide supporting evidence. The French were very embarrassed by the petition filed by pro-Palestinian organizations.' 'The situation was very different this time,' he explained. 'Euronaval complied with two decisions from the National Security and Defense Council. We knew it reflected Macron’s wishes. It’s very rare for the Grand Paris Area Commander to appear and ask the commercial court not to rule, as that essentially would mean the judiciary is criticizing a state decision. His presence suggests that they may see our appeal as a protest against the political decision.' Israel and France's next legal battle? Hugues du Plessis d'Agentre, the director of Sogena, which operates the exhibition, avoided expressing a clear stance on the issue. 'We’re always pleased that the Israelis, like all industries from around the world allied with France, can participate in the exhibition. There was a public dispute and that’s all behind us as far as we’re concerned and we’re very pleased,' he said. When asked about the company’s position on the issue, he continued to take a diplomatic approach. 'The delegations are invited by the government, not by us. Our position is to comply with the law. The government made a decision and we followed its instructions. The judicial system overturned the decision and we complied with the court’s ruling.' The next potential legal clash between Israel and France over participation in another arms exhibition is set to take place next summer, ahead of the Paris Air Show. 'It’s the world’s largest exhibition. We won’t allow ourselves to be boycotted,' Tomer clarified. 'I hope the French government understands this. If not, we’ll fight again.' Israel’s ambassador to France Joshua Zarka came to congratulate the Israeli participants and show support. 'It’s a sweet victory,' he told Ynet. 'The State of Israel supports the defense industry, which is integral to Israeli national security, and we must do everything as a nation to strengthen it. In our view, the decision to impose the ban was entirely mistaken.'

German police have arrested eight suspected members of a right-wing militant group driven by racist ideology and conspiracy theories who had been training in warfare for the downfall of the modern German state, prosecutors said on Tuesday. 'It is a militant group of 15 to 20 individuals whose ideology is characterized by racist, anti-Semitic and partially apocalyptic ideas,' the prosecution said in a statement.

Houthis turn to social media to raise funds for war	Iran's proxy tells the already impoverished population in Yemen that they can be partners in the path to victory; 'Fire your own missile,' a post reads Yemen's Houthi rebels have been campaigning on social media, to raise money for their fight against Israel. 'Be a partner in bringing victory, donate 100 Yemeni rials and help the missile force,' a Houthi post read. The rebels, who are part of the Iranian army of proxies and are mostly funded by Tehran, were appealing to supporters for donations despite the abject poverty of most of Yemen's population after years of civil war. Donations can be made either via telephone or through a dedicated bank account. 'Fire your own missile,' and 'Support the missile or drone forces,' are some of the slogans the Houthis were using in their posts. In one, they added a drawing of the Palestine missile, that the rebels claimed to have fired at Israel, made from coins. The appeals for cash are spread by a musical group of supporters of the Iran-backed rebels which releases songs to the web at a considerable pace. The group released songs about slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and slain Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. An official in Sanaa said some civilians in areas under Houthi control, where unemployment is high and poverty rates skyrocketed, oppose the rebels' attempt to raise funds at the expense of the population. He said that Houthi supporters follow the attacks on ships in the Red Sea with enthusiasm and believe their donations fund the rebels' military force. He said people give large sums of money, gold and even cars or weapons, which are a source of income for the Iran-proxies and help the terror business thrive. Hezbollah, Iran's largest and best-equipped and funded proxy, also raises money in addition to the funding from Tehran. The IDF has gone after Hezbollah's banks in an effort to stop the influx of cash that allows the terror group to re-arm and continue its war against Israel.

Border police uncover large sum of money in a routine inspection at a West Bank checkpoint arresting a suspect wanted for funding terror The IDF said on Tuesday that it killed two armed terrorists in a drone strike near the West Bank city of Jenin. Forces were conducting anti-terror raids on villages in the area overnight and in the morning hours, and according to Palestinian reports, at least two people were killed. Forces located explosives produced in the village of Tubas and detonated them while the operation continued. In a separate incident, Border Police forces found more than one million shekels in cash in a car belonging to a Palestinian resident of Hebron who was wanted on suspicion of funding terrorism. The man was stopped for a routine check at a checkpoint when the cash was discovered in his car.

Musk and X are epicenter of US election misinformation, experts s...	Musk's massive reach with nearly 203 million followers helps enable 'network effects' in which content on X can jump to other social media and messaging platforms False or misleading claims by billionaire Elon Musk about the U.S. election have amassed 2 billion views on social media platform X this year, according to a report by non-profit group Center for Countering Digital Hate. The platform is also playing a central role in enabling the spread of false information about the critical battleground states that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential race, election and misinformation experts said on Monday. A spokesperson for X said the company's Community Notes feature, which lets users add additional context to posts, is more effective at helping people identify misleading content than traditional warning flags on posts. Since taking over the company formerly known as Twitter, Musk has curtailed content moderation and laid off thousands of employees. He has thrown his support behind former President Donald Trump, who is locked in an exceptionally close race against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Musk's massive reach with nearly 203 million followers helps enable 'network effects' in which content on X can jump to other social media and messaging platforms such as Reddit and Telegram, said Kathleen Carley, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and expert on disinformation. 'X is a conduit from one platform to another,' she said. At least 87 of Musk's posts this year have promoted claims about the U.S. election that fact-checkers have rated as false or misleading, amassing 2 billion views, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate's report. In Pennsylvania, one of the seven key swing states, some X users have seized on instances of local election administrators flagging incomplete voter registration forms that would not be processed, falsely casting the events as examples of election interference, said Philip Hensley-Robin, Pennsylvania executive director at Common Cause, during a press briefing on Monday. Common Cause is a nonpartisan organization that promotes accountable government and voting rights. Some X accounts implied 'that there was voter fraud, when in fact, we know very clearly that election officials and election administrators in all of our counties were following the rules and â€¦ therefore only eligible voters are voting,' Hensley-Robin said. Cyabra, a firm that uses AI to detect online disinformation, said on Monday that an X account with 117,000 followers played a key role in helping spread a fake video purporting to show Pennsylvania mail-in ballots for Trump being destroyed. X's spokesperson said the platform took action against many accounts that shared the video.

Hezbollah launches a rocket attack on Acre, Haifa and surrounding...	Sirens activated in the early morning hours sending hundreds of thousands into shelters; IDF says a soldier suffered serious injuries in South Lebanon fighting Hezbollah fired a barrage of rockets and missiles at the coastal cities of Acre and Haifa and their surrounding areas on Tuesday, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis into shelters in the early morning hours. The attack came after a relatively quiet night with the last barrage targeting the Upper Galilee region including the northern city of Safed. The IDF said it intercepted a drone that crossed into Israeli territory across the Syrian border overnight. Residents of the Jezreel Valley region said they heard loud sounds of explosions likely from aerial defenses intercepting the incoming threats. According to the military two projectiles were shot down and emergency services said there were no immediate reports of injuries in the attack. The military said a soldier was badly hurt in the fighting in South Lebanon as the IDF continued its operation to uproot Hezbollah terrorists from the area, destroy its infrastructure and prevent it from attacking the Galilee.

IDF says 2 female soldiers attacked by settlers, US furious over ...	Security forces launch manhunt against Israeli assailants after targeting troops in West Bank; U.S.'s Miller seeks accountability from Israel on settler violence The IDF reported on Monday that 'several Israeli settlers attacked two female IDF soldiers at an illegal West Bank outpost. The soldiers received medical attention on the scene and the attackers fled, prompting security forces to launch a manhunt. The IDF condemns any violence against its soldiers and will continue working to maintain order in the West Bank.' Earlier, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller opened his daily briefing with a statement condemning Jewish settler violence in the West Bank. 'It is incidents like this in the past that led us to impose sanctions, and we certainly will be looking at this one, as we look at others to see if the government of Israel takes steps to impose accountability and if they don’t know [we’ll be looking at] what we might do on our end,' Miller said. 'It is critical that the government of Israel deter extremist settler violence and take measures to protect all communities from harm in accordance with its international obligations,' he added. During the night, unknown assailants reportedly set fire to at least 19 Palestinian vehicles in the city of al-Bireh, near Ramallah. Two buildings were also damaged and the police and Shin Bet have launched an investigation into the incident. According to local residents, the arson was carried out by 'armed settlers,' and the Palestinian Authority has called on the international community 'to pressure Israel to halt violations against Palestinians.' Miller noted, 'I have no new sanctions to announce today but incidents like these have prompted us to impose sanctions in the past. If the Israeli government doesn’t take steps to prosecute those responsible, we’ll consider what actions we can take on our end and we’ve made this clear to the Israeli government.' He also mentioned reports of 'extremist settlers setting 20 Palestinian cars on fire in the West Bank. When the owners attempted to extinguish the blaze, the settlers fired at them.' Miller added that the U.S. is very concerned by such incidents and similar reports of escalating violence from extremists in the West Bank, including attacks on people, vehicle arson, property damage, siccing dogs on individuals and preventing olive harvesting. ' These violent actions cause immense human suffering for Palestinians, they threaten Israel’s security, make the realization of a two-state solution more difficult, and undermine the prospects for peace and stability throughout the region,' he said. The U.S. has already imposed sanctions on settlers and organizations during the ongoing war for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, citing that Israel hasn’t done enough to enforce the law in these areas. The UK and the European Union have also joined in applying these sanctions.

UN General Assembly to discuss Israel's UNRWA ban	The informal session will include a briefing from UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini; initiative by Norway to seek ICJ opinion on Israel's move The UN General Assembly will discuss Israel's legislation severing ties with the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). The informal session will include a briefing from UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini. The Knesset voted to sever all ties with UNRWA last week and lift its privileges to operate in its territory after members of the organization were found to have participated in the Hamas atrocities during the October 7 massacre. The United States and European allies urged the government against approving the bill warning that the move could ultimately lead to Israel's removal from its membership in the United Nations because it would be violating the UN charter. The British government was considering further restrictions on arms sales to Israel in response to the legislation. On Monday State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the United States was concerned that ending UNRWA's role in Gaza would further hamper humanitarian efforts in the Strip that were already insufficient. 'We oppose that legislation and have serious concerns about the implications of its being fully implemented as well as our concerns about the underlying humanitarian situation in Gaza even before Israel legislated the bill,' Miller said. Foreign Minister Israel Katz informed the UN of the law that will come into effect in three months and said Israel was working to replace UNRWA with other humanitarian groups that do not have ties to terrorism. Officials in Jerusalem said they believed that countries wpi make adjustments to the delivery of aid into Gaza but would not say so openly, to avoid being seen as deserting UNRWA. Norway has been working to move the matter of UNRWA to the International Court of Justice in the Hague, for review and Israeli officials said other countries will take similar initiatives.

Israel can end Lebanon fight but no progress in sight for Gaza	Officials say ending the war may be the only way to save hostages because Hamas refuses any deal before war ends; U.S. says Israel cannot afford a perpetual fight in Gaza Officials involved in negotiations for a cease-fire in Lebanon said on Monday that there could be an agreement within the next two weeks but a decision must be made in Jerusalem. Israel and the U.S. made progress on the document that would be added to any cease-fire deal and would ensure Israel's freedom to operate militarily in South Lebanon, if the terms of the cease-fire are violated and measures are not taken in response. Lebanese MTV channel reported on Monday evening that US envoy Amos Hochstein and President Joe Biden's special ambassador Brett McGurk will return to the region next week. While there is some optimism that a cease-fire can be agreed on in Lebanon, there is much pessimism among Israeli officials that any progress to reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal with Hamas in Gaza has not taken place. Hamas said it rejected any proposal that did not include an Israeli withdrawal from all of the Gaza Strip and an end to the war. 'Truth must be told, there is no sliver of a deal. The question is whether now we must save the surviving hostages and end the war in Gaza,' officials said. 'We must face facts.' But observers in Jerusalem note that if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agrees to end the war, his coalition would fall, so he is not likely to choose that path. He may attempt to tie a cease-fire deal to the efforts to reach normalization with Saudi Arabia, but that would take months. The hostages are under constant threat and may not survive. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in his daily briefing to reporters that the administration would like to see an end to the war and is working toward that aim. Miller added that Israel was one side of the conflict and Hamas has continued to fight. Israel cannot afford - for many reasons, economically, diplomatically, in terms of its standing around the world to continue to fight a perpetual conflict in Gaza,' he said 'To get to a long-term stand you have to have a political path.' Officials in Israel were bracing for increased pressure from the U.S. to end the war, that will come soon after the elections on Tuesday. They believe that no matter who wins the race to the White House, the Biden administration will want to reach a deal that will end the war and free the hostages, as part of his legacy. If Trump is elected, Netanyahu may now want to give Biden the win with a deal in Lebanon and the release of the hostages. On the other hand, Trump also called for the war to end.

The Israeli vote could determine the US election,' former Israel...	Speaking to Ynet, former Israeli ambassador Michael Oren discusses upcoming Harris vs. Trump showdown, focusing on Muslim vote in Michigan, Jewish community's growing support for GOP candidate and ongoing challenges American Jews face regarding identity and perception Speaking to Ynet, former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren offered his analysis of the increasingly tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, predicting it will go down to the wire. While Trump appears to lead in most battleground states, Oren noted that his margin remains within the margin of error, leaving the contest too close to call and both candidates neck and neck as election day approaches. According to Oren, voter turnout will play a key role in determining the identity of the next president, with Trump relying on young male voters and Harris banking on female turnout. 'If the women come out, Harris has an advantage. If the men come out, Trump has an advantage,' Oren said. When asked about Trump's appearance at a Michigan rally where Arab supporters expressed concerns about the Palestinian issue, Oren downplayed the notion that this represented a policy shift. 'I think it's obvious he's going to go toward these voters,' Oren said. 'Keep in mind Arab and Muslim Americans are not just Arabs and Muslims, they are people who belong to the middle class. They have small businesses, and they like Trump. As for his economic policies, they also like Trump for his security policies.' He explained that while the Democratic Party has called for defunding the police, Trump has positioned himself as a strong supporter of law enforcement, a stance that resonates with many in these communities. Oren also pointed to a religious dimension. 'Many of these people are religiously observant. They see a Democratic Party which is increasingly atheist [and] in favor of abortion. For example, do you think that people who are religious Muslims are in favor of abortion? They may not be. This is why Trump is gaining, not only among Arab Americans and Muslim Americans. You go by a small margin, but certainly among African Americans, Black Americans and Latino Americans.' Addressing the Jewish vote, Oren acknowledged that American Jews have traditionally supported the Democratic Party based on values rather than economic interests. However, he suggested that this year could be different. 'In the past, close to 80% of American Jews have voted with the Democratic Party. This year, it's going to be less, not only because of Israel. It has to do with wokeism and political correctness and the difficulty Jews have getting ahead today because they're perceived as white and affluent and not as members of a minority,' Oren explained. While the Jewish vote may not shift the outcome in Democratic strongholds like New York, he said, it could prove decisive in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia. 'There are as many as 500,000 Israelis who have the right to vote in the U.S. election,' he said, highlighting the strong pro-Trump campaign in Israel, including a large billboard urging support for the Republican candidate along Ayalon Highway, one of the nation's main arteries. He pointed out that many Israeli voters are registered in key swing states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, and their votes could ultimately determine the election's outcome. 'The Israeli vote could determine this election,' Oren concluded.

Trump and Harris make final push before elections in rally blitz	Presidential candidate launch fierce battle for votes in final 24 hours before one of the tightest races seen in U.S. history; 78 million Americans place their votes so far The last full day of the 2024 U.S. elections campaign began on Monday, with the race for the White House tighter than ever. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are taking advantage of the hours before heading to the polls to make campaign stops in the swing states that will tip the balance, holding a blitz of rallies. Harris is spending Monday in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes offer the largest prize among the states expected to determine the Electoral College outcome. The vice president and Democratic nominee will visit working-class areas, including Allentown, and end with a late-night Philadelphia rally that includes Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey. Trump has four rallies in three states, beginning in Raleigh, North Carolina and stopping twice in Pennsylvania with events in Reading and Pittsburgh, both areas Harris is also visiting Monday. The Republican nominee and former president ends his campaign the way he ended the first two, with a late Monday night event in Grand Rapids, Michigan. There were plenty of empty seats at the J.S. Dorton Arena, a 5,000-seat venue with additional seating on the floor in the Raleigh arena where Trump was kicking of his campaign day. One attendee, Ebony Coots, said she regretted voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and is now backing Trump — but is nervous about Tuesday’s election. 'You know, actually, I might try to go to another planet,' Coots, a 48-year-old delivery driver, said if Harris were to win. About 78 million Americans already have voted early. Either result on Election Day will yield a historic outcome. First woman president or first felon president? A Trump victory would make him the first incoming president to have been indicted and convicted of a felony, after his hush-money trial in New York. He will gain the power to end other federal investigations pending against him. Trump would also become the second president in history to win non-consecutive White House terms, after Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century. Harris is vying to become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to reach the Oval Office — four years after she broke the same barriers in national office by becoming President Joe Biden’s second in command. The vice president ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden’s disastrous performance in a June debate set into motion his withdrawing from the race — one of a series of convulsions that have hit this year’s campaign. Trump survived by millimeters a would-be assassin’s bullet at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. His Secret Service detail foiled a second attempt in September when a gunman had set up a rifle as Trump golfed at one of his courses in Florida. Harris, 60, has played down the historic nature of her candidacy, which materialized only after the 81-year-old president ended his reelection bid after his June debate against the 78-year-old Trump accentuated questions about Biden’s age. Instead, Harris has pitched herself as a generational change, emphasized her support for abortion rights after the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision ending the constitutional right to abortion services, and regularly noted the former president’s role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Assembling a coalition ranging from progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney, Harris has called Trump a threat to democracy and late in the campaign even embraced the critique that Trump is accurately described as a ' fascist.' Heading into Monday, Harris has mostly stopped mentioning Trump. She is promising to solve problems and seek consensus, while sounding an almost exclusively optimistic tone reminiscent of her campaign’s opening days when she embraced 'the politics of joy' and the campaign theme 'Freedom.' 'From the very start, our campaign has not been about being against something, it is about being for something,' Harris said Sunday evening at Michigan State University. In Allentown, home to tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans, Harris will hold a rally with rapper Fat Joe before visiting a Puerto Rican restaurant in Reading with Ocasio-Cortez. Both Fat Joe, whose real name is Joseph Cartagena, and Ocasio-Cortez, are of Puerto Rican heritage. The stops come after a comic at a recent Donald Trump rally suggested that Puerto Rico was a 'floating island of garbage.' The former president, renewing his 'Make America Great Again' and 'America First' slogans, has made his hard-line approach to immigration and withering criticisms of Harris and Biden the anchors of his argument for a second administration. He’s hammered Democrats for an inflationary economy, and he’s pledged to lead an economic 'golden age,' end international conflicts and seal the U.S. southern border. But Trump also has veered often into grievances over being prosecuted after trying to overturn Biden’s victory and repeatedly denigrated the country he wants to lead again as a 'failed nation.' As recently as Sunday, he renewed his false claims that U.S. elections are rigged against him, mused about violence against journalists and said he ' shouldn’t have left' the White House in 2021 — dark turns that have overshadowed another anchor of his closing argument: 'Kamala broke it. I will fix it.' The election is likely to be decided across seven states. Trump won Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016 only to see them flip to Biden in 2020. North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada add the Sun Belt swath of the presidential battleground map. Trump won North Carolina twice and lost Nevada twice. He won Arizona and Georgia in 2016 but saw them slip to Democrats in 2020. Harris’ team has projected confidence in recent days, pointing to a large gender gap in early voting data and research showing late-deciding voters have broken her way. They also believe in the strength of their campaign infrastructure. This weekend, the Harris campaign had more than 90,000 volunteers helping turn out voters — and knocked on more than 3 million doors across the battleground states. Still, Harris aides have insisted she remains the underdog. Trump’s team has projected confidence, as well, arguing that the former president’s populist appeal will attract younger and working-class voters across racial and ethnic lines. The idea is that Trump can amass an atypical Republican coalition, even as other traditional GOP blocks — notably college-educated voters — become more Democratic.

Israel strikes Hezbollah intelligence site near Damascus, IDF say...	The compound includes an independent intelligence gathering, coordination, and assessment network; was under the command of Mahmoud Mohammed Shaheen and Hezbollah's Head of Intelligence, Hassan Ali al-Zaima both killed in Dahieh attacks The IDF said on Monday that it attacked a Hezbollah intelligence site near Damascus. The compound includes an independent intelligence gathering, coordination, and assessment network and was under the direct command of Hezbollah's Head of Intelligence, Hassan Ali al-Zaima who was assassinated in a strike on Beirut's Dahieh last September along with the designated leader of the terror group Hashem Safieddine. According to the military in that same strike, chief of Hezbollah's intelligence branch in Syria Mahmoud Mohammed Shaheen was also killed. Earlier Syrian state media reported an Israeli strike near the Sayyeda Zeinab area south of Damascus, home to an important Shiite sanctuary and guarded by pro-Iranian groups, including Hezbollah. 'According to initial reports, an Israeli aggression targeted the area around Sayyeda Zeinab,' the official SANA news agency said, without providing additional details. Three sites were targeted, Syrian radio said in a report. News outlet affiliated with the opposition said sources close to the Assad regime reported that at least two members of Hezbollah were killed and five others injured in the attack on a farm belonging to Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Sayeda Zeinab, a stronghold of the Iran-backed terror group and the site of a major Shi'ite shrine, has been targeted in previous strikes. Syrian and Western intelligence sources say Israeli attacks in Syria have killed numerous Hezbollah and pro-Iranian militia fighters based around the eastern outskirts of Damascus and to the south of the city. The sources say the neighborhood remains a target due to the presence of high-ranking militia leaders.

No UNRWA, no food in Gaza, residents fear	UNRWA officials warn of rampant chaos in the Strip if nothing is done to replace the UN body; Israel claims tapping alternatives are organizations with no link to terror, some already active in the area Gazans are concerned about the repercussions of Israel's decision to cancel its agreement with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). Efforts are underway to find alternatives or prevent the decision from being implemented. 'There's chaos, and food has almost completely run out. What should we do now? Die of hunger?' said a displaced person in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. UNRWA spokesperson Adnan Abu Hasna added, 'There's no substitute for the agency's operations.' In an interview with Ynet, Abu Hasna explained that attempts were made over the past year to introduce other organizations to replace UNRWA in the Strip, but according to him, 'these are small organizations that can't replace a massive institution like UNRWA, which has 13,000 employees and hundreds of facilities. No one can be a substitute for UNRWA logistically; therefore, chaos will ensue.' Data from Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) indicates that around 600 aid trucks are still waiting to be distributed in Gaza. The inability to maintain a steady distribution pace and a severe shortage of personnel in Gaza don’t bode well for the displaced population in the enclave. Abu Hasna noted that various aid organizations have operated in the area throughout the year, but their smaller scale has hindered them from keeping up with demand. One of these organizations is 'al-Sahm al-Shahim,' staffed by associates of Palestinian politician Mohammed Dahlan. However, criticism against the organization has recently sounded in Gaza. 'They're discriminatory in distributing aid and medical supplies,' said one of the displaced. 'There are already alternatives to UNRWA present,' Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in response to UNRWA's claims that no aid alternative exists in the Strip. 'Other international aid organizations aren’t involved in terrorist activities.' He stressed that Israel 'is committed to international law and will continue to uphold it, while ensuring the safety of its citizens.' 'Despite extensive evidence presented to the UN showing that UNRWA employees participated in the October 7 massacre and that many of them are Hamas terrorists, the UN has ignored this and taken no action in the matter,' he added. The Palestinian Authority has also expressed concern, with presidential spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh having accused Israel of 'disregarding all international norms, conventions, resolutions and international humanitarian law.' 'Israel continues its campaign against UNRWA to disregard the refugee issue, cancel the right of return and obstruct its operations and mandate,' he added. 'The world must take serious and concrete actions against Israel. This decision by the Israeli government is very dangerous.' Meanwhile, the agency is expected to continue operating in Gaza according to UNRWA's official website and providing services to Palestinian refugees 'until a fair and lasting solution to their issue is found.' The agency noted that the responsibility to assist in finding this solution lies with the international community.

Echoes of 1979: Iran’s influence over hostility on U.S. soil, fai...	Comment: ‘The world hasn’t learned its lesson’ The Islamic regime in Iran threatening the United States is nothing new. In fact, it's been a hallmark of the government since its inception. In 1979, the regime's entire identity was founded upon a fanatic, genocidal hatred of Israel, the little Satan and the United States, the great Satan, both of which they routinely called to eradicate, going back to 45 years ago today, when a radicalized mob of student Islamic revolutionaries attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and began the start of the Iranian hostage crisis, taking 53 American diplomats and staff hostage for 444 days. This violation of international law had the full backing and endorsement of Ayatollah Khomeini, who had come to power in part thanks to the appeasement of the US administration at the time, who refused to support the Shah of Iran. Sensing American weakness, the Ayatollah used the hostage crisis for over a year to create a narrative that incites against the West, all while innocent Americans were being held hostage in inhumane conditions. Sadly, it seems the world hasn't learned the lessons of this tragic event, as we are still dealing with the same problems today, whether it be violent student protests, policies of appeasement or ongoing hostage crises. Since October 7, Western campuses have become a battleground, with students conducting violent antisemitic protests, waving flags of terror groups, burning American flags and even hijacking buildings and taking hostages. This is not a coincidence. What we're seeing is straight from the playbook of the Islamist Communist Alliance, which we saw destroy Iran in 1979. In fact, the US government has confirmed some of these recent anti-Israel protests have even been funded by the regime in Iran. Yet, instead of administrators or law enforcement taking a zero-tolerance approach, we've seen them make every possible excuse not to shut down this blatant hate speech on a national scale. The Biden administration has promoted a policy of appeasement with Iran, giving the regime billions for hostages, incentivizing kidnappings, failing to enforce sanctions, allowing the regime an estimated $122 billion in oil revenue since 2021 and freeing up $16 billion In frozen regime assets. And what has that yielded? Executions have skyrocketed in Iran. Iranian oil exports and military expenditures, including terror proxy funding, have more than doubled since the Trump administration. The regime's nuclear program has advanced at unprecedented levels, with 20% and 60% uranium enrichment at record levels. Finally, for over a year, Hamas, a proxy of the regime in Iran, has been holding American and Israeli citizens hostage. At the same time, the Biden administration's policies have enabled the funding of these very same terror proxies, the same way the Islamist revolutionaries held Americans hostage in brutal, dehumanizing conditions. So, too, today, we see the proxies of the regime doing as the Islamic Republic of Iran taught them. It's been 45 years, and history is repeating itself because of bad US policy on Iran. The only difference now is that Iran is on the cusp of a nuclear weapon, and the campus riots are starting on US soil. We can't afford not to act. American democratic values are at risk, and they cannot be defended by policies of appeasement. You don't stand up to a bully by giving him billions of dollars and asking him nicely to stop. You stand up to a bully by punching him in the face. The Islamic Republic of Iran will only stop its campaign of terrorism when they're forced to.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjqib00lwjg	2024-11-04T07:20:24-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/04/01/S1lNkp9dJA/S1lNkp9dJA_0_0_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

German's AfD leader's familial Nazi past, revealed	Alice Weidel's grandfather served as military judge in Nazi occupied Warsaw claimed no knowledge of SS crimes of murder of Jews; An investigative report published in Germany over the weekend revealed the Nazi familial past of Alice Wiedel leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany Party (AfD). Her grandfather Hans Wiedel served as a military judge in Nazi-occupied Warsaw during the Holocaust. The avid Nazi joined the party in 1932 and served in the SS, a family history Weidel failed to divulge during her ascent to the leadership of her party. She and AfD urged Germany to move on from what the party calls a 'cult of shame' over its Nazi-era atrocities. According to the report, Weidel's Nazi grandfather was investigated after the war for his involvement in the execution of 20,000 opponents of the Nazis but the investigations were dropped, because of insufficient documentary evidence. He claimed he did not know about the atrocities committed by the SS or the mass extermination of Jews. After the war Hans Wiedel opened a law office which was mostly preoccupied by his efforts to receive compensation for his lost property in Upper Silesia. Weidel said she was six years old when her grandfather died and did not know him or about his involvement with the Nazi regime. 'Because of a family feud we did not have any contact with my grandfather,' she said. 'He was never a subject of discussion in my family.' Many Germans of Wiedel's generation have relatives who were Nazis but Weidel has become the co-leader of a political party that was trying to erase the past and some of its senior members were the children or grandchildren of Nazis. Bjorn Hocke, even described a Holocaust memorial as a 'monument of shame' calling for a reversal of Germany's approach to remembrance. After succeeding in the elections in three German federal states in the east of the country in September the AfD was no set to establish its position in the federal elections next year. The latest revelations may not lessen support for Wiedel or the Afd.

Iran plots to assassinate Nevatim airbase commander	Brigadier General Yotam Sigler along with his family, is placed under security protection after a spy-cell made up of immigrants from Azerbaijan, operating on behalf of Iranian intelligence is uncovered Iran plotted to assassinate the commander of Nevatim airbase, according to a report in the Iranian opposition outlet, Iran International, on Monday. According to the report, Brigadier General Yotam Sigler has been put under security protection. The outlet cited a security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, who said that such security measures were typically reserved for high-threat individuals, akin to IDF Chief of Staff or Air Force Commander. However, due to recent developments, both Sigler and his family are now under protection. Additional security for Brigadier General Sigler was put in place after uncovering that he was a target within the broader scheme involving Israeli nationals returning from Azerbaijan. These individuals were allegedly operating as part of an Iranian-directed spy cell and were apprehended last month. The source said that those under threat usually undergo comprehensive security evaluations, including assessments of their family's online exposure. Sigler's position makes him a priority target for Iran due to the strategic importance of Nevatim Airbase, which serves not only as a hub for combat operations but also as a crucial intelligence and strategic asset.

Watch: Nazareth crime ring arrested at wedding after high-speed p...	Father and son indicted for opening fire at multiple locations in city before fleeing from police; one suspect apprehended while hiding at wedding; new footage reveals escape route; police seize pistol and grenades Surveillance footage released Monday has provided critical evidence in a series of shooting incidents in Nazareth, leading to the indictment of a father and his son. The two are accused of multiple shooting events and illegal possession of fragmentation grenades. The investigation began after Northern District officers and Border Police responded to reports of gunfire targeting a business and a residential property. Authorities tracked a fleeing scooter, sparking a pursuit that ended when the suspect abandoned the vehicle and sought refuge under a table at a wedding venue. Police arrested the suspect and recovered a discarded Glock pistol along the escape route. A subsequent search of the suspect's home led to the discovery of five fragmentation grenades, and the arrest of the suspect's father and another son. Witnesses near the wedding venue supported the arrests. 'It’s good he was caught immediately,' one said, noting that the police action disrupted the wedding but likely prevented a potential murder. Indictments have now been filed against the father and one son, while the other was released due to lack of evidence. The police statement indicated: 'Around 10:00 PM yesterday, Northern District officers were conducting operations in Arraba as part of efforts to prevent shooting incidents in the Arab community. During the operation, forces observed gunfire aimed at a business. Officers engaged and fired at the armed suspects, who, while fleeing, returned fire at the officers. Additional police units were dispatched, initiating a broad search for the suspects. Shortly after, the suspects' vehicle was located nearby, engulfed in flames.' Northern District Commander Superintendent Meir Eliyahu visited the scene and ordered the formation of a special investigation team. Six suspects were arrested overnight on suspicion of involvement, with further arrests anticipated. Eliyahu praised the officers' response: 'The officers' decisive engagement and bravery are commendable. In incidents where officers are targeted, the criminal assumes full responsibility for the consequences, and we will apprehend him, either during the incident or subsequently.' In a related event, police released footage from a shootout in Arraba, Lower Galilee, where armed suspects fired long guns at officers. No injuries were reported, and police are investigating the incident with aerial support.

Sky wars: Hezbollah's drone tactics push Israeli defense systems ...	Terror group's evolving use of drones challenges Israeli defenses, spurring swift deployment of advanced interception tech; recent incidents, like a drone downed near Binyamina, highlight urgent need for stronger airspace security and military response For 34 minutes last Saturday, fighter jets and helicopters escorted a Hezbollah drone until it was shot down. The drone crossed the border over Shlomi in the Western Galilee and continued flying unchallenged over Nahariya, Acre and Haifa, reaching open land near Binyamina. Once possible, reservist Major A., an Apache helicopter pilot from the 190th Squadron, locked onto it with his sight and fired a barrage of shells. The incident concluded within seconds. Civilians who witnessed the successful interception from the ground immediately uploaded footage to social media. Moments later, the message 'The incident has concluded' reached hundreds of thousands of Israelis who had taken shelter. 'We followed it for a long time,' Major A. recounted to Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. 'We waited for a moment when we could ensure that the helicopter's cannon shells wouldn't hit civilians, houses or cars below us. I saw there were clear fields and brought it down.' Tension in the cockpit and on the radio was high, with every second being critical. Decisions had to be made quickly. In the control room of the Air Force command and the Apache squadron dispatched for the mission, there was a strong desire to prevent the 'enemy aircraft intrusion' alert, which had turned many areas red, from ending in disaster. Last month, in the same area, a drone exploded at a Golani training base near Binyamina without warning, killing four soldiers and injuring dozens. On Sunday, a missile boat intercepted a drone over the sea off the coast of Caesarea. Since the outbreak of the war, Hezbollah has been launching drones toward Israel almost daily. These aircraft can sometimes evade air defense systems more easily, as they are not adequately prepared for the threat. In over a year of war, Israel has been attacked by drones from Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Lebanon. Suicide drones targeting specific locations are harder to intercept for various reasons: their small size, flight path and sometimes low altitude. Additionally, they are often launched from locations near the border, significantly reducing the response time for air defense systems. Israel’s air defense array is designed to detect, track and intercept hostile aircraft before they cross the border. The system issues warnings and follows the aircraft until they can be neutralized. Key to this process is the time the IDF has to intercept the target, which varies depending on whether it's heading toward a military base in the Western Galilee, a defense facility or a high-profile location like the prime minister’s residence in Caesarea. Each target presents a different operational window for a successful interception. According to the Air Force, about 1,300 drones have been launched toward Israel from all fronts since the war began. Of these, 231 hit the ground. This means that approximately 82% were successfully intercepted. The military is trying to target the source of the drone launches, Hezbollah's secretive air Unit 127. Despite the elimination of its commander, Mohammad Sarour, in a strike in Beirut's Dahieh district at the end of September, it has relatively retained its strength—only about ten percent of the terrorists in the unit have been killed so far. According to IDF, Hezbollah retains about 30% of its drone arsenal, with the majority destroyed in strikes on warehouses and launch sites. Returning to the drama over Binyamina's skies, seconds before the cheers of residents who documented the chase and did not heed defense instructions. In the Air Force's control unit sat Major N., the air controller who led the mission to shoot down the drone. 'We scrambled fighter jets and helicopters at it and waited for an interception opportunity,' he described. However, the Air Force admits that in reality, they still fail to intercept a significant portion of the drones. Fortunately, many such offensive aircraft miss their intended targets and fall in open areas or collide with objects, such as the residential tower in Nahariya in September and a suspension bridge in the city last week. Civilian limitations These are usually relatively small aircraft, weighing as little as 7-9 lbs. and flying slowly. In many cases, they appear on radar systems like birds, cars or clouds. Alongside sky observers recently deployed along the borders, parallel systems are activated in an attempt to detect any launch of such an aircraft and shoot it down before it crosses the border. The assessment of whether the response to destroy the threat will come from the Iron Dome, aircraft or attack helicopters is done quickly. 'Every weapon system has proximity limitations to certain sites,' explained Major N. 'We also need to protect civilians from the munitions. 'In the year of fighting, we've undergone a rapid evolution in dealing with drones. We started with detection gaps, not seeing all threats in time. Sometimes we didn't even know how to alert them. We acquired dozens of detection and warning systems, and today we can see more than 90% of the threats. The interception rate stands at about 70% of them.' The new systems can quickly determine whether the incoming object is a bird, for example, and if there's any doubt about the type of alert received. Within moments, fighter jets are sent skyward, and pilots are called to locate and identify who stands before them with their eyes. 'Every month, there's a new means to improve interceptions and defense systems,' said Major N. 'Our situation is much better now. Initially, it took us minutes to launch the first interceptor missile. Today, a missile is already launched at it within a second.' Major (res.) Y. is an F-16 pilot in the veteran 101st Squadron, and his family was evacuated from Kibbutz Yiftach on the Lebanese border. Over the past year, he has participated in dozens of sorties across various fronts. Major Y. says the required response from him and his colleagues against the new threat is immediate. For example, last month, he was scrambled in the middle of the night from sleep, boarded a plane and flew toward the mission defined for him. Within minutes, the airborne threat was destroyed, even before crossing the border. In his view, 'The main challenge is finding an appropriate opportunity to intercept it without causing more significant damage than the device itself can inflict.' In the nick of time Air battles against drones can be seen in the north almost daily, in pursuits that usually end with an interception. Major Y. says that downing the aircraft is often more challenging than any other task. 'We have a lot of power and maneuverability in fighter jets,' he explained, 'but it's tough to detect and shoot down these small devices. It's like looking for an ant on the road while you're on a fast motorcycle. A fighter jet is designed to engage large aerial targets and attack ground targets. But we still manage to provide a satisfactory response to these aircraft as well.' Major Y. does not reveal where the drone he intercepted in the air chase about last month originated. 'Its route was relatively clear—on its way to one of the big cities,' he noted. 'You know that if you don't shoot it down, there's a chance it will cause damage. It's more stressful than attacking in Lebanon, which you do from an altitude of 30,000 feet. Minutes earlier, I woke up from the siren and the scramble for action. While shaking off the throes of sleep, you must organize for interception, identify the device and reach a certain altitude. At the last second, you press the button and launch a missile at it.' The 101st Squadron boasts the highest number of enemy aircraft downed in Israel's wars—161 enemy planes. The Air Force has not engaged in air-to-air combat in recent decades, and no additional decorations have been added to the squadron's illustrious wall of downings. It is conceivable that the pilots may now lay the foundation for a new wall marking drone downings. 'True, it's not a fighter jet but another attacking aircraft, but in practice, we are here to defend the nation's skies. It doesn't matter what the threat is or its size—the main thing is to shoot it down,' said Major Y. Assessment: Prime Minister's residence could be targeted again Meanwhile, about two weeks after a drone hit the residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea, another attempt to hit the location was apparently made on Sunday. From the investigation of the drone attack, it appears that at 5:30 PM, two drones were launched simultaneously. One exploded in an open area near Elyakim, causing no damage or injuries, while the second target was intercepted by the Navy before it crossed into Israeli territory. The combined drone formation was likely on its way to the prime minister's residence in Caesarea, and the unit responsible for personnel security was updated on the event and instructed to take defensive measures. IDF identified the drone launches and their flight path. Northern Command updated the security coordinators in the frontline communities, indicating that the increased fire from Lebanon, both rockets and drones, is expected to continue—across and deep into the entire sector.

Netanyahu urges justice minister to find 'solution to 'adversaria...	Ministers accuse Gali Baharav-Miara of obstructing government decisions; Ben-Gvir says she opposes 'every good thing'; Communications Minister Karhi calls for her dismissal Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday called on Justice Minister Yariv Levin to devise a 'solution' regarding Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, whom he described as 'adversarial' to the government. The request followed a call by Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi during a Cabinet meeting to dismiss the attorney general. The discussion arose while ministers were debating the appointment of a new Civil Service commissioner. Several ministers criticized the attorney general’s legal opinions, accusing her of obstructing government decisions. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir claimed Baharav-Miara opposed 'every good thing,' citing her stance on prison overcrowding. Minister David Amsalem added that 'everything is halted by her.' Karhi suggested firing Baharav-Miara, with Amsalem further blaming her and Deputy Attorney General Gil Limon. 'This is adversarial legal advice,' Netanyahu then remarked. 'We saw what was approved under the previous government—illegal gas agreements, appointments during a transitional government. We can't work like this. I’m asking Yariv to propose a solution.' Netanyahu's comments referenced two key issues from the previous administration. The first was the maritime border agreement with Lebanon in 2022, under then-Prime Minister Yair Lapid. The agreement, which defined gas field rights in the Mediterranean, was criticized by Netanyahu as illegal because it was signed close to elections without full parliamentary approval, though it was sanctioned by the attorney general. The second issue was the appointment of IDF Chief Herzi Halevi by then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz during a transitional government. Netanyahu argued that such appointments should not be made during an election period, though the legal system permitted it under specific conditions. Constantly at loggerheads Netanyahu's government and the attorney general have been clashing for months over various issues. On Monday, Baharav-Miara sent a letter to Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs, accusing him of acting 'without authority' regarding legislation to subsidize daycare for ultra-Orthodox families, which she argued effectively circumvents the military draft law for the ultra-Orthodox. Baharav-Miara had previously said that the law would encourage draft evasion and was unconstitutional. The attorney general’s letter, drafted by her deputy Dr. Gil Limon, noted, 'We have been informed that you approached the accountant general, requesting he instruct the Labor Ministry to act contrary to the attorney general’s guidelines and the government’s position in ongoing court cases related to daycare subsidies.' Fuchs responded by accusing Baharav-Miara of creating a 'constitutional crisis and anarchy' with her opposition to the government's agenda. The government meeting also addressed the appointment of the new Civil Service commissioner, a position traditionally filled through a competitive selection process. Baharav-Miara had requested clarification from the government on why no competitive process was being considered, instead of allowing Prime Minister Netanyahu to present a sole candidate to the committee for approval. This comes as the government informed the Supreme Court of its intention to amend the appointment process. Baharav-Miara has also opposed other coalition-backed bills, including one that seeks to expand police use of spyware but excludes bribery offenses, and another that would change television ratings measurement methods, which she criticized for potentially infringing on privacy rights. The latter bill, introduced by Likud MK Shlomo Danino, has been linked to Communications Minister Karhi, who earlier called for Baharav-Miara’s dismissal.

Katz declares Israel's exit from UNRWA pact	After Knesset voted to end UNRWA's activities in Israel, FM Katz voids 1967 agreement, raising potential ICJ disputes; Israel cites UNRWA’s alleged terror ties and plans to redirect aid to non-terror-linked organizations Following the Knesset's recent enactment of legislation to terminate UNRWA's operations within Israeli territory, Foreign Minister Israel Katz has initiated the annulment of the 1967 agreement between Israel and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. The decision comes amid accusations that some UNRWA personnel were complicit in the October 7 attacks. The agreement had previously served as the legal framework governing relations between the two entities. 'Further to legislation passed by the Knesset of Israel on 28 October 2024, I write this letter to notify the United Nations that the State of Israel withdraws its request issued to UNRWA... The legislation will enter into effect following a three-month period. During this time, and thereafter, Israel will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel's security,' the letter read. This strategic move by Israel is anticipated to catalyze a legal confrontation with the Palestinians at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. Additionally, it is likely to provoke diplomatic maneuvers against Israel within the UN General Assembly, potentially including requests for advisory opinions. Minister Katz has tasked Foreign Ministry Director-General Yaakov Blitshtein with formally notifying the UN about Israel's termination of the agreement with UNRWA, in compliance with Section 1(b) of the newly enacted law. 'UNRWA, whose employees were involved in the October 7 massacre and many of whom are Hamas operatives, is part of the problem in Gaza, not the solution,' Katz said. 'Numerous pieces of evidence regarding Hamas operatives employed by UNRWA and the misuse of its facilities for terrorist activities were presented to the UN, yet no action was taken. Furthermore, UNRWA has ignored the UN's own recommendations from the Colonna report. 'Do not be misled by those claiming there is no alternative to UNRWA. Currently, the majority of humanitarian aid is distributed through other organizations, with only 13% channeled through UNRWA. Israel remains committed to international law and will continue to facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza in a manner that safeguards Israeli citizens' security.' Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon remarked on the communication sent to the President of the General Assembly, stating, 'Following the legislation concerning UNRWA, we have formally notified the President about ceasing cooperation with the agency. Despite the substantial evidence we provided to the UN demonstrating Hamas's influence over UNRWA, no measures were taken to acknowledge or alter the situation. As I have repeatedly emphasized, UNRWA is under Hamas's control in Gaza. Israel will continue its cooperation with humanitarian organizations but not with those that serve terrorism against Israel.' Under the legislative proposal by Knesset members Yulia Malinovsky, Dan Illouz and Ron Katz, which passed its second and third readings, UNRWA will no longer operate any offices, provide services or conduct activities, directly or indirectly, within Israel's sovereign territory. This effectively ends UNRWA's operations in East Jerusalem, transferring its responsibilities to Israeli control. The proposal was supported by 92 Knesset members, with 10 opposing. The legislation's backdrop reveals that the UN agency, tasked with providing services to Palestinian refugees, has employees suspected of involvement in the surprise attack on Israel and affiliations with terrorist organizations Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Following the law's passage, several global governments swiftly condemned the step, including UN Secretary-General António Guterres and UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini. Guterres even communicated to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, warning of 'devastating' consequences. The Palestinians reacted with shock, and the United States indicated that the legislation might invoke repercussions consistent with American law and Washington's policy. The British government is contemplating revoking additional arms export licenses to Israel if the UNRWA legislation is implemented. Reports from Britain suggested that Foreign Minister Katz assured his British counterpart, David Lammy, that 'the contentious measure will not be enforced immediately.' UNRWA is deeply entrenched with Hamas, with its employees involved in the October 7 massacre, and many more are Hamas and PIJ operatives, with new instances of UNRWA employees' involvement in terrorism emerging frequently. In July, Israel presented the UN with extensive documentation, including a list of 100 Hamas military operatives employed by UNRWA, yet the relief agency took no action. Recently, reports surfaced about UNRWA employee Muhammad Al-Atawi, included on this list, who participated in the massacre at Kibbutz Re'im on October 7, 2023. Despite the information being provided, no action was taken against him by UNRWA. Al-Atawi was killed in an IDF operation and UN chief Guterres expressed regret over his death. Moreover, numerous terrorist acts during the war were executed from UNRWA facilities, yet the agency did not notify Israel about Hamas' improper use of its facilities during the war, contravening its commitments to maintain neutrality. UNRWA has also failed to implement the minimal measures required by the UN's own Colonna report: employees affiliated with Hamas and PIJ have not been dismissed, nothing has been done to address the neutrality violations of UNRWA facilities and the agency has not amended the educational materials in its schools despite commitments to donor countries and Israel to immediately remove such content. The Foreign Ministry echoed Katz's statement. 'UNRWA is part of the problem in Gaza—not part of the solution. Claims that there is no alternative to UNRWA are unfounded. The vast majority of humanitarian aid to Gaza is already delivered through other organizations, with only 13% through UNRWA. Israel is committed to international law and will continue cooperating with UN and international organizations free from terrorism to ensure humanitarian aid reaches Gaza without compromising Israeli citizens' security. 'In accordance with the law, the legislation regarding UNRWA will take effect in approximately three months. During this period, the already extensive cooperation with other international organizations free from terrorism will be expanded, preparations will be made to sever ties with UNRWA, and alternatives will be established, all in compliance with international law.'

David's Sling and Namer APC awarded Israel Defense Prize: 'Ground...	Israel Defense Prize honors teams from Defense Ministry, IDF, Mossad, Shin Bet and defense industries for transformative projects enhancing military capabilities and strategic operations with cutting-edge technology and intelligence The prestigious Israel Defense Prize was conferred on Sunday evening upon teams from the Defense Ministry, IDF, Mossad, Shin Bet and defense industries for their groundbreaking technological projects that have significantly bolstered the IDF's wartime capabilities. Among the celebrated projects are the David's Sling missile defense system, the innovative Target Factory target acquisition system and the Namer armored personnel carrier (APC). Additionally, a lifetime achievement award was presented to a Mossad operative identified as Y., recognizing three decades of pioneering contributions. The ceremony, held at the President's Residence in Jerusalem, was attended by notable figures including Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar and Mossad head David Barnea. The awarded projects are as follows, according to the Defense Ministry and the President's Residence: David's Sling Air Defense System: This accolade was awarded to the Homa Directorate at MAFAT (the Defense Ministry's Directorate of Defense Research & Development), the Air Force, Rafael, Elbit Systems, and the Israel Aerospace Industries' ELTA Division, for their development, production and operational deployment of the David's Sling system. This sophisticated defense mechanism provides comprehensive national protection against medium-range missiles, rockets and cruise missiles. It serves as an interception layer against steep-trajectory projectiles and precision surface-to-surface missiles. For over a decade, its development has been spearheaded by the Homa Directorate at MAFAT, in collaboration with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA). During the Gaza war, the system, operated by the Air Force's air defense units, successfully intercepted numerous rockets, safeguarding countless lives. Target Factory: The award went to the Air Force, the Intelligence Directorate and the C4I Branch of the IDF for their role in mechanizing the IDF's Target Factory. This project developed shared information capabilities across IDF branches and advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence for target planning and preparation. Throughout the Gaza war, Target Factory markedly enhanced the effectiveness of the Air Force's close air support for maneuvering ground forces. Namer armored personnel carrier (APC): This award was granted to the Merkava and Armored Vehicles Directorate (Mantak) at the Defense Ministry, the Ordnance Department, the Ground Forces, the Golani and Givati Brigades and the Merkava Manufacturers Forum within the Manufacturers Association. The Namer APC, an Israeli innovation, was tailored to the IDF's unique operational requirements, revolutionizing maneuver tactics during the Gaza war. The Defense Ministry's development of the Namer facilitated pivotal operational achievements, protected IDF soldiers and commanders, and had a direct impact on combat outcomes. It integrates cutting-edge technology and results from long-standing collaborative efforts in development, production, and integration by the Defense Ministry, IDF and defense industries. Additionally, an award was bestowed upon Mossad, Rafael and the Air Force for an extraordinary strategic project that integrates cutting-edge technology, high-quality intelligence, strategic cunning and bold operational maneuvers that reshape the operational landscape. The project was noted for its unique and significant contribution to Israel's security and the defeat of its adversaries. An award was also given to the Research and Development Unit at MAFAT, the Intelligence Directorate, Israeli Air Force, Shin Bet and Elbit Systems for developing a groundbreaking technological capability that established a new intelligence discipline. The operational deployment of this system directly contributed to the IDF's success in addressing battlefield challenges and achieving intelligence superiority. The Israel Defense Prize Committee also decided to honor Mossad operative Y. with a lifetime achievement award for his three decades of service. 'Throughout his tenure, Y. has been instrumental in developing unique and innovative breakthrough technological systems, exemplifying unwavering excellence and professionalism. His efforts have significantly bolstered Israel's technological prowess and security,' the statement read. Mossad chief Barnea commended the agency's employees and commanders: 'This year, more than ever, you have demonstrated the strength and influence of Mossad in Israel's ongoing battle to overcome its enemies. Your achievement this year reflects the spirit, values, initiative and creativity of Mossad, showcasing the ability to accomplish the seemingly impossible time and again. I am proud of you.'

Suspected leaker recruited as reservist, then shifted to Netanyah...	Investigators focus on how highly classified documents leaked from secure repositories, tracking individuals who disregarded protocols; Defense Ministry confirms PM's spokesman recruited to National Emergency Center but failed to report The investigation into a sensitive document leak from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, leading to the arrest of several suspects, including his spokesperson Eli Feldstein, originated with the Israeli military. The probe focuses on a breach involving 'live secret channels'—classified intelligence from Unit 8200, the army's SIGINT unit, whose methods for securing the information appear compromised. The IDF approached the Shin Bet to trace the source of the leak, initially unaware that it would lead to Feldstein, who served as Netanyahu's security affairs spokesperson over the past year. The leak stemmed from a restricted zone where a small group of individuals allegedly provided sensitive information to an unauthorized party. This data eventually reached Feldstein, who, according to the investigation, passed it on to the German newspaper Bild. Central to the investigation are not the specific documents, known as the 'Sinwar Papers' which purportedly lay out Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's hostage negotiation strategy, but rather the channel through which the information was leaked. A source involved in the case emphasized that this inquiry is different from typical leak probes, as it focuses on understanding the breach in handling top-secret information. Several IDF reservists are also under suspicion for their role in the matter. The leaked intelligence, reportedly gathered through advanced systems, did not just circulate within Israel—it was seen by Hamas. This breach allowed the terror group to infer what Israeli intelligence knew, jeopardizing ongoing military objectives. The source added that revealing this intelligence compromises Israel’s strategic capabilities, potentially endangering its operational advantage in the war with Hamas. The Shin Bet's primary goal remains shutting down the leak during wartime. Despite claims of selective prosecution, insiders deny such allegations, noting that the Shin Bet has arrested one of its own employees for involvement. Former Shin Bet official Dvir Kariv defended the investigation, rejecting accusations of misconduct and explaining that when leaks occur, the security services must take action, regardless of the source. Though the investigation continues, initial findings suggest that espionage or financial gain are not the motives behind the leak. The suspects reportedly believed their actions were in Israel’s best interest, though knowingly transferring classified information remains a serious offense. In the early days following the October 7 massacre, Netanyahu’s office reportedly sought to appoint a new spokesperson for military and security matters, a role that had not previously existed. Traditionally, the Defense Ministry maintained contact with military correspondents. Although Netanyahu’s spokespersons had communicated with the press over the years, a specific and fully defined position had never been created until Eli Feldstein's appointment. During the second week of the war, the director-general of the Prime Minister’s Office requested Feldstein's assignment to the National Emergency Command Center, under the Defense Ministry. Feldstein was brought on in a reservist capacity through the National Emergency Authority (known by its Hebrew acronym RAHEL). However, for three days in mid-October, Feldstein worked at Netanyahu's office rather than reporting to the command center, as intended. Upon realizing that Feldstein was not fulfilling the duties for which he was recruited, the Defense Ministry immediately requested that the IDF’s Manpower Directorate (AKA) terminate his reservist service. A statement from the Defense Ministry confirmed: 'At the request of the Prime Minister’s Office, Eli Feldstein was recruited on October 15 to reinforce the emergency command center, but after three days, it became clear he was not stationed at his designated role and was promptly released by the National Emergency Authority.'

FBI arrests 'Hamas operative' and Jewish woman for plot to attack...	US-Lebanese citizen Mohamad Hamad allegedly acquired bomb-making materials to target Jewish sites in Pittsburgh; Talya Lubit, charged as his accomplice, accused of vandalizing synagogue and Jewish center with pro-Hamas graffiti Two Pittsburgh residents were arrested by the FBI and local police in connection with hate crimes and the vandalism of Jewish buildings in July. One of the suspects, Mohamad Hamad, 23, who identified himself as a 'Hamas operative,' reportedly purchased explosives. Hamad, a U.S. and Lebanese citizen, was a member of the Pennsylvania National Guard stationed near Pittsburgh International Airport, according to a report in the New York Post. The second suspect, Talya Lubit, a Jewish woman, allegedly assisted Hamad in defacing Jewish buildings with pro-Hamas graffiti. Hamad is accused of vandalizing a Chabad synagogue and a Jewish community center in Pittsburgh, where messages such as 'Jews for Palestine' and a red inverted triangle, associated with Hamas supporters, were spray-painted on the walls. Lubit, who referred to Jews as 'enemies,' reportedly supported a local county resolution condemning Israel and defended a Pittsburgh legislator who blamed Israel for Hamas' October 7 attack. The FBI launched a criminal investigation on July 29 following reports of vandalism at the Chabad house and another Jewish community center. During the probe, search warrants were executed at the suspects' homes in August and September, uncovering text messages between Hamad and Lubit discussing their plans to target Jewish institutions. Evidence found on Hamad's phone revealed that in the weeks leading up to the vandalism, he described himself as a 'Hamas operative' and shared a photo of himself wearing a Hamas-branded headband. He also discussed bomb-making and shared a video of a test explosion. Investigators found that he had purchased two pounds of Indian Black aluminum powder and two pounds of potassium perchlorate used to form explosives. Hamad reportedly planned an initial test explosion on July 6 as part of a larger plot to target Pittsburgh's Jewish community. Hamad also communicated with Lubit about the graffiti incident several days before the July 29 vandalism. Messages revealed that Lubit had grown increasingly hostile toward Jews, saying, 'I can literally feel myself starting to see Jews as my enemies.' She also shared an image of an Israeli flag with a swastika in the middle, using the codename 'Warsaw.' Both Hamad and Lubit have been linked to anti-Israel politics within the Democratic Party. Hamad donated to Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, while Lubit was part of a Jewish group defending a Pittsburgh lawmaker who called for a cease-fire following Hamas’ October 7 attack. Both suspects face hefty prison sentences.

Israeli universities return to studies under shadow of war	TAU: 1,600 students in IDF reserves Israel kicked off its academic year at universities across the country on Sunday. For the second consecutive year, thousands of students are beginning their studies under the shadow of war. Last year, one in five students served in the reserves, totaling around 70,000. This year, the numbers are expected to be similar. At Tel Aviv University, approximately 1,600 of the 30,000 students are serving in the reserves. Staff at the university told ILTV News that they are doing everything possible to support these students—emotionally, financially, and, of course, academically. ILTV’s Ariella Lahayani was at the university on Sunday to speak to students.

Israel must strike back: One building for every Hezbollah drone, ...	ILTV News interview with Prof. Mordechai Kedar Israel should demolish one building in Lebanon for every drone Hezbollah launches at Israel, according to Bar-Ilan University’s Prof. Mordechai Kedar. In an interview with ILTV News, Kedar stated that 'this should be the price the community will pay if they continue to launch drones against Israel.' He added, 'if Israel did this, after two or three days, when they see Israel is serious, they will stop it.' Kedar emphasized that the goal is not to harm civilians. Israel could still warn civilians in advance of its strikes, focusing on deterrence. Hezbollah, unlike Israel, aims to kill Israeli people. And what about Iran—will it strike Israel again soon? Kedar said he is not concerned. 'Iran is more or less exposed today,' Kedar told ILTV, 'because Israel destroyed large parts, if not most, of its air defense system. It is much easier to target more places in Iran.' He added that he believes Iran’s nuclear military facilities are exposed—anything not deeply underground—and that if Israel wanted to, it could take actions against those facilities. 'Israel should take advantage of the fact that the air defenses in Iran are weak,' he said.

Iran plans complex attack on Israel after military losses, report...	Iranian diplomats warn Middle Eastern nations Tehran's response to Israeli strike, which killed 4 soldiers, may involve military and 'additional weapons'; attack expected after US election but before inauguration Iran has conveyed diplomatic messages indicating plans for a complex attack on Israel, using more powerful warheads than previously deployed, alongside other advanced weaponry, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing Iranian and Arab officials familiar with the plans. Tehran reportedly intends to involve its regular military forces, not just the Revolutionary Guards, following the deaths of four Iranian soldiers in an Israeli strike. An Egyptian source told The Wall Street Journal that Iran personally warned Cairo of a 'strong and complex' retaliation. 'Our military lost personnel; they need to respond,' an Iranian official said, adding that Iraq could be used as part of the operation. The attack is expected to target Israeli military sites but 'in a more aggressive manner' than before, the official noted. The report claims Iran's response will likely go beyond missiles and drones, potentially involving more powerful warheads. In previous attacks on Israel, Iran used four types of medium-range missiles, including Emad, Raad, Kheibar Shekan and Fateh, according to the report. The Iranian official, amid Israeli intelligence reports suggesting an imminent attack, stated that Tehran does not want to influence the U.S. elections with its retaliation. As a result, the response is expected after Election Day but before the next U.S. president's inauguration. Diplomatic sources from Bahrain and Oman were also briefed by Iranian diplomats on the planned response. Western officials cited by The Wall Street Journal believe Iran’s leadership is debating the scope and nature of the attack—whether it should be directly from Iran or via its proxies to maintain plausible deniability. Israel, meanwhile, is preparing for a serious response, with military officials warning that any Iranian strike will be met with even greater force. Three days ago, The New York Times reported that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the country’s Supreme National Security Council to prepare for an attack on Israel. The decision followed a detailed briefing from top military commanders on the damage caused by the Israeli strike to Iran's missile production capabilities, air defense systems around Tehran, energy infrastructure, and a key southern port. According to the report, Khamenei stated that the scale of the Israeli attack and the death of at least four regular army soldiers were too significant to ignore, adding that failing to respond would be perceived as admitting defeat.

Debris from destroyed Russian drones sparked park and grass fires in Kyiv, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital said on Monday, in what was Moscow's third drone attack on the city in as many nights. 'Emergency crews have been dispatched,' Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. The drone wreckage caused a fire in the Muromets park in the Desnianskyi district in Kyiv's northeast and set some grass ablaze on the embankment of the Dnipro River across from the park. There was no immediate information about potential injuries.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj11dd0b11ye	2024-11-03T20:11:24-08:00	
Night-time operation under Hezbollah's nose: How Israel captured ...	A meticulously planned IDF operation led to the capture of Iranian operative Ali Soleiman al-Assi near Quneitra; Soldiers executed a covert nighttime raid, employing diversion tactics and aerial support, effectively dismantling espionage efforts and preventing future attacks on Israeli targets The Israeli defense establishment disclosed on Sunday evening the capture of Ali Soleiman al-Assi, an Iranian operative, in Syrian territory near Quneitra, first to Saudi Arabia and shortly thereafter to Israel. This disclosure aims to exert pressure on the Iranian Revolutionary Guards amid the threat of a potential Iranian offensive against Israel. According to IDF reports, al-Assi revealed during his interrogation by Unit 504 of the Intelligence Corps the operational methodologies employed by Iranian entities on the Golan Heights front. The IDF prominently featured interrogation footage with his face clearly visible, affirming that he remains in Israeli custody. Al-Assi, a Syrian national, allegedly gathered intelligence in the Golan region prior to his apprehension, which effectively thwarted a prospective attack against Israeli interests in the area. This revelation coincides with another recent IDF operation in northern Lebanon, where Shayetet 13 commandos swiftly captured a Hezbollah operative, identified as a maritime knowledge hub for the terrorist organization. Details of al-Assi's capture, obtained by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, reveal that an Egoz Unit team conducted a covert nighttime raid on his residence near Quneitra several months ago. During the operation, his family was present in the building. The Egoz Unit, known for executing numerous covert operations beyond Israel's northern border in Syria and Lebanon in recent years, both before and after the war, prepared meticulously to prevent any noise or disturbance from family members that might betray their presence in the village. Apprehending the operative lasted mere minutes from the moment the perimeter was secured. Sources indicate that armed Hezbollah operatives and Syrian army personnel were in proximity but remained unaware of the unfolding operation, aided by simultaneous diversion and deception tactics. Egoz operatives stealthily crossed the border and extracted their target from his bed under the cover of night. He was unable to resist or use his personal weapon, which was confiscated. A Unit 504 investigator, tasked with verifying al-Assi's identity at the scene, joined the elite commando brigade's force. The suspect was spirited back to Israel with the operatives, employing both vehicular and on-foot maneuvers, without encountering danger. The force was discovered only nearing the border, a scenario anticipated and accounted for in the operational plan. Despite several delays, the operatives were prepared, executing their mission comprehensively. 'The operative was quite surprised when we arrived and roused him,' according to the IDF. 'This team has faced at least 10 close-quarters encounters with Hamas terrorists in Gaza, accruing significant confidence and experience, although this operation entailed a quiet and covert infiltration.' Al-Assi was informed of his captors' identity only after crossing into Israeli territory. The Egoz force had meticulously monitored him, analyzing his behavior in the weeks preceding the operation, gathering important preliminary intelligence. The mission was supported by remotely operated aircraft from the Israeli Air Force for surveillance and potential strikes, alongside special drones and a reserve force poised to extract the operatives should complications arise. Despite its proximity to the Israeli side, Hezbollah has attempted in recent years to establish terrorist infrastructures in the operation area, repeatedly thwarted by Division 210 forces responsible for the Golan sector, including preemptive strikes throughout the past year. On Sunday evening, IDF spokesperson announced the operation was conducted in recent months during a cross-border night incursion into Syria by Egoz Unit operatives with Unit 504 field investigators, under Division 210's command and intelligence guidance. The IDF confirmed that the detainee, Ali Soleiman al-Assi, a Syrian national residing in the Saida area of southern Syria, operated under Iranian direction, engaged in intelligence gathering on IDF troops in the border region for future terrorist activities. Al-Assi was under stringent surveillance by Israeli forces and is currently under interrogation by Unit 504 and security forces in Israel. During his interrogation, al-Assi recounted a meeting with one of his recruiters: 'We sat on the fence, he glanced around and told me - your area is good, strategic. We can leverage it.' He claimed to understand the individual was linked to Iran and received an offer to collaborate with them: 'He told me, you need to work with us. Just to observe the borders. He claimed to be from military intelligence, but in fact, Iran is behind them, as I understood he belongs to Iran. Even Iran does not operate openly; there's a military intelligence cover.' According to him, the recruiter expressed interest in the border area with Israel and troop movements: 'Once we informed him there was a tank yesterday at such a time, a patrol passed at such a time.' The IDF spokesperson said in a statement that: 'The operation by IDF troops to detain al-Assi prevented a future attack and led to the exposure of the operational methods of Iranian terror networks located near the Golan Heights. Al-Assi was transferred for further investigation to Unit 504 and other security forces. The IDF will continue to operate to defend the sovereignty of the State of Israel and will not allow Iranian proxies in southern Syria to operate and threaten Israeli civilians.'

IDF: Terrorist bomb exploded near humanitarian convoy in Gaza, 6 ...	On Sunday, in coordination with COGAT, a humanitarian convoy enabled the evacuation of patients and staff from the Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals to other hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip, according to the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. The convoy also provided humanitarian aid to these hospitals, including food, water, fuel and medical equipment. As the convoy passed by the Kamal Adwan Hospital, a report was received from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the detonation of an explosive device, only a few hundred meters from the hospital. As a result of the explosion, the convoy was hit by shrapnel. No injuries were reported among the convoy’s personnel. Following the incident, the COGAT Gaza Coordination and Liason Administration (CLA) reached out to the heads of the WHO and clarified this was an explosive device planted by the terrorist organizations in Gaza. Additionally, following an assessment by COGAT with hospital officials, six children in the hospital were injured by the explosion. Damage was also caused to the roof and courtyard of the hospital.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkff000h11ye	2024-11-03T14:05:35-08:00	
Eli Feldstein identified as key suspect in Netanyahu office leak	Eli Feldstein, once employed in Netanyahu's office, is at the center of a significant document leak investigation potentially impacting national security and hostage negotiations; A court, balancing transparency and security, partially lifted the gag order amid ongoing legal scrutiny Eli Feldstein, once employed in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, is the principal suspect in the confidential document leak case, who was arrested and brought before the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court. On Sunday evening, a judge partially lifted the gag order on the case, permitting the disclosure of Feldstein’s identity and related specifics, including his employment and status. Earlier, his detention was extended by two days. Since the revelation of Feldstein's identity Sunday evening, the Prime Minister's Office has remained silent on the issue and has not released a response. The order was mitigated following a petition filed by Attorney Tal Leiblich on behalf of Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. The presiding judge also permitted the publication of the following: 'The investigation was initiated after significant suspicions arose within Shin Bet and IDF, also in light of media reports that classified and sensitive intelligence information was taken from IDF systems and unlawfully disseminated, raising concerns about serious harm to national security and jeopardizing information sources. Consequently, there was a potential risk of damage to the security services' capacity to achieve the objective of releasing the hostages as part of war aims.' The implication is that the return of the hostages might be compromised due to the leaks' impact on sources. Additionally, it was permitted for publication: 'Following this, a joint covert investigation was launched by the Shin Bet, IDF and Israel Police, during which the aforementioned suspicions were significantly corroborated. Subsequently, an overt investigation was opened, during which four suspects involved in the activity were interrogated, some from the security establishment and a civilian named Mr. Eliezer Feldstein. The investigation is ongoing, and is being conducted in accordance with legal procedures and under court supervision. Any further publication regarding the investigation could jeopardize the investigation, its objectives and state security.' Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court Judge Menahem Mizrahi said in his decision that 'I have reviewed the investigation materials and its conduct and am satisfied that it constitutes a focused and highly professional investigation that must be allowed to proceed to completion. If I were to order the complete revocation of the order, there is a real risk of substantial harm to the investigation and the quest for truth. The court will reconsider the situation repeatedly as the process continues.' Furthermore, Mizrachi indicated that 'reviewing the classified material presented to me and other evidence suggests a reasonable suspicion and even substantial prima facie evidence supporting the allegations against the suspects.' Tzvia, Feldstein's sister, wrote Sunday evening that her brother is 'in Shin Bet solitary confinement already for a week without meeting a lawyer,' and claimed he is 'a victim of an embarrassing and disgraceful political spin.' She asserted that 'he will soon emerge, stronger and braver. Understanding that he is on the good side of the map.' She added: 'My brother Eli is a talented, sharp and witty guy. A sensitive soul. A pure heart that spreads only good around him. Always willing to help, full of generosity and love. For years, he sacrificed for the country in military service, yes, yes, a guy from an ultra-Orthodox home. An officer of the highest caliber. He reached the highest places through hard work. He is also a sought-after and pursued bachelor.' Feldstein's associates previously remarked that it is 'painful to see how they threw him to the wolves after he was as loyal as a soldier to Netanyahu.' An associate said that he was 'prepared to do anything for Netanyahu. There is a reason he was brought into the most important office in the country. They understood that if necessary, he would move heaven and earth for a kind word from Bibi. The fact that they discarded him the moment the affair was exposed and disowned him will backfire on them. There isn’t a person in politics who doesn’t know he has worked for Netanyahu since October 7.' Moreover, his relatives contended that 'they brought him in precisely for these tasks, related to the army. So suddenly to say that Bibi doesn't know who he is? He sat in your office, you called him on the phone. It's absurd.' Earlier, a session was held in the court regarding the request by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth and other media outlets to lift the gag order on the secret documents affair involving the spokesperson in Netanyahu's office. The session then transitioned to behind closed doors, preceding the judge's decision on the matter. Feldstein, who worked with the Prime Minister's Office, is detained as part of the document leak case that is shaking the premier's office. He is suspected of passing classified documents to the German newspaper 'Bild' and to Israeli reporters. The ongoing investigation is tasked with examining whether the material leaked by the suspects poses a real security threat or even a risk of exposing security sources and methods. Another aspect under scrutiny is who authorized the classified document leak, whether the suspects acted independently or received directives from higher authorities. The Prime Minister's Office issued a new response Saturday night, asserting that 'the document that was published never reached the Prime Minister's Office from the Military Intelligence Directorate, and the Prime Minister learned about it from the media. The person in question never participated in security discussions, was not exposed to or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits. Overall, it is ridiculous to say that publishing a favorable article about Israel in a German newspaper - in which a document like those previously published with approval and authority - caused any damage to the hostage release negotiations or to Israel's security. On the contrary, it assisted the effort and certainly did not harm it.' The Prime Minister's Office claimed selective enforcement, stating: 'Since the beginning of the war until today, we have witnessed a flood of deliberate and criminal leaks from secret cabinet meetings, closed security discussions, confidential discussions related to the release of hostages; the leak of the doctored video against our soldiers in the Yemen field, and the leak by Knesset member Gilad Kariv from the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. It is very puzzling why, out of all these leaks, this particular document - whose content was known to all and assisted the State of Israel - received such an aggressive and targeted investigation.' Before the discussion on lifting the gag order, a session was held regarding the extension of the suspects' detention in the case. According to one suspect's lawyer, his client was released, while the court extended Feldstein's detention by two days. Despite Netanyahu's declarations that he would join the petition to request the removal of the gag order, he did not submit any such request. Concurrently with the case discussion, Netanyahu's spokespersons - Yonatan Urich and Ofer Golan - were seen leaving the office of attorney Amit Hadad, who represents the prime minister in his ongoing corruption trial. The suspects themselves did not attend the session but participated via live video from detention. The request was submitted by media outlets, the hostages' families' headquarters, and a personal request by Einav Zangauker, the mother of the hostage Matan and one of the leaders of the families' protest. Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth were represented by attorneys Tal Leiblich and Natai Zuriel from the firm Leiblich-Muser-Glick.

Trump says wouldn't mind if someone shot through media to get him	Republican Donald Trump complained to supporters on Sunday about gaps in the bullet-proof glass surrounding him as he spoke and mused that an assassin would have to shoot through the news media to get him, adding, 'I don't mind that so much.' In a meandering 90-minute rally speech two days before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, Trump noted that there were gaps in the panes of glass around him. Some of the members of the press following Trump at the event in Lititz, Pennsylvania, had a sight line through one of the gaps. The former president has escaped two attempted assassinations this year.Surveying the gaps, Trump said: 'To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news and I don't mind that so much.' Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung issued a statement after the media remarks. He said Trump was looking out for the media's safety.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjo1kdbzkx	2024-11-03T12:20:58-08:00

Drone explodes near Metula 20 minutes before Netanyahu visit to a...	Prime minister's visit focused on meeting senior military officials in area, with no interactions with evacuees or local residents; 'With or without an agreement, the key to bringing residents back safely is pushing Hezbollah away' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to visit the northern Israeli town of Metula on Sunday but canceled after a drone exploded at a nearby outpost just 20 minutes prior to his arrival. His convoy was already en route when the destination was changed at the last minute. As with previous visits to Israel’s northern border, Netanyahu’s visit was limited to military officials and did not include meetings with displaced residents or local civilians. Netanyahu emphasized the government's commitment to security in northern Israel. 'We are striking across Lebanon. With or without an agreement, the key to restoring calm and security is first to push Hezbollah beyond the Litani River, second to prevent any renewed armament, and third to respond decisively to any action against us. In simple terms: enforcement, enforcement, enforcement – and cutting off Hezbollah’s supply line from Iran through Syria. We are fully committed to these goals.' Netanyahu further noted: 'From the northern border, one can see and hear the transformation on the ground – our aircraft above and our brave fighters below, across the border, dismantling Hezbollah’s entire underground terror network that was prepared for an invasion into the Galilee and a massacre even worse than what happened in Gaza. This will not happen.' He also praised the dedication of the reservists. 'Our heroic reservists play a crucial role in our achievements. They put their lives on hold, leave their families, lose work and sometimes, tragically, lose friends. I just met with them, and their readiness and fighting spirit are deeply inspiring. One brigade commander told me: ‘We have the privilege to defend our country. We are making history.’ This spirit of sacrifice and courage deserves our utmost support,' he said. Netanyahu’s office dismissed reports that he had personally requested to cancel the visit, calling them 'false.' A statement clarified: 'Contrary to misleading media reports, the prime minister did not ask to cancel his visit to Metula. Quite the opposite, Netanyahu repeatedly seeks to visit frontline areas, but security officials set limitations. In this instance, security authorities advised modifying the visit route.' Earlier in the day, another drone exploded in Elyakim, near Yokneam and a separate drone was intercepted off the coast of Caesarea following numerous air alerts in northern Israel over a 40-minute period. The IDF spokesperson confirmed that a Navy missile boat intercepted the drone before it entered Israeli airspace, while firefighting teams worked to extinguish a blaze sparked by the explosion in Elyakim.

Rubble, smoke and bewildered people: A drive through 'broken' Leb...	The end of Iran's era': The Atlantic highlights Lebanon's dire situation, depicting a nation fractured by economic crisis and conflict, where Hezbollah's influence wanes, communities are displaced, and people argue among themselves about what kind of a nation Lebanon will be after the war At the end of September, just days after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was eliminated in an airstrike on the organization's stronghold in southern Beirut, a reporter from 'The Atlantic' magazine met with a Hezbollah supporter at a seaside café in western Beirut. The man, an academic with a thin white beard and the weary appearance of someone who hadn't slept in days, had a deep and long-standing connection with Hezbollah. 'We are in a great campaign, like no other before,' he said. 'Hezbollah has never faced what Israel is conducting now, not in 1982, not in 2006. This is a total war.' When asked about the possibility of Iran stopping its support for the organization, he replied after a tense silence: 'There are questions.' He added, 'It's like you've raised a son, now 42 years old, and you abandon him? No. It doesn't make sense.' Fighters at the border are ready, he said, and Israeli soldiers will dig their own graves and soon beg for a cease-fire. But then, the man slowed his speech, the reporter describes, and doubts returned. He mentioned Ahmad Shukeiri, the first chairman of the PLO, who said on the eve of the Six-Day War that the Jews who survive will remain in Palestine, but he estimated that none of them would survive. 'I don't want to be like him,' said the man. It took a moment to understand the historical analogy: he implied that the movement he is so dedicated to might face complete destruction. 'This tea we are drinking,' he said, 'we don't know if it will be the last.' In a comprehensive article in 'The Atlantic,' reporter Robert Worth paints a picture of a fragmented country, and perhaps something Israelis would like to hear - that Hezbollah and Iran are losing their grip on it. The article's headline is a quote about 'the end of the Iranian era.' Here are selected excerpts from it. Fuel ran out, so they continued on foot Hezbollah is much more than a militia, writes Worth; it is almost a state within a state, stronger than the weak and divided Lebanese government, certainly stronger than the Lebanese army. The organization smuggles not only weapons but billions of dollars from Iran. It operates banks, hospitals, a welfare system and a parallel economy of duty-free imports and drug trade that enriched and empowered the Shiite community, which was previously disadvantaged. The road to Tyre reveals the depth of the crisis, according to the article in 'The Atlantic.' The coastal highway, usually bustling with traffic, is almost empty. The driver speeds at over 87 mph. On both sides of the road, smoke from the previous night's bombings can be seen. Hezbollah's yellow flags wave in the wind, alongside new billboards of 'martyrs' with the inscription 'Nasrallah Aat' - a play on words in Arabic on the name of the killed leader of Hezbollah, meaning 'Victory of God.' On the northern roadside, dozens of abandoned cars are parked -left behind by families who fled from the south, ran out of fuel, and continued on foot. The city of Tyre, usually bustling, is described by the reporter as a ghost town. The Rest House hotel, a fenced tourist complex, has become a safe spot for refugees and journalists. From its wide balcony, overlooking a stunning beach, one can see Hezbollah's rocket launches. 'It happens a lot,' said one Arab journalist. 'That's how it is in war. You get used to it until the assumptions change and the missiles land on you.' In the city of Sidon, a strike on a residential building claimed the lives of at least 45 people, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. Israel, the article notes, stated that it eliminated a local Hezbollah commander and with him activists. Mohammed Ahmed Jiradi, 31, was among the first to arrive at the scene. 'I heard the screams of people under the rubble,' he recounted. 'I saw my aunt when they rescued her. Her internal parts were outside, her head crushed. That's the last image I have of her.' A resident named Lilal recounted how many receive phone calls from Israelis warning them to evacuate their homes. Many follow the X account of Avichay Adraee, the IDF spokesperson in Arabic, who publishes warnings about upcoming attacks. Lilal's neighbor, Ghadir, received a call from someone speaking Arabic with a Palestinian accent who knew all her personal details. When she evacuated her apartment, the building was bombed that night. An economic crisis is an opportunity for Israeli intelligence. In an effort to improve its image, Hezbollah organized a tour for about 300 journalists in the devastated areas of Dahiya, its stronghold in southern Beirut. The reporter describes how, at each bombing site, a Hezbollah representative gave a speech about innocent civilians who were killed while journalists crowded to photograph the smoking ruins. One shop owner in the area sneaked in to check his place and told the reporter, 'I came now because I know the Israelis won't bomb you.' The reporter shares the story of Hamoudi, a 25-year-old Shia who was a secular and successful film producer in Beirut. 'He didn't pray,' his sister said. 'My mother said, 'You won't be a martyr, you don't pray.'' Hamoudi loved women, music and parties, and lived in the secular Hamra district instead of Hezbollah's stronghold in Dahieh. Last September, he decided to join the ranks of the militants. A day after filming a 'martyr' video, he was killed in an Israeli bombing. 'He was my friend, my brother, my box of secrets,' his sister said tearfully. Instead of promising revenge, she added, 'I'm thinking of leaving the country.' Ashraf Rifi, former head of Lebanese security services, explained to The Atlantic how Israel managed to infiltrate Hezbollah's ranks. According to him, the organization's involvement in the Syrian war exposed the fighters to Israeli intelligence. Additionally, Lebanon's economic crisis made many vulnerable to recruitment as collaborators. On September 17, an operation was carried out to explode thousands of beepers sold through deception. A doctor at a leading hospital described the chaos of that day, with dozens of young people hospitalized without registering their names – all under the name 'George,' a typical Christian name. Rifi estimated that about 20% of Hezbollah's mid-level and senior commanders were killed in Israeli operations. 'The Iranian era is over, I think,' he said. 'In Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen.' Belief in Lebanon In Tripoli, at the trendy Crop restaurant, the reporter described a heated debate about the country's future. A local municipal official claimed, 'I don't see anyone who believes in a country called Lebanon. I see the Christians, Sunnis, Shias, Druze each loyal to their community or party. There is no public interest.' A young historian named Charles El-Haik passionately disagreed, arguing that Lebanon has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other Arab countries: traditions of religious diversity, democracy, higher education, and personal and public freedoms. A senior former officer in the Lebanese army, close to Chief of Staff Joseph Aoun, warned in the article that 'only Iran can disarm Hezbollah.' According to him, despite the severe blow, Hezbollah still has a significant fighting force in the south that can operate independently. 'But over time,' he emphasized, 'Hezbollah will feel the lack of money. That will be the biggest problem. And when the Shias return to the south, who will rebuild?' At night, from the roof of a hotel in Beirut, the reporter describes orange flames erupting from the southern outskirts of the city following an airstrike. 'It looks like a volcanic eruption,' he writes. A group of young Lebanese at a nearby table film the spectacle on their phones and return to their cocktails. Meanwhile, about a quarter of Lebanon's population has been displaced. At Beirut airport, Worth writes that he saw people sleeping outside hoping to get a ticket for a flight out. Foreign airlines have stopped their flights, and more than 300,000 Syrian refugees have fled back to Syria – evidence, he says, of the depth of fear prevailing in the country.

'We are in a great campaign, like no other before,' he said. 'Hezbollah has never faced what Israel is conducting now, not in 1982, not in 2006. This is a total war.' When asked about the possibility of Iran stopping its support for the organization, he replied after a tense silence: 'There are questions.' He added, 'It's like you've raised a son, now 42 years old, and you abandon him? No. It doesn't make sense.' Fighters at the border are ready, he said, and Israeli soldiers will dig their own graves and soon beg for a cease-fire. But then, the man slowed his speech, the reporter describes, and doubts returned. He mentioned Ahmad Shukeiri, the first chairman of the PLO, who said on the eve of the Six-Day War that the Jews who survive will remain in Palestine, but he estimated that none of them would survive. 'I don't want to be like him,' said the man. It took a moment to understand the historical analogy: he implied that the movement he is so dedicated to might face complete destruction. 'This tea we are drinking,' he said, 'we don't know if it will be the last.' In a comprehensive article in 'The Atlantic,' reporter Robert Worth paints a picture of a fragmented country, and perhaps something Israelis would like to hear - that Hezbollah and Iran are losing their grip on it. The article's headline is a quote about 'the end of the Iranian era.' Here are selected excerpts from it. Fuel ran out, so they continued on foot Hezbollah is much more than a militia, writes Worth; it is almost a state within a state, stronger than the weak and divided Lebanese government, certainly stronger than the Lebanese army. The organization smuggles not only weapons but billions of dollars from Iran. It operates banks, hospitals, a welfare system and a parallel economy of duty-free imports and drug trade that enriched and empowered the Shiite community, which was previously disadvantaged. The road to Tyre reveals the depth of the crisis, according to the article in 'The Atlantic.' The coastal highway, usually bustling with traffic, is almost empty. The driver speeds at over 87 mph. On both sides of the road, smoke from the previous night's bombings can be seen. Hezbollah's yellow flags wave in the wind, alongside new billboards of 'martyrs' with the inscription 'Nasrallah Aat' - a play on words in Arabic on the name of the killed leader of Hezbollah, meaning 'Victory of God.' On the northern roadside, dozens of abandoned cars are parked -left behind by families who fled from the south, ran out of fuel, and continued on foot. The city of Tyre, usually bustling, is described by the reporter as a ghost town. The Rest House hotel, a fenced tourist complex, has become a safe spot for refugees and journalists. From its wide balcony, overlooking a stunning beach, one can see Hezbollah's rocket launches. 'It happens a lot,' said one Arab journalist. 'That's how it is in war. You get used to it until the assumptions change and the missiles land on you.' In the city of Sidon, a strike on a residential building claimed the lives of at least 45 people, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. Israel, the article notes, stated that it eliminated a local Hezbollah commander and with him activists. Mohammed Ahmed Jiradi, 31, was among the first to arrive at the scene. 'I heard the screams of people under the rubble,' he recounted. 'I saw my aunt when they rescued her. Her internal parts were outside, her head crushed. That's the last image I have of her.' A resident named Lilal recounted how many receive phone calls from Israelis warning them to evacuate their homes. Many follow the X account of Avichay Adraee, the IDF spokesperson in Arabic, who publishes warnings about upcoming attacks. Lilal's neighbor, Ghadir, received a call from someone speaking Arabic with a Palestinian accent who knew all her personal details. When she evacuated her apartment, the building was bombed that night. An economic crisis is an opportunity for Israeli intelligence. In an effort to improve its image, Hezbollah organized a tour for about 300 journalists in the devastated areas of Dahiya, its stronghold in southern Beirut. The reporter describes how, at each bombing site, a Hezbollah representative gave a speech about innocent civilians who were killed while journalists crowded to photograph the smoking ruins. One shop owner in the area sneaked in to check his place and told the reporter, 'I came now because I know the Israelis won't bomb you.' The reporter shares the story of Hamoudi, a 25-year-old Shia who was a secular and successful film producer in Beirut. 'He didn't pray,' his sister said. 'My mother said, 'You won't be a martyr, you don't pray.'' Hamoudi loved women, music and parties, and lived in the secular Hamra district instead of Hezbollah's stronghold in Dahieh. Last September, he decided to join the ranks of the militants. A day after filming a 'martyr' video, he was killed in an Israeli bombing. 'He was my friend, my brother, my box of secrets,' his sister said tearfully. Instead of promising revenge, she added, 'I'm thinking of leaving the country.' Ashraf Rifi, former head of Lebanese security services, explained to The Atlantic how Israel managed to infiltrate Hezbollah's ranks. According to him, the organization's involvement in the Syrian war exposed the fighters to Israeli intelligence. Additionally, Lebanon's economic crisis made many vulnerable to recruitment as collaborators. On September 17, an operation was carried out to explode thousands of beepers sold through deception. A doctor at a leading hospital described the chaos of that day, with dozens of young people hospitalized without registering their names – all under the name 'George,' a typical Christian name. Rifi estimated that about 20% of Hezbollah's mid-level and senior commanders were killed in Israeli operations. 'The Iranian era is over, I think,' he said. 'In Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen.' Belief in Lebanon In Tripoli, at the trendy Crop restaurant, the reporter described a heated debate about the country's future. A local municipal official claimed, 'I don't see anyone who believes in a country called Lebanon. I see the Christians, Sunnis, Shias, Druze each loyal to their community or party. There is no public interest.' A young historian named Charles El-Haik passionately disagreed, arguing that Lebanon has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other Arab countries: traditions of religious diversity, democracy, higher education, and personal and public freedoms. A senior former officer in the Lebanese army, close to Chief of Staff Joseph Aoun, warned in the article that 'only Iran can disarm Hezbollah.' According to him, despite the severe blow, Hezbollah still has a significant fighting force in the south that can operate independently. 'But over time,' he emphasized, 'Hezbollah will feel the lack of money. That will be the biggest problem. And when the Shias return to the south, who will rebuild?' At night, from the roof of a hotel in Beirut, the reporter describes orange flames erupting from the southern outskirts of the city following an airstrike. 'It looks like a volcanic eruption,' he writes. A group of young Lebanese at a nearby table film the spectacle on their phones and return to their cocktails. Meanwhile, about a quarter of Lebanon's population has been displaced. At Beirut airport, Worth writes that he saw people sleeping outside hoping to get a ticket for a flight out. Foreign airlines have stopped their flights, and more than 300,000 Syrian refugees have fled back to Syria – evidence, he says, of the depth of fear prevailing in the country.

Telegram’s hate speech increased 433% after October 7 massacre	The messaging platform's new privacy policies useless, experts say; Following CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in August, hopes rose for better moderation, but no significant steps taken to curb platform's hate and antisemitism Since the October 72023 Hamas massacre, which marked one of the deadliest days for Jews since the Holocaust, antisemitic speech has spread online like wildfire. Telegram, known for its stringent privacy features and minimal content moderation, has since become a bastion for groups that incite violence against Jews and the Jewish State. A newly released report by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) tracked a sample of 793 channels/groups and 7,769 users, representing those who posted at least one violent antisemitic or anti-Israel message between April 2023 and 2024. The analysis found that on the day of the attacks antisemitic posts surged by 433.76%, skyrocketing from an average of 238.12 to 1,271 daily. While this spike has diminished, the current average of 321.22 daily posts remains significantly higher than pre-attack levels. Antisemitic conspiracy theories spreading across various platforms include false accusations that Israelis harvest organs from Palestinians, accusations that Jews were responsible for the 9/11 attacks, that Jews control the media and the U.S. government, that Jews promote the 'LGBTQ+ agenda,' and denying or distorting Israel's role in the October 7, 2023, attacks, falsely suggesting Israel orchestrated the violence. The influence of antisemitic content is measured by the volume of posts and user engagement, particularly by how frequently these posts are shared. Analysis by the ADL revealed that, before October 7, an average of 12.18 unique users forwarded extreme antisemitic posts weekly and this surged to 20.96 after that date. Additionally, the weekly forwarding of violent antisemitic and anti-Israel messages rose from 204.03 to 346.4. Daniel Kelley, director of Strategy and Operations and Head of the ADL Center for Technology & Society, discussed the report's concerning findings. 'After the arrest by French authorities (of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov) earlier this year, Telegram started sharing some data with governments, which they hadn’t done before. However, they haven’t changed their core rules,' Kelley said. 'They did add one rule to their terms of service, which says if something is illegal in many countries, they will take action. But they still don’t have fundamental content moderation measures in place. Telegram doesn’t prohibit hate speech or have rules against extremism or support for extremists,' according to Kelley. Although many experts consider these basic standards and platforms try to enforce them, Telegram seems hesitant to acknowledge that hate against marginalized groups isn’t acceptable on their platform, even in light of its recent attempt to prohibit notoriously illegal content. Arik Segal, the founder and CEO of Conntix, a consultancy facilitating effective and constructive communication on virtual platforms, highlighted how and why Telegram’s privacy changes won’t have the desired effect. 'I don't think the new privacy policies will have any impact. First, I believe that most people are not aware of the changes. Second, people don't see hateful messaging as a crime but as a legitimate communication method. Lastly, I don't think the police will have time and resources to deal with anything that is not strictly criminal, so people will not see any enforcement,' he said. According to Segal, curbing hate requires legal and technological changes done in coordination to protect free speech while shutting down antisemitism. Segal explained that local laws about hate and incitement are the first steps to fix this problem since platforms like Telegram have a business model that thrives on viral, often fake content, including antisemitic conspiracies. 'In short, they will only act if there is a threatening regulation,' highlighted the CEO of Conntix. David Strom, a leading technical expert on digital technologies with more than 35 years writing about online communications based in St. Louis, said he also is skeptical that Telegram’s new privacy policies will have the desired effect. 'Telegram better be more reactive, or they will get massive fines. I believe that businesses that rely on Telegram for their communications will switch to strongly encrypted emails and VPNs that don’t share users' data and migrate from Telegram to Signal for messaging, for example,' according to Strom. Even with newly devised AI tools to provide moderation, Strom is doubtful of their efficiency. 'To do content moderation properly, you need human eyes on and a big enough staff to fix the problems of false positive flags.' With Telegram’s CEO recently saying that his platform only employs 'about 30 engineers,' it is clear to experts that antisemitism will continue to flourish there. Considering Telegram’s unwillingness to take efficient measures, it remains in the hands of public authorities to do something. 'As long as people don't hear about a person that was thrown into jail due to controversial speech, they will not change their behavior. The police will not act since they don't have the willingness and resources to do so,' Segal said. Despite many who believe that hateful and violent content is a matter of opinion, Kelley explained that 'we’re not dealing with grey areas here, like questioning whether something is hate or not. The new rules are focused specifically on illegal content – things like terrorism and child pornography, which are illegal in most countries. They’re now prohibiting activities like child abuse and selling illicit goods, including weapons. For example, selling guns on Telegram is now explicitly banned, which wasn’t the case before. But even then enforcement is spotty. Telegram has had a rule for years against promoting violence on publicly viewable channels, but ADL found channels sharing footage from the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel and celebrating it. As Telegram seems indifferent to the violent and racist content on its platform, the ADL took the issue to other players in the high-tech sector, but the measures can still be avoided. Equally powerful to help curb antisemitism online, Google and Apple have restricted access to specific channels on Telegram. These online forums remained accessible via browsers or other means outside Apple and Google’s ecosystems. Kelley considers these measures the bare minimum and not measures that could be regarded as debatable since they promote explicit violence and hate. Concerned about how to fight back against hate speech on Telegram, Kelley doesn’t believe it is the right platform to do such work because most radicalized people are unwilling to review their worldview. 'They’re unmoveable in that sense,' he said. Other platforms could be a more efficient way to reach people who aren’t fully committed to extremist positions, according to the expert from the ADL. 'TikTok, YouTube or Facebook can be valuable where there’s more room for dialogue,' according to him. Fully aware that TikTok also has many problems, the ADL shared that TikTok usually addresses complaints when the ADL reports them. Still, when an average user reports them to TikTok, it is much less likely to be addressed. TikTok has recently updated its efforts to protect users amid the ongoing conflict. The platform has strengthened its Community Guidelines, expanding policies against hate speech to include indirect references to antisemitism, such as the misuse of the term 'Zionist.' TikTok reports removing over 4.7 million videos and suspending 300,000 livestreams for violations related to hate speech and misinformation since October 7, 2023. The company has also removed 500 million fake accounts globally, significantly ramping up content moderation with enhanced automated tools and trained moderators. Initiatives like the #SwipeOutHate campaign aim to engage the community in reporting hateful content. -This article is written by Nathan Klabin and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hknqlbhb1e	2024-11-03T10:26:32-08:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/17/BJuH1LhZT/BJuH1LhZT_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Iranian woman takes off her clothes at a Tehran university to pro...	The young woman was filmed walking in a bra and underwear at Azad University in Tehran, reportedly after being 'harassed' by Basij militia members enforcing Iran's strict morality laws; Iranian authorities claim she 'suffers from mental health issues' A young woman was arrested after undressing at a university in Tehran, according to reports from Iran. Sources associated with opposition to the Ayatollah regime claimed the woman was protesting Iran’s strict hijab laws, while state-affiliated media asserted that she suffered from mental health issues. Footage of Saturday's incident circulated on social media, showing the young woman walking in a bra and underpants, leaving onlookers stunned at Azad University in Tehran. In another video, she appears to be detained by authorities and taken into a vehicle. According to various reports on social media, the woman was allegedly 'harassed' earlier by members of the Basij militia at Azad University, which is considered a prestigious educational institution in Iran. Though the credibility of these reports remains unclear, they were also cited by the French news agency AFP. Some accounts claim that Basij members 'forcibly removed' the woman’s hijab and outer clothing, prompting her to strip down to her undergarments in protest and walk outside the university. An Iranian student news outlet, Amir Kabir Newsletter, alleged she was assaulted during her arrest. The incident sparked widespread reactions on social media. 'For most women, being seen in underwear in public is a nightmare … this is her response to the government’s stubborn insistence on enforcing hijab laws,' wrote one user on the X platform. Meanwhile, Iranian state media insisted that the woman is struggling with alleged mental health issues. The popular Iranian daily Hamshahri quoted a 'well-informed source' who suggested she would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. A spokesperson for Azad University also claimed the woman has 'severe psychological issues.'

IDF captures Iranian Revolutionary Guard operative in Syria	Syrian citizen spying on Israel for Iran says he was 'told to watch the borders' during interrogation in Israel; IDF: Arrest 'prevented a future attack and led to the exposure of the operational methods of Iranian terror networks located near the Golan Heights' An Iranian terrorist operative was recently arrested in Syrian territory, the IDF spokesman announced Sunday evening. The arrest was carried out in recent months during a nighttime operation in southern Syria, by the soldiers of the Egoz unit with field investigators of Unit 504, under the command of Division 210 and with intelligence guidance. The detained spy, Ali Soleiman al-Assi, a Syrian citizen who lives in Saida in southern Syria, was employed by Iran and engaged in gathering intelligence on IDF forces in the border area for future terrorist activity. Al-Aasi was under close surveillance by IDF forces, and he is under investigation in Israel by members of Unit 504 and the security forces. 'The operation by Israel Defense Forces troops to detain al-Assi prevented a future attack and led to the exposure of the operational methods of Iranian terror networks located near the Golan Heights,' an IDF spokesperson said. The Saudi channel Al-Hadith reported Sunday afternoon that an Israeli commando force entered Syria and kidnapped a Syrian working with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. According to Syrian reports, in July an IDF force accompanied by military vehicles entered the village of Al-Razania, in the south of the Quneitra district, arrested the citizen Ali Soleiman al-Assi at his home, and transferred him to Israeli territory. The reports claim that he worked transporting milk to Damascus and it is not clear why the report was published on the Syrian Voice of the Capitol website, which is affiliated with the opposition in the country, and on a local Syrian website. 'It is possible that Israel disrupted UNIFIL radars to reach northern Lebanon coast' This is the second time in the last day that the IDF admits, unusually, that its forces arrested terrorist operatives in enemy territory in a special operation. Last night it was allowed to be published that in a special operation of the 13th Fleet arrested a senior Hezbollah operative in the town of Batroun in northern Lebanon who is an expert in his field. The detainee, Imad Fadel Amhaz, was transferred to Israel and interrogated by Unit 504. The IDF confirmed that in a special commando operation together with the Navy, the flotilla's force intercepted an active member of Hezbollah, 'who is an expert in the maritime field.' Officials in Israel said Saturday that the operation, according to one, 'primarily shows operational boldness, they come and simply pick upsomeone from deep in Lebanon.' An official said that the arrested activist is 'a man who was a significant operational factor in military capabilities, such as those used by Hezbollah in the Second Lebanon War.' On Sunday morning, the Lebanese networks published a comment by the arrested man's father, Fadel, who claimed that his son was not involved in politics. The Arabic-language Saudi newspaper ASharq Al-Awsat, which is published in London, published new details about the arrest in Batroun on Sunday. A legal source told the newspaper that the Information Department of the Internal Security in Lebanon has opened an investigation into the incident, and that it will take 'at least three days to find out the details of the operation and the method the Israelis used to carry it out successfully.' A security source quoted in the newspaper said that there are several scenarios which the Israelis could have used, and that the investigation so far has not determined whether the forces reached the shore with boats or helicopters. According to the newspaper, the UNIFIL forces informed the Lebanese side that they too had begun an investigation to determine the measures taken by the IDF. The source said that it is possible that Israel had disrupted the radars of the UNIFIL forces, which made it easier for the Israeli forces to reach the coast without being discovered by UNIFIL or the Lebanese army, but so far this has not been confirmed. UNIFIL forces enjoy international immunity and therefore the Lebanese mechanisms cannot investigate them, unless they cooperate and deliver the information requested by Lebanon. The forces operating in Lebanon do not have to deliver to Lebanon the results of the special investigation they conduct, but can only submit them to the UN Secretary General. In February, the Syrian news site Nidaa al-Watan reported from sources that Mataa al-Sarhan, a senior member of Baath - the ruling party in Syria - disappeared after leaving his home in the village of al-Rafid in the Quneitra district of Syria. In media affiliated with the country's opposition there were various reports about his fate - some claimed that he was kidnapped in front of his house, others reported that he fled to Israel and, according to one report, he had been in Israel and was released back to Syria. The Syrian regime and the official media did not comment on the incident.

Nahariya man, 57, dies two weeks after being hit by rocket shrapn...	Edward Salulov couldn't reach the shelter in time when sirens sounded in the northern city of Nahariya, and was critically injured by shrapnel from an intercepted rocket; After two weeks, he has succumbed to his wounds; 'He taught children how to catch fish and tie hooks,' a local said Edward Salulov, 57. from Nahariya, was injured about two weeks ago on the evening of the Simchat Torah holiday by shrapnel from an interceptor during a Hezbollah barrage targeting the city. He was unable to reach a shelter on the seaside promenade and was critically injured by two pieces of shrapnel. On Sunday morning, after 11 days during which intensive care teams at the Galilee Medical Center fought for his life and performed several surgeries, he was pronounced dead. Salulov had been a resident of Nahariya since 1990. He was divorced and had four children with whom he had not been in contact for over a decade. He maintained contact with two of his nephews living in the city. One nephew, Arthur Korginyan, noted that Sululov lived alone and that his mother had died about seven years ago. He is also survived by a sister who lives in Holon. Salulov once leapt into the water and saved the lives of two children who were drowning at sea According to Korginyan, his uncle was a fisherman. 'We were on good terms. He worked for years at Soglowek (an Israeli food company), and, following an injury at work, he could no longer continue working. All of Nahariya knew him. He taught children how to catch fish and tie hooks. He managed to catch a 26-lb. amberjack fish from the shore.' Korginyan also shared that about two years ago Salulov leapt into the water and saved the lives of two children who were drowning at sea. 'He was always ready to help, forgetting all his problems and only remembering to help others. He was an unfortunate man with no luck in life.' Korginyan, a boxing coach, added that Salulov used to send 'weak people' to him, asking him to train them 'so that they wouldn't get hurt.'

Rabin family will request cancellation of state memorial amid war	The family of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin is requesting that the official ceremonies at Mount Herzl, a special session in the Knesset, and an event at the president's residence marking his assassination be cancelled The family of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Yitzhak Rabin Center plan to request that the state cancel this year’s memorial ceremonies for Rabin due to the ongoing war. This year’s commemoration of Rabin’s assassination is scheduled for November 13, the anniversary date on the Hebrew calendar. Events would include the official ceremony at the Great Leaders of the Nation's Plot on Mount Herzl, a special session in the Knesset, and a gathering at the president’s residence. Dalia Rabin, Rabin’s daughter, did not issue a response, and his granddaughter, Noa Rothman also said in a statement that she could not comment on the report. On Saturday night, November 4, 1995, Rabin attended a peace rally in Tel Aviv's Kings of Israel Square in Tel Aviv. . As he was walking back to his car he was assassinated by gunman Yigal Amir. Last month, it was reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to miss the state ceremony at Mount Herzl’s national leaders’ section, after the government secretariat notified ministers that the prime minister 'will not be able to attend this ceremony' and requested they designate a representative to lay the government’s wreath on his behalf. Last year, Netanyahu also missed the ceremony, sending then-Minister Ofir Akunis in his place. His absence drew sharp criticism, including from the leader of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz, who said in a statement that 'Netanyahu’s decision to miss the official memorial for Yitzhak Rabin is unstatesmanlike, but, more seriously, it is a failure of leadership. Regardless of criticism, Israel’s prime minister must do the right thing, honor the memory of a slain prime minister, and attend the ceremony –not for his own obligation, but for the State of Israel and all its citizens.'

IDF troops raid Hezbollah terrorist compound	During limited, localized, targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence by the 36th Division, troops of Shayetet 13, the Yahalom Unit, and the Oketz Unit, with support from the 282nd Brigade, conducted a raid on a Hezbollah terrorist compound, the IDF announced on Sunday. Hezbollah intended to use this compound to plan and execute an infiltration into Israeli territory and attacks on IDF troops. Within the compound, the soldiers located underground infrastructure and hideouts equipped with logistical and medical supplies for prolonged stays, military tents, and pits stocked with weapons, according to the IDF. The troops also located and destroyed rocket launchers, high-powered explosives ready to be activated, anti-tank missiles, mortar shells, AK-47 rifles, surface-to-air missiles, and a launcher concealed in a mountain on a several-meter track aimed directly at civilian communities in northern Israel.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyzubzswyx	2024-11-03T06:25:22-08:00

Harris and Trump locked in tight race in swing states, NYT/Siena ...	Close races in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, according to the poll, which surveyed 7,879 likely voters in the seven states from Oct. 24 to Nov. 2.; In Iowa, Harris up likely thanks to women, after Trump wins state in 2016, 2020 Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump remain in a tight race in the country's seven battleground states two days before the U.S. presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College poll. The opinion poll showed Vice President Harris with marginal leads in Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin and former President Trump just ahead in Arizona. The two are in close races in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, according to the poll, which surveyed 7,879 likely voters in the seven states from Oct. 24 to Nov. 2. In all seven states, the matchups were within the poll's 3.5% margin of error. About 40% of the respondents had already voted and Harris led among those voters by 8 percentage points, while Trump leads with voters who have said they are very likely to vote but have not yet done so, the poll found. The tied race in Pennsylvania shows Trump gaining momentum in a state Harris had led by four percentage points in all prior New York Times polls, the outlet said. Both candidates are campaigning in battleground states this weekend, with Trump set to appear in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday, while Harris will campaign in Michigan. But in Iowa, a new poll released on Saturday, conducted by Ann Selzer for the Des Moines Register/Mediacom, showed Harris surpassed Trump in the state he won in 2016 and 2020, likely thanks to women voters, responsible for the turnaround. The poll of 808 likely voters, who were surveyed Oct. 28-31, has Harris leading Trump 47%-44% in Iowa, which has been trending deeply Republican in recent years. It is within the 3.4 percentage point margin of error, but it marked a turnaround from a September Iowa Poll that had Trump with a 4-point lead, the newspaper reported. 'The poll shows that women, particularly those who are older or who are politically independent â€' are driving the late shift toward Harris,' the Register said. Trump won Iowa in his past two presidential campaigns by more than 9 percentage points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. The Trump campaign released a memo from its chief pollster and its chief data consultant calling the Des Moines Register poll 'a clear outlier,' and saying that an Emerson College poll - also released Saturday - more closely reflected the state of the Iowa electorate. The Emerson College Polling/RealClearDefense survey of a similar number of likely voters Nov. 1-2 had a starkly different result, with Trump leading Harris by 10 points. This poll also has a 3.4 percentage point margin of error. The Emerson College survey had Trump with strong leads over Harris among men and independents, while Harris was performing well with those under the age of 30. Whoever wins Iowa will collect six Electoral College votes. A total of 270 are needed to capture the White House. Both parties have been concentrating their efforts during the closing days of their campaigns on 'battleground' states such as North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

Look them in the eyes': Former hostage shares new photos from ca...	Agam Goldstein-Almog abducted with her mother and younger siblings after her father and sister are murdered takes to social media to slam the government's inaction to bring about the release of those still held captive Former hostage Agam Goldstein-Almog shared new images on Sunday from her time held in Gaza, urging for the release of the 101 hostages still being held captive after 394 days. 'Look them in the eyes; how much longer will you ask them to survive like this?' she wrote in an Instagram post, accompanied by two photos. In one, she stands beside her younger siblings, Gal and Tal, who were abducted alongside her. Her father, Nadav, was murdered on October 7. 'Just sitting there in a tunnel in Gaza, photographed, begging to come home,' wrote the 18-year-old. 'With tired, frightened eyes that had just witnessed the worst and feared what more they might see. Today, November 3, 2024, on this date last year, I had no idea that in three weeks I'd be free, no idea if I’d even survive if I'd see other hostages. I was afraid of what my eyes would see. I didn't want to witness more tragedy or pain. 'These eyes — eyes that likely will never fully express all they've seen. Eyes that each day there, looked at the clock, waiting without knowing what for. Eyes that saw the other hostages up close. I looked into your eyes, not knowing it would take so much longer. How can we still look you in the eye? What will we say to you? What do you see there? What's being done to you from the day we parted? 'Today, I look at you through my own eyes and see people who don't place you first on their list of priorities. I see you, and then I see your mother fighting for you everywhere she can. I see two worlds and know what you're seeing there. Look into my tired, lost eyes in the photo and tell me I’d have to survive like that for another 51 days. I wouldn’t have believed it. And I'm angry because so much would have been spared if they'd freed me even a week earlier. Even a single day earlier. 'So what can I say about them? Soon it'll be 400 days and to think of all we could have spared them from seeing. And how much we continue to add with every delay. Look them in the eyes; how much longer will you ask them to survive like this?' In an interview with The Washington Post published in January, Goldstein-Almog spoke about the sexual abuse of those who remain in captivity, revealing that hostages she encountered in the tunnel confided in her that they had been sexually assaulted. In the tunnel where she and her family stayed for a week before their release, Agam met six women, some of whom were injured to varying degrees. The teen recounted that she and her mother treated their wounds using the limited means available. The teen shared that some of the women were held in isolation, separated from others, in small rooms with their daughters. When they met these women, some tearfully and with great difficulty revealed that they had been sexually assaulted. 'It was the first question we asked when we realized we were alone: 'How do they treat you?' Suddenly, they had someone they could share with and break down in front of - cry together.' Agam was released on November 26. On the day of her release, she said: 'Suddenly they came and told us to be ready at nine in the morning. The other girls, who were not supposed to be released, they lied to: 'Maybe tomorrow, Inshallah, maybe tomorrow.''

Tories pick pro-Israel Kemi Badenoch as new leader	The 44-year-old North West Essex MP is declared the winner of a lengthy leadership after beating Robert Jenrick; the new conservative boss is outspoken in her support for Israel; 'The time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles.' Kemi Badenoch has won the race to become the next leader of the Conservative Party. The 44-year-old North West Essex MP, who has been a staunch supporter of Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu’s war efforts in Gaza and in Lebanon, was declared the winner of a lengthy leadership after beating Robert Jenrick. At a results ceremony in central London on Saturday it was confirmed that Badenoch had received 53,806 votes from members to Jenrick’s 41,388, leaving her the winner with 57% of the vote. Having served as shadow business and trade and communities in the previous government Badenoch has been outspoken in her support for Israel. Both she and Jenrick have repeatedly expressed support for the Conservative Friends of Israel organization, appearing at their hustings event last month, and both penning letters to the group. Badenoch wrote: 'If I am leader of the Conservative Party, we will continue to strengthen our ties with Israel and root out the tragic resurgence of antisemitism in the UK. We will be true to our values.' She added 'We stand on the edge' of Labour 'reversing' the UK’s strong relationship with Israel built by the previous Conservative government. Last month she said Israel was showing 'moral clarity in dealing with its enemies' in the war with Hamas and Hezbollah. In an interview with Sky News host Trevor Phillips she said she would be 'congratulating Prime Minister Netanyahu' in dealing with 'enemies of the West.' Asked if she was ready to give Israel a 'free pass' if she became PM, Badenoch said: 'It’s not about a free pass, Israel does have a right to defend itself… If we look at what happened on October 7 we can see they cannot be complacent,' she said adding 'of course there will be red lines, we have international law for that.' Badenoch also flew to Israel to engage in on-going talks for a new free trade agreement with the Jewish state, which has yet to be concluded. In terms of tackling antisemitism at home, Badenoch strongly disputed claims by Lord Mann, that she had no interest in discussing the problem with him when she was Communities Secretary. Conservative former justice minister Lord Wolfson, a supporter of Badenoch’s, claimed: 'That’s not my experience of her, nor that of many others.' In comments about the pro-Palestine demos in the UK, Badenoch said: 'Our streets were soon filled with hordes of joyous people, not appalled at the acts of terror or demanding the perpetrators be brought to justice, but instead protesting against Jews under the guise of attacking Israel.' After the final result was announced Badenoch said the Tory Party was 'critical to the success of our country' but 'the time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles, to plan for our future, to reset our politics and our thinking.' Prime Minister Keir Starmer responded to the result saying the first election of a black leader in this UK was 'a proud moment for this country.' Badenoch’s shared of support from members was comparable to that achieve by former PM Liz Truss, but was less than that given to David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith.

Hezbollah's new tactic to confuse air defenses	terror group launches barrages made up of different projectiles, with a variety of ranges targeting different distances from the border at the same time, often adding drones into the mix Hezbollah implemented a new tactic to challenge Israel's air defenses in recent days, combining barrages of different-range rockets some precise and some 'stupid,' and launching at the same time, swarms of drones, all along the Israel-Lebanon border. The aim was to make it harder for the Iron Dome missile defense system and for radars, to detect and respond to specific threats. Since the morning hours, rocket attacks on the Western Galilee, Upper Galilee and Golan Heights came minutes apart. In one attack, The Iran-backed terror group targeted Western Galilee with a barrage of 10 rockets while 25 projectiles were fired at the Golan Heights. In an earlier attack, two longer-range missiles were fired at the Haifa Bay area and minutes later, a barrage targeted the Western Galilee communities closer to the border. IDF officials said they expected Hezbollah to launch more significant barrages in the war. They said they had braced for at least 150 different types of rockets and 10 drones in each attack. They attribute Hezbollah's limited strikes to the successes of the forces on the ground in South Lebanon, and the attacks on the terror group's arsenal of weapons along with the severe blow to the group's senior command after its leadership was assassinated and lower-level commanders were also killed in targeted strikes.

Rare flag and a lock of hair: Americana on auction ahead of elect...	New York auction house offers bizarre and rare items from the history of American presidents including a lock of George Washington’s hair, a flag that adorned Abraham Lincoln's casket Guernsey's‏, a New York auction house, launched a new event placing rare and unusual items in the U.S. presidential history for sale. The company said that some of the proceeds would go toward the construction of a new American museum. As the celebrations for the upcoming election unfold, rare items from U.S. presidential history are hitting the auction block, reminding everyone where it all began: a lock of George Washington’s hair, a flag that adorned Abraham Lincoln's casket, the plaster model for his famous statue in the Washington Monument and stunning presidential portraits from a family studio collection. The American flag that draped Abraham Lincoln's casket was seen by millions of Americans who bid farewell to the assassinated president in April 1865. Measuring 2.4 meters (7.9 feet) long, it covered the casket as it journeyed from Washington to his burial site in Springfield, Illinois and is now valued at between $800,000 and $1.2 million. Another unique American flag up for auction is a 49-star flag from 1959, created after Alaska joined the Union but before Hawaii became the 50th state. At the time, the government decided against producing more 49-star flags, anticipating Hawaii's upcoming statehood and the shift to 50-star flags. However, President Dwight Eisenhower's Oval Office still needed a distinguished display, so this impressive flag was specially crafted to stand behind his desk, symbolizing this unique moment in American history. As for George Washington, the auction house owners explained that a lock of his graying hair had been preserved in a locket that was gifted to a family friend and passed down through generations — until it reached a Philadelphia museum which is now putting it up for sale. The delicate hair, likely cut from Washington’s head shortly before or after his death in 1799 at age 67, is contained in a hand-crafted brass and glass locket. Also included in the auction are rare portraits from the Bachrach Studio, long considered a preferred choice for American presidents and now revealed to the public for the first time. Alongside these presidential portraits, including Franklin Roosevelt’s, are family snapshots from the Kennedy family, such as Jacqueline Kennedy’s wedding portrait. Among the special items is also the studio chair where numerous icons sat for their portraits, from Albert Einstein to Donald Trump and Meryl Streep. Founded in 1868, the Baltimore studio is the oldest continuously operating photography studio in the world, having documented every American president since Abraham Lincoln, including the only photo of him during his famous Civil War speech at the Gettysburg National Cemetery. Another famous presidential portrait of Abraham Lincoln available for auction was painted by artist Francis Bicknell Carpenter. Carpenter created this portrait as part of his preparations for the well-known painting 'First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln,' which currently hangs in the U.S. Capitol. Other famous paintings include the 'Monumental Lincoln Deathbed' by James Burnes, painted in 1866, along with the rare plaster model for the famous statue created by Daniel Chester French at the Washington, D.C. memorial. French, considered one of America’s greatest sculptors, created the figure of the 'Minute Man' in 1875, depicting a farmer who became a soldier in the Revolutionary War fighting for the young nation. The statue, located in the center of Concord, Massachusetts, became an American icon, used by the government during wartime to raise funds through war bonds and savings. Decades later, French received the honor of designing one of the most iconic and beloved works in the U.S.: his statue of Abraham Lincoln at the famous memorial in Washington. The rare plaster models for these two renowned works will also be up for sale. Other artistic works being auctioned include impressionistic portrait sculptures of presidents by sculptor Robert Berks — the first to have his works featured on the cover of Time magazine. His statue of John F. Kennedy also received the exceptional honor of being displayed above the podium at the White House.

I was Donald’s closest friend': disgraced pedophile says in reco...	Jeffrey Epstein tells Michal Wolf in an interview how Trump goes after the wives of his friends; had undergone surgery for hair loss and was incapable of showing affection; The Trump campaign says the claims are false and are elections interference Recordings released on Sunday by entertainment outlet The Daily Beast revealed that Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in his jail cell, referred to himself as 'Donald Trump's closest friend' and shared intimate details about Trump’s sex life, including instances of him cuckolding his close friends. The convicted pedophile even boasted about his friendship with the U.S. former president and his now-wife Melania, claiming, 'The first time he slept with her was on my plane.' The aircraft, known as the 'Lolita Express,' also transported Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Kevin Spacey, Naomi Campbell and numerous young girls who later alleged rape and sexual assault. Epstein spoke at length about Trump with author Michael Wolff in August 2017, two years before he was found dead in his cell. Wolff was then working on his book Fire and Fury, which went on to sell 5 million copies. Trump tried at the time to prevent the book’s publication. The recordings shed new light on the longstanding relationship between Trump and Epstein, and their release — just two days before the U.S. election — adds to discussions about the Republican candidate’s character, especially regarding his attitude toward women. Trump’s camp called the recordings 'false smears' and 'election interference.' In the recordings, Epstein described Trump as 'charming' and 'always fun,' hinting at his support for Trump’s policies on various issues, including 'the transgender stuff.' However, he alleged that Trump was a serial cheater during his marriages and liked 'to f*** the wives of his best friends.' He also claimed Trump was a person without real friends at heart and was incapable of showing affection. Epstein alleged that Trump had undergone surgery for hair loss. 'How do you know all this?' Wolff asked Epstein, who responded, 'I was Donald’s closest friend for 10 years.' On Thursday, Wolff caused a stir by releasing a brief clip in which Epstein spoke at length about working within Trump’s inner circle. Wolff also claimed that the convicted millionaire pedophile showed him photos of Trump with topless young women sitting on his lap. Wolff, a veteran journalist who also authored Rupert Murdoch’s biography, said that he possesses around 100 hours of interview recordings with Epstein. He said he decided to release some of them following a new accusation against Trump — Miss Switzerland 1992, Beatrice Kohl, alleged that he sexually harassed her a year after her win. 'He was grabbing and touching my body everywhere he could,' she recounted. Epstein was first arrested in Florida 2005, accused of paying a 14-year-old girl for sexual favors. Dozens of other minors described similar sexual offenses, but prosecutors ultimately allowed him to plead to only one charge. He served 13 months in jail. Some high-profile associates distanced themselves from Epstein after his conviction, including former U.S. presidents Clinton and Trump, while others didn’t. In 2019, Epstein was arrested again on charges of trafficking dozens of girls for sex and later died by suicide in his cell.

IDF cuts Jabaliya off from Gaza City in prolonged operation	The military says most civilians have already left leaving hundreds of Hamas terrorists and the remaining civilians surrounded by troops; IDF officials say at least six months are needed to clear northern Gaza from Hamas The IDF cut off Jabaliya from Gaza City in its weeks-long assault. The forces took control of the area and allowed civilians out through dedicated passages where they were monitored with facial recognition technology to prevent terrorists from escaping. Thus far some 600 suspected Hamas terrorists have been captured and detained for interrogation by security forces. The forces in effect implemented part of a plan devised by former high-ranking members of the military, to prevent humanitarian aid from reaching areas under Hamas control and thereby undermine its rule. In the first week of the assault, Jabaliya was surrounded, while the military urged civilians to leave but after American pressure, aid was once again allowed in, straight to the hands of Hamas. Tens of thousands of civilians, no longer fearful of the terrorists, chose to leave but thousands remain. The military increased the use of artillery fire after the risk of civilian casualties was reduced. Jabaliya was considered a Hamas stronghold in the northern part of the Strip and many of the terrorists returned there after the IDF withdrew its forces earlier in the year. The forces said they found the entrance to the city laced with explosives that caused casualties to the troops but said they were less sophisticated than in other areas. Hamas, having studied the movements of the forces, began booby-trapping the upper floors of buildings, believing the soldiers shelled lower floors only, before entering the structures. Hamas opted to use their explosive material on booby traps which were more effective than directing them at the troops maneuvering outside. 'We found an exhausted population, hungry and weak, arriving at our ports of passage and without civilians, Hamas cannot exist,' IDF officials said. 'Interrogations of terrorists have been useful and provide intelligence on where the Hamas planted explosives and where they keep their weapons.' The IDF said several hundred terrorists still remain in Jabaliya, behind their fortifications, requiring the military to continue operating there for at least a few more days. The ongoing operation was made possible after more aid was delivered. Medical equipment has also been brought into the local Kamal Adwan hospital. The IDF said the terrorists and civilians have enough supplies to last them a month although more aid is making its way into the besieged areas. Some officials in the military said it would take at least six months to clear northern Gaza of Hamas forces.

Israel's academic year begins, the second since war	Higher education institution heads make effort to support reserve soldiers throughout year but warn budget cuts and other restrictions could harm academia and the country Israeli higher education institutions opened the academic year on Sunday amid the backdrop of the Gaza war for the second consecutive time, as tens of thousands of students — some still actively serving in the reserves — head to universities and colleges. Data from universities and colleges indicate that one in five students served in the reserves in the last academic year — marking about 70,000 students — and similar numbers are expected this year. Ahead of the academic year, university heads pledged to continue supporting reservists to minimize the impact on them and help them complete their degrees. They also showed concern about anticipated cuts to higher education, urging funds be allocated to address these challenges and were also troubled by the growing phenomenon of boycotts against Israeli institutions and researchers worldwide. Universities report a significant number of reservists already mobilized, with more expected to do so throughout the year. At the Hebrew University, 2,000 reservists will start the year, while Tel Aviv University has about 1,600, Ariel University has 1,900, Ben-Gurion University has 1,700, a similar number at Bar-Ilan University and over 1,000 at the Technion. A breakdown by field of study reveals that a large proportion of these reservists are enrolled in engineering, medicine and law faculties. The war’s effects are also reflected in students’ choice of study fields. Universities report an increase in students enrolling in therapeutic fields like psychology, social work, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Additionally, education studies are seeing ongoing growth in study interest alongside rising regard for technology and engineering fields. Ariel University reports a 15% increase in the number of students starting medical studies this year. Meanwhile, the war has driven a significant increase in demand for Arabic language and literature studies (40%) as well as Islamic and Middle Eastern studies (31%). According to data from Haifa’s Technion, enrollment interest remains unaffected by the ongoing war. 'We’ll likely open the new academic year under the threat of rocket fire,' said Technion President Prof. Uri Sivan. 'The Technion is probably the only university in the world directly protected by technologies developed by its alumni — the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow are just a few examples.' He added that harm to Israeli academia through budget cuts, threats to its independence, or restrictive laws would severely impact Israel’s future — its security, economy and society. 'I invite everyone to imagine what the current war would look like without our technological advantage and how the economy could support the war without advanced industries,' he said.

American Iranian journalist jailed for months in Iran	Detention of Reza Valizadeh, former staffer of an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that’s overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media to increase tensions with the U.S. ahead of threatened strike on Israel An Iranian-American journalist who once worked for a U.S. government-funded broadcaster is believed to be detained by Iran for months now, authorities said Sunday, further raising the stakes as Tehran threatens to retaliate over an Israeli attack on the country. The imprisonment of Reza Valizadeh, acknowledged to The Associated Press by the U.S. State Department, came as Iran marked the 45th anniversary of the American Embassy takeover and hostage crisis on Sunday. The event took place days ahead of the US elections pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Kamala Harris. It also followed Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatening both Israel and the U.S. the day before with 'a crushing response' as long-range B-52 bombers reached the Middle East in an attempt to deter Tehran. 'The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation and the resistance front,' Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran. Valizadeh had worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that’s overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. In February, he wrote on the social platform X that his family members had been detained in an effort to see him return to Iran. In August, Valizadeh apparently posted two messages suggesting he had returned to Iran despite Radio Farda being viewed by Iran’s theocracy as a hostile outlet.

IDF forces were near Sinwar 5 times, Hamas claims	Forces were mere dozens of meters away from a house in the Khan Younis neighborhood where Sinwar was hiding alone, accompanied only by a bodyguard who helped him stay hidden, Hamas sources say Hamas sources told Arab news outlet Asharq Al-Awsat on Saturday that former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was nearly killed by IDF troops in the Gaza Strip five times, before his ultimate death back in October. According to the sources, Sinwar maintained contact with senior Hamas officials via letters delivered in a method he devised, moved from place to place based on the presence of IDF forces in the area, relayed messages to Hamas members and mediators abroad and even informed his family when his nephew, who accompanied him died but that message reached them only two days after he, himself was killed. During the IDF’s offensive in Khan Younis last January the Hamas sources said Sinwar was hiding in one of his tunnels in the city north of Rafah. They referred to a video showing Sinwar walking through tunnels with his family, released by the IDF. They said the IDF intercepted recordings showing Sinwar moving around and delivering several items to a tunnel he and his family occupied just hours before the October 7 attack. 'Sinwar insisted on staying' 'But Israel was unable to reach him in the Khan Younis tunnels, nor could they get to him above ground,' the sources said. As the military operation expanded, both above and below ground, Sinwar was forced to find a safe place for his wife and children, distancing them from him due to Israel's relentless pursuit. They said the wife and children were unharmed and received letters from him at least every six weeks. 'As the military operation in Khan Younis intensified, Sinwar insisted on staying there and parted several times from his brother Mohammed and Rafa'a Salameh, Hamas’ Khan Younis Brigade Commander,' who was killed last July alongside Mohammed Deif, 'whom he met occasionally since the start of the war in safe houses or tunnels,' the sources claimed. They explained that the four weren't always together, meeting at times and spending hours or even days before parting based on the situation on the ground. The sources revealed there were instances when IDF forces were mere dozens of meters away from a house in the Khan Younis neighborhood where Sinwar was hiding alone, accompanied only by a bodyguard who helped him stay hidden. They added that Sinwar 'was armed and prepared for a possible IDF raid on the house where he was located and to confront them if they approached. However, movements by Hamas operatives from house to house led to street battles with IDF forces, revealing Sinwar’s presence within the house.' The sources said that Sinwar was immediately extracted from the house through openings Hamas operatives had created in adjacent homes and was subsequently moved to a safe house approximately one kilometer (0.62 miles) from his previous location. Before being relocated from the second to a third hiding place, he met with his brother Mohammed and Rafa'a Salameh, after which the three parted ways as the military maneuver expanded in the area where they were located. From Khan Younis to Rafah The sources added that, under pressure from his brother, Salameh and Hamas operatives, Sinwar was forced to leave Khan Younis for Rafah back in February. According to them, Israeli forces at the time had almost complete control of Khan Younis and had imposed a siege. 'However, he was safely transferred to Rafah through operations above and below ground,' they said. The sources revealed that Sinwar’s nephew, Ibrahim Mohammed Sinwar, didn’t leave his uncle’s side throughout the war. They added that Ibrahim was killed last August in an Israeli strike when he exited a tunnel opening to monitor military movements while with his uncle in Rafah. They added that Sinwar sent a letter to his brother's family explaining the circumstances of Ibrahim’s death and the location of his burial in an underground tunnel. 'He pointed out the burial location and mentioned that he himself had prayed over the body,' they reported. Hamas sources noted that the delay in the message reaching Mohammed Sinwar’s family 'demonstrates the difficult and complex conditions,' in which the terror organization’s leader lived, as well as the stringent measures he took to avoid any security breaches through which Israel could easily locate him. 'This also explains the thinking that his death was an 'accident',' they claimed. The sources reported that Sinwar had been in Rafah for several months, moving through various parts of the city. 'Since the end of last May, he remained in its western areas, moving both above and below ground. He was in multiple tunnels in Rafah, including the one where the six hostages were killed.' According to them, this indicated he made the final decision to execute them after Israeli forces came close to him last September. While separated from his relatives and commanders, he exchanged letters with them using certain security methods he devised himself. The sources said that the same method applied to his communications with Hamas leadership in Gaza and abroad — especially concerning contacts with mediators about any cease-fire agreement and hostage deal. The sources said that before his elimination, Sinwar and his companions suffered from food shortages, particularly in the last three days when they didn’t eat at all. 'They were preparing for a confrontation with Israeli forces and thus moved between several nearby damaged buildings,' they said. The sources explained that Hamas’ Tel al-Sultan Battalion commander, Mahmoud Hamdan made attempts to evacuate the Hamas leader to a safe location during their final 15 days in Rafah, but these efforts failed due to the intensity of military operations in the area in which the two were later located and eliminated. 'Israeli forces came close to Sinwar’s location many times — at least five times, three above ground and twice underground. Each time, Sinwar was relocated despite his insistence on participating in the fighting, which he did several times before being moved from locations where firefights took place,' they claimed. When asked if his incessant presence in Rafah was related to assessing the situation along the Philadelphi Corridor, particularly since he was killed only a few hundred meters (0.19 miles) away, the sources denied it. Other sources close to the terror organization suggested that his choice to remain there might have been part of a plan where Sinwar considered the potential for Israel’s gradual withdrawal from the area and its impact on a 'prisoner exchange' deal, as well as to assess the situation on the ground.

New details on abduction of Hezbollah operative in Lebanon	According to reports in the Lebanese press, the raid lasts no more than four minutes carried out by a 20-man team including 2 in civilian wear; IDF remotely erases some CCTV footage to mask details The abduction by Israeli commando forces, of a senior Hezbollah operative from a coastal town in north Lebanon, continued to fascinate local media after new reporting added details of the operation. Lebanon's al-Jadeed channel reported that the raid in Batrun, lasted only four minutes and was carried out by 20 people including soldiers and 2 civilians, like soldiers in civilian clothes. Al Jadeed also claimed as part of the Israeli effort to prevent details of the operation from being revealed, CCTV footage from the area of the raid, later taken by Lebanon's security forces, was remotely erased. The senior operative's wife reported the abduction. In his apartment, the Lebanese forces found 10 SIM cards with foreign numbers, a phone and foreign passports. Pictures showed one of the passports with PANAMA written on it in English. The abduction of Imad Amhaz, described by the military as a naval expert, took place early on Friday and was carried out by IDF naval commandos and military intelligence forces. Israeli sources confirmed its forces had carried out the operation some 140 kilometers (85 miles) north of the border.

Election day nears as demographics debate: Trump or Harris?	This election is one of the closest ones yet and both candidates are very unpopular. Voters this time, more so than in previous elections, are voting against someone, not for someone With only a few days until the U.S. presidential election, it is still unclear who will win. Last week, some polls began to show former U.S. President and Republican candidate Donald Trump edging past Vice President and Democratic contender Kamala Harris, with a 54% chance of winning. However, 'with the margin of error, this is still a very close race,' Drew McCoy, president of Decision Desk HQ, told The Media Line. 'The election will come down to turnout.' According to the latest Gallup Poll report, more than half (54%) of registered voters are expected to have voted by November 5. However, this is down from 64% in 2020, suggesting that more voters may cast their ballots in person this year — or possibly not show up at all. 'First, I cannot recall any election as close as this one,' Eytan Gilboa, a professor of international relations at Bar-Ilan University and an expert on U.S. elections, told The Media Line. 'Second, both candidates are very unpopular. Voters this time, more so than in previous elections, are voting against someone, not for someone. And when you vote against someone, it doesn't matter who is on the other side.' There is also extreme polarization between the Democratic and Republican parties, with voters barely agreeing on the most important issues. Although the economy is No. 1 for both sides, there are several other critical issues on the table that only Republicans or Democrats prioritize, such as immigration, abortion, or democracy. When it comes to the economy, people often don't seem to remember what actually happened during Trump's first term; instead, they recall a time when the economy was better and inflation was lower, according to Prof. Benjamin Miller of the University of Haifa. Trump presents himself as a billionaire, which projects an image of economic expertise. On the other hand, Harris lacks a strong record in financial affairs, leading to lower public trust in her economic management skills. Pro-Trump voters expect him to address issues at America’s southern border with Mexico related to illegal immigration. Pro-Harris voters, meanwhile, are concerned about the anti-abortion laws implemented since the reversal of Roe v. Wade, which was influenced by Trump's appointment of conservative judges to the Supreme Court. Harris voters are also focused on preserving democracy; Harris has accused Trump of being a fascist and argues that only she can safeguard the country's democracy and commitment to civil and human rights. Another major factor is foreign policy. According to Miller, Harris aims to continue America's 'grand strategy since World War II,' positioning the U.S. as a global leader committed to its allies, particularly NATO. On the other hand, Trump takes a more unilateral or isolationist approach, which could mean discontinuing support for Ukraine and potentially abandoning NATO. Are Jews and Muslims shifting their loyalties? Israel, the Gaza war, and the potential for a regional escalation involving Iran are also factors for U.S. voters this year. In Israel, where most people can't vote in the U.S. election, many favor a Trump victory. A recent poll by Israel's Channel 12 showed that 66% of Israelis support Trump, while only 17% support Harris. In contrast, a Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) survey found that 63% of American Jews plan to vote for Harris. However, this represents a drop in support from the Jewish community compared to Biden in 2020. Meanwhile, 24% of American Jews plan to vote for Trump, with 95% of Trump supporters citing his pro-Israel stance as the primary reason. Over 90% of these supporters believe a Trump Administration would strengthen U.S.-Israel relations, according to JPPI. A majority of Americans (56%) feel the current Biden Administration does not adequately support Israel. For Harris supporters, however, the survey showed that Israel is less central, with only a third listing it as a key voting issue. Meanwhile, the American Muslim community, which has historically supported Democratic candidates, is also shifting away from Harris. This year, for the first time in documented history, Michigan's Council on American-Islamic Relations is not endorsing a Democratic candidate. Michigan, home to the country's largest Arab American constituency — around 250,000 Muslims, nearly half of whom are eligible to vote — has seen mixed reactions, with some planning not to vote and others leaning toward Trump, according to a recent Reuters report. Similarly, younger, progressive Democrats critical of Harris's support for Israel are moving away from her. The Reuters article suggested many of these voters plan to cast protest votes for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. A survey by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research revealed that many U.S. voters are concerned that the Middle East conflict could escalate into a broader regional war. Miller noted that the public perceives Trump as more 'hostile to Iran,' which has orchestrated and funded much of the proxy war against Israel. Trump's decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal with Iran when he was president is seen as indicative of his hardline stance. 'One of Trump's arguments during this election campaign was that while he was in office, there were no major wars,' Miller added. Is America ready for a female president? In a country that prides itself on gender equality, gender is unexpectedly playing a significant role in this election. 'Another issue is whether or not the United States is really ready for a woman president,' Gilboa told The Media Line. Looking at the polls, about 80% of African American women plan to vote for Harris, but fewer than 50% of African American men say the same. The Harris campaign has even adopted a slogan, 'Be a man, vote for Harris,' which, according to Gilboa, suggests they recognize her struggle to gain support from men — whether white, Black, or Hispanic — despite Harris being a minority herself. Miller agreed. He explained that Trump's core supporters are white working-class voters, but he has recently gained traction among minority voters, particularly Latino and African American working-class males. For many of them, 'the idea that a woman, let alone a woman of color, could be president is hard to absorb.' Voter turnout: The deciding factor for the White House? According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2020 presidential election saw the highest voter turnout of the 21st century. Some 66.8% of citizens 18 and older voted. According to Decision Desk HQ's McCoy, voter turnout, at least in numbers if not percentage, is expected to be similar this year. In recent history, higher turnout has tended to favor Democrats, but McCoy noted this trend has shifted somewhat toward Republicans. 'Now, the Republicans want higher turnout, and the Democrats might want lower,' McCoy said. 'If you start to see higher turnout levels, that could benefit Trump and the Republicans.' There are seven key swing states to watch: North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. In most of these, polls show both candidates running neck and neck, with a slight Trump advantage in Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. 'Based on where things are now, there is a chance that those seven states — or at least five of the seven — go to one candidate,' McCoy said. 'North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are highly correlated.' Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have voted together since 1988, but this year is more of a toss-up. Analysts are watching closely to see if these states will stay aligned or diverge. McCoy explained that Harris's most straightforward path to the White House is to retain as much of the 2020 map as possible. This means she could lose North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada as long as she holds Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to secure the 270 electoral votes needed. If Trump retains North Carolina, as he did in 2020, and flips Georgia and Arizona in his favor, he could also reach 270. McCoy noted that Pennsylvania is particularly close. Harris had the chance to select a Jewish vice-presidential candidate from Pennsylvania, which has the most electoral votes of any swing state, but she chose Tim Walz from Minnesota instead. 'There is a lot of discussion about how much of a home-state advantage a candidate like [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro would have,' McCoy said. 'However, if Donald Trump wins Pennsylvania, people will certainly question it.' With just a few days left, the candidates are making last-minute efforts to sway undecided voters. Harris is working to attract Republicans who oppose Trump and is appealing to evangelical Christians — Trump's core base — to remind them that 'he is not a moral person, not a family man,' Gilboa said. Meanwhile, Trump is reaching out to American Muslims with messages focused on the economy and a stable Middle East. Who will be more convincing? The world will have to wait until Tuesday to find out.

Israel expresses doubt over hostage deal amid renewed talks	Mediators press on, yet Israeli officials warn Hamas’ demand to end war and withdraw from Gaza may block any small-scale deals; Israeli sources predict heavy US pressure to end war following upcoming election Despite renewed negotiations and mediator efforts, Israeli officials expressed significant pessimism Saturday about the chances of securing a hostage deal with Hamas. 'Hamas insists on a complete end to the war and is not open to incremental deals. This isn’t moving in a promising direction,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that mediators have not returned with an official response, attempting to prevent a full collapse of the talks. 'Perhaps after the U.S. elections, there could be a fresh approach. If [Kamala] Harris wins, momentum could continue toward a larger deal—meaning an end to the war.' 'The mediators are still in talks with Hamas and haven’t given up, but the chances look very slim,' explained one source familiar with the ongoing discussions. 'As it stands, Hamas is unwilling to consider any framework that does not ultimately include a full withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war from July 2. This isn’t final, but even if Hamas were to agree to an initial small-scale deal, they would still require the later stages to include a full cease-fire and retreat from Gaza. 'After over a year of intense fighting, including significant gains and the killing of [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar, it’s time to consolidate, end the war and achieve core objectives, one of which is the hostages’ return. Some argue that it would be wise to withdraw even without securing the hostages. 'Sinwar has consistently told Hamas leadership—and his brother—that the hostages are leverage and will only be released if there is a full military withdrawal. No hostage is returned until forces withdraw from Gaza. The prime minister’s team might frame it as Hamas waiting for us to lose and withdraw, but most security and military officials believe that after a year of combat and substantial achievements, now is precisely the time to end the war, plan for what follows and secure the hostages.' Israeli assessments suggest that after the U.S. election, regardless of who wins, there will be intense pressure on Israel to conclude the war. Officials anticipate that the Biden administration, feeling less constrained by the political campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, will push for a broad deal that includes ending the war and securing the return of the hostages. Meanwhile, Cairo is persisting in its diplomatic efforts with both Palestinian and Israeli representatives to establish calm in Gaza and enable further humanitarian aid access, Egypt’s Al Qahera News reported Saturday evening, citing a senior Egyptian official. The source noted ongoing Cairo meetings between Fatah and Hamas leaders, with Hamas remaining firm on negotiating hostage release and cease-fire terms jointly to avoid further hostilities from Israel. Egypt is working to bring negotiations back on track, with both Fatah and Hamas reportedly open to forming a joint committee for Gaza’s governance. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Saturday with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. The two discussed steps to reduce regional escalation, with Blinken underscoring the importance of ending the war in Gaza, securing the return of all hostages and establishing a post-war pathway that ensures governance, security and reconstruction. Blinken addressed the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, reviewed actions taken to improve the situation and urged further steps to increase aid to civilians. The two also discussed ongoing diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution in Lebanon, which would allow both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to return safely to their homes. Additionally, Blinken reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to Israel’s security against threats posed by Iran and its proxy groups.

Israel expresses doubt over hostage deal amid renewed talks	Despite renewed negotiations and mediator efforts, Israeli officials expressed significant pessimism Saturday about the chances of securing a hostage deal with Hamas. 'Hamas insists on a complete end to the war and is not open to incremental deals. This isn’t moving in a promising direction,' a senior Israeli official said, adding that mediators have not returned with an official response, attempting to prevent a full collapse of the talks. 'Perhaps after the U.S. elections, there could be a fresh approach. If [Kamala] Harris wins, momentum could continue toward a larger deal—meaning an end to the war.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhw6l4bkl	2024-11-02T11:30:11-07:00

The Israeli Air Force killed Jaafar Khader Faour, Hezbollah’s head of missile and rocket operations for the Nasser unit, in an airstrike on the southern Lebanese village of Jouaiyya, the IDF reported Saturday. The IDF confirmed that Faour, who also led the unit’s drone operations, directed rocket fire from eastern Lebanon into Israel on October 8, 2023. According to the IDF, Faour was responsible for rocket attacks on Israel’s Golan Heights, killing a couple in Kibbutz Ortal; strikes on Majdal Shams that resulted in the deaths of 12 children and teenagers; and shelling in Metula, which killed five farmers.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryyyyx4wkl	2024-11-02T10:31:35-07:00

Israel confirms captured senior Hezbollah operative in high-stake...	Israeli sources acknowledge commando raid on Batroun’s coast, capturing Hezbollah operative identified as 'key figure in weaponry capabilities used by Hezbollah during Second Lebanon War,' and say mission demonstrates 'bold operational capability' Israeli authorities confirmed Saturday that an elite naval commando operation by Shayetet 13 captured a senior Hezbollah operative in Batroun, northern Lebanon. The individual, described as an expert in weaponry crucial to Hezbollah's capabilities, was transferred to Israel and is currently being interrogated by Unit 504, Israel’s military intelligence division. According to earlier reports from Arabic media, a team of more than 25 suspected Israeli commandos landed on the shores of Batroun, approximately 85 miles from Israel’s border, and apprehended the Hezbollah operative in a building in the sector. Israeli sources hailed the operation as a show of 'bold operational capability,' with one official remarking, 'They just reached in and extracted someone from deep within Lebanon.' Sources said that the detained operative was 'an individual with significant operational expertise in weaponry capabilities, akin to those Hezbollah used during the Second Lebanon War.' Sky News Arabia quoted an Israeli security source confirming the capture, identifying the detainee as Imad Amahaz. Hezbollah has reportedly denied any connection to the individual, while Lebanon’s Al Jadeed network claimed Amahaz is an officer in the Lebanese Navy, potentially tied to Hezbollah. However, Al Arabiya, citing additional sources, reported that he is not affiliated with Lebanon's official military forces. The Associated Press reported that the raid took place early Friday in the coastal town of Batroun, about 20 miles north of Beirut. The man allegedly abducted had rented an apartment on the first floor of a multi-story building in the town. Lebanon’s National News Agency reported that locals observed an unidentified military force conducting an amphibious landing on the beach. The force reportedly moved with weapons and equipment to a nearby cabin, later capturing the Lebanese national, taking him to the shore and departing on motorboats to the open sea. Security footage distributed from the area shows around 20 armed individuals in military uniform escorting a person with his face covered by a shirt.

Northern towns experience continuous alarms as suspected Hezbollah drone enters from Lebanon; after 34 minutes, military confirms drone shot down; second drone also downed over Mediterranean before entering Israeli airspace near Tel Aviv Israel’s northern towns sounded continuous alarms Saturday, warning of a suspected drone infiltration from Lebanon. The first sirens were activated in Shlomi and surrounding border communities, quickly spreading across the Western Galilee, including the city of Nahariya. The IDF reported a 'suspicious aerial target' crossing from Lebanon, adding that it was being monitored, and urged the public to follow Home Front Command instructions. As the drone continued southward, alarms sounded in Acre, Kiryat Bialik, Kiryat Yam and Kiryat Motzkin. Within minutes, sirens were also triggered in Haifa, Nesher and further south in Binyamina, where fighter jets were reportedly seen overhead, possibly in pursuit of the suspected drone. The sirens extended across additional northern locations, with alarms sounding in Yokneam Illit, Bat Shlomo in the Carmel region, and later in Zikhron Ya’akov, Ramat Hanadiv and Ma’ayan Zvi. After 34 minutes of heightened alerts, Home Front Command announced the conclusion of the incident, with the IDF confirming that the drone, which set off numerous warnings, had been intercepted. Meanwhile, another drone was reportedly intercepted west of Tel Aviv in the Mediterranean Sea, before the drone crossed into Israeli airspace.

Arab Media: Israeli naval commandos snatch Hezbollah official nor...	Several Lebanese and other Arab networks have reported Israeli commandos, making landfall from the Mediterranean shores to the coastal city of Batroun in northern Lebanon, have taken Imad Amahaz, reportedly a senior Hezbollah operative, in an operation they report was conducted jointly with UNIFIL, who deny involvement On Saturday, Arab media buzzed with reports of a clandestine naval operation. A sizable force, suspected to be Israeli, stealthily touched down on the shores of Batroun in northern Lebanon, roughly 87 miles from the Israeli border, with the intent of snatching a high-ranking terrorist operative from his hideaway in a cabin. This daring raid, involving over 25 operatives, was said to have been coordinated with UN forces stationed in Lebanon (UNIFIL). On their end, UNIFIL have denied any involvement in the matter. Confirming the whispers, an Israeli security source revealed to Sky News in Arabic the capture deep within Lebanese territory. Saudi channel 'Al-Hadath' named the captured figure as Imad Fadel Amahaz. While Hezbollah distanced itself from him, Lebanon's 'Al-Jadid' painted Amahaz as a naval officer, possibly linked to Hezbollah. Contrarily, Saudi 'Al-Arabiya' cited sources claiming he wasn't part of Lebanon's military ranks. The Lebanese National News Agency added more color, describing local accounts of an unidentified military force executing an amphibious landing. Armed and ready, they reportedly seized a Lebanese individual, whisked him to the beach, and vanished into the sea aboard motorboats. 'Al-Hadath' sources labeled the operation as an Israeli commando landing in Batroun. Initially, Lebanese Transport Minister Ali Hamieh dismissed these reports as internal disruptions. Yet, he later confirmed the capture, identifying the individual as a captain of civilian and commercial ships, corroborating the operation with a video, while security services conducted inquiries. Hamieh further commented on efforts to verify with UNIFIL whether the operation was coordinated with them, questioning the implementation of UN Resolution 1701. UNIFIL's deputy spokesperson, Kandice Ardiel, denied any involvement in the capture or sovereignty breach. Meanwhile, Israeli sources noted a significant uptick in strikes against Hezbollah's aerial unit over the past week. 'The road ahead is long, and it continues to challenge us, but we've shifted from defense to offense with the Air Force in this domain, and we will not relent,' they stated. This isn't the first instance of Israeli special forces making waves in enemy territories. Last September, 'Syrian Television,' an opposition outlet to Assad's regime based in Turkey, reported an Israeli raid in Masyaf, Hama, involving ground forces rappelling into action. The broadcast detailed skirmishes resulting in the deaths of three Syrians, with several others injured. Reports claimed that up to four Iranians were captured by Israeli forces, who executed the attack with drones, securing the area from external access.

Fearing a Trump win, Iran waits for US election results before st...	Iran delays retaliatory strike on Israel for US election results, fearing further regional chaos might bolster Trump’s campaign; Meanwhile, tensions rise as both sides prepare for potential post-election confrontations A week has passed since the Israeli strike in Iran, yet the full scale of the destruction at the Revolutionary Guards' bases continues to come to light. Despite Iran's efforts to downplay the events, new satellite images reveal significant damage to two buildings at the Khojir missile production complex near Tehran, which had recently undergone expansion. In tandem with Iran's claims of a 'weak attack,' Tehran's officials have issued frequent threats against Israel, promising a 'decisive and painful response.' However, reports about the timing of any retaliatory strike have been conflicting. Some suggest a response before the U.S. elections, while others indicate it might occur afterward, partly due to Iran's concern that further regional tension could bolster former President Donald Trump's election campaign. Today, the Washington Post cited a source close to the Israeli leadership, who claimed that current intelligence points to Iran preparing an attack on Israel in the coming days. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei stated that they would take whatever actions are necessary to confront political or military arrogance, emphasizing that the Iranian people and officials will never hesitate to confront the criminal mechanisms controlling the world order. He warned that enemies, particularly the U.S. and Israel, should expect a harsh response for their actions against Iran and the resistance front. Iran's Revolutionary Guards spokesman, Mohammad Ali Naeini, remarked that Israel believes Iran will not retaliate. He said the 'Zionists think Iran is reluctant to enter into a direct conflict and that the Iranian people are weary of resistance and unwilling to engage in war with Israel'. He added that the response to the Israeli strike against Iran is inevitable, definitive, and beyond what the enemy expects. Concurrently, the Pentagon announced an order to deploy additional forces to the Middle East, including ballistic missile destroyers, fighter squadrons, refueling aircraft, and several long-range B-52 bombers. These additional forces are expected to arrive in the region in the coming months, coinciding with the planned departure of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. This reinforcement comes against the backdrop of Iran's threats to strike Israel again, following the Israeli assault that disabled several air defense batteries and impacted Tehran's ballistic missile production. American officials, speaking to the Wall Street Journal, explained that the damage might delay the production of solid-fuel missiles by a year or more. Regarding the S-300 air defense systems, which were completely destroyed, a security source indicated that repairs or replacements could take several months. The Journal also noted that Israel's response remained within the 'red lines' defined by Washington. Over the past week, the U.S. has urged Iran not to launch an attack on Israel, with White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre making it clear that if Tehran decides to respond, the U.S. will stand by Israel and assist in its defense. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller also addressed the issue, stating he could not predict Iran's potential actions but said Tehran should not escalate the conflict. He did not respond to questions about whether Iran had communicated with Washington regarding a possible attack before the elections, saying he would not discuss communication between the two governments, whether real or imaginary. However, he underscored that Iran has been clearly informed not to escalate the conflict. Despite American appeals, the New York Times reported that Ayatollah Khamenei instructed the country's Supreme National Security Council to prepare for an attack against Israel. According to three informed Iranian sources, Khamenei made this decision after reviewing a detailed report from senior military commanders on the extent of the damage inflicted by the Israeli strike on Iran's missile production capabilities, air defense systems around Tehran, energy infrastructure, and a key southern port. The Times reported that Khamenei considered the scale of the Israeli strike and the number of casualties—at least four soldiers were killed—too significant to ignore, and he viewed inaction as an admission of defeat, according to the three sources. These sources spoke anonymously as they were not authorized to speak publicly. They added that military commanders are preparing a list of dozens of potential military targets within Israel. Earlier this week, satellite images also uncovered damage at the secret Parchin base, previously reported to have been used for nuclear development. Nuclear expert David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector, stated that other images, likely undisclosed, showed damage to a building that was part of Iran's nuclear weapons program. According to him and another researcher from the American research institute CNA, the images also depicted damage to facilities used for integrating solid fuel into missiles. Israel's strike in Iran, launched in response to the barrage of ballistic missiles from Iran at the beginning of last month, marked Israel's first-ever declared attack on Iran. Dozens of fighter jets were involved, significantly impairing the Islamic Republic's air defense network and its capability to produce ballistic missiles.

US-brokered Lebanon-Israel truce falters amid doubts over ‘unreal...	Lebanese sources anticipate escalation, with Parliament Speaker Berri accusing Netanyahu of rejecting US proposal; sources say proposal fell through after Israel insisted on enforcing agreement itself American efforts to halt fighting between Israel and Hezbollah have failed after the U.S. drafted an 'unrealistic' cease-fire proposal and Israel's insistence on being able to enforce a truce directly, people briefed on the diplomacy told Reuters. Meanwhile, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri claimed on Friday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a U.S.-backed proposal for a cease-fire with Hezbollah. 'The Israeli prime minister rejected Lebanon’s proposed roadmap, which was agreed upon with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein,' he said in an interview with the Arabic-language London-based newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. The newspaper further reported that 'political efforts to resolve the crisis have been postponed until after the U.S. elections.' Al Jazeera quoted a source close to Berri as saying, 'An agreement with Hochstein was reached in Beirut on provisions to be implemented within 60 days. These provisions include a complete cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, the deployment of the Lebanese Army to the southern border and the withdrawal of all unofficial military presence to north of the Litani River.' Lebanon’s Al Jadeed channel added that 'only after this will negotiations to resolve the issue begin.' With no workable proposal on the table ahead of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, the conflict could drag on for months, according to a Lebanese political source close to Hezbollah, two diplomats and a person briefed on the talks. They all spoke on condition of anonymity. The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not respond to questions from Reuters. Political sources in Lebanon told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television they anticipate a likely escalation in the coming days as talks stall, though U.S. officials have described the discussions as 'substantive and constructive.' The U.S. also emphasized that 'public negotiations' are not part of Washington’s approach to these discussions. According to a draft of the proposal reported by The Wall Street Journal, Israel would retain the right to conduct defensive strikes in Lebanon for 60 days to address 'imminent threats.' During this period, Israel would also oversee the implementation of the cease-fire and UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Lebanon War. The proposal calls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon within a week, after which the Lebanese Army would be deployed to dismantle Hezbollah’s military infrastructure in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government, however, reportedly rejected the proposal, claiming it grants Israel excessive latitude for cross-border operations. Lebanese officials noted they preferred to avoid publicly dismissing the proposal, as it leaves room for further negotiations that could eventually lead to an end to hostilities. In Israel, U.S. envoys Hochstein and Brett McGurk met with Israeli leaders, returning to the U.S. without a stop in Lebanon. Israeli officials dismissed claims that the lack of a Lebanon visit indicates stalled progress, saying, 'We never expected this to resolve in just a few days.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken remarked, 'We’ve made strides towards implementing Resolution 1701 as a foundation for a political agreement between Israel and Hezbollah.' When questioned on the matter by Reuters, State Department officials referred to Blinken’s comments. After the U.S. team’s visit, Israeli sources familiar with the negotiations described an understanding between Israel and the U.S., with Hochstein and McGurk set to brief President Joe Biden and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan upon their return to Washington before possibly heading to Lebanon to finalize the deal. 'The U.S. side document is crucial; it provides Israel the backing it needs to act if necessary,' an Israeli official said, adding that action is expected given likely violations until the Lebanese Army takes control. Meanwhile, Israel expressed pessimism over separate talks with Hamas for a hostage deal. According to sources, Hamas has demanded a complete end to the war, rejecting smaller-scale arrangements. 'This isn’t looking promising,' an Israeli official said, noting that mediators have not returned with an official response to avoid a total breakdown in talks. 'After the U.S. elections, we might see a creative approach. A victory by Harris could keep momentum going for a larger deal that ends the war.'

Arizona prosecutor investigating Trump for saying Cheney should f...	Arizona's top prosecutor, a Democrat, said on Friday that her office was investigating whether Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump violated state law for suggesting a prominent critic should face gunfire in combat. Trump has drawn outrage for comments he made about former lawmaker Liz Cheney at a campaign event in the battleground state of Arizona on Thursday. His campaign said the former president was criticizing Cheney as a warmonger, but critics condemned the remarks as evidence he would target his enemies if he wins next week's election against Democrat Kamala Harris. 'She's a radical war hawk,' Trump said of Cheney. 'Let's put her with a rifle standing there, with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.' Speaking to a local TV station on Friday, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said Trump might have violated state laws that prohibit death threats. 'I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona's laws,' Mayes told 12News.

Security agencies focusing on spokesperson suspected of leaking manipulated Hamas documents to international media; despite lacking clearance, he joined sensitive talks; associates say he is a 'scapegoat' The investigation centers on suspicions of exposing sensitive intelligence and methods, potentially compromising Israeli military operations and strategic aims in Gaza. The leaks reportedly involve a former spokesman who, despite lacking full security clearance, regularly accompanied Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure meetings, including military briefings at the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. He is suspected of sharing classified information with the German newspaper Bild and other Israeli journalists, allegedly disclosing in September a document supposedly written by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The document purportedly detailed Hamas’ negotiation strategy with Israel, advising on how to manipulate the international community while aiming to rebuild military capabilities and intensify pressure on Israel. A parallel report in The Jewish Chronicle quoted another Hamas document, later deemed fraudulent, which claimed Hamas aimed to transfer hostages via the Philadelphi Corridor to Iran or Yemen. Within days of the publication of these reports, both Bild and The Jewish Chronicle faced backlash. IDF investigators determined the so-called 'Sinwar Document' had been manipulated, suggesting it was not authored by Sinwar himself, as initially reported. The Chronicle retracted its story after confirming that the cited document had no basis, and that the author’s name was fabricated. This revelation has prompted additional scrutiny of how seized Hamas materials were potentially altered to influence public opinion in Israel regarding the Gaza war. While Netanyahu’s office denied the detained individuals were officially employed, insiders confirmed the suspect maintained close ties to Netanyahu’s inner circle, conducting public relations and diplomatic assignments under the direction of Netanyahu's Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman. Despite failing an initial security clearance check, he continued to attend high-level discussions, reportedly acting as an ardent supporter and unofficial advisor. The classified leaks investigation has intensified tensions between Netanyahu’s office and Israel’s defense establishment, highlighting growing divisions over Gaza policy and hostage negotiations. Sources familiar with the case view the detained suspect as a 'scapegoat,' suggesting that other officials may have played larger roles in the series of leaks. In an ongoing security and legal effort, authorities continue to examine if senior officials might have indirectly sanctioned the unauthorized release of classified documents to foreign media.

Northern Command chief sustains minor in crash, resuming duties after hospital checks; Central Command head unharmed; IDF ground ops in Lebanon see increased road mishaps due to challenging terrain and steep inclines on supply routes The IDF reported Friday evening that a patrol vehicle carrying Northern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin and Central Command Chief Maj. Gen. Avi Blot overturned during an operational tour in Lebanon. Gordin sustained minor injuries, completed a series of medical checks and returned to duty, the military confirmed. The two commanders were visiting troops on the Lebanese side of the border, marking Blot’s first tour in Lebanon as Central Command forces under his command, including the 98th Division and Paratrooper Brigade, have been actively deployed across the border. Gordin was released from Ziv Medical Center in Safed in good condition and attended evening planning and operational briefings at a nearby command base. A few other soldiers were slightly injured in the accident, checked at the hospital and subsequently discharged. Over the past month of ground operations in southern Lebanon, numerous operational road accidents have occurred on newly opened supply routes near the border, designed to support logistics and transportation of supply convoys. In one instance, an IDF Humvee plunged down a short embankment in Lebanon, injuring a soldier who fractured his arm. The vehicle was recovered after a nighttime operation lasting several hours. Supply trucks have also faced challenges, with some toppling on steep, rugged terrain. Drivers navigate these newly cut, rough roads with night-vision equipment, often under blackout conditions to avoid detection by Hezbollah.

Armed group in Bolivia takes over military post in latest politic...	An armed group in Bolivia took over a military post outside the city of Cochabamba on Friday while taking some soldiers captive, the armed forces said in a statement, ramping up tensions in the already restive Andean nation. Cochabamba, located in central Bolivia, is home to many supporters of former President Evo Morales. The standoff over the military post, located about 100 miles (160 km) east of Cochabamba, marks the latest escalation in Bolivia's increasingly volatile and often violent politics. The military's statement described the armed group as 'irregular,' noting it had also taken control of firearms and ammunition, and stressed that such actions amounted to treason. It urged those responsible for the takeover to 'immediately and peacefully' abandon the facility.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy68iog11ye	2024-11-01T11:26:56-07:00

Iran braces for Trump victory, fearing more Israeli strikes, West...	Tehran faces diminished leverage if Trump wins Nov. 5 US election, fearing he could grant Israel green light to hit nuclear sites and finalize US-Saudi defense pact to shift regional balance of power Iran's leadership and allies are bracing for what they would regard as a dreadful outcome of the imminent U.S. presidential election: A return to power of Donald Trump. Opinion polls suggest the Republican Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris remain locked in a close contest. But Iranian leaders and their regional allies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen are concerned that Trump could well triumph on Nov. 5 and this could spell more trouble for them. Iran's main concern is the potential for Trump to empower Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites, conduct targeted assassinations and reimpose his 'maximum pressure policy' through heightened sanctions on their oil industry, according to Iranian, Arab and Western officials. They anticipate that Trump, who was president in 2017-21, will exert utmost pressure on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to cave in by accepting a nuclear containment deal on terms set by himself and Israel. This potential change in U.S. leadership could have far-reaching implications for the Middle East balance of power, and might reshape Iran's foreign policy and economic prospects. Analysts argue that whether the next U.S. administration is led by Harris or Trump, Iran will lack the leverage it once held - largely due to Israel's year-old military campaign aimed at degrading the Islamic Republic's armed proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. However, Trump's stance is perceived as more detrimental to Iran due to his more automatic support for Israel, they added. 'Trump will either put very tough conditions on Iran or let Israel carry out targeted strikes on its nuclear facilities. He is fully endorsing a military action against Iran,' Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Gulf Research Center think-tank, said. 'It's Netanyahu's dream day to have Trump back in the White House,' he told Reuters. Poison chalice? A senior Iranian official who declined to be named told Reuters Tehran was 'prepared for all scenarios. We have (for decades) consistently found ways to export oil, bypassing harsh U.S. sanctions..., and have strengthened our ties with the rest of the world no matter who was in the White House.' But another Iranian official said a Trump victory would be 'a nightmare. He will raise pressure on Iran to please Israel... make sure oil sanctions are fully enforced. If so, (our) establishment will be economically paralyzed.' In an election speech in October, Trump stated his unwillingness to go to war with Iran, but said Israel should 'hit the Iranian nuclear first and worry about the rest later', in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel on Oct. 1. Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Iranian military targets, especially missile production sites, on Oct. 26. Iran's choices are limited going forward, analysts say. 'The reality is: Trump is going to support Netanyahu and give him the green light to do whatever he wants,' said Hassan Hassan, an author and researcher on Islamic groups. 'Trump is much worse (than Harris) for Iran.' Hassan noted that Washington has delegated a substantial share of responsibility to Israel in the conflict with Iran and its proxies, with Israel leading the way. 'The U.S. is involved enough in that it's backing Israel, may be more so than before.' 'This time it's just things are really bad for Iran. Iran is seen as a problem by both Republicans and Democrats.' During her campaign, Harris called Iran a 'dangerous' and 'destabilizing' force in the Middle East and said the U.S. was committed to Israel's security. She said the U.S. would work with allies to disrupt Iran's 'aggressive behavior.' But Trump's re-election would be a 'poisoned chalice', for Khamenei, according to two regional officials. If he were to reinstate stringent sanctions, Khamenei may be forced to negotiate and accept a nuclear pact more favorable to U.S. and Israeli terms to preserve theocratic rule in Iran, which is facing growing foreign pressure and has been buffeted by bouts of mass protest at home in recent years. A U.S.-Saudi defense pact tied to Riyadh's establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, now in its final negotiating stages, poses a significant challenge to Khamenei too. This alliance threatens to shift the regional balance of power by creating a more unified front against Iran, impacting its geopolitical standing and strategy in the Middle East. New architecture Hassan said recent attacks on Iran and its allies have been widely perceived as a significant success for Israel. They offered insights into what a limited strike on Iran might look like, setting a precedent and altering assumptions that military action on Iran would inevitably spark a wider Middle East war. A senior Arab security official said that Tehran could 'no longer brandish its influence through its armed proxies' in the wake of Israel's deadly strikes on Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. For its own part, Iran has every reason to fear another Trump term. It was Trump who in 2018 unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and ordered the killing of Qassem Soleimani, Khamenei's right-hand man and mastermind of overseas attacks on U.S. and allied interests. Trump also imposed punitive sanctions targeting Iran's oil export revenues and international banking transactions, which led to extreme economic hardship and exacerbated public discontent in the Islamic Republic. He frequently said during his presidential campaign that President Joe Biden's policy of not rigorously enforcing oil export sanctions has weakened Washington and emboldened Tehran, allowing it to sell oil, accumulate cash and expand its nuclear pursuits and influence through armed militias. In March, he told Israel's Hayom newspaper in an interview that Iran could have a nuclear weapon in 35 days and that Israel - which deems Iran's nuclear activity an existential threat though is widely thought to have the region's only nuclear arms - was in a 'very treacherous and dangerous neighborhood'. An Arab government adviser noted that Tehran recognizes there is a 'new architecture in the making', but also that Trump despite his tough rhetoric realizes there is no alternative to a deal with Iran given its accelerated uranium enrichment program. 'Trump might aim for a new nuclear agreement, he could say I tore up the 2015 agreement because it was incomplete and replace it with a long-lasting agreement, touting it to 'make America great again' and preserve U.S. interests,' the adviser said. As the 2015 deal has eroded over the years, Iran has escalated the level of fissile purity in enriched uranium, cutting the time it would need to build an atom bomb if it chose to, though it denies wanting to. Iran Online, a state-run news website, stated that when Trump left office, Iran was capping enrichment at 3.67 percent under the deal, far below the 90 percent of weapons grade. Now, Iran has 'enriched uranium to 60% with IR-6 advanced centrifuges' and could achieve nuclear weapons capability 'within a few weeks ... Completing the nuclear deterrence cycle is Iran's greatest trump card against Trump,' it said. Arab and Western officials warn that the more Iran hints it is nearing development of an atomic bomb, the more they incite the need for Israel to strike. 'If Trump reassumes power, he will support Israeli plans to strike Iranian nuclear facilities,' a Western official said.

Report exposes failures in US universities' handling of antisemit...	US House report reveals major failures by top universities in addressing antisemitism on campus, describing 'environment hostile to Jewish students'; Harvard avoided calling Oct. 7 massacre 'violent,' and Columbia minimized ties with Tel Aviv U A new U.S. House of Representatives report reveals major lapses by leading American universities in addressing antisemitism and anti-Zionism on campus, presenting internal discussions on the issue for the first time. The 300-page report, compiled from over 400,000 documents, includes transcribed testimonies, document requests and subpoenaed statements. The House Education Committee noted that the incidents investigated serve as 'evidence of a broader environment on these campuses that is hostile to Jewish students,' violating the Civil Rights Act. Harvard’s response to October 7 protests The report highlights Harvard University’s handling of protests after October 7, showing that the administration initially drafted a statement condemning Hamas and expressing sympathy for hostages. However, then-president Claudine Gay and current president Alan Garber, who was then provost, requested the statement be softened, removing key references to hostages. Internal communications show Harvard’s leadership resisted stronger condemnation of Hamas, citing the 'complex' and 'deeply divided' nature of the issue. Harvard Medical School Dean Dr. George Q. Daley, for instance, opposed using the word 'violent' to describe Hamas’ attack, suggesting it might imply blame, preferring instead to 'express horror' over the ongoing violence, referencing IDF actions in Gaza. Garber, though initially opposed, ultimately agreed with Gay’s request amid concerns of faculty backlash, writing in an internal email that the stance would be 'crossing a line for many members of our community.' Additionally, current Harvard provost John Manning opposed including a passage on the toll hostage situations had on Harvard’s community, a draft that initially read, 'The violence hits all too close to home for many at Harvard. Some members of our community have lost family members and friends; some have been unable to reach loved ones, and others fear that their loved ones may have been taken hostage.' This section was removed after multiple professors concurred with Manning that mentioning hostages without balancing reference to Palestinian casualties would be inappropriate. Following public backlash over the muted statement, Harvard Corporation Board member Penny Pritzker wrote to Gay, calling the response 'massively inappropriate at the time and insufficient.' Pritzker urged Gay to denounce the use of the slogan 'From the River to the Sea' on campus, explaining it as 'clearly an anti Semitic sign which calls for the annihilation of the Jewish state and Jews' and further added, 'why we would tolerate that and not signage calling for Lynchings by the KKK.' Garber responded that the issue was 'not as simple as some of our friends would have it,' and Gay advised Pritzker not to label the phrase antisemitic publicly, suggesting it might 'prompt the question of what we're doing about it' Congress, notably, recently passed a resolution defining the phrase as antisemitic. The report further noted that students involved in disruptive protests on campus were not disciplined, a decision made consciously by the relevant committees, according to internal records. During testimony, Pritzker said that the Harvard Corporation found 'uneven enforcement' of rules around campus protests, an issue she called 'unacceptable' and still under review. Columbia University's handling of antisemitism A report has spotlighted Columbia University’s approach to issues of antisemitism and pro-Palestinian activism on campus, revealing internal communications and decisions among senior leadership. According to the report, then-president Minouche Shafik communicated with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who reportedly advised her that 'universities' political problems are really only among Republicans' and suggested the 'best strategy is to keep heads down' and avoid meeting with Republicans. Additionally, Columbia Board Chair David Greenwald and Trustee Jonathan Lavine expressed hope in private communications for a Democratic majority in Congress, anticipating it would halt further investigations into universities. In another internal exchange, Columbia Trustee Chair Claire Shipman dismissed Congressional criticism over campus antisemitism as 'capital [sic] hill nonsense' and pushed to reinstate anti-Israel groups suspended by the university, proposing events with anti-Israel professors to foster dialogue. Meanwhile, a senior figure in Columbia’s University Senate, responsible for coordinating with university leadership, was found to have supported pro-Palestinian demonstrators and suppressed pro-Israel voices. Although Columbia ultimately did not reach an agreement with leaders of an on-campus pro-Palestinian encampment, internal documents revealed potential concessions were considered. These included options to divest from Israeli-linked businesses, establish a joint program with a West Bank university, offer scholarships to Palestinian students and provide lenient disciplinary action for protest participants, as well as reactivating anti-Zionist student groups. The report also covered the case of an Israeli student who sprayed 'skunk spray' at a pro-Palestinian protest on campus. Columbia suspended the student, claiming he used an illegal chemical agent, but later agreed to pay him $395,000 in damages after confirming the spray was legally available for purchase. Further, the report criticized Shafik for ignoring complaints of discrimination from students in Columbia’s joint degree program with Tel Aviv University. The report notes that Shafik appeared to downplay the partnership, with a post celebrating the program's first graduating class removed from Columbia’s social media channels within hours. Overlooking calls to murder Israelis At the University of Pennsylvania, former Board Chair Scott Bok reportedly advised then-President Liz Magill to disregard pressure over the institution's response to antisemitism, dismissing political criticism as coming from voices 'easily purchased.' The report also alleges that UPenn leadership coordinated with a local media outlet to secure favorable coverage of Magill’s congressional testimony, portraying legislators’ questions as 'bullying and grandstanding.' At UCLA, the report details instructions given to campus police not to intervene as protesters set up a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus. School leaders allegedly refrained from intervention and even issued misleading communications to the university community about the encampment. At Rutgers University, a student who encouraged others to harm an Israeli peer was allowed to remain on campus during disciplinary proceedings and ultimately faced only a one-semester suspension. Meanwhile, several Jewish students received disciplinary action for publicly speaking out against antisemitism and filing formal complaints with authorities. The report also mentions a senior business professor at Northwestern University, Nour Kteily, who, during negotiations with a pro-Palestinian campus group, reportedly expressed hope for 'amazing wins' for the student protesters. Kteily, part of the administration’s negotiating team with the protesters and a member of Northwestern’s newly established anti-antisemitism task force, had previously criticized the need for such a task force. During talks, he reportedly proposed a campus boycott of Sabra products, made by Israeli food manufacturer Strauss Group.

Israeli ex-lawmaker claims Mossad ties in fight against extraditi...	Former Romanian MP Nati Meir, who previously served a prison term, detained in Rhodes at Bucharest’s request; Meir opposes extradition, alleging Romanian persecution over his Mossad ties Israeli national Nati Meir, a former Romanian parliamentarian detained this week in Rhodes, claims he previously served as a Mossad agent operating in Romania. Meir made this assertion in an affidavit to a Greek court in an attempt to prevent his extradition to Romania. Meir’s arrest in Rhodes follows an Interpol warrant issued by Romania, which alleges he fled the country in 2016 to evade an 11-year prison sentence for criminal fraud. Romania has formally requested his extradition from Greece. Meir’s attorney, Nir Yaslovitzh, filed a petition in Rhodes court opposing the extradition, calling it a 'witch hunt' by Romania despite Meir having served a five-year sentence. Yaslovitzh argues that Romanian authorities allowed Meir to leave the country and continue to persecute him without legal grounds. In his statement to the court, Meir explained, 'I was a Mossad agent sent to Romania, where I lived for 20 years from 1996 to 2016. I was elected to the Romanian Parliament in 2004, but shortly after my Mossad ties became apparent, a relentless campaign began to discredit me with false criminal charges, effectively ending my political career.' Yaslovitzh added that Romania’s pursuit of Meir reflects ongoing political persecution, citing a similar 2022 incident when Israel intervened to secure Meir's release from a Dubai detention. He called on Israel’s Foreign Ministry to help secure Meir's release once again. A Rhodes court will review Meir’s case next week.

At least nine injured, one seriously, in Galilee rocket attack	Emergency services paramedics arrive on scene in olive orchard in Arab town of Sha'ab where the rocket hit, injuring residents in the area The Hian Medical Services emergency service reported on Friday at least nine people were injured, one seriously, after a rocket landed in an olive orchard in Sha'ab located in the Galilee following a rocket barrage from Lebanon toward the area earlier. Magen David Adom Director Eli Bin added paramedics who arrived on the scene treated one individual in minor to moderate condition following the impact. According to the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, 'approximately 30 projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israel. Some of the projectiles were intercepted and others fell in the area.' Hezbollah and Israel continue to trade blows amid the Gaza war, now ongoing for over a year, despite efforts by the U.S. to reach a diplomatic solution for a cease-fire. Officials familiar with the talks between U.S. President Joe Biden's Middle East envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials said on Thursday that the administration's envoys are expected to return to Israel to finalize a deal, after meeting Biden and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. 'More important than the agreement will be an American document that will authorize Israel to act,' they said. Jerusalem understands that there will most certainly be violations of the deal until the Lebanese military takes over responsibility for South Lebanon.

Government approves Israel's 2025 state budget	Ministers pass new budget marked at NIS 607.4 billion in a 23-7 majority vote following hours of intense discussions; opposition criticizes budget as selective and harmful Israel government approved the country’s 2025 state budget on Friday in a 23-7 majority vote. Ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir, Amichai Eliyahu, Yitzhak Wasserlauf, Miki Zohar, Gila Gamliel, Avi Dichter and Idit Silman opposed it. Yitzhak Goldknopf and Gideon Sa’ar didn’t participate in the vote. 'The 2025 state budget will stand at approximately NIS 607.4 billion ($160 billion),' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said following the budget's approval. 'Alongside the budget, the government approved budgetary adjustment measures totaling approximately 37 billion shekels ($9.8 billion).' 'The current budget is a stabilizing one designed to serve the needs of the war and the major challenges facing the Israeli economy,' he added. 'It’s a war-supportive budget that also promotes growth: we’re offering reservists an additional care package worth 9 billion shekels ($2.4 billion) and a comprehensive recovery and development plan for the north amounting to approximately 15 billion shekels ($4 billion).' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu concluded the cabinet meeting, saying, 'I want to thank the finance minister, ministers and the office staff who worked very hard for this. We gathered to vote for an important, difficult budget but one that's essential in a wartime year.' Opposition Leader Yair Lapid sharply criticized the budget, saying, 'The Netanyahu government just passed a reckless budget. It’ll increase every Israeli family’s expense by 20,000 shekels ($5,300) a year, while simultaneously distributing billions to 10 unnecessary government ministries. They’ve lost all shame,' he wrote. National Unity party leader Benny Gantz added, '4.1 billion shekels ($1.1 billion) – that’s the amount the Israeli government just approved.' 'No, it’s not for reservists who experience the heavy load, not for active-duty soldiers, nor for evacuees from the north and south, nor for economic recovery after a significant hit, nor for at-risk populations, education or welfare. 4.1 billion shekels is for them — for the politicians. Whoever supported this budget will carry this shame for life. Shame on you,' he added. The marathon of discussions for the budget’s approval began on Thursday, with the scheduling designed by the Prime Minister's Office and the finance ministry to press ministers into ending discussions as the hours approached the early start of Shabbat. Consequently, disputes over certain budget items diminished, allowing most of the Finance Ministry’s proposed budget items to pass as written.

Israel is Exhausted'	Dr. Gerald Steinberg on Ceasefire with Hezbollah Israel should pursue a ceasefire with Hezbollah, as 'there is no reason for them to remain now' and 'Israel is exhausted,' says Dr. Gerald Steinberg, founder and president of NGO Monitor. Steinberg argues that Israel has achieved its objectives in Lebanon and sees no reason for troops to remain, apart from possibly maintaining a buffer zone.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rycgbufbyx	2024-11-01T05:06:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/11/01/HkUsGomzWye/HkUsGomzWye_0_0_1601_901_0_small.jpg

Akin to surrender': Lebanon denies US proposal for unilateral ce...	Top Lebanese diplomat says U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein asked Prime Minister Najib Mikati for a unilateral cease-fire with Israel to allow and advance deal with Hezbollah A U.S. envoy this week asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral cease-fire with Israel as part of an effort to help negotiations to reach a resolution for the more than year-long conflict, a senior Lebanese political source and a senior diplomat told Reuters on Friday. The sources say the effort was communicated by U.S. Lebanon Envoy Amos Hochstein to Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati. But such an announcement was seen as a non-starter in Lebanon, the sources say, where it would likely be equated with a surrender. In a statement to Reuters, Mikati’s office denies the claim and says the government’s stance was clear on seeking a ceasefire from both sides and the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last round of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden's Middle East envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, Mossad Director David Barnea and other senior Israeli officials. 'The two focused on efforts to secure a cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, allowing people on both sides of the Blue Line to return home safely, as well as new initiatives to secure the release of hostages which Hamas must address without delay,' an Israeli official said. 'We have made progress toward implementing Resolution 1701, which will serve as the basis for a political agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. It’s important to make sure we have clarity, both from Lebanon and from Israel, about what would be required under 1701 to get its effective implementation,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. A senior American official said that Thursday’s meetings in Israel were 'substantial and constructive, focusing on a range of issues in depth including Iran, Lebanon, Gaza and securing the hostages' release.' The Wall Street Journal also revealed on Thursday a draft of the pending agreement, which includes a clause allowing Israel to strike in Lebanon during a 60-day interim period in response to ' imminent threats.' According to the report, Israel would enforce the agreement and relevant UN resolutions, including UN Security Council Resolution 1701 which concluded the Second Lebanon War in 2006.

Israeli returns from dangerous trip to Afghanistan	Benny Wexler says he spent days without sleep ahead of his trip to the Taliban's home country, worrying he might be identified as Jewish Benny Wexler, a young ultra-Orthodox man, recently managed to reach Afghanistan’s capital of Kabul — a country controlled by the Taliban that has no diplomatic ties to Israel. 'It was the scariest and most challenging trip I’ve ever taken,' he recounted. 'To be at the mercy of the Taliban without minimal protection, I couldn’t sleep for weeks leading up to the trip.' Wexler, who owns a travel company, has already visited approximately 100 countries around the world, including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and others. He faced significant challenges obtaining a visa for Afghanistan, saying, 'It took us a very long time, with a lot of connections and favors.' 'My biggest fear,' he said, 'was entering the country with their strict inspections, passing dozens of Taliban checkpoints where we were repeatedly checked. The big concern was that they would discover we were Jewish, carrying tefillin and other items in Hebrew. We were advised to dress like locals to blend in.' To avoid having his tefillin discovered, Wexler packed them in a nondescript bag with Arabic writing from Dubai, planning to claim he bought them as souvenirs in a shop in Dubai selling antiques from around the world if questioned about them. He was also concerned about his phone, which contained Hebrew text. In Afghanistan, photographing passersby, especially Taliban members, is prohibited, with severe punishments for violations. Wexler also needed Taliban permission to tour Kabul. 'It was a complex process, involving meetings with various Taliban officials before finally obtaining clearance from the Taliban leadership, who showed us respect and even offered us tea and cookies.' His hotel was located directly across from the Iranian embassy. He described the rooms as very basic, had no air conditioning, malfunctioning showers and insects everywhere. One of the scariest moments of his trip took place at the hotel. 'While in the room, we thought no one could hear us and spoke in Hebrew,' he shared. 'The hotel owner overheard us, grew suspicious and started questioning us. We thankfully managed to get him to drop it after some effort.'

Rockets, drones and terror attacks: 88 Israelis killed in October	October marks the deadliest month in Israel's war in Gaza amid a ground operation in Lebanon, incessant rocket and drone strikes and deadly terror attacks Israel experienced one of its most challenging months since the beginning of the war in the month marking exactly one year since Hamas’ October 7 attack. Alongside impressive military actions, including the elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and the ground offensive in southern Lebanon, 88 civilians and soldiers were killed in October, marking it the deadliest month in 2024. November marks one month since IDF forces entered southern Lebanon, during which 37 soldiers have been killed in fighting there and along the northern border. Fighting in Gaza continues to take a heavy toll. Nineteen soldiers fell in combat over the past month and another soldier died in an operational accident near the border. Additionally, it was confirmed that captive Idan Shtivi was killed on October 7, 2023, and his body remains held in Gaza along with 101 other hostages — both alive and deceased. October was also marked by significant security incidents within Israel, with nine civilians, a police officer and a policewoman killed in terror attacks from Be'er Sheva to Hadera. The deadliest attack took place on the first day of the month when seven people were killed in a terror attack in Jaffa. Thirteen civilians were killed by rocket or shrapnel impacts in northern Israel, seven of whom were killed on Thursday in Metula and the Haifa Bay area within a matter of hours on the last day of the month. Six soldiers were killed by drone strikes, including four combat soldiers hit by a deadly UAV strike at the Golani Brigade Training Base.

IDF reports injured officer succumbs to wounds in hospital	Military confirms Captain Yarden Zakay, an officer in the Givati Brigade, succumbed to his injures after being severely wounded while fighting in Gaza The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported on Friday that Captain Yarden Zakay, 21, from Hadera, a Platoon Commander in the Shaked Battalion, Givati Brigade, succumbed to his injuries after being severely injured during combat in southern Gaza on September 17, 2024. Medical staff fought to save Zakay’s life for about a month and a half. Other soldiers fell in the same incident including Captain Daniel Mimon Toaff, Staff Sergeant Dotan Shimon, Staff Sergeant Amit Bakri and Staff Sergeant Agam Naim, who was the first female soldier to die while fighting in Gaza. Hadera Mayor Nir Ben Haim mourned Zakay’s loss on Friday, saying, 'After two months in which he continued fighting for his life and all of Israel prayed for his recovery, Yarden, our city’s son, is no longer with us. There are no words to comfort us; the entire city grieves.' As part of the 401st Armored Brigade operation, soldiers were conducting searches for weapons in a building in the Tel Sultan neighborhood. For reasons still under investigation, a deadly explosion occurred. A helicopter evacuated the wounded, including five soldiers in serious condition and two others in moderate condition, to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva.

IDF strikes 200 terror targets in Gaza and Lebanon in one day	Military spokesperson says troops eliminated terrorists alongside precise airstrikes on Hezbollah and Hamas military complexes The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Friday that the Israeli Air Force struck 'over 200 terror targets belonging to Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon,' throughout Thursday. According to the military, the targets included 'command and control centers, launchers and terrorist infrastructure sites.' 'Yesterday (Thursday), projectiles were fired from Lebanon toward the area of Haifa Bay in northern Israel. The IAF struck the launcher and the terrorist who fired the projectiles,' the IDF said in a statement. 'Over the past day, IDF troops continued their limited, localized, and targeted activity in southern Lebanon, eliminating terrorists, locating weapons, and dismantling terrorist infrastructure sites and launchers. Simultaneously, IDF operational activity continues throughout the Gaza Strip,' it added. The military also detailed the forces’ operation in the Gaza Strip, saying troops in Jabaliya 'eliminated dozens of terrorists from the air and ground and conducted targeted raids on military structures.' 'In central Gaza, the troops identified and eliminated several armed terrorists who were operating in the area. In the Rafah area, the troops identified terrorists operating within a military structure that had an underground tunnel shaft. The IAF then struck and eliminated the terrorists,' the IDF said.

Iraq tries to avoid regional fight as militias fire at Israel	Country is working to avoid being drawn into the growing regional conflict as Iran-backed terror groups launch attacks on Israel from Iraqi soil Nervously watching Israel's destructive campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon, Iraq is working to avoid being drawn into the growing regional conflict as Iran-backed terror groups launch attacks on Israel from Iraqi soil, sources familiar with the matter say. Two decades after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, Iraq is experiencing relative stability with high revenue from oil sales funding a service-based agenda that has turned much of the country into a construction site. Iraq does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani's government is wary of regional conflicts that could affect its delicate balancing act between Washington and Tehran, both states it is allied with. Axios reported late on Thursday that Israeli intelligence suggests Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days, possibly before the U.S. presidential election on November 5, citing two unidentified Israeli sources. There was no immediate Iraqi comment. Spillover from regional conflict has already resulted in months of tit-for-tat attacks between Iran-backed terror groups and U.S. forces stationed in Iraq and the region that only subsided after Iran intervened in February. Sudani's government has not been successful in a push to convince the Islamic Resistance in Iraq - a coalition of Iran-backed terror groups - to stop firing rockets and drones at Israel, according to four sources in Iran-backed terror groups and two government advisors. Two visits to Iran by Iraq's top security officials in the past two months, seeking Tehran's help to rein in its allied Iraqi factions, failed, the sources said. 'The Iraqi delegation received a cold reception in Tehran ... The answer was: those groups have their own decision and it is their call to decide how to support their brothers in Lebanon and Gaza,' said a senior Iraqi security official briefed on the visits. Baghdad turned to Washington, asking U.S. officials to intervene with Israel to prevent retaliation for the attacks, including one that killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded more than 20 on Oct. 4, the sources said, the first time such an attack has been reported to cause fatalities. 'Washington was understanding of the repercussions of possible Israeli strikes in Iraq and pledged to help,' said an Iraqi foreign ministry official. A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Baghdad did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Four militia sources said the Kataib Hezbollah and Nujaba groups, which are leading the attacks on Israel, have warned the prime minister against pressuring them to halt their actions and vowed to continue their attacks as long as Israel continued its Gaza and Lebanon operations. The issue has divided parties in Iraq's ruling coalition, all of whom are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and view Israel as an enemy, though some differ over how involved Iraq should be in the regional confrontation. Shi'ite leaders discussed the risk of repercussions from attacks on Israel and possible Israeli retaliation during two meetings in October, said Ahmed Kenani, a Shi'ite lawmaker from the ruling alliance. Key players in the Shi'ite coalition view direct confrontation with Israel as counterproductive and potentially damaging to Iraq, according to four Shi'ite lawmakers. 'Those groups who have the rockets and drones should go to Gaza and Lebanon to fight Israel rather than pushing Iraq towards destruction,' said Iraqi PM adviser Abdul Ameer Thuaiban. Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful of the terror factions, said Israel and the U.S. would have to pay a price for Israel's strikes on Iran last week. Senior Iraqi security sources said ahead of that attack that any strike by Israel against Iran outside what the sources called the established rules of engagement could prompt pro-Iran terror groups to significantly expand their attacks on Israel and U.S. assets in the region. Mohammed Shummary, chairman of Baghdad-based think tank the Sumeria Foundation, said growing regional conflict risked pulling Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim parties, many of them heavily armed, into a confrontation that few initially had appetite for. 'They are torn between maintaining their decision to keep Iraq out of the confrontation and their ideological and political commitments toward the Shia of Lebanon and the broader resistance axis, amid Israeli aggression that has crossed all permissible red lines,' he said. 'If the confrontation escalates ... this may not only mean the continuation of attacks on Israeli targets but also the potential involvement of additional factions in larger, more complex operations,' he said.

I was tempted by easy money': Court indicts Azerbaijani couple w...	Rafael Guliyev admits to charges against him but distances his wife from crime claiming she had no knowledge of it; suspects say they didn't wish to harm Israel's security Rafael Guliyev, 32, made aliyah to Israel with his family from Azerbaijan at age 7. During one of his visits to his homeland, he met Lala, 29, who joined him in Israel six months ago. The two married and now live together in Lod. The couple was caught at a hotel in Tel Aviv while surveilling a highly sensitive security facility for Iranian intelligence operatives. On Thursday, they were charged with gathering intelligence for Iran, facing serious security-related charges of aiding the enemy in wartime and providing information to the enemy with the intent to harm national security. In a hearing held at the Central Region District Court, the prosecution requested to remand the couple until the end of the legal proceedings against them. At the conclusion of the hearing, it was decided that the couple would remain in custody for at least 30 days until a further decision was made regarding their case. 'The respondents committed security offenses at a time when the State of Israel is engaged in one of its toughest wars, facing multiple fronts including Iran,' the prosecution said in its request. The indictment noted that individuals identifying themselves as Elshan and Hassan, acting on behalf of Iranian intelligence agencies, were involved in recruiting Israelis, including the couple, to carry out various tasks aimed at gathering intelligence for the Islamic Republic. The defendants were asked, among other things, to photograph the Mossad headquarters, take pictures of graves of those killed in the October 7 massacre and monitor an academic from the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) aiming to harm her. The Iranian handlers, one of whom had a prior acquaintance with the defendant’s family from Azerbaijan, assigned Guliyev a 'test mission.' According to the indictment, Elshan asked the defendant to photograph a tourism office located near the Moldovan embassy in Tel Aviv. Guliyev initially arrived near the German embassy, took photos there and only later reached the correct location sent by his handler, near the Moldovan embassy. The defendant received $400 for this photo. From that point on, the defendants were assigned numerous tasks, which Guliyev carried out either alone or with his wife, under the guidance of foreign agents. Among various assignments, the defendants were asked to photograph the graves of victims of the October 7 massacre at cemeteries in Petah Tikva, Kfar Saba, Jerusalem and Be'er Sheva. For these photos, the defendant was paid $1,200. He received $650 for each day of surveillance and photographing of Mossad headquarters. In total, the couple received approximately $26,000 in cryptocurrency from foreign agents. 'I don’t know what my husband did or why he took pictures without my understanding,' Lala Guliyev, who doesn’t speak Hebrew, claimed during her interrogation. However, investigators from the Israel Police’s special investigations unit Lahav 433 and the Shin Bet assert that she was fully aware of the purpose behind photographing security-sensitive sites across Israel and the source of the money they received for their actions. 'Today I understand that my actions could have harmed the country I love. I deeply regret it. I’ve been in this country for 25 years and I love it. I didn’t mean to harm the country; I was tempted by easy money,' the defendant said. 'I thought I could trick the Iranians and only took mock photos.' Guliyev admitted to receiving instructions from his Iranian handler. Regarding the request to photograph the graves of last year’s massacre victims, the defendant said, 'They insisted I take photos, even though I told them it was available online.' The defendant recounted that during one of his trips to Azerbaijan, a local businessman asked him to photograph offices for rent in Tel Aviv and Haifa, along with the views from them. He further shared that the businessman later connected him with another local, saying, 'He had an Iranian accent.' Guliyev revealed this individual overwhelmed him with requests to photograph sensitive sites in Israel. The investigation revealed that the Iranian intelligence handler was well-acquainted with Israel and its sensitive and strategic facilities. While the defendant admitted to taking the photos, he also said during his investigation, 'I thought I was smarter than the Iranian, so I didn’t photograph exactly what he asked for.' Later, the Iranian handler requested bolder actions, such as setting cars on fire. He also asked Guliyev, 'Do you have the courage to kill someone?' to which the defendant responded, 'I don’t.' Guliyev admitted in his interrogation that he recognized the handler as a hostile entity assigning him tasks, but claimed he didn’t believe his actions would harm the country. Investigators suspect that the handlers were involved in other cases leading to indictments against Israelis for espionage on behalf of Iran.

Officials optimistic Lebanon deal possible despite Hezbollah's re...	Biden envoys arrive in Israel to meet officials and discuss potential diplomatic agreement report says first draft will allow Israel to act in Lebanon for 60 days Officials familiar with the talks between U.S. President Joe Biden's Middle East envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials said on Thursday that the administration's envoys are expected to return to Israel to finalize a deal, after meeting Biden and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. 'More important than the agreement will be an American document that will authorize Israel to act,' they said. Jerusalem understands that there will most certainly be violations of the deal until the Lebanese military takes over responsibility for South Lebanon. Saudi outlet Al-Hadath reported the two will return directly to the U.S. from Israel, without visiting Lebanon. Israeli officials denied that this was an indication of a lack of progress. 'We didn't deceive ourselves into thinking this would be resolved today or within a few days,' they said. 'We have made progress toward implementing Resolution 1701, which will serve as the basis for a political agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. It’s important to make sure we have clarity, both from Lebanon and from Israel, about what would be required under 1701 to get its effective implementation,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. A senior American official said that Thursday’s meetings in Israel were 'substantial and constructive, focusing on a range of issues in depth including Iran, Lebanon, Gaza and securing the hostages' release.' McGurk and Hochstein met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, Mossad Director David Barnea and other senior Israeli officials. 'The two focused on efforts to secure a cease-fire agreement in Lebanon, allowing people on both sides of the Blue Line to return home safely, as well as new initiatives to secure the release of hostages which Hamas must address without delay,' the official added. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu made it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel's ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes,' the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement. Meanwhile, Al-Hadath cited Hezbollah sources saying the terror group refused to withdraw beyond the Litani River as part of the agreement. The Wall Street Journal also revealed on Thursday a draft of the pending agreement, which includes a clause allowing Israel to strike in Lebanon during a 60-day interim period in response to ' imminent threats.' According to the report, Israel would enforce the agreement and relevant UN resolutions, including UN Security Council Resolution 1701 which concluded the Second Lebanon War in 2006. The proposal was expected to face strong opposition from both Hezbollah and the Lebanese government due to concerns over violations of Lebanese sovereignty. As per the draft, Israel would need to withdraw its forces from Lebanon after a week, after which the Lebanese army would deploy in the country's south to help dismantle military infrastructure linked to Hezbollah and other militias. According to the journal, neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government has accepted the proposal, which they argue 'gives Israel too much leeway to continue attacking over the border,' according to Lebanese and Arab officials familiar with the talks. Lebanese officials said they were reluctant to reject the deal publicly as the document leaves room for continued negotiations that could ultimately bring the conflict to an end, according to Arab sources.

Iran's supreme leader's decision prompted by the extent of damage caused in Israel's strike on Iranian military targets, says failing to respond is admitting defeat; Netanyahu issues warning to Iran that nuclear sites could be targeted Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei gave the order to prepare for a strike on Israel, the New York Times reported on Thursday quoting three Iranian officials. According to the paper the decision was made after the leader was briefed on the extent of damage caused by Israel's strike on Iran last Saturday. Khamenei, they said was impressed by the number of casualties and the damage and said ignoring the results of the Israeli strike would be 'admitting defeat.' The officials said the strike would come after the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential elections so as not to help the Republican candidate Donald Trump's chances. Earlier Kamenei's senior aid Mohammad Mohammadi Golpayegani warned of a 'harsh and regretful' response to Israel's strike. 'The recent action of the Zionist regime in attacking parts of our country was a desperate move and the Islamic Republic of Iran will give it a harsh and regretful response,' the influential cleric, told the Tasnim news agency. He praised Iran's air defense performance in 'preventing the entry of the Zionist regime fighters into the territory' and said damage from the strikes was 'minimal.' The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Hossein Salami said Israel made a mistake and will see Iran's reaction that will 'surpass imagination.' He said Israel was wrong to believe it could change the balance of power in the region by launching a few missiles but saw how its air defenses failed during Iran's strike on October 1. During that attack, Iran launched some 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a clear message to Iran in a speech to the graduation ceremony of IDF cadets, saying Israel's primary goal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear capability, remains unchanged. 'The bravado of the Iranian regime cannot mask the simple fact that Israel today has a greater freedom to operate in Iran than ever before,' he said.

Berlin cops on hunt for suspect after he drops bag with explosive...	Man stopped for a routine document check takes off leaving his bag with triacetone triperoxide (TATP), same explosives used in ISIS Paris Bataclan attack; Berlin police says risk of a terror strike still in place German police are searching for a man who abandoned a bag of explosives at a Berlin train station and ran away after being stopped by federal officers, according to police. 'We are investigating all possibilities,' a police spokesperson told Reuters on Thursday, adding that authorities had not yet been able to identify the suspect. Police said they stopped the man in the German capital's Neukoelln station on Wednesday afternoon. He fled the scene and explosives were found in the bag he left behind, according to a post on social media platform X. The explosive found was triacetone triperoxide (TATP), often referred to as 'the mother of Satan' due to its prominent use in attacks, such as the Bataclan club bombing in Paris, in the shoe soles of Richard Reid and the planning of the Taylor Swift concert attacks in Vienna. The amount of explosive material and the charges found inside prompted police to alter protocol: rather than transporting the device to a designated disposal station, authorities evacuated passengers from the train station and transported the device to an open area. Firefighters then dug a pit for a controlled detonation of the material. The blast's echoes were heard hundreds of meters away. 'If the device had exploded in a crowded area, the consequences would’ve been dramatic,' a police officer told the BZ newspaper. 'The device was wired, indicating it was meant for use, not transit alone. This is an explosive that anyone could make in their kitchen from materials anyone can buy. Using such an explosive carries an extremely high risk. The explosive can detonate from any movement or change in weather. A major disaster was averted.' Police could neither confirm nor deny the report on the type of explosive.

Hamas entered UNRWA and took everything,' Gazan staffer says	IDF releases interrogation with UNRWA worker in Gaza describing how terror group operatives took over UNRWA facilities and vehicles and looted aid meant for civilians for their personal use The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Thursday released a video clip from the interrogation of a Gazan staffer of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees UNRWA who described how Hamas used the organization's facilities as their own. 'They see UNRWA vehicles as a form of protection,' he said. 'Hamas entered the place [UNRWA facilities] and took everything. Hamas is, after all, the government. They took it in their way (by force), it happened before everybody’s eyes. It’s no secret. Because they [UNRWA vehicles] have supplies, they started taking the supplies out of them and distributing them using private supply lines,' he said in his interrogation. On Tuesday, the Knesset voted to pass a bill banning UNRWA’s activities in Israel after employees of the agency took part in the Hamas massacre last year. The legislation caused the outrage of UN and international bodies. The law passed by a vote of 92-10. European Council President warned on Thursday that Israel's decision to ban the key U.N. aid agency for Gaza could result in the annulment of a deal establishing Israeli trade relations with Brussels. 'The decision made by parliament in Israel, if implemented, to ban UNRWA in Israel is absolutely not acceptable and I cannot imagine that there would be no consequences on the EU side,' Charles Michel told reporters in Geneva. 'I can observe that more and mo re voices, including at the political level, the highest political level of the EU, are considering that the time will come to put on the table the Association Agreement between Israel and the EU,' he said. The deal, which entered into force in 2000, provides the legal basis for trade between the two parties. An EU website showed that the EU is Israel's biggest trade partner, accounting for 28.8% of its trade in goods in 2022, while Israel is the EU's 25th biggest trade partner. Under the new law, UNRWA will not 'operate any institution, provide any service, or conduct any activity, whether directly or indirectly,' in the sovereign territory of Israel. In effect, UNRWA's activities in East Jerusalem will be terminated and the body's powers will be transferred to Israel's responsibility and control.

PM spokesperson given full access despite being denied security c...	Spokesperson closely allied to Netanyahu sits in on confidential meetings, calls with U.S. officials, enters secure sites; IDF probes leak of confidential material to press Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office allowed access to classified and sensitive information to a spokesperson who failed his security clearance review held by the Shin Bet, Ynet learned on Thursday. The spokesperson accompanied Netanyahu on visits to sensitive security facilities during the war, including the Air Force command bunker at the IDF’s Tel Aviv military headquarters and was even exposed to classified transcripts from meetings held by the Security Cabinet. According to sources close to the matter, the spokesperson was initially hired to work for Prime Minister’s Office’s Director General Yossi Shelley’s office. He was promoted at the request of Netanyahu’s Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman and left the Director General’s office to serve as a spokesperson in the 'Aquarium' — a nickname for the Prime Minister's office, one of the country's most sensitive facilities, dealing with security issues. For this role, he was required to receive a high-level security clearance. However, as reported by Israeli public broadcast channel Kan 11, the spokesperson failed the security screening. According to insiders, his position with the director general ended after this came to light, but he continued to act as a spokesperson on security issues despite not having clearance. After leaving the director general's staff, he was no longer a full-time employee but this didn’t prevent him from continuing to represent the prime minister on sensitive security matters. Throughout this period, he worked under Braverman and stayed in contact with Netanyahu’s various spokespeople. He was involved in sensitive political and security discussions, participated in consultations and even joined several security-related conference calls, including some with U.S. officials. Since his official employment at the Prime Minister’s Office ended on April 1, efforts were made to hire him as a paid external consultant, though no contract was finalized. In recent months, Netanyahu’s office has tried to officially hire him as an external consultant and pay him for his services. Ynet reported last month that the IDF was investigating how classified material was leaked to certain international publications for perceived political motivation. Senior officials close to Netanyahu on Wednesday distanced themselves from the spokesperson, who was known as close to the Prime Minister over the past year. Ynet couldn’t obtain his comment. The Shin Bet and the Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment on the matter.

Exiled cleric’s death likely to improve Turkish-US relations, ana...	Turkish justice minister said there were 256 extradition requests for people in the US that Ankara believes are members of Gülen’s network and there are still diplomatic disagreements over the handling of those suspected of being his followers The death of Pennsylvania-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen will likely improve Washington’s relations with Ankara, which had demanded his extradition over accusations he masterminded the 2016 coup attempt. The request for Gülen’s extradition was one of the largest challenges in relations between the US and its key NATO ally, Turkey. Ömer Özkizilcik, an Ankara-based non-residential fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the argument over his extradition was a source of distrust for Turkey, which believed that the US keeping him in the country was evidence that Washington was behind the putsch. 'This will most likely open the way for the new administration, whether it will be [US Vice President Kamala] Harris or [former US President Donald] Trump, to restart and rekindle the Turkish-American relations after the American election results,' he said. Suspicions of Gülen’s involvement in the putsch are widespread across the political spectrum in Turkey, and some of his strongest critics are also opposed to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Yusuf Can, an analyst at the Wilson Center’s Middle East program, agreed that pressure on ties between Turkey and the US could decrease due to Gülen’s passing. 'The impact of Gülen’s death is multifaceted. On the one hand, his death might ease tensions around his extradition, which has been a significant issue between Turkey and the US,' Can said. Turkey’s state news agency reported last year that the Turkish justice minister said there were 256 extradition requests for people in the US that Ankara believes are members of Gülen’s network and 483 in the European Union. Özkizilcik warned that, despite Gülen’s death, there would still be diplomatic disagreements over the handling of those suspected of being his followers. According to Özkizilcik, there would be internal disputes within Gülen’s network following his death, possibly weakening the group, and Ankara could use this time to try to get more of his followers and those suspected of being part of the coup attempt back to Turkey. 'They will definitely still be a topic, but these people will not be as pressuring and as high priority… as Gülen himself was,' he said, adding that if there is an improvement in relations between the US and Turkey, extradition requests will no longer harm those ties. 'This topic will remain. It will not go away, but it will not be as public as it was before. It will not be as pressuring as it was before, and it will be done more behind closed doors on a bureaucratic level rather than politically and in the public.' Can agreed that problems would remain between the two countries given that people linked to Gülen’s network were still in the US despite Turkey’s desire for extradition, but the prominence of the issue would likely decline. He stated that while Ankara would continue to seek people’s extradition, this issue would likely be used as leverage during negotiations, especially in cases where the US needs Turkey’s cooperation. On Monday, Kenya said it had accepted an extradition request from Turkey for four Turkish refugees, with some reports suggesting they had connections to the Gülen network. The government stated that it was assured these refugees would be treated in line with international law. Three days earlier, Amnesty International said it was alarmed and concerned about what it referred to as the individuals’ 'abductions' and that the incident broke international refugee law. The UNHCR told the AFP news agency that Kenya should 'abide by their international legal obligations and, in particular, to respect the principle of non-refoulement, which protects asylum-seekers and refugees from any measure that could lead to their removal to a place where their life or freedom would be threatened.' Özkizilcik said that Turkey could increase the number of such operations as Gülen’s network potentially weakens following his death. However, he did not expect these attempts to happen in the US or Europe. Can argued that the UN’s comments would not likely carry much weight for Ankara or substantially impact its policies. This is partly because of the international organization’s waning influence on the global stage. 'The AKP government has historically been dismissive of international criticism unless it leads to tangible negative consequences,' he said.

Negotiations continue despite Hamas rejecting partial	Terror group rejects proposals by Egypt and the U.S. to facilitate a partial hostage and cease-fire deal they hope would lead to a preeminent end to fighting in the Strip; Sources say talks still advancing behind the scenes Intense negotiations are ongoing to facilitate a hostage and cease-fire deal with Hamas despite the terror group's rejection of Egypt and the U.S.'s proposals, Ynet has learned. Hamas was now demanding guarantees before any 'small deal' that it will eventually lead to a halt in fighting and a full withdrawal. Senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu said in an interview that the terror group opposed a temporary cease-fire. 'The idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,' he told AFP. Meanwhile, the Hamas-affiliated Quds network revealed new details regarding proposals for a partial deal. According to the report, the Egyptian proposal involves a 10-day cease-fire, during which 150 aid trucks would enter Gaza daily, in exchange for the release of four hostages, including two women. The American proposal, according to sources cited by Quds, involves a 30-day cease-fire and the entry of 600 aid trucks per day in exchange for the release of all female and IDF soldier hostages. 'Both proposals concern a partial deal that doesn't end the war, nor does it include returning displaced residents to their homes or an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza,' the report added. 'All proposals are Israeli, based on Netanyahu's desire for a partial deal.' As mediators await Hamas's official response regarding its willingness to enter negotiations on a hostage deal based on the proposals presented at the Doha summit earlier this week, a source close to the talks in Qatar said on Wednesday that the terror group would be offered a cease-fire lasting 'less than a month.' The source added that discussions between Mossad chief David Barnea, CIA Director William Burns and Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani focused on a proposal for a several-week pause. The source noted that the proposal to be conveyed to Hamas includes the release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails and an increase in humanitarian aid delivery to the Strip. 'Senior U.S. officials believe that if a short-term agreement can be reached, it could lead to a more permanent agreement,' he added. Qatari officials are expected to meet with Hamas leaders in the coming days to relay the proposals from the Doha summit and check whether the terror group is willing to sit at the negotiation table for a smaller deal. In addition to the American and Egyptian plans, a Russian proposal is also on the table which involves the release of two hostages with dual citizenship.

Saudi-US bilateral accords 'not that connected' to Israel normali...	Country's foreign minister says 'moving ahead' with normalization efforts with Israel after negotiating with officials in Washington Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Thursday that some of the bilateral agreements the kingdom has been negotiating with Washington are 'not that tied' to the normalization of Saudi relations with Israel and are 'moving ahead'. Potential U.S.-Saudi agreements about trade and artificial intelligence are 'not tied to any third parties' and 'can progress probably quite quickly,' Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said on stage at an investment conference in the Saudi capital Riyadh. 'Some of the more significant defense cooperation agreements are much more complicated. We would certainly welcome an opportunity to finish them before the (end of the Biden) administration's term, but that's reliant on other factors outside of our control,' he said. 'The other work streams are not that connected, and some of them are progressing quite quickly, and we hope to see moving forward.' Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are looking into a set of agreements on nuclear energy, security and defense cooperation, which were originally all part of a wider normalization deal with Riyadh and Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden's aides originally envisioned, in three-way negotiations before the Oct. 7 attack, for Saudi Arabia to gain U.S. security commitments and U.S. nuclear cooperation in exchange for normalizing ties with Israel. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said in May that Washington and Riyadh were close to concluding a set of agreements but cautioned that for normalization to proceed there must be calm in Gaza and a path to Palestinian statehood. Prince Faisal on Thursday reiterated the kingdom's position that it would not recognize Israel without a Palestinian state, adding on that accord, Saudi Arabia is 'quite happy to wait until the situation is amenable,' before moving ahead with normalization.

Prime minister says Tehran's bravado cannot mask the fact that Israel now has the greatest freedom to operate in Iran; says the war in Gaza and Lebanon will continue until objectives are met, freeing hostages, preventing Hamas rule over Gaza, safety of Israelis in the north and south Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has not altered its intention to stop Iran's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons. speaking at a graduation ceremony for IDF officer cadets, he said Israel's ultimate objective was and remains to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear capabilities. 'The bravado of the Iranian regime cannot mask the simple fact that Israel today has a greater freedom to operate in Iran that ever before. After the IDF strike on Iranian military targets including air defenses on Saturday, and after the regime in Tehran first played down the severity of the damage caused in the attack, threats of retaliation have been increasing. CNN quoted a 'senior source' familiar with the Iranian discussions who said there will be a 'definitive and painful' response to Israel’s recent attack on its territory, likely before the U.S. presidential election on November 5. CNN did not specify where the source came from, but it is implied from his words that he is Iranian. 'The response of the Islamic Republic to the aggression of the Zionist regime will be definitive and painful,' said the source. The White House once again called upon Iran not to attack Israel. White House spokeswoman Karin Jean-Pierre was asked at a press briefing about a report about a possible attack and replied: Iran should not respond to Israel's retaliation. They should not. ... If they do, we will support Israel in defending itself, but they should not,' she said at a news briefing. In his speech, Netanyahu said there was no set date to end the war, only set objectives. he said until Hamas is removed from its rule over Gaza and cannot pose a threat to Israel, the war will continue. He said the objectives are victory and the return of the hostages. He said that the agreement under consideration to end the war in Lebanon must include the IDF's freedom to enforce measures vital for security and prevent Hezbollah from re-arming. 'Let me be clear, the documents, papers, proposals 1559, 1701, all those are not the issue. The issue is our ability and mostly our determination to enforce security,' he said. The prime minister said he greatly appreciated U.S. support adding that when possible he accepts Washington's demands and when necessary, he opposes them.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqch711wjl	2024-10-31T08:03:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/31/SJN11vQ1111kx/SJN11vQ1111kx_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Over the past year, locals repeatedly called on Northern Command officers to remove the threat but were told the tower was controlled by the Lebanese military or UN forces. On Monday, the Israeli military destroyed the tower. 'The demolition of that tower has lifted another layer of fear for us,' said Nisan Zeevi, a resident of the evacuated Kibbutz Kfar Giladi, who has a permanent binocular station in his backyard to keep watch on the area. He gazed repeatedly at the remains of the tower, calling them a symbol of hope. 'That tower overlooked the entire Hula Valley, Kiryat Shmona and the fence-adjacent communities,' he described. Behind it lies the village of Khiam, where extensive terrorist infrastructure remains largely unaddressed. Amid reports of U.S.-pressured government talks to reach an agreement with Hezbollah and end the fighting, residents in Israel’s north are divided over what to make of the potential deal. 'We've learned not to react to every report but to see what the results bring,' said Zeevi. 'Taking down that tower is symbolic, but it's not the whole picture. Israel knows that to bring the northern residents back home, we need to decide if our goal has been achieved. No plan has been presented showing how to create real security here, let alone a sustainable economic or community vision for the area.' On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the home of Einat and Gideon Lev-Ari in the town of Metula was destroyed by Hezbollah shelling. Einat decided early in the war that she would not return to Metula as long as the tower overlooking the valley still stood. 'To me, it symbolized the existential threat and the neglect that allowed such a structure to exist here at all,' she explained. 'I understand that we’ll have to return to the land we worked on, but if the crisis of trust continues, we won’t be able to stay here.' Lev-Ari, however, welcomed the idea of a cease-fire agreement to end the war. 'I think the army has done an excellent job dismantling Hezbollah’s capabilities. Even after a deal, there will be hidden weapons and threats, but I hope the agreement includes a real buffer zone separating us from any Lebanese influence.' Prosper Azran, former mayor of Kiryat Shmona, has refused to leave his home since the outbreak of war. Even a rocket strike on the housing unit in his yard didn’t sway him. 'I don’t trust any deal that says foreigners will protect us,' he said angrily. 'After we’ve seen what’s happening in southern Lebanon, they tell us only 30% of the Radwan forces remain. Even 10% of them could do more damage than Hamas did in the south. We have to keep them on the run—there’s no peace with them.' For Azran, any agreement must guarantee 'an area no Arab can enter, where we don’t need permission to eliminate anyone who crosses into it.' Itzik Ben-Moha, chairman of the local council of Zar’it in Western Galilee, posted a sign at the entrance reading: 'Residents of Zar’it are not sitting ducks. We will not return without a demilitarized zone.' A year after they were evacuated from their homes, Zar’it residents declared that rumors of a deal wouldn’t make them pack up the lives they’ve built far from the Lebanese border. 'We made a community-wide decision: no one is going back, and we’re ready to launch a campaign to make the Israeli government understand that it’s us or Hezbollah,' Ben-Moha declared. 'The residents won’t return until all operations in southern Lebanon are completed, as we were promised until the army clears everything—to the Litani [River]. For years, they kept telling us there were no tunnels, and that everything was fine. The system misled the residents here. We now know the truth about the tunnels and the weapons caches they found—and there’s more of it in deeper areas. We appreciate what our soldiers have done so far, but it’s not enough. We won’t go back only to become another community under fire.'

Two dead in rocket strike north of Haifa	A woman in her 60s and a man in his 20s were the latest fatalities in Hezbollah fire since the morning hours at least one more man in his 70s was wounded; the terror group launched a barrage of 25 projectiles hours after missiles killed five in Metula. A woman in her 60s and a man in his 20s were killed in a rocket attack on the northern suburbs of Haifa on Thursday. Another man in his 70s was wounded in a barrage of some 25 projectiles. The victims were identified as members of the same family, from the Arab city of Shfar'am who were at their olive grove. The attack came hours after five people were killed when missiles struck the northern border town of Metula. This is the deadliest day of civilian casualties in the north since the war began. While Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli cities, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with American envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk in Jerusalem to discuss progress in the negotiations for a cease-fire on the Lebanese front. 'The prime minister told his guests that the main point is not the writer agreement but Israel's ability to enforce it and respond to any threat from Lebanon on its security, in a way that will bring the residents of the Galilee safely back home,' the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement.

Israel works to fortify settlements as West Bank reaches boiling ...	West Bank operations continue unabated, focusing on eastern border, Green Line crossings and Hamas recruitment efforts; following lessons from October 7, Israel bolsters forces and armed rapid-response teams to double firepower for sudden threats As negotiations for calm continue along Israel’s northern border and hostilities remain active in Gaza and southern Lebanon, IDF operations in the West Bank show no signs of slowing, even after heightened activity during the recent High Holiday period. Although recent weeks have seen fewer prolonged operations deep in refugee camps, aggressive counter-terrorism efforts persist. Overnight Thursday, IDF forces targeted and eliminated an armed terrorist cell in a preemptive airstrike on Tulkarm's Nur al-Shams refugee camp. Israeli security assessments highlight three key strategic areas contributing to regional security challenges: Arm smuggling on the eastern border: For months, the IDF and Shin Bet have warned of extensive arms smuggling along the porous Jordanian border, with terrorist groups attempting to bring sophisticated arms, including anti-tank missiles and military-grade explosives, into the West Bank. While the IDF recently announced plans to establish a specialized division focused on tightening security along this border, its operational start date remains uncertain. Green Line crossings: Movement across the Green Line into Israel and back into the West Bank is a key security concern, with authorities working to strengthen defenses at checkpoints. Despite these efforts, officials report significant quantities of smuggled ammunition—such as a recent seizure of thousands of 5.56mm rounds intended for West Bank terrorists. Regarding unauthorized workers, estimates indicate that about 70,000 Palestinian workers are present within Israel, around 40,000 of whom lack permits. Though the Security cabinet has avoided deciding on halting the entry of Palestinian workers during the ongoing war, far-right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir continue to oppose such discussions. Cross-Border terror coordination: Security officials report that Hamas is actively recruiting West Bank operatives from Lebanon, Syria and Gaza to carry out attacks. Known as 'external direction,' this coordination includes providing operatives with funding, often through intermediaries, such as electronics traders who receive funds from Hamas to purchase supplies, keep a portion and deliver the rest to West Bank contacts. Meanwhile, IDF West Bank Division is now focusing on securing major roads and settlements, reinforced in the wake of the October 7 attacks. Additional arms, equipment and personnel, including reservists and rapid-response teams, have been deployed to strengthen settlement defenses. In some areas, notably in Samaria in the northern West Bank, IDF bases have been relocated closer to communities. The objective is to double available firepower in case of sudden threats, giving forces time to hold positions until reinforcements arrive. The West Bank Division highlights the strategic importance of operating within refugee camps, where preserving freedom of movement for counter-terror efforts is key. 'The goal is to maintain and expand operational flexibility,' an IDF source explained, noting that frequent entry into camps reinforces the military’s deterrence and helps prevent armed resistance during arrests or security operations. 'To keep this freedom of action, I’m in Nur al-Shams every week,' he said, expressing concern over northern Samaria, where substantial funds and resources are fueling terrorism. Despite political actions that have destabilized the Palestinian Authority, Israel’s security agencies coordinate counter-terrorism with Palestinian security forces. While IDF officials emphasize they are not solely reliant on Palestinian forces, cooperation in certain areas does take place. The Palestinian Authority’s recent arrest of a terror cell in the Qalqilya area exemplifies this coordination. Security forces captured six suspects and a large cache of weapons intended for a major attack, including seven Carlo submachine guns, four M16 rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. However, while Palestinian forces work with Israeli counterparts, they typically avoid refugee camps, where the IDF has intensified operations. An IDF official noted that despite a relatively calm holiday period in the West Bank, the situation remains volatile, with a call among officials for larger-scale operations to seize arms, set up checkpoints and conduct broader arrests.

Ministries call to cut ties with Haaretz after publisher calls te...	Amos Schocken accuses Netanyahu government of enforcing 'cruel apartheid regime' on Palestinians; interior and communications ministries urg cutting all government ties with newspaper, suggesting halting services would 'ease public distress' Government officials called to terminate any ties with Haaretz newspaper after its publisher, Amos Schocken, called Palestinian terrorists 'freedom fighters.' On Wednesday evening, Interior Minister Moshe Arbel instructed his staff to effectively stop any collaboration with the daily, with the ministry's director-general issuing a formal letter to that effect. 'We cannot and will not remain silent in the face of harm to IDF soldiers and the state's efforts to protect its citizens,' the director wrote. During a Haaretz conference in London, Schocken criticized the Israeli government, claiming 'It dismisses the costs [to] both sides for defending the settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls 'terrorists.'' He further accused the Netanyahu government of 'imposing a cruel apartheid regime' on the Palestinian Arab population and usurping lands supposedly designated for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Schocken's comments generated significant backlash, particularly after labeling Israel's actions in 'the occupied territories and in part of Gaza' as a 'second Nakba,' using the Arab term meaning 'disaster' for Israel’s 1948 War of Independence. Schocken's remarks reached Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi, who proposed to the government that all dealings with Haaretz be halted. This includes ending government press office advertisements in the newspaper and prohibiting any governmental agency from communicating with Haaretz in any form. 'It is worth noting that Haaretz is generously funded by Israeli citizens through advertisements and subscriptions purchased by the government,' Karhi said. 'Halting the purchase of services from Haaretz by government bodies will ease the significant distress Israeli citizens feel, not only from the newspaper's publications but also from being compelled to fund it with their tax money. This approach will mitigate the harm to Israeli citizens without disproportionately infringing on freedom of expression. 'Israel's status as a buyer of advertisements and subscriptions from Haaretz is that of a party to a contract. This is not an administrative action, but rather a contractual decision subject to free will. By adopting its current line, Haaretz surely considered that this extreme position could alienate some of its clientele. The State of Israel is a customer of Haaretz.'

‘We are in the beginning of a third world war’	ILTV News interview with MK Sharren Haskel Israel and the West may be facing the early stages of a third world war—a clash not only against groups like Hamas and Hezbollah but one that pits radical Islam against Western civilization. 'This is a cultural and religious war, with Israel on the front lines,' MK Sharren Haskel told ILTV News in an exclusive interview for its new podcast last week. Haskel, known by some internationally as Israel's 'Minister of Hasbara' or public diplomacy, didn't hold back on what Israel's response to Iran might have looked like if she were prime minister. Over the weekend, the Israeli air force struck several Iranian military sites across multiple cities in response to a recent Iranian attack, which launched over 180 rockets toward civilian areas in Israel on October 1. Haskel said she would have prioritized targeting Iran's economic lifelines and nuclear reactors to prevent the country from achieving nuclear weapons. Analysts suggest that Israel's recent strikes might ease future actions against Iran. However, Israel refrained from hitting nuclear facilities, oil refineries, and other infrastructure at Washington's request. 'Imagine those missiles they sent toward Israel with nuclear warheads,' Haskel said. 'What would happen? Israel wouldn't exist.' She stressed that Iran operates through proxies worldwide, not just in the Middle East, while the international community 'chooses to completely ignore it.' 'You'll either fight them when they're small, with fewer casualties, or you'll face them when they have nuclear capabilities, with tens of thousands, if not millions, of victims,' Haskel warned. 'And it won't just be Israelis—it will be British soldiers, American troops, French forces, German forces.' On Monday, the Knesset was set to vote on two bills related to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). One bill would make it illegal for Israeli officials to cooperate with the organization, while the other aims to restrict UNRWA's operations in Jerusalem. Haskel founded the UNRWA caucus nine years ago when she entered the Knesset. Her goal was to develop an alternative for serving Gaza's population and Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, and East Jerusalem. Only after the October 7 massacre, when Israel uncovered direct ties between UNRWA and Hamas, did the country move to designate it a terrorist organization. According to Israel, around 10% of UNRWA employees are linked to Hamas. Haskel told ILTV that UNRWA provides services typically offered by a government, like education, healthcare, housing, and infrastructure. 'UNRWA even provided the street sweepers,' she said. 'Over the years, they let Hamas take over, manage, and run the organization, using it for their own purposes.' Israel has shown that Hamas was using UNRWA schools and other buildings to conceal terror infrastructure. Some of UNRWA's teachers and doctors were found to be directly linked to the October 7 attacks or involved in holding hostages. Now, Haskel is calling on Israel and the international community—including the Abraham Accords countries, Saudi Arabia, the European Union, and the United States—to replace UNRWA with a new program that offers similar services. She is also advocating for a comprehensive overhaul of the UNRWA education system, which she says promotes hatred toward Israel and Jews. 'If we want to change our future, it has to start with education,' Haskel said. 'One of the soldiers' Since October 7, Haskel has traveled around the world, speaking in parliaments across five continents and giving interviews to major media outlets. As head of the Knesset Christian Allies Caucus, she has connected with parliamentarians who support Israel through their faith. By educating them about UNRWA and Israel's position, these allies can advocate for Israel among other lawmakers. She said that, beyond the physical war, Israel faces another battlefield in media and social media. 'For me, I feel with my position, I'm one of the soldiers to fight this fight for Israel,' Haskel said. 'Our family members are fighting on the front line, and my job is to fight those lies in the media and social media… and to tell [the world] about the real Israel.' Haskel believes that being a woman and a young mother of three children under four makes her relatable to the politicians and journalists she meets. Her fluent English also helps. Haskel lived in Australia for almost seven years, where she studied to become a veterinary nurse and worked at a clinic that rescues, treats and releases wildlife back into nature. 'It was a completely different life, and I loved it,' she admitted. 'But I made a conscious decision about where I want my life to be, where I want my kids to grow up, and to recognize the incredible miracle our country is.' She lamented that the government and other relevant bodies still don't coordinate well enough to effectively fight for Israel in the media and on social platforms. While she acknowledges it's better than in past operations, she feels there's still room for improvement. She also knows that the job is far bigger than her alone. Still, she believes every small victory matters. 'I have a responsibility,' she said. If I know I'm capable of doing this, I have to do it. It's part of my obligation.' Although she feels guilty about not always being home with her young children, she understands that her work is helping to build a safer Israel for them in the future. 'After October 7, I was shocked to my core,' Haskel admitted. She shared that she learned about year-old twins who watched as their mother was killed in front of them and were then left to cry for hours—set as a trap by Hamas. Anyone who heard their cries and entered would be ambushed. 'As Israeli mothers, we carry those tragedies and those horrifying stories,' Haskel said. 'I would go to my girls' room every few hours to check that they were okay during the night. I would sleep with my gun under my pillow, and every noise—a motorcycle or something else—would make me run to the window and look. This is our mission: to protect our babies, our children. And as a leader of this country, I have a responsibility to all of these children to make it safer, to make sure that something like that will never, ever, ever happen again.' She added, 'For that, many changes need to happen. I'm only one, but with God's help, this is going to be my life's mission: to make sure that Israel is safe and secure and that something like that will just never happen again to any Israeli child.' She stated that the war with Gaza cannot end until all the hostages come home. However, since the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month, she is more optimistic that this could happen. Haskel expressed hope that, in the end, Israel can still live in peace with its neighbors. 'If we work together, understanding how we need to resolve the problem and build a different future, I believe we can do that,' Haskel concluded. Although she acknowledged that, for now, Israel must stay in control of security in Gaza and at the border, she believes that in two or three generations, 'there could be a Palestinian leadership that will want to look after its people and that will be capable of doing that well.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj9m00alyg	2024-10-31T04:31:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/11/S1iWFogrS0/S1iWFogrS0_0_0_1558_878_0_small.jpg
Watchdog: ‘UNRWA’s existence violates UN charter’	ILTV News speaks with UN Watch’s legal advisor, Dina Rovner. The existence of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) violates the UN Charter 'because instead of promoting peace and security, it perpetuates conflict and war,' said UN Watch’s legal advisor, Dina Rovner. In an interview with ILTV News, Rovner argued that UNRWA 'perpetuates conflict and war' and poses a threat to the State of Israel and the safety of its citizens. She explained that Israel’s parliament, which voted earlier this week to ban UNRWA operations in Israel within 90 days, acted within its legal rights. 'UNRWA keeps Palestinians in perpetual refugeehood, giving them this dream that they have a right of return to sovereign Israeli territory,' Rovner concluded. 'We know what that looks like. We saw it on October 7.'

Should Israel sign a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah?	ILTV speaks with Sarit Zehavi, founder and president of the Alma Research and Education Center Will Hezbollah continue to threaten Israel's northern border residents if a ceasefire deal is reached in the coming days or weeks? This is the critical question security experts are examining before any agreements are finalized. Sarit Zehavi, founder and president of the Alma Research and Education Center, says it all hinges on whether Hezbollah can rearm and redeploy along the border. 'The only way to ensure this doesn’t happen is to implement an effective, military-level monitoring mechanism,' Zehavi noted, 'which would need to be deployed by Israel, the United States, or a capable international entity.' Furthermore, she emphasized the global community must press Lebanon to alter Hezbollah’s status within its borders. 'Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization worldwide, yet in Lebanon, it is recognized as a legitimate political party that participates in government decision-making,' Zehavi said. 'This is unprecedented. As long as this remains the case, I don’t believe we will see real change in Israel’s north or Lebanon’s south.'

FBI offers $5 million reward for tips in 30-year-old suspected mu...	Thirty years after the bombing of Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901, which killed 21 passengers and crew—mostly Jews, including four Israelis—the FBI has released photos of three suspects believed to be tied to Hezbollah Thirty years after a mysterious midair explosion killed four Israelis, the United States has announced a $5 million reward for any information that could lead to an arrest or conviction in the bombing of Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901, which officials believe was carried out by Hezbollah. On July 19, 1994, Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901 took off from Colón Airport in Panama, headed for Panama City. The routine 15-minute flight soon entered the annals of aviation's greatest unsolved mysteries. The small plane was carrying 21 passengers, most from the local Jewish community, including four Israeli citizens—Rani Gabay, Jaica Rascovsky Yaker, Joseph Gershon and Moshe Pardo. Just minutes after takeoff, a powerful explosion ripped through the plane, tearing the metal shell of the aircraft over the Panamanian jungle and killing everyone on board. Aviation investigators quickly concluded that the blast was caused by a bomb, but the circumstances surrounding the bombing remain unknown. Many believed it was a targeted terror attack against the Jewish community, especially given the timing: just one day earlier, an attack on the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires killed 85 people and injured more than 300. The Argentine attack, later classified as a Hezbollah-led terror act, left a deep scar on the Jewish community in Argentina and worldwide. The close timing of the two events led to suspicions that they were coordinated attacks by the same group, prompting intelligence agencies and relevant governments, including Israel, to pursue justice. Days after the attacks, a Lebanon-based group calling itself 'Ansar Allah' claimed responsibility. U.S. authorities later identified the group as a Hezbollah alias. The prime suspect was Ali Hawa Jamal, the only passenger whose body was never claimed. U.S. intelligence, which joined the investigation after three Americans were confirmed among the dead, later found evidence linking Jamal to the bomb. According to a Panamanian government report, Jamal had scouted the flight path and noted it frequently carried Jewish passengers. He allegedly carried out the attack after several trips, during which he tested the security measures. After the bombing, Panamanian authorities reported that they had identified a local Hezbollah terror cell suspected of orchestrating the attack but were unable to make any arrests. In 2018, 24 years after the explosion, then-Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela called for a reopening of the investigation based on new information from Israeli intelligence, which he said confirmed the event as a terrorist attack. Varela also asked Israel and the FBI to aid in the effort. He noted that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had written to him, saying, 'I lost my roommate and a senior member of the Jewish community in Panama to a Hezbollah terrorist attack.' Now, the U.S. has renewed international efforts to seek justice with its generous reward, hoping to bring those responsible to trial. The FBI, whose announcement was also released in Hebrew, included photos of three men believed to have assisted Jamal. According to the FBI, the suspects were known to travel among Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Lebanon and were in contact with known arms smugglers. The American investigation also revealed that, before the attack, a man believed to be Jamal used a stolen U.S. credit card to rent a car in Panama City. The next day, he contacted the agency again to rent a second vehicle, a 4x4 jeep. Both rentals were paid for with the stolen credit card, and the vehicles were later found abandoned near the airport. The FBI believes that the same man may have used the credit card to purchase a two-way Motorola phone system, which Jamal was later seen carrying aboard the flight. Family members of the victims, many of whom have no grave to visit, welcomed the renewed U.S. efforts with hope and gratitude. Anna Karina Smith-Kane, granddaughter of one of the victims, expressed thanks to the U.S. government, saying, 'This is a powerful message that our tragedy has not been forgotten. It’s a day engraved in our memory as an ongoing pain—and the reward reminds us that the fight for justice continues.'

The Tel Aviv District Court on Thursday indicted Asher Benjamin Weiss of Bnei Brak for allegedly surveilling an Israeli nuclear scientist under orders from Iranian agents, with the intent to facilitate his assassination. Weiss faces charges of contact with a foreign agent, providing intelligence to an enemy and obstruction of justice. According to the indictment, Weiss recorded the scientist’s home and vehicle using a GoPro camera, which the agent later forwarded to an East Jerusalem resident assigned to carry out the attack. Weiss also allegedly set vehicles on fire, sprayed graffiti and distributed hundreds of flyers calling for civil unrest. Charges against the East Jerusalem suspect were filed last week.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1u00z0e11yl	2024-10-31T01:50:15-07:00

Israeli couple charged with espionage for Iran after allegedly ta...	Rafael and Lala Guliyev of Lod allegedly spied on security sites and prominent security think tank employee, marked by Iran for harm; pair reportedly began working with Iranian agents in 2021, photographing key sites, including Mossad headquarters Israeli authorities have arrested a couple from Lod suspected of conducting espionage activities on behalf of Iran, the Shin Bet security agency and police announced Thursday morning in a joint statement. According to officials, Rafael and Lala Guliyev allegedly carried out intelligence-gathering operations on security and national infrastructure sites, as well as a prominent scholar. Authorities report that the academic was 'marked for physical harm.' An indictment was filed Thursday against the couple, both 32 and originally from the Caucasus region, on charges of aiding an enemy in war and relaying information with intent to compromise national security. The prosecution has requested that the couple be remanded to custody throughout the legal proceedings. Court filings reveal that the couple allegedly began coordinating with two Iranian agents in 2021, gathering intelligence on strategic sites and sending still photographs and video footage via encrypted messaging apps. Among the sites photographed were the Mossad headquarters, the Moldovan Consulate in Tel Aviv, key points around the Glilot area, Israel’s Electric Corporation, Haifa Port, public shelters in Tel Aviv, graves of victims of the October 7 Hamas attack and a factory where one of the suspects worked. The pair allegedly transmitted this information to their handlers using secure communication to avoid detection. The indictment also states that Rafael Guliyev was instructed to recruit additional operatives to establish a covert network. Furthermore, he is accused of surveilling a scholar affiliated with the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), a prominent security think tank, whose identity remains undisclosed, photographing her residence and vehicle over hours of observation. According to Shin Bet and the police, the Iranians intended to inflict harm on the scholar, with Guliyev reportedly receiving $600 daily for these surveillance activities. Throughout the assignment, Guliyev allegedly maintained contact with his handlers, receiving additional funds periodically. The indictment states that the couple received approximately $26,000 in total for their efforts. The investigation led by Shin Bet, the National Unit for International Crimes and the police’s cyber unit exposed the alleged Iranian-backed network, which aimed to recruit individuals from the Caucasus community in Israel. Rafael Guliyev was reportedly recruited by an Israeli citizen of Azerbaijani origin, identified as 56-year-old Elshan Aghayev, who acted as an intermediary for Iranian intelligence. According to Shin Bet, Guliyev was tasked with finding an assassin on behalf of his Iranian handlers. INSS expressed gratitude to Shin Bet for uncovering the plot, with INSS director Maj. Gen. (res.) Tamir Hayman stating that the center's analysts remain targeted by Iran due to the institute’s role as Israel’s leading security research center. Although INSS operates independently of the defense establishment, Hayman noted the institution’s ongoing communication with security agencies. Thursday's indictment is the latest in a wave of espionage cases exposed by authorities in recent weeks involving Israeli citizens allegedly working on behalf of Tehran. Police officials reaffirmed their commitment to neutralizing threats to Israeli citizens and pursuing legal measures against those cooperating with hostile entities. Last week, seven individuals from northern Israel were indicted for allegedly collecting intelligence on military bases for Iranian operatives during the current war. A senior Shin Bet official noted earlier this month that Tehran is systematically attempting to harm prominent figures in Israel, including scientists, municipal leaders and defense officials. Authorities stressed that stringent punitive measures are critical for deterrence, advocating administrative and economic sanctions, including potential citizenship revocation and asset seizures, for Israeli citizens who collaborate with Iran.

Not on our watch': IDF destroys Hezbollah terror command center ...	The entire village was a staging ground; we found weaponry and evidence of terror operations in almost every house,' says soldier involved in operation The IDF announced Wednesday that it had completed a large-scale demolition operation targeting southern Lebanon’s Matmoura, located close to Israel’s northern border near Kibbutz Adamit and the village of Arab al-Aramshe in the Western Galilee. The operation was led by the 5067th Engineering Battalion, part of the 646th Brigade under the 146th Division, and marked the culmination of an intensive brigade-level exercise in the sector. According to an IDF soldier involved, the village functioned as a Hezbollah 'terror hub,' where caches of weapons and ammunition were found in nearly every building. 'The entire village was a staging ground; we found weaponry and evidence of terror operations in almost every house,' he reported. Footage released by the IDF shows 466th Battalion Commander Lt. Col. (res.) Nimrod Ziv addressing troops, saying, 'After a year of war on the southern front, in the West Bank and now in Lebanon, we, the reservist paratroopers of the 646th Brigade’s 446th Battalion, destroy this Hezbollah staging ground. We will not allow the enemy to threaten our freedom in this country on our watch. We honor those who sacrificed everything, and we will continue to fight forever and defend our land.' The IDF’s operations last week led to the discovery of underground bunkers designed for Hezbollah’s elite Radwan forces, with long-term living supplies, military gear and ammunition. Among the equipment seized were combat vests packed with grenades, full ammunition magazines, tactical helmets, winter gear, rocket launchers and advanced night vision systems. Several weapons reportedly bore markings linking them to sources in Moscow, Russia. Lt. Col. Shushan, who previously led tours in the village, explained, 'Even in our emergency depots, we don’t have the level of readiness we found here in this small Sunni village.' He added that heavily fortified combat positions were constructed by Hezbollah mere feet from the border. 'They had dug trenches and planted mines, intending to breach the wall along the border and infiltrate Israel in civilian clothing to strike quickly,' he said. The IDF emphasized that this operation is part of a broader mission to neutralize Hezbollah’s offensive capabilities near the border, aiming to restore security and assure the safety of Israel’s northern residents.

North Korea said it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday, upgrading what it called the 'world's most powerful strategic weapon', as Seoul warned Pyongyang could get missile technology from Russia to help with the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was on hand and said the test was a warning to enemies that have been threatening the country's security, KCNA state news agency said. 'The test-fire is an appropriate military action that fully meets the purpose of informing the rivals, who have intentionally escalated the regional situation and posed a threat to the security of our Republic recently, of our counteraction will,' Kim was quoted as saying by KCNA. The muscle-flexing comes amid a storm of international condemnation and rising alarm over what the U.S. and others say is North Korea's deployment of 11,000 troops to Russia - 3,000 of them close to the western frontlines with Ukraine. The launch drew swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1xkfcgwyx	2024-10-30T21:14:24-07:00

Trump courts Muslim voters: 'I will stop the suffering and destru...	Trump who has already pledged to end the wars in Gaza and the north, continues to court support from the Arab and Muslim communities, especially in Michigan – a key state that could decide the election With just six days remaining until the U.S. presidential election, Republican candidate Donald Trump has once again ramped up his appeals to Arab and Muslim voters. In a post on X, Trump declared that if he returns to the White House, he will put an end to the 'suffering and destruction in Lebanon.' His words add to recent statements he’s made, promising to end the war in Gaza if elected. 'During my Administration, we had peace in the Middle East, and we will have peace again very soon! I will fix the problems caused by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon. I want to see the Middle East return to real peace, a lasting peace, and we will get it done properly so it doesn’t repeat itself every 5 or 10 years!' 'I will preserve the equal partnership among all Lebanese communities. Your friends and family in Lebanon deserve to live in peace, prosperity, and harmony with their neighbors, and that can only happen with peace and stability in the Middle East. I look forward to working with the Lebanese community living in the United States of America to ensure the safety and security of the great people of Lebanon. Vote Trump for Peace!' While Trump hasn’t explicitly stated he would force Israel to halt its actions in Gaza and Lebanon, his increasing promises to end the war, along with his often unpredictable nature, may be causing some concern in Jerusalem over how Israeli interests would fare if he defeats Harris next week. Harris, meanwhile, has repeatedly reaffirmed her commitment to Israel’s security and to continuing financial and military aid. Over the past six months, she has called consistently for an end to the Gaza conflict. Still, based on past experience, the expectation was that Trump would offer Israel far more leeway. Trump raised eyebrows earlier this year when he praised Hezbollah as a 'smart organization' and when he said that Israel should end the war in Gaza because it was causing it image damage. On the other hand, he repeatedly accused Biden and Harris of not giving Israel sufficient support, and said that it is better for Hamas that the Israeli hostages return home before he returns to the White House. Trump explains: 'The Arabs in Michigan want peace' Arab and Muslim voters in the U.S. - like Jewish voters - tend to vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, who are seen in their eyes as those who will better protect the rights of minorities and immigrants. However, in the current election campaign, certain shifts are noticeable against the backdrop of the war in the Middle East: On the Jewish side, more people are considering voting for Trump instead of Harris due to the feeling that the Democratic Party is distancing itself from Israel and not doing enough to stop the wave of antisemitism in the U.S., including on campuses; And on the Arab and Muslim side there are quite a few who intend to refrain from giving their vote to Harris , in protest of her 'assistance to the genocide in Gaza,' as they see it. Even if only a few percent in each of the communities change their voting patterns, in an election campaign as close as the one currently underway, this may have dramatic consequences. At a rally he held this weekend in Michigan, Trump raised a sword in the battle for the Muslim voice, when he hosted on stage those he presented as 'prominent leaders in the Muslim community of Michigan.' 'I'm thrilled to have the support of these rather respectable leaders,' Trump said as he invited them to the stage, and later stated that Arab and Muslim voters 'could swing the election one way or the other.' 'We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace – he promises peace, not war,' Imam Bilal Alzuhairi said. 'We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine.' 'And I think this man can make it happen. I personally believe there's a reason why God saved his life twice,' the imam said, referring to the two assassination attempts from which Trump survived. Trump at his rally on Saturday claimed that 'Jews, Catholics, evangelicals, Mormons, Muslims are joining our cause in larger numbers than ever before and now the most wonderful thing is happening.' 'The Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East. That’s all they want,' Trump said.

Key Hamas operative killed in Tulkarem in West Bank	The Shin Bet, the Israel Police and the IDF said in a joint statement that the terrorist operative who was killed in the West Bank town of Tulkarm on Wednesday night was Hassam Malach, 'a key operative in the Hamas infrastructure in the area, who was involved in planning imminent attacks.' It was also reported that Malach worked to promote terrorist attacks together with Aslam Odeh, who was killed on October 26 in an operation in Tulkarm, and Zahi Ofi, who was killed in an airstrike in Tulkarm on October 3, and was responsible for planning significant attacks that were to be carried out on the first anniversary of the October 7 massacre. 'After their elimination, Hassam led the terrorist infrastructure of Hamas in Tulkarem and in recent days was engaged in planning an attack in the immediate time frame,' it was reported.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bygkwvgbkl	2024-10-30T14:50:08-07:00

Report: Iran will attack Israel, likely before US election	Now that extent of damage caused by Israel is known, 'senior source' claims to CNN that Iran will attack Israel in a 'definitive and painful' response even before the U.S. presidential elections; White House warns: 'Iran should not respond' A 'senior source' familiar with the Iranian discussions, told CNN Wednesday night that there will be a 'definitive and painful' response to Israel’s recent attack on its territory, likely before the U.S. presidential election on November 5. CNN did not specify where the source came from, but it is implied from his words that he is Iranian. 'The response of the Islamic Republic to the aggression of the Zionist regime will be definitive and painful,' said the source. In the first days after the attack in Iran, which took place overnight between Friday and Saturday, Iran tried to minimize and downplay the damage caused to the country's military infrastructure. In Tehran they even claimed that the IDF's announcements after the attack, which said that it was successful and its goals were achieved , constitute 'psychological warfare.' The elections in the United States will be held this Tuesday - November 5 - so if the source's words are to be believed, Iran may attack Israel in less than a week. An Israeli official responded to this Wednesday , and issued a warning: 'If they give a response - they will receive back double.' Knesset member Avigdor Liberman called on the political and military ranks 'not to wait until the Iranians carry out their threats,' and added: 'We must move from waiting for a preemptive strike, from a proportional response to a clear decision. On October 26, we proved our ability, and now the order of the day is to exercise this ability in full force '. The White House once again called upon Iran not to attack Israel. White House spokeswoman Karin Jean-Pierre was asked at a press briefing about a report about a possible attack and replied: Iran should not respond to Israel's retaliation. They should not. ... If they do, we will support Israel in defending itself, but they should not,' she said at a news briefing. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller also addressed the issue. He said that he could not give an assessment regarding what Iran might do, but he also noted that Iran 'doesn't need to respond.' He did not answer when asked if Iran had conveyed a message to Washington regarding a possible attack before the elections, saying that 'I will not talk about the communication between the two governments, whether it is real or imaginary. But as we have stated publicly, and Iran clearly knows this, they must not escalate this conflict.' Israel estimated shortly after the attack that Iran would respond - but it was not clear how. At the same time, the Israeli attacks targeted, among other things, missile production facilities, and the air defense batteries that protect Tehran were damaged, so that Iran remains exposed to future attacks. The report on the escalation in Iranian rhetoric comes following the publication by the Associated Press, which on Tuesday revealed new satellite images from Iran, which indicate damage to another site in the Israeli attack - damage that the regime in Tehran has not reported so far. The photos show damage to several buildings at the Shahrud Space Center in the north of the country. The center, which is located about 370 km northeast of Tehran, is managed by the Revolutionary Guards, from which they launch satellites into space, but according to the AP it is also used by the Revolutionary Guards to manufacture ballistic missiles. Iran publicly admitted that the attack caused damage to sites in the Tehran area and in the provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan in the west of the country, but it did not report any damage at all in Samnan. Experts emphasized that it is not possible to absolutely determine that the damage to the site was not caused by another reason, but they noted that the photos from before the attack did not show any damage to the site. The Planet Labs satellite images taken Tuesday show a 'central' structure in the center was destroyed, with only its skeleton left standing. Near it are seen vehicles, probably belonging to Iranian officials who were sent to examine the extent of the damage. In a previous photo taken in March of this year, the building can be seen before it was destroyed, with a high blue roof. On Wednesday morning, Iran's Minister of Defense, Aziz Nasir Zadeh, issued several statements about the attack and threats: 'There was no disruption in the pace of missile production,' he claimed, noting that 'Iran can launch dozens of counterattacks such as 'The Real Promise' (the Iranian name for the two attacks carried out in Israel) We will respond to any attack on our lands, even if it is a single bullet.' In addition, an Iranian lawmaker attributed the following quotes to Zada, which appeared, among others, in the 'Tehran Times' and include another threat: 'When the airspace is violated, the country has the right to respond to any act of aggression. Even if the Zionist regime fires an arrow at our country, Iran will not forgive That's how you will respond.' The minister later claimed that 'no fighter jet entered Iran during the Israeli attack. Israel's latest aggression caused partial damage - and it was repaired immediately.' The 'Days of Repentance' operation , conducted in response to the barrage of ballistic missiles on Israel from Iran at the beginning of the month, was Israel's first ever declared attack on Iran. Dozens of fighter jets participated in the attack, which significantly damaged - according to foreign reports and also according to the official Israeli statements - the air defense system of the Islamic Republic and its ability to produce ballistic missiles. In the days after the attack, senior Iranian officials stated that Tehran reserved the right to respond 'at the appropriate time' to the attack, and several of them, including Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami, promised 'painful revenge.' At the same time, and despite various reports on the extent of the damage, Tehran is careful to claim that the results of the attack were limited and that the damage from them will be repaired quickly, in a way that was interpreted internationally, at least until Wednesday evening, as a possible attempt to 'contain' the attack. The final decision on a retaliatory attack will be made by Supreme leader Ali Khamenei - with the estimate that he also prefers to avoid an all-out war. A few days ago, Khamenei himself issued a non-committal statement regarding revenge: 'Israel made a miscalculation and must understand the will of the Iranian people,' he said. 'Israel's step should not be exaggerated - nor should it be underestimated.'

N., a combat navigator, describes feelings once airborne: 'We know this is history in the making, something that hasn’t been done before'; Maj. S., a combat pilot, adds: 'We were trained to strike deep, to reach distant enemy countries under significant threats; the objective isn't just the event itself, it’s the very fact that I got there' 'The entire operation went according to plan. We were deep in one of the deserts, the moon was rising, and you tell yourself, 'Here it begins.' It's an image I’ll carry with me for a long time,' recounts Maj. N., a combat navigator, describing a mission over enemy territory en route to Iran for a retaliatory strike following Iran's massive early October attack. 'After landing, it took me a moment to process and understand the full impact of what I’d done. Gaza is here; Lebanon is somewhat distant, but Iran — it's far, and we’re not normally there.' 'The Air Force has been preparing for the eastern front for at least 20 years, as long as I can remember,' Maj. N. says. 'It's constantly on our radar. It's no secret that Iran is a relevant theater, always distant and unreachable, somewhere off in the distance. But we got there.' In 119 Squadron, based at Ramon Airbase, the team meticulously prepared for the mission. 'We were all here during the holiday,' shared Maj. Anael from the base’s control tower. 'On Friday, we started the day early with more drills and preparations, briefing soldiers with our commanders. We make sure to maintain unity beforehand, talking together about what we’re doing here, especially with the maneuvering and knowing we have hostages. I have a close friend, Omer Wenkert, who was abducted,' she added (Wenket was abducted from the Re’im festival to Gaza). 'Each time a plane takes off, I think of him and our friends fighting, and how we’re protecting them from above.' 'Dad doesn't come back saying, 'I bombed Iran'' Maj. N. woke up to sirens in Jerusalem on the morning of October 7. By 8 a.m., he’d decided to head to the squadron, and by early afternoon he was already in the skies over Gaza. 'The initial situation then and now is completely different,' he reflects. 'What happened surrounds all of us. We’re here around the clock. In the days leading up to the strike, we focused mainly on preparations: ground scenarios, studying the terrain and the air models, including scenarios and responses. We sit and think about what it means if there are surprises – in the plane, the systems, or the field itself. 'Of course, it crosses your mind – what happens if things don't go as planned. But once airborne there’s this heightened focus, and nothing else enters your mind. It’s full of data, figuring out how to execute the mission, and what to do at each stage. It’s an enormous privilege. We know it’s a historic event, that we're doing something unprecedented at this scale. From the moment you cross that flight line into enemy territory, all your senses sharpen. The alertness stays at that heightened level until we’re back in our country’s borders. Until you’re home, you’re alert, razor-sharp. After crossing back, you allow yourself to relax. Once we land, we gather information from our fellow squad members, realize it was a successful event, and there’s a great sense of satisfaction.' Maj. N., married with five children, didn’t tell his family the details of that night. 'My wife hears the same news we all consume, so she can put two and two together. My family and friends understood quickly. They’d read about the increased intensity, the talk of things to come. My wife isn’t fazed by the distance I fly; it’s part of serving in the Air Force. Dad doesn’t come home saying, ‘I bombed Iran.’ They know enough. The kids are happy and proud.' 'You feel a sense of duty as you take care of the skies' 'Most of our flights are operational. But a mission toward Iran is something different,' Maj. Anael explained. 'There are specific forms indicating the aircraft's destination. It’s knowing they’re going on a different mission. Just hearing that plane take off… and not everything always goes smoothly. We have to keep a safe and functional base for every departing plane and every plane returning safely. It’s very moving to say, ‘Cleared for takeoff,’ and send those planes so far away. We see where they’re heading, and we feel responsible for following them – who’s landing, who’s taking off, and how to take care of the skies. The feeling of knowing the planes completed the mission is incredible. It’s knowing we’re part of something historic. When we learned they’d launched and completed the offensive action, our pulse quickened, because it’s the riskiest moment for the pilots, seeing what the ‘red side’ has planned.' 'The night didn’t end with the strike – it continued long after that,' she added. Maj. R., head of the munitions division, shared his perspective: 'The moment it ends, and everyone’s landed, we’re just waiting for the next mission. If you’d asked me a year ago if something like this would happen, I wouldn’t have believed it. In those first days of the war, we were in shock, not expecting this. The feelings were intense and stay with us. Some of the scenarios we prepared for — the reality has outpaced them all. I didn’t anticipate we’d reach where we have, but I trust the people and the machines. When it’s over, there’s a sigh of relief, and then you wait for the next mission. I feel the people of Israel are united. Our mission is to bring the hostages back, and that’s what drives our work.' 'I’ll always remember the moon that night — it was a brilliant crescent, shining and rising just as we flew deep, illuminating the pitch-black night,' recalls Maj. S., a combat pilot, speaking of the moment he flew over enemy skies. He came to Israel as a lone soldier and was part of Operation Days of Repentance against Iran. As a combat pilot, he keeps his focus short-term, always thinking ahead to the next sortie. But what doesn’t fade is the commitment to bring the hostages home and return civilians to their homes, whether in the north or Gaza perimeter. 'My family knows I was part of the attack, but the exact details — I still can’t share. It’s tough from a distance, and even for those whose parents are here, it’s difficult to talk about our experiences and what we’re doing. Here, I decided to share, and it’s very empowering. My parents were incredibly moved and proud,' he said. 'We know how to strike far and under significant threats' Maj. S. explained that, as a combat pilot, he has trained for such moments. 'We were trained to strike deep in enemy territory. I know how to reach faraway countries under numerous threats. These are capabilities we trained for even before October 7. In the days leading up to the mission, the excitement grew, and there was a little pressure, too. The peak came just before takeoff. It comes from knowing the importance and meaning of what we're about to do, understanding how many people are counting on us. The squadron commander assigned me to the mission and trained me for it. In the end, it’s me carrying it out, and it has meaning for every citizen in the country. They might not know I’m the one executing it, but a single mission has strategic importance,' he said. 'I believe the point isn’t just the specific target but that we’re delivering weaponry into Iran and showing them we have the capability. Look, we’ve reached you; we’re responding, we’re here. And on this mission, we dealt them a significant blow. It’s less about the target than the operation itself — I’m placing munitions on Iranian soil.' Despite the excitement and pressure, he says it dissipates once in the air. 'The moment I power up the engines on the ground and take off,' Maj. N. explained, 'my body and mind go on autopilot. I’m skilled enough not to feel it, and the plane will do what’s required. I’ll always remember the moon that night. It was a brilliant, crescent moon, rising exactly as we flew deep, lighting the surrounding area and allowing me to see in a very dark night. I’m trained enough to separate emotions from actions in real time, making decisions quickly by working purely logically. After landing, it took me a moment to process and understand the full impact of what I’d done.' 'This wasn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last that I put myself at risk in a combat mission,' he said. 'Even in more routine sorties during the war, I take risks. And if the enemy does its job well, there’s a chance I’ll be hit. It’s a fear I understand every time I take off. The best thing I can do is not think about it– fly fast, fly well, and if something happens, respond optimally. Because it was such a critical mission, we took risks – I knew there was a chance I’d be hit, but we had ample time to prepare for nearly every contingency, a 'what if' response. If the worst should happen, I’m mentally prepared and know what steps to take in each moment.' Despite the historic nature of the mission, he says he keeps his focus on the next assignment. 'The moment I land, the focus is on debriefing and preparing for the next mission, and the next mission is always important. Even after returning from the strike in Iran, I flew several missions afterward, each with a different character and creating different feelings. The only things that don’t fade from memory are the commitment and importance of bringing the hostages home and returning our residents to their homes —whether in the north or the Gaza perimeter. We’re committed, and we can’t stop until everyone is back —every hostage, every resident.'

Iran intends to respond to the extensive Israeli attack on its territory, a source familiar with the discussions in the Islamic Republic told CNN, noting that 'the reaction against the Zionist regime will be absolute and painful.' It was also reported that Iran will probably respond in the coming week, before the U.S. elections on November 5.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rysqlme11ke	2024-10-30T13:36:23-07:00	
Lebanese PM hopes for cease-fire soon, but process could take tim...	Najib Mikati ready to deploy Lebanese troops to south of country with wtihdrawal of Israeli troops; Says Hezbollah 'was late to sever the connection between the Gaza and Lebanon fronts'; White House: 'There are many reports and drafts circulating' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Wednesday evening that he hopes a cease-fire with Israel will be signed ' within the coming hours or days.' He expressed 'cautious' optimism, adding: 'We are doing our best.' According to him, Hezbollah 'was late to sever the connection between the Gaza and Lebanon fronts' and now demands that Lebanese army forces be deployed in the south of the country with the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Mikati also stated that Lebanon will no longer agree to receive aircraft assistance from Iran or Iraq, after Israel threatened to attack Iranian aircraft transporting military equipment to Beirut. 'We don't want to expose Beirut airport to danger,' he said. 'If Iran or Iraq want to help us it will be via the sea.' He added that he is not in contact with any official from Hezbollah, and that he received the message about the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah while he was in treatment in the U.S. Mikati made the statements after a conversation with President Joe Biden's envoy to Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, who together U.S. Mideast envoy Brett McGurk, is currently traveling to Israel. The two envoys will hold a series of meetings in Israel at a critical point in time, to discuss the overall regional picture. On the agenda is a possible cease-fire in Lebanon, as well as a hostage deal and cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, and the desire to prevent Iran from attacking Israel. National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said on Wednesday night of a potential deal for a cease-fire in Lebanon that 'there are many reports and drafts circulating. They do not reflect the current state of the negotiations.' The discussions in Israel will focus on three directions. The first is preparations for a possible attack by Iran against Israel in response to the Israeli attack last week. The commander of the U.S. Central Command, General Michael Kurilla will be in Israel over the weekend for talks with senior IDF officials to discuss Israel's defense in the event of an Iranian attack. Both Israel and the U.S. do not know what Iran will do and think that the issue of the Iranian attack is still open. The Iranians are still in the process of trying to understand what happened in the Israeli attack and are realizing day by day that it was very significant. The more the Iranians understand and internalize that they have something to lose if they attack, the more likely that they will drop the response option. Despite this, no one - neither in Israel nor in the U.S., knows what the Iranians will actually do in the end, but they understand that they must be prepared for every possibility, both defensively and offensively. The second focus of the discussions will be on Lebanon. In recent weeks, there has been an intensive dialogue between Israel and the United States on the current hostilities. The two countries have reached an agreement on what a cease-fire settlement will look like, how the political outline is shaped, and how to enter into it. The fact that Hochstein and McGurk are coming to the region indicates that there is an understanding between Israel and the U.S. that they are moving in the direction of the diplomatic path. Despite this, it is important to emphasize that, as far as Israel is concerned, a final agreement with Lebanon has not yet been reached, and the intention is to enter into an accelerated process that will last several weeks until an agreement is reached. On the other hand, Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri said that he has reached agreements with Hochstein - and that he expects the American envoy to reach these same agreements with Netanyahu as well. According to him, the agreements are related to the cease-fire, the deployment of the South Lebanese army and the implementation of resolution 1701, without changes. 'The ball is now in Netanyahu's court,' he said. 'If he shows willingness to continue the understandings with Hochstein or turn against them.' In the meantime, the IDF still has time to act in southern Lebanon and complete the dismantling of the terrorist infrastructure. Sources privy to the details say that what is happening now reflects a feeling that the time has come to translate the military achievements into a political path that will soon allow the residents to return to their homes. In principle, Israel and the US want to work on a mechanism that will be much stronger than Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war and required Lebanese troops to withdraw to south of the Litani River - a mechanism that will never be fully implemented. The intention is also not to base it on UNIFIL, which is worthless and has no weight. In the discussions, there is talk of a significant enforcement mechanism, along with the addition of a principle that gives Israel freedom of action to enforce violations. Still, Berri claimed Wednesday that 'we are not ready to change even one letter in Resolution 1701.' Also on wednesday, the U.S. State Department spokesman said that the U.S. supports Israel's right to go after legitimate Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, when asked about the eastern city of Baalbek being bombarded by Israel. But Matthew Miller told reporters at a regular news briefing that Israel must do so in a way that does not threaten the lives of civilians and it was critical civilian infrastructure and significant cultural heritage sites can be protected. 'We have made clear that the campaign they are conducting in Lebanon should not, cannot, must not look like the campaign that they have conducted in Gaza. We do not want to see that type of widespread damage,' Miller said when asked about Baalbek at a regular news briefing. The third discussion is about the kidnap deal. The talks for a cease-fire in Lebanon are not really related to the hostages, but there is an indirect connection. In Israel there is a belief that the talks on Lebanon can advance a hostage deal, because Hamas has been betting that a regional war will break out and stop Israel in Gaza. A hostage deal with Hamas in Gaza that would come with a temporary cease-fire would help reach a settlement in Lebanon, but now Lebanon no longer ties itself to Gaza and an agreement with it could help reach an agreement in the south. Behind the scenes there is also a U.S. preoccupation with the humanitarian issue in Gaza, while in the background there is disappointment among the Americans about the legislation in the Knesset against the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. The Americans understand that UNRWA is a failed and rotten organization, but their fear is that it will harm the humanitarian effort.

French court rules Israel can participate in Paris Euronaval exhi...	Paris Commercial Court ruled against President Emmanuel Macron and the French government, allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Euronaval exhibition The Paris Commercial Court ruled Wednesday in favor of a petition by the Manufacturers Association of Israel, Israel Shipyards and the France-Israel Chamber of Commerce, allowing Israeli companies to participate in the Euronaval maritime defense exhibition, set to take place in Paris in early November. The judge’s decision effectively overturns a previous ruling by French President Emmanuel Macron, the French government, and event organizers to bar Israeli companies from the exhibition — a move the court deemed inconsistent with the European Union’s free-market principles and in violation of equality and non-discrimination policies. Foreign Minister Israel Katz welcomed the decision, saying, 'Congratulations to the Israeli petitioners on their victory against the undemocratic and unjust decision by President Macron to exclude Israeli companies from the exhibition. This success, achieved in part through legal and diplomatic efforts by the Foreign Ministry, is a win for justice and a clear statement against attempts to weaken Israel in its struggle against forces of evil.' Ron Tomer, president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel, added: 'The court made clear that political-based discrimination in business has no place in the international market. Israeli industry will continue to be open to global business and lead in innovation and advanced technology. No government or organizing body will hold us back, and if attempts like this arise in the future, we will make it known that ‘Made in Israel’ will proudly stand at international exhibitions and conferences. This is a victory for the State of Israel and Israeli businesses, reaffirming that all are bound by the principles of equality and fair trade to which we are committed.' Despite the limited time left until the exhibition begins, Israel Shipyards will manage to set up its booth. Eitan Zucker, CEO of Israel Shipyards, praised the ruling, noting it would allow the company to showcase some of the world’s most advanced naval vessels made in Israel. However, he also urged caution for policymakers. 'While the court ruled in our favor, we must remember that France effectively imposed a security embargo on Israel by trying to block Israeli companies from the exhibition. This should serve as a wake-up call for Israeli decision-makers to recognize, as we have seen in other instances during the war, that Israel must not be dependent on other countries. We need to rely on our own high-level capabilities and the strength of Israel’s defense industry, especially when it comes to key platforms,' he said. The petition, filed through the French law firm GKA, argued that France’s decision violated EU principles of equality and fair trade, which require member states to maintain open, competitive and non-discriminatory markets. The petition emphasized the EU’s obligation to uphold fair, unbiased trade practices, ensuring that Israeli companies can participate and compete in the European defense market.

German lawyers ask court to block ship allegedly carrying explosi...	Human rights lawyers have filed a court appeal in Berlin seeking to block a 150-metric-ton shipment of military-grade explosives aboard German cargo ship MV Kathrin which they say is to be delivered to Israel's biggest defense contractor. The European Legal Support Center (ELSC) said on Wednesday the action was filed on behalf of three Palestinians from Gaza, arguing that the shipment of primarily RDX explosives could be used in munitions for Israel's war in Gaza, potentially contributing to alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Israel denies accusations that it has committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip. Germany-based Lubeca Marine, which owns the MV Kathrin, said the ship 'was never scheduled to make any port calls in Israel' and had recently discharged its cargo in Bar, Montenegro. The ELSC said the RDX shipment was destined for Israeli Military Industries, a division of Elbit Systems, Israel's largest defense contractor. Elbit Systems declined to comment.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r19zvblzkg	2024-10-30T11:23:47-07:00

I will preserve the equal partnership among all Lebanese communities. Your friends and family in Lebanon deserve to live in peace, prosperity, and harmony with their neighbors, and that can only happen with peace and stability in the Middle East.

Lifting Iran sanctions, threatening to censure Israel enabled Gaz...	In his new book, 'One Jewish State', former US ambassador to Israel appeals to country’s political left, arguing that Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank offers the best solution for Palestinian welfare and regional stability The road to October 7 began when President Joe Biden entered the White House, according to former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Friedman said that if President Donald Trump had still been in office, Israel would not have experienced the deadly attacks and would have achieved more regional alliances through additional Abraham Accords. 'When we left office, Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy,' Friedman, who served under Trump, said. 'Qasem Soleimani, who had been their chief architect of terror, had been eliminated by the United States, imposing great fear and concern on the part of the mullahs. And then Biden comes in.' Friedman criticized Biden for stopping the enforcement of sanctions on countries that trade with Iran, known as secondary sanctions. 'Iran began to sell oil in large amounts to China, to Russia, two of America’s greatest adversaries. Large, specific amounts. There was like a $6 billion gift here, a $10 billion gift there. That seemed to make no sense,' he said. 'So what happened to Iran? Iran more than doubled its GDP in a couple of years by about $200 billion.' He said that Iran used that money to fund its many proxy groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, which are now engaged in a multifront war with Israel. Under a Trump Administration, Friedman said, Iran would not have had the funds to prop up the various proxy groups. He also said that Trump would have continued the momentum of the Abraham Accords, the historic US-brokered agreement normalizing relations between Israel and four Arab nations. 'I think we needed about six months more in our administration to get the Saudis on our side,' Friedman said. He added that Indonesia and 'some of the secondary Gulf nations' were also primed to achieve normalization with Israel. Saudi Arabia, which once seemed to be on the cusp of normalizing relations with Israel, recently held military exercises with Iran. Friedman said that Saudi Arabia would stop cooperating with Iran if Trump is elected and it becomes clear that the US is 'a partner that can push back against Iranian malign activity.' 'What people need to understand about the Abraham Accords is it wasn’t about showing these countries that we could move away from Israel. It was about showing these countries how closely we were aligned with Israel. That’s what made Israel the most attractive partner to the Gulf, that they were rock-solid aligned with the United States,' he explained, noting that once the U.S. relationship with Israel appeared less secure, alliance with Israel became less attractive to Gulf states. Once the U.S. relationship with Israel appeared less secure, alliance with Israel became less attractive to Gulf states Friedman’s book 'Sledgehammer: How Breaking with the Past Brought Peace to the Middle East' was published before the October 7, 2023 attacks. Friedman said that many of the predictions he made in his book came true on October 7. 'What I thought then, and I think what’s been proven to be the case, is that the US-Israel alliance, at its strongest, is the fulcrum upon which you can then expand peace throughout the Middle East,' he said. As it weakens, those opportunities not only become less, but the potential for malign activity and mischief becomes greater.' Biden’s strategy for the Middle East involved showing countries other than Israel that the U.S. was committed to 'equal measures of peace, prosperity, dignity' throughout the entire region, Friedman said. 'They use that phrase, ‘equal measures,’ all the time,' he continued. 'No. No. Israel is the single most important ally of the United States in the Middle East.' He said that broadcasting the centrality of Israel as the US’s ally in the Middle East would increase the chances of peace in the region. Senator Lindsey Graham has pushed for achieving normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel during the Biden Administration. 'I would love to see the details,' Friedman said of Graham’s plan. 'It’s hard to comment on something which is just, at this point, aspirational.' Democrats also recently urged a probe into Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and former White House aide, alleging that he had acted as an agent of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Friedman described that allegation as 'complete nonsense.' 'Anything Jared Kushner does in that field is done for the good of America, with the support of America,' he said. 'And I hope that he continues what he’s doing, because he developed levels of credibility with Saudi Arabia, with the Emirates, with others in the Gulf, that had never been achieved before.' Earlier this month, a letter sent by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to the Israeli government leaked to the press. In that letter, the U.S. threatens to withhold arms shipments if Israel doesn’t address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Friedman expressed frustration with the Biden Administration’s threat of sanctions on Israel, including an embargo or slowed arms shipments critical for Israel’s defense in the ongoing conflict. He confirmed knowing the specific weapons involved but declined to elaborate, emphasizing his belief that these delays are 'entirely political.' He emphasized the significance of a swift and decisive Israeli victory in its current conflict, framing it as 'essential' not only for Israel but also for the stability of Jordan, Egypt, and moderate Sunni Muslim nations. According to Friedman, US national security interests should support a clear win for moderates over extremists in the region. Turning to US domestic politics, Friedman argued that Michigan holds critical weight in the upcoming 2024 presidential election, suggesting that without Michigan, Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, lacks a path to victory. 'They’re in the process of losing Michigan, and what they did here, I think, was to sway those in Dearborn and other places,' he asserted. Friedman criticized the Biden Administration, asserting that 'politics has infected the national security decisions,' leading to negative consequences. In his view, while President Biden has not demonstrated the capacity to end the conflict swiftly, Trump is seen by some voters as able to achieve that goal, which may influence the election outcome in Michigan. Asked about Trump’s habit of making derogatory comments and offensive statements, Friedman urged people offended by the former president’s words to 'get over it' He noted a recent shift, where a group of Muslim imams endorsed Donald Trump, citing his perceived ability to 'stop the killing' and end the war. He explained that this endorsement didn’t reference Israel directly but suggested urgency in conflict resolution. 'That doesn’t mean that Israel should somehow be held back in its efforts to win the war, but it should be done quickly, decisively, and let’s start the rebuilding process,' he said. Israel will struggle to improve its public image until the war comes to an end, Friedman said. 'Once it’s over, you can make the case, look, this is what we did,' he said. 'This is what had to be done. Efforts were made to minimize civilian suffering. We are rebuilding, and this is what the future will look like. I think in the absence of a vision going forward, it’s hard to get people all that interested in your side of the case.' Friedman said that Trump will likely receive between 30% and 40% of the Jewish vote, which would be a historically high level of Jewish support for the Republican candidate. Many Jews who support Harris simply have priorities other than Israel, Friedman said. 'But then there are others who really just want to self-rationalize the idea that Kamala Harris will be better for Israel or better at fighting antisemitism than Trump,' he said. 'I don’t think there’s any intellectually honest way to get there.' Friedman discussed Trump’s 2019 executive order that expanded Title VI of the US Code to include protections for Jewish students from anti-Semitic conduct at universities. This expansion means that universities receiving federal funding must ensure the safety of their Jewish students or risk losing financial support. 'And almost all universities get some form of federal funding,' he said. According to Friedman, this is an 'enormously important' tool that remains in place under President Biden but is not being enforced. 'You can’t get tenure on a major American university if you’re pro-Israel,' Friedman asserted. 'We’ve seen that over and over again. And this is the breeding ground for the leaders of America for the next 20, 30, 40 years.' He argued that the federal government could pressure institutions like Harvard, Yale, and Columbia by threatening their funding, which he believes would prompt swift changes, saying, 'follow the money, you figure out where the incentives lie.' Friedman highlighted the broader impact of universities as 'the breeding ground for the leaders of America' and described the lack of pro-Israel perspectives in academia as a critical issue for the country’s future. He called for expanding law enforcement, particularly around immigration laws, asserting that many agitators are foreign nationals. While Friedman expressed doubt in changing 'the hearts and minds of anti-Semites,' he emphasized that enforcing existing laws could address these issues. This, he explained, is one of the key measures Trump would prioritize to 'change things very quickly' if reelected, ensuring universities comply with laws protecting Jewish students. Asked about Trump’s habit of making derogatory comments and offensive statements, Friedman urged people offended by the former president’s words to 'get over it.' 'He’s made America a stronger country, a more prosperous country, a more respected country,' he said. 'He’s been able to export American values throughout the world, throughout some of our most challenging places within the world. He’s feared in places like North Korea and Russia. And he stood up to China like no president before or after. You don’t like something he said, get over it.' Friedman said he was 'really nervous' about a world in which Trump isn’t elected. 'Who’s going to deal with making sure Israel has the weapons it needs to defend itself? The only thing Kamala Harris has ever said that’s in favor of Israel is that they have the right to defend themselves,' he said. 'I’d like her to point to any country in the world that, after it’s been attacked, doesn’t have the right to defend itself. It’s a meaningless platitude. Where she goes with that, I don’t know. I don’t think she really believes in the cause, in the ultimate justice of a Jewish state.' In his recently published book, 'One Jewish State: The Last, Best Hope to Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,' Friedman argues for a one-state solution where Israel would hold sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, the West Bank. This stance marks a shift from his previous support for a two-state solution, though he clarifies that even then, his vision included strict security controls by Israel over Palestinian territories—a model Palestinians rejected. He attributes his change in perspective to several factors: The first factor, he said, was the Palestinian response to the 2020 Trump peace plan, 'which was complete, unadulterated rejection.' 'Then along comes October 7, in which we see the capacity of Palestinians for hatred and brutality,' he said. 'And then you look at the polls of Judea and Samaria, of the Palestinians living there, and the aftermath, where like 80-plus percent of them were in favor of what Hamas did on October 7. So you take the Palestinian rejectionism, their support for October 7, and you then say, OK, this has changed the way I think.' Friedman recalls a pivotal conversation with a secular Israeli entrepreneur who initially seemed indifferent about retaining historically significant areas like Shiloh. After learning about Shiloh’s biblical heritage, the entrepreneur changed his view, affirming the importance of retaining the site. Inspired by this interaction, Friedman wrote his book to appeal to Israel’s political left, presenting his case for Israeli sovereignty as the best path for Palestinian welfare and stability. 'The best outcome is Israeli sovereignty over all of Judea and Samaria, because there is no other governing body,' he said. 'Look around and look around the region. You know, there’s no other governing body that has a track record of empowering an Arab minority other than Israel.' According to Friedman, Israel’s governance has offered opportunities to its Arab citizens, pointing to Arab participation in elite universities, health care, and business in Israel. He argues this model benefits Palestinians more than self-governance, which, he says, was a failed experiment in Gaza, leading to resources being diverted to conflict. 'What did they do with their independence, right? What did they do with the money that was given to them? They squandered it all on terror tunnels and weapons of mass destruction,' Friedman said. 'So why go through this experiment again when Israel has a proven track record of running an Arab minority?' Friedman has not yet presented these ideas to Trump or the moderate Muslim states, noting that his focus is on influencing Israeli opinion. He believes that for any U.S. policy shift, it is crucial to have Israeli consensus on the approach. The book, he adds, was recently translated into Hebrew to broaden its reach in Israel. Friedman’s plan does not provide an answer for the 2 million people living in Gaza. 'It’s a long-term solution,' he said. 'We’re not ready yet for a long-term solution to Gaza. Gaza is entirely a short-term problem. You know, people need houses. They need to eat. I mean, these are issues that, until you deal with them, you don’t deal with the One Jewish State issues.' Despite the ongoing war and the hostages still held in Gaza, Israel is better off now than it was before the war broke out, Friedman said. 'My analogy has always been to take two people who had serious cancer on October 6,' he said. 'They don’t know it yet. They feel fine. But they’ve got cancer growing inside of them. And over the course of the next year, one discovers it, goes through chemotherapy, suffers through it, has a very difficult time. It’s now a year later, not completely out of the woods, but starting to get good test results, starting to get, you know, the PET scans and the CAT scans are showing that the cancer has shrunk. In some cases, it’s been eliminated. The other guy still feels fine, right? Now, you compare these two people a year out, right? In the USA, you’re a life insurance company, right? Who do you want to write a policy on? Who’s healthier?' Similarly, he said, Israel has come to terms with the unsustainable situation on its borders and taken steps to address it. Asked about what role he might take in a new Trump Administration, Friedman expressed his willingness to rejoin the government, especially in the wake of recent events impacting Israel. He described a desire to help Israel heal from the trauma of October 7 and said he would again accept the role as ambassador if Trump is reelected and offers it to him. 'I want to help Israel get back on its feet,' he said, adding that he also hopes to 'help America restore its credibility within the world.' Friedman emphasized his belief that America is uniquely positioned to lead globally, warning that if the US doesn’t take that role, 'the world quickly devolves to a very bad place.' 'I want to help America restore its credibility within the world,' he said. 'Of all the superpowers, regional and worldly, America’s the only country with the values that really make it suitable to lead the world.' -This article is written by Felice Friedson and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ryav00glz1e	2024-10-30T10:34:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2020/02/25/HJJ32sMVL/HJJ32sMVL_0_34_800_451_0_small.jpg

The United States supports Israel's right to go after legitimate Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, the State Department said on Wednesday when asked about the eastern city of Baalbek being bombarded by Israel.

Haredi lawmaker says national religious are 'useful idiots' of th...	Moshe Shimon Roth says the left is using the religious Zionist community's fallen soldiers as a political tool and says that the whole conscription issue is a sham, claiming there is no manpower shortage Knesset Deputy Speaker Moshe Shimon Roth of the United Torah Judaism Party launched a scathing critique of Aliyah and Integration Minister Ofir Sofer from the Religious Zionism party, who stated on Wednesday, 'We’ve been spit in the face by Haredi leadership,' adding that it’s unacceptable that the Haredi community avoids enlistment while 'both Torah students and others are bleeding to death.' Considered relatively moderate on conscription issues, Roth told Kol Berama Radio that, contrary to the claims of IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, 'the whole conscription issue is a sham. There is no manpower shortage; the IDF doesn’t want to draft Haredim. It’s the left that keeps bringing this up, using national religious Israelis as its ‘useful idiots.’' Roth, who is involved in discussions on the military conscription law and serves as chair of the Knesset Ethics Committee and a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, added: 'Sofer is very attached to his seat, and that overrides any ideology. Eventually, even he will need something. He just wanted to show his supporters what a debater he is, but that’s the end of the show – he went off to bed.' 'They [the left] do it because the religious and traditional camp is gaining strength, and that bothers the left. They are politicizing the sacrifice of religious Zionists to score points against the Haredim. When these soldiers were alive, the left vilified them for their actions and beliefs, but now they’re using them as tools against the Haredim.' Opposition leaders quickly condemned Roth. Avigdor Liberman, chairman of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, said Roth 'should be ashamed. Calling the national religious community ‘useful idiots’ crosses a red line. National religious Israelis, who combine Torah study with military service and workforce participation, are the salt of the earth and deeply committed to the values of the state and Zionism. It’s time you and your colleagues realize: we’re in an existential battle; everyone must join and enlist.' Likewise, Yesh Atid Knesset member Meirav Cohen criticized Roth, saying: 'When a public official fights to keep his community out of the army – refusing to serve while their own brothers fall –and calls those who do serve ‘useful idiots,’ well…' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1n1ucybkl	2024-10-30T10:08:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/30/HkoN11T111Jx/HkoN11T111Jx_0_40_1280_721_0_small.jpg
How inmates in Israeli prison hid cellphones underground	Over 40 mobile devices found in underground spaces and sewage pipes sawed to hide the cellphones; Israel Prison Service warns possible upcoming budget cuts could hinder efforts to prevent future smuggling operations In September 2021, six prisoners escaped from Gilboa Prison, which until then was considered one of Israel's most secure facilities. Following the escape and the ensuing investigative committee, the Israel Prison Service underwent a significant reform, introducing a computerized management system and reinforcing prison security. As part of these measures, concrete was poured into the underground spaces beneath Gilboa Prison, which had been constructed with foundational piles. The project was expanded to other prisons, including Ganot Prison in southern Israel, where approximately 2,500 inmates are held. At the peak of these efforts, it was revealed that prisoners found another use for these 'dead spaces' beneath the cells: hiding mobile phones to maintain contact with the outside world. Currently led by Israel Prison Service chief Kobi Yaakobi, this extensive effort to fortify cells and fill underground spaces with concrete aims to implement recommendations from the government’s inquiry following the Gilboa escape. The committee discovered that some prisons have open spaces beneath the cells – created when the structures were raised on piles – leaving gaps of several dozen centimeters between the ground and the floor. The latest security operations uncovered a particularly clever tactic: Prisoners sawed through toilet pipes to stash magnetic pouches containing mobile phones. Using improvised 'fishing rods' with magnets on the ends, they would retrieve the phones to communicate outside the prison. Despite concerns about budget cuts, the Israel Prison Service warns that the proposed reductions could severely hinder their ability to prevent smuggling operations and implement the Gilboa Prison escape committee’s recommendations. During recent security operations in Ganot Prison, prison staff uncovered over 40 mobile phones hidden under cell floors. Using the new method, prisoners sawed into plumbing pipes, creating hidden compartments for phones and retrieving them with magnetic fishing rods when needed. Chief Warden Hatem Azam, who leads the project, highlighted the sophistication displayed by the prisoners. 'We are facing elaborate tactics, and our actions aim to thwart these attempts and prevent illegal communications. Additionally, we’ve deployed cellular jammers to disrupt any communication. We will continue to detect and seal off these ‘underground cities.’' Southern District Commander Chief Warden Eran Peer expressed concern over possible budget cuts. 'Right at the peak of our fight, the Finance Ministry is considering budget reductions, while we’re uncovering methods that enable security prisoners to communicate from behind bars. National security depends on preventing these smuggling operations. Lives and state security cannot be reduced to a matter of budget.'

Gallant in Gaza: 'Deal to return hostages most important task'	Defense Minister Yoav Gallant entered the Gaza Strip on Wednesday and joined troops deployed in Rafah and the Philadelphi corridor. Gallant was shown the location where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was eliminated and held an operational situation assessment together with the General of the Southern Command, Commander of the Gaza Division, and additional senior officials. 'In any place where Hamas rears its head, it meets the IDF – whether in Rafah, Khan Younis, or Jabaliya- wherever Hamas rises, it is taken down. Your [military] actions led to the conditions that ultimately caused Sinwar to make a mistake [leading to his elimination],' he told IDF troops. 'The central issue here is to continue exerting as much [military] pressure on Hamas as possible, in order to create the conditions necessary to ensure the return of the hostages. Your duty is to exert military pressure, and eliminate and imprison terrorists.' 'The political echelon must do what is necessary to bring about a deal. You [referring to the troops] must apply military pressure and do what is necessary to create the conditions required for us to carry out a deal. This is our most important mission in Gaza at this time,' he said. 'We have routine tasks as well – defending Israeli communities and troops, and maintaining our freedom of operation in Gaza. You apply pressure – do what is necessary and we will bring about a deal because you created the conditions for us to carry it out, and I hope that we will do it.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk87eay11jx	2024-10-30T07:47:26-07:00

New Hezbollah chief says war goes on in 1st speech	Naim Qassem vows to continue in the path set by his slain predecessor Hassan Nasrallah; says the terror group is defending Lebanon and not working on behalf of Iran Hezbollah's new leader, Naim Qassem, said on Wednesday that the war against Israel will continue. In a prerecorded speech, his first since being named to head the terror group, Qassem said he will continue in the footsteps of his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah who was assassinated in an Israeli strike on his bunker in Beirut, in September. During his speech rockets targeted the Galilee after barrages that began early in the morning and continued throughout the day. 'I thank Hezbollah for giving me this responsibility, which is a heavy load and a sign of trust. The blood of our leader will remain and strengthen our resolve to continue on this path,' he said. Qassem said support for Gaza was necessary to deal with the threat Israel poses to the entire region. 'Israel does not need an excuse for its aggression,' he said. 'History has proven that.' He said Hezbollah was not asking for a cease-fire. 'If the enemy wants to stop, we will accept terms that are suitable to us. Any solution will be through negotiations,' he said. U.S. Mideast envoy Amos Hochstein and Special Presidential Envoy Brett McGurk were scheduled to arrive in the region on Thursday, to advance a cease-fire deal that would end the fighting on the Israeli-Lebanon border. The 71-year-old cleric said that Hezbollah was fighting Israel to defend Lebanese territory and not on behave of any foreign influence, alluding to Iran, the group's main benefactor. He said Iran'supports us but doesn't want anything' in return.

Ukraine is also bracing for what could be the toughest winter of the war after long-range Russian airstrikes destroyed what officials says is about half of its power generating capacity. A $61 billion aid package from the United States, stalled by Republicans in Congress from December last year, was approved in April.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1aoz6ywkl	2024-10-30T06:29:45-07:00	
Mass evacuations from Lebanese towns amid explosions from IDF att...	Two farmers injured by rocket from Lebanon targeting Metula, as Israeli forces warned Lebanese towns of imminent danger, urging evacuation; From an environmental standpoint, there is significant damage to forests throughout northern Israel, with long-term recovery needed for affected wildlife and vegetation Two farmers sustained injuries, ranging from mild to moderate-severe, on Wednesday morning due to a direct rocket strike launched from Lebanon targeting Metula. They were taken to Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa for treatment. Concurrently, IDF's Arabic spokesperson, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, issued an evacuation warning to residents of Baalbek, Ain Borday and Dours in eastern Lebanon, prompting a massive exodus. Later on Wednesday, huge explosions and large amounts of smoke were seen and heard in Baalbek. Adraee's message stated: 'Urgent notice to the residents of Baalbek, Ain Borday, and Dours. IDF is taking strong action against Hezbollah interests in your towns and villages and does not wish to harm you. To ensure your safety, you must immediately evacuate your homes and move beyond the towns and villages via the following routes: Zahle-Baalbek Road; Nahla-Baalbek Road; Al-Arz-Baalbek Road, as outlined on the map. Proximity to Hezbollah operatives, its facilities, or weaponry may expose you to danger.' Following the evacuation announcement, Sky News in Arabic reported on the mass departures from the Baalbek area and other regions identified in Adraee's notice. The governor of Baalbek said in an interview with Sky News in Arabic that 'there is no military presence of Hezbollah' within Baalbek and urged residents to head toward the northern district, adding that 'panic has spread among the residents after the evacuation warnings.' In the afternoon, IDF spokesperson reported that Air Force fighter jets, guided by intelligence from Military Intelligence, the Air Force, and Northern Command, attacked the Nabatieh area and eliminated Mostafa Ahmed Shhadi, the deputy commander of Hezbollah's Radwan Force. In his former roles, he was responsible for operations in Radwan during the Syrian conflict from 2012 to 2017 and managed the unit's combat plans in southern Lebanon. 'Mustafa Ahmad Shihadi advanced terror plots against the State of Israel. This elimination further cripples the operational capabilities of Hezbollah's Radwan Force to execute terror activities against Israeli forces and the Israeli home front on the northern border, particularly the plan to conquer the Galilee,' the report stated. Meanwhile, the Lebanese 'Al-Mayadeen' network, affiliated with Hezbollah, reported an aerial strike on a vehicle on the Al-Kahhala Araya road in the Mount Lebanon area. According to the Lebanese 'Al-Jadid' channel, one person was killed in the vehicle attack. Minutes earlier, a separate report in Lebanon detailed another vehicle attack using a drone in the nearby village of Shamoun. Earlier in the morning, minor damage was reported at a factory building in Nahariya, where aviation components are manufactured, after a drone exploded nearby. The IDF is investigating why no alert was triggered at the site. Prior to this, IDF spokesperson updated that the Air Force intercepted three drones that penetrated from Lebanon after sirens activated in Nahariya and communities in the western Galilee. It was further reported that there were no casualties in the incident, although a fire broke out near the Gesher HaZiv area. In the meantime, the Jewish National Fund (KKL) released data on Wednesday indicating the extent of damage caused by Hezbollah fire since the war began. Approximately 43,243 acres of natural land were burned in the Upper Galilee-Golan Heights region, which suffered the most damage. They estimate that rehabilitation will take between five to seven years. In the Lower Galilee-Gilboa, slightly more than 6,100 acres of open and forested areas were burned, according to KKL data. In the Western Galilee-Carmel region, approximately 2,224 acres were burned, and in the Hula Valley, approximately 178 acres. 'KKL emergency teams, alongside firefighting and rescue crews, continue to lead the fight against fires in the north, even under fire,' said KKL Chairperson Yifat Ovadia-Luski. 'The war has caused severe damage to the residents of the north, and unfortunately also to wildlife and vegetation. Our primary mission for the new year is to rejuvenate the affected areas and the entire State of Israel.' KKL also noted that the fires impacted a wide variety of wildlife: many bird nesting sites were destroyed, habitats of mammals and reptiles living on the ground were burned, and a large number of arthropods could not escape the flames. The damage to vegetation, they noted, is severe. All forest and woodland trees, including conifers like pine, cypress, and cedar, as well as broadleaf trees such as oak, terebinth, Judas tree, eucalyptus, carob, and almond, were affected by the fires. Additionally, public spaces like parking lots, lookout points, scenic viewpoints, forest entrances, and scenic routes were also burned. 'They want to make a 'lame' agreement' Northern municipal leaders addressed the potential settlement in the north, as revealed on Tuesday by Ynet and 'Yedioth Ahronoth.' Eitan Davidi, chairman of Moshav Margaliot, said: 'We want the war to end, but this is not the way. Israel is attempting to reach an agreement that would allow residents in southern Lebanon to return to their homes, and at some point, we could live amicably with our neighbors, but that's not the situation.' He stated, 'This neighborhood doesn't work, the concept doesn't work. The State of Israel needs to change its approach.' Davidi warned that if such a settlement is implemented, 'we will protest.' He added: 'I suggest to the Chief of Staff and the Northern Command Commander to focus on restoring security and achieving results within Lebanon. They want to make a 'lame' agreement.' Shimon Guetta, head of the Ma'ale Yosef Regional Council, said in an interview with Ynet: 'We need to end this once and for all. We are eager to return to our homes, but to return safely. The residents will not return easily. People have been outside their homes for a year.'

Espionage scandal rocks Italy, Mossad implicated	Private security firm alleged to steal information on leaders, public figures in years of hacking, to sell to customers; Mossad agents reportedly seek to trade information on illegal deals with Iran for info on Russian hackers, Wagner Group An internal espionage scandal is rocking Italy after a private investigation firm made up of current and former senior members of the security services was alleged to have stolen personal information on politicians, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and public figures for extortion. Israel's Mossad was alleged to have been involved in deals with the Milan-based investigative firm. At least four people were under arrest and dozens more were under investigation. Cyber security experts and hackers may have breached the servers of Italy's interior ministry, investigators said. Meloni described the alleged plot as 'unacceptable' and 'a threat to democracy.' Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto demanded an urgent parliamentary probe, out of concern that state secrets may have been compromised. He said the personal information that was exposed is the tip of the iceberg. Italian media described the affair as a conspiracy of the highest level that involves members of the mafia and officials in the intelligence services along with foreign intelligence services including the Mossad. A former senior member of the police who heads Equalize, the private investigation firm is the primary suspect in the investigation and is accused of breaching the servers of government ministries and the police, since 2019 and until 2024, to build massive files, packed with secrets and sensitive information which he sold or planned to sell to his clients. Most of the firm's clients are large companies or major law firms who were interested in access either to gain an advantage over competitors, to succeed in court cases or for extortion. According to a report in the Corriere Della Sera on Wednesday, investigators intercepted a visit to the investigation firm, by two unidentified Israelis who were described as intelligence agents, who wanted to deal in information regarding Iranian gas that may be of interest to Italy's government gas company, ENI and pertained to illegal trade in gas with Iran. The paper also said that the visit was coordinated by a senior member of the police who worked for Italian intelligence, Mossad's counterpart, a man identified as Lorezo De Marcio, and that the Israeli agents asked help in identifying the actions of Russian hackers and Russian bank transactions connected to the notorious Wagner Group, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin's former ally who was reportedly assassinated after he led a mutiny against the Russian military. The Open website claimed the Israelis asked to stop funding of Prigozhin by Russian oligarchs and offered the Italian firm classified information on illegal purchases of gas from Iran and a payment of one million euros. According to the website, the Vatican was involved in assisting the action against Russia.

US Marines complete first drill using Iron Dome interceptors in I...	Drill included a radar-based system and an American command-and-control center testing capabilities of Iron Dome in part of a new U.S. Army project The U.S. Marine Corps has completed its first live-fire training exercise using an air defense system incorporating Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system, the Defense Ministry said on Wednesday. The drill was carried out successfully, featuring a radar-based system and an American command-and-control center, alongside the Iron Dome interceptor missile and a mobile launcher developed by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in collaboration with the U.S. company Raytheon. During the exercise, the Marines operated the system in full, intercepting targets within the area. Additionally, the exercise evaluated the continuous launch capability of Iron Dome interceptors from a mobile launcher designed specifically for the U.S. Marine Corps. The Defense Ministry said in a statement that this exercise was part of a development and procurement project headed by the U.S. Marines to test a prototype for a new medium-range interception system. The Iron Dome interceptor, known as the 'Tamir,' which was used in the exercise, can intercept cruise missiles, drones, and a variety of rockets, shells and mortars. 'The live-fire exercise’s success represents a key milestone toward operational deployment of the Marines' first prototype battery,' the ministry said in a statement.

After demeaning photos appear, detained Palestinians speak out	Hundreds of men stripped of their shirts seen in images on social media after being detained by troops during the fighting in Gaza; IDF says it acted in accordance to international law and was searching for Hamas terrorists among the civilians Hundreds of Palestinians detained by troops in Gaza were seen in photos on social media, stripped of their shirts. The demeaning photos prompted condemnation from media outlets but the IDF said it was acting according to international law and the men were told to strip to ensure that they were not strapped with explosives. 'The men were instructed to remove their clothes and stay in just their underwear,' on man told CNN. We complied. We sat in the cold for several more hours and the weather was frigid. They were insulting us during that time, calling us names, laughing and taking pictures.' According to the report, the image, taken last Friday, was initially shared on an Israeli Telegram channel. It was also noted that the individuals in the photo had tried to leave the area following a warning from the IDF that there will be fighting there. Temperatures in Gaza were in the high 20's C for most of the day. CNN reported that it was unclear who had taken the picture, though some of those photographed claimed it was IDF soldiers who photographed them during their detention. A CNN correspondent spoke with five of those in the image. Muhannad Khalaf, 27, said he and his wife were detained by IDF soldiers while attempting to flee their home with their infant son via what was described as a designated safe corridor. 'We were all gathered in one place – men, women, children, and the elderly. This was at 11 a.m. After five hours, at 4 p.m., they asked the women and children to move forward and carry all (of our) bags and belongings,' he told the outlet. 'Once they left, the men were instructed to remove their clothes and stay in just their underwear. We complied. We sat in the cold for several more hours and the weather was frigid. They were insulting us during that time, calling us names, laughing and taking pictures,' he added. According to Khalaf, every five men in the photo were asked to move forward for an ID screening by the soldiers before being allowed to proceed toward Gaza City. 'Some individuals were detained while others were released. Most of us ended up in Gaza City. The situation was terrifying and deeply saddening as we witnessed elderly men and injured individuals in distress, with no one showing them compassion or mercy.' According to CNN, the image shows a three-and-a-half-year-old girl named Jouri Abu Ward riding a bicycle alongside her father as they made their way to Gaza City. Her father, Mohamad Abu Ward, said, he was forced to strip down to his underwear and was held for eight hours. He said the girl was not required to remove her clothes but was unable to leave the area because she was alone with him. No food or water was available to them. His wife and other children left the area earlier in the morning and were able to make it to Gaza City. 'Individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity are being detained and questioned,' the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit told CNN in a statement. 'The detainees are treated in accordance with international law but it is often necessary for terror suspects to hand over their clothes so that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry.' 'Due to security protocol, clothes aren’t immediately returned to the detainees,' the statement added, adding the clothes are returned as soon as it’s 'possible to do so.'

Spain flash floods kill at least 51 people	Torrential rains leave roads and towns under water in Valencia leaving some people stranded; Madrid send troops to assist in the rescue efforts At least 51 people have been killed in flash floods sweeping the eastern Spanish region of Valencia following torrential rains on Tuesday that left roads and towns under water, local authorities said on Wednesday. Dozens of videos shared on social media overnight appeared to show people trapped by the floodwaters, with some climbing into trees to avoid being swept away. Carlos Mazon, the regional leader of Valencia, told a press conference some people remained isolated in inaccessible locations. Frantic residents searched for missing relatives while local rescue services struggled to respond to the urgent demand. The government in Madrid deployed 1,000 military troops to assist in the rescue efforts after an astounding 491 mm. of rain fell in 8 hours, the most since 1966, according to Spain's RTVE network. Emergency services urged citizens to refrain from any kind of road travel and to follow further updates from official sources. Spain's state weather agency AEMET declared a red alert in Valencia, with some areas such as Turis and Utiel recording 200 mm (7.9 inches) of rainfall. Meteorologists warned that the extreme weather occurrences will likely increase amid rising global temperatures.

Israel disables most of Iran's air defenses, official says	Israel's destroys key S-300 missile systems and radar sites; Satellite images reveal extensive damage to the Shahrud Space Center, a pivotal Revolutionary Guards facility used for satellite launches and missile production Israel succeeded in taking out most of Iran's air defenses during its attack last Saturday, an official said in an interview with Fox News late on Tuesday. According to the network's sources, Israel destroyed three of Iran's S-300 systems, after a fourth was targeted in the first Israeli strike last April Satellite imagery has revealed significant damage to the Shahrud Space Center, a key launch site for Iran's Revolutionary Guards located in the Semnan province in northeastern Iran, allegedly inflicted by Israel. The operation reportedly also targeted multiple radar systems critical to Iran's ballistic missile capabilities. In a message to Tehran, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi warned that any further Iranian missile barrages would be met with unprecedented Israeli military responses. Visiting the squadrons responsible for the Iran strike at Ramon Air Force Base, Halevi said, 'We will know how to hit very, very hard in both capabilities and locations that we left aside this time.' The Associated Press unveiled new satellite images showing additional damage at another site targeted by the Israeli assault, a fact unreported by Tehran. Images reveal destruction at several buildings within the Shahrud Space Center. Although Iran has acknowledged damage in Tehran and the provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan, it remains silent about Semnan. Expert analysis suggests that while there is no definitive evidence the damage was not caused by other means, pre-strike imagery shows no such destruction. Captured by Planet Labs, the satellite images from Tuesday depict a central structure at the space center, now a skeletal ruin. Nearby vehicles, likely belonging to Iranian officials, survey the wreckage. Pre-strike images from March show the building intact, topped by a high blue roof. Further images reveal three smaller structures demolished south of the main building, with additional damage to a hangar to the northeast, indicating precise targeting by the Israeli military. Iran is presumably still assessing the full extent of the damage from this calculated strike.

US envoys arrive to advance Lebanon cease-fire	Israeli terms include freedom to operate in South Lebanon if UNIFIL fails to prevent Hezbollah's return to areas south of the Litani; Hezbollah says will not disarm and is prepared to fight on U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk will arrive on Thursday as efforts to secure a cease-fire deal in Lebanon, advance. Hochstein was in the region last week and will now return as both sides show serious intentions to finalize a deal. Israeli officials said an agreement in Lebanon is tied to the discussions held between CIA chief William Barns and Egyptian and Qatari mediators attempting to reach a hostage release and cease-fire deal for Gaza. Officials in Jerusalem said that some of Israel's conditions could prove difficult for Lebanon to accept, including the demand that the IDF be able to operate freely in South Lebanon to ensure compliance with the terms agreed. Israel insists that if the UNIFIL force is unable to enforce the deal, the IDF be able to take action to ensure the safety of the residents in the north, after the peacekeepers failed to enforce UN resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War and allowed Hezbollah terrorists to return to the border with Israel and build fortifications there in advance of their planned invasion of the Galilee. Israel also demands that the Lebanon army complete the destruction of all Hezbollah infrastructure in South Lebanon, after the IDF withdraws, and ensures no members of the terror group remain south of the Litani River. Jerusalem also demands that measures be in place to prevent Hezbollah from re-arming with weapons smuggled across Lebanon's border with Syria, provided by Iran. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Khbar newspaper published on Tuesday, the demands of the terror group for the cease-fire including maintaining the link between the war with Israel and Hamas's war in Gaza. 'Hezbollah hopes all Lebanese understand that disarming is not an option,' the paper wrote. Hezbollah also rejects changing the makeup of UNIFIL troops except for the removal of Germans 'because they are partners with the enemy.' Israel has asked that its European allies dedicate troops to the peacekeeping mission. 'Israel wants to continue the war,' Hezbollah officials told the paper. 'We must be prepared for a prolonged fight.' The terror group also said they were not affected by the wave of assassinations of leaders.

Beyond UNRWA: How does Israel plan to coordinate Palestinian aid ...	UN officials and foreign leaders condemned Israel’s plan to ban the UN’s Palestinian refugee organization, but Israeli politicians say that doing say is necessary for the country’s security If the bills passed Monday night by the Israeli parliament are implemented, the United Nations agency supporting Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank could be banned in Israel by February 2025. The plan, which is expected to be implemented in 90 days, would shift responsibilities from the organization known as UNRWA to other international aid organizations. Israeli lawmakers say the change aims to create a foundation for a more peaceful and productive relationship with Palestinians in Jerusalem and neighboring areas. Founded in 1949, UNRWA provides education, health care, and aid to millions of Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israel’s tenuous relationship with the agency became even more strained after the October 7 attacks, in which at least 12 Gaza UNRWA employees were found to have been involved. Israel later discovered evidence that at least 1,200 UNRWA employees in Gaza—10% of its Gaza workforce—were operatives of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. A bill banning state authorities from having any contact with the UNRWA and stripping all UNRWA workers of their diplomatic privileges and immunity passed the Knesset 87 to 9. 'I hope for a better education system in Palestinian society—one that teaches peace, not hate' 'I hope the Palestinians will see a weakened Hamas and weakened radical forces,' lawmaker Dan Illouz, who co-authored the bill, told The Media Line. 'I hope for a better education system in Palestinian society—one that teaches peace, not hate—and then, a move forward. It might be a very slow move forward, but toward a more constructive Palestinian society that yearns for peace, not war.' Lawmaker Sharren Haskel co-authored a second bill barring UNRWA from operating in Israeli territory. That bill passed 92 to 10. 'To protect our people, we have to change things, and it starts with UNRWA' 'I knew nine years ago that if UNRWA remained at the core of the Israeli-Arab conflict, there could be no different future,' Haskel told The Media Line. 'I knew it would lead to death and destruction. I didn’t imagine it would pave the way to a massacre like the one on October 7. To protect our people, we have to change things, and it starts with UNRWA.' Haskel’s bill would ban UNRWA from operating in East Jerusalem. A minority of the Palestinian students in East Jerusalem attend schools run by UNRWA, which are not associated with the Jerusalem municipality of the Israeli Education Ministry. Students at these schools study only in Arabic and follow the same curriculum as children in Gaza. Getting rid of UNRWA schools in East Jerusalem would be the most significant result of the bill, allowing a new generation of Palestinian East Jerusalemites to become more integrated into Israel society, Haskel said. The two bills were brought for a second and third reading Monday night, marking the start of the Knesset’s winter session. Both bills aim not only to remove UNRWA from Israel but also to sharply restrict its activities in Gaza and the West Bank. Israel will no longer issue entry permits for UNRWA workers from those territories or have the Israeli military coordinate on UNRWA operations. Lawmaker Boaz Bismuth, who co-authored one of the bills, described the organization as 'an aid agency for Hamas.' 'UNRWA is not a refugee aid agency,' he said. Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chair Yuli Edelstein said that Israel has 'the right and duty, as any sovereign nation committed to its survival, to combat threats against it, especially when they lie at its very heart.' Palestinians will still receive aid, lawmakers say Illouz explained that other international aid organizations are expected to support Palestinians as UNRWA is phased out. Potential alternatives include UNICEF, the United States Agency for International Development, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme, and others. The Palestinian Authority could also take over some responsibilities from UNRWA. 'These are organizations that work worldwide in all conflict zones,' Illouz explained. 'It is only in the case of the Palestinians that there is this unique organization that deals with only one conflict. This is toxic, not constructive, and not conducive to peace. We want to return to the internationally accepted norm in all other conflicts.' Haskel noted that the recent polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, a collaborative effort between WHO and UNICEF, ran smoothly. She emphasized that Israel wants to ensure that aid can enter the Palestinian territories and get to those in need. Aid not coordinated through UNRWA is more likely to reach those it’s intended for, she said, noting that diverted UNRWA aid bags had allegedly been found in the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s Gaza hideout. Illouz said he expects funding to be redirected from UNRWA to other aid organizations as needed. 'At the end of the day, the international community will need to decide if they care more about actual humanitarian aid for the Palestinians or strengthening this terror-supporting organization,' he said. 'That’s a decision they’ll have to make. I hope they make the right one.' He also called on the UN to change its definition of Palestinian refugees, noting that UNRWA now serves 5.8 million Palestinian refugees, up from the 750,000 it was originally tasked with serving. Critics of UNRWA often point to the ballooning number of Palestinian refugees as a sign of the agency’s ineffectiveness, but UNRWA rejects the idea that Palestinian refugees are held to a more lenient standard than other refugees served by the UN. 'There is no basis to question the reality that Palestine refugees have for generations been compelled by circumstances to retain their refugee status,' then-UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness wrote in 2011. 'Such questions betray a lack of understanding of the international protection regime and serve only to distract from the need to address the real reasons for the protracted Palestinian refugee situation, namely the absence of a negotiated solution to the underlying political issues.' Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, called the Knesset’s decision 'unprecedented' and 'dangerous,' adding that it violated international law. He also said that the bills 'will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians.' Similarly, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that the decision would have 'devastating consequences.'

Palestinian Authority reels at bill banning UNRWA in Israel	International and Palestinian bodies harshly condemn Jerusalem for passing controversial law banning UN aid organization activities in the country; repercussions expected in ICJ case against Israel Palestinian Authority officials condemned the legislation of the bill to ban UNRWA activities in the country on Monday. 'The Israeli decision regarding UNRWA’s work requires an Arab and international stance dedicated to protecting and supporting the agency’s role,' Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee Secretary-General Hussein al-Sheikh said in a posted on X. 'The UN Security Council must compel Israel to implement international decisions. Silence on the massacres committed against Palestinians and on what UNRWA has been exposed to is a disgrace for those who agreed to restrict their position to statements, condemnations and denunciations only,' he wrote. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has been in severe economic straits since the beginning of the Gaza war, teetering on the brink of collapse after Israel was withholding clearing funds which make up 65% of its annual budget. Palestinian officials noted that without an immediate solution for the 'void that UNRWA will leave behind, specifically in the education system,' the PA would struggle to meet the needs of students and teachers. 'Israel is tying our hands and feet,' a senior PA official said. 'We have no way to address all the issues UNRWA handled and supported without UN funding and aid unless Israel intends to fill that void through financing.' Fatah Deputy Chairman Mahmoud al-Aloul stressed the international community’s need to take 'urgent action' to force Israel to repeal the law and warned of its 'negative consequences.' 'The law reflects Israel’s systematic intent to end UNRWA’s role and replace it with other agencies, in a move aimed at eliminating the Palestinian refugee issue and revoking their right to return,' he said. 'Refugees’ right to return is guaranteed by international law and can’t be circumvented by Israeli methods.' Al-Aloul accused the Israeli law of 'blatantly violating the UN Charter and contradicting international resolutions — foremost among them Resolution 302 which mandates the establishment of UNRWA, as well as the recent Security Council resolution calling for the protection of humanitarian institutions and their staff.' UNRWA was established by a UN General Assembly resolution in 1949 and is authorized to provide aid and protection to Palestinian refugees in its five operational areas: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 'We provide assistance, protection and support for over 5.9 million Palestinian refugees,' UNRWA wrote on its main Arabic website alongside a statement from the agency’s Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, calling to 'stop Israel’s violent campaign against us.' The laws halting UNRWA’s operations in Israel were approved partly due to the involvement of some agency members in the October 7 massacre. 'There is no question that individuals accused of criminal acts, including the deplorable assault on Israel, must be investigated,' Lazzarini said. 'This is exactly what the United Nations is doing. Those individuals must be held accountable through criminal prosecution and, if found guilty, punished.' He said the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the top investigative body in the U.N. system, is overseeing this inquiry. 'It is looking into allegations against 19 out of 13,000 UNRWA staff members in Gaza. To date, one case was closed because there was no evidence. Four cases were suspended because the information was insufficient to proceed. Another 14 cases remain under investigation. But we must distinguish the behavior of individuals from the agency’s mandate to serve Palestinian refugees. It is unjust and dishonest to attack UNRWA’s mission on the basis of these allegations.' Several governments worldwide, including France, were quick to condemn the legislation. 'Paris deeply regrets the approval of laws aimed at banning UNRWA’s operations in Israel. The implementation of these laws would have severe consequences for the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territories, depriving hundreds of thousands of civilians of essential aid, including shelter, healthcare, education and food,' France’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 'For more than 70 years, UNRWA has been playing a vital, indispensable role in providing essential goods and services to Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, but also in the countries that have taken them in – Lebanon, Jordan and Syria,' it added. 'France reaffirmed its support for UNRWA, pledging that it will 'continue to ensure the implementation of the necessary reforms to guarantee its neutrality, specifically the recommendations contained in the Colonna Report.' Repercussions at The Hague The new legislation mandates Israel’s complete severance of ties with UNRWA. The immediate effect means that should UNRWA staff request visas, Israel’s Foreign Ministry won’t cooperate, indirectly impacting their immunity. Israeli officials estimate Palestinian officials will leverage this legislation against UNRWA in the genocide lawsuit South Africa filed against Israel at the Hague. The legislation has triggered a serious crisis in Israel’s relations with the UN, though it’s important to note the UN consists of many bodies. Israel maintains reasonably good relations with UNICEF, the International Red Cross and the UN World Food Program. Bodies with which it has friction include UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who has one more year in office, UNRWA and UN Women. Guterres will likely use the legislation as a lever against Israel. He and Lazzarini framed the legislation as a blow to the multilateral system and a dangerous precedent — but this is misleading, as there’s no other organization in the world similar to UNRWA that perpetuates refugee status indefinitely.

Up to 14 hostages freed, 30 day lull, latest cease-fire proposal	Deal being discussed by Mossad chief and Qatari mediators says all women held hostage to be freed along with elderly; Egypt proposes a smaller deal to jumpstart the process with Hamas after Sinwar's killing Mossad Chief David Barnea and Qatari mediators drafted a proposed deal to be negotiated with Hamas that would see the release of all women held by Hamas in Gaza and the elderly hostages in exchange for a 30-day lull in the fighting and the freeing from Israeli jails of an undisclosed number of Palestinian prisoners. The offer does not include an Israeli withdrawal from the Strip. The U.S. and Qatar were considering a guarantee to Hamas that the IDF troops would pull out after all hostages were freed, despite Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence on maintaining troops along the border with Egypt. Efforts were underway to bring Hamas back to the negotiating table even for a 'small deal' to test the terror group's position after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month. Proposals on offer involve four hostages released in exchange for a two-week ceasefire, followed by a temporary pause to ponder peace. Prime Minister Netanyahu, however, claimed no such offer was made adding that he would have accepted such a proposal. Hamas, meanwhile, eyes Egypt not merely as a neighbor but as a gateway—a portal to renewed diplomatic ties under the watchful eyes of newly minted intelligence chief Hassan Rashad. This rapprochement comes after a frosty chapter with Rashad's predecessor, Kamal Abbas. And then there is the Russian proposal—two hostages with dual citizenship, Alexander Trofenov and Maxim Harkin, become the focal point of Moscow's diplomatic efforts. Hamas number 2, Mousa Abu Marzook was in Moscow, but it remains unclear—whether this would be part of a broader agreement. With the U.S. presidential elections taking place next week, there’s doubt whether any deal can be agreed before Americans go to the polls. After the elections, the pressure on Netanyahu promises to be relentless, regardless of who the next president will be.

Bismuth: 'Terror organizations like UNRWA won' operate in Israel' How did the Knesset manage to pass a bill banning UNRWA from Israel? According to one of the bill’s authors, MK Boaz Bismuth, this legislation has been a long time coming. 'If we say that what was before October 7 won’t be the same after, then this [ban] is one thing Israelis are expecting: That terror organizations, like UNRWA, will not operate from Israel,' Bismuth told ILTV. He added that implementing the bill will be straightforward. Israel, as a sovereign nation, 'only has to ban UNRWA' from operating within its borders and has full authority over which organizations or individuals may enter.

Rafael chief says laser interception systems is a gamechanger	New air defense system against rockets, mortars, cruise missiles, and even drones is the future: 'This is the world’s first laser weapon, and it will work seamlessly with Iron Dome, 'Yuval Steinitz says; So how does the system work, and what will it cost? 'This is the first laser system of its kind in the world, a global breakthrough—not just for Israel—that allows us to intercept missiles, rockets, shells, and drones kilometers away from the country using lasers,' said former minister and Rafael Chairman Yuval Steinitz on Sunday. The timing of the announcement amid wartime holds special significance, he noted: 'Most of our employees at Rafael are highly skilled scientists who could work elsewhere, but here, they feel they’re contributing to the national effort.' Israel’s Defense Ministry announcement effectively ends an international race among world powers, who have spent years attempting to develop a laser-based defense system. This breakthrough was made possible by scientific advancements at Rafael six years ago, which allowed the laser beam to stay consistent upon contact with the atmosphere without scattering. Rafael expects the system to be operational by 2025, adding another layer to Israel’s air defense against missile threats during wartime. 'The system is composed of hundreds of laser beams directed at an incoming target,' Steinitz explained. 'Laser is a highly focused and powerful beam with immense energy that can cut through steel at close range. However, when it encounters air, it tends to scatter. Our scientists at Rafael solved this by sending hundreds of laser beams toward a target tens of kilometers away, enabling us to detect in seconds—based on the beams' return—which hit the missile most accurately. The system then instantly redirects all beams to that precise point for effective targeting. It happens in a flash, within milliseconds. Once all beams lock onto the most accurate frequency, the missile can be neutralized.' Using sophisticated targeting technology similar to Iron Dome’s advanced systems, the laser system calculates the most effective beam for detonating the incoming missile, focusing the rest of the beams on that exact impact point to bring it down. 'The hit range will be about 10 centimeters,' Steinitz noted. 'It will slice through the missile’s steel casing, penetrate its warhead, and strike the explosive with such force that it will detonate.' When fully operational, the Iron Beam system will complement Israel’s existing air defense network, already one of the most advanced globally thanks to Iron Dome, the Arrow missile, and David’s Sling. This laser-based system provides Israel with a strategic and economic advantage, reducing interception costs significantly. 'Right now, each interceptor missile costs taxpayers a fortune,' Steinitz explained. 'But the Iron Beam intervention will cost the state only a few thousand dollars per use, thanks to the laser-based system instead of missiles. It’s a major difference. The cost of a single interception will be around five dollars, a massive shift. It reverses the current equation of intercepting cheap missiles with expensive countermeasures.' Rafael declined to go into further details, but for now, it appears the system won’t defend against ballistic missile attacks, like the one seen from Iran earlier this month. However, Rafael assures it will work effectively against other aerial threats from neighboring regions that have intensified in recent years. 'The system will be deployed alongside Iron Dome batteries,' Steinitz added, 'and depending on the threat type, it will decide whether to use an Iron Dome missile or the faster, lower-cost laser to do the job.' According to the agreement, the first operational system will be delivered to Israel by the end of next year. Like any defense system developed here, Israel’s adversaries will immediately seek ways to overcome it. Yet Steinitz remains unfazed by the challenge. 'There’s never 100 percent success, but while they think far ahead, so do we—ten steps ahead. This is just the beginning of the system. It’s clear that this breakthrough will bring additional applications and have a lasting impact on national defense in the future,' he concluded.

Reza Pahlavi reveals bold plan to end Iran's Islamic regime – is ...	Exclusive interview with former Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince of Iran, says the Islamic regime maintains its grip on power through indoctrination and proxy wars. In an exclusive interview with ILTV’s Emily Schrader, Pahlavi criticized Western policies that prioritize changing the regime’s behavior over advocating for its replacement. Instead, he supports a controlled implosion that would pave the way for a secular, democratic system. Pahlavi emphasized that Iranians are ready for change and that international support is crucial—but not through military intervention. What is his vision for the Iranian-Israeli relationship? Pahlavi envisions a strategic partnership between Israel and a free Iran, focused on mutual benefits and regional stability.

Is military or ‘civil’ force the key to regime change in Iran?	This is a war of narratives,' said Marty Youssefiani, who served as senior counselor to Iran’s crown prince. Over the weekend, Israel launched a powerful attack deep into Iran, demonstrating its capability to strike critical targets across the country at will. This show of force could pave the way for future strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities or energy infrastructure. Did Israel’s recent action weaken Iran’s leadership, or might it provoke retaliation? Two influential Iranian dissidents – Marty Youssefiani, a veteran campaign strategist who served as senior counselor to Iran’s crown prince, and Mohsen Sazegara, former Islamic Republic Deputy Prime Minister and founder of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards – discuss these questions on the latest episode of ILTV’s Insider. 'No regime change can ever be accomplished through military actions,' Youssefiani told Insider. 'What needs to be done is more investment in the Iranian people.' According to Youssefiani, much like Soviet Communism, Islamist governance in Iran is 'destined to fall' because it offers 'an epic but dark ideology.' He said that over the past 45 years, the people of Iran have witnessed the incompetence and corruption of living under a kleptocracy, and the world will see it too when the regime is no more. However, Youssefiani cautioned, this is not a war that can be won by missiles. 'This is a war of narratives that we can only win by winning the hearts and minds of the Iranian people, giving them the courage and confidence to stand up,' he said. However, there is hope that some military pressure may help convince the Iranian regime itself that it may be time for change. Sazegara noted that, for at least the last 25 years, Iranian military doctrine has centered on three pillars: asymmetric warfare or terrorist groups, missiles, and, as a deterrent, its nuclear project. Since Iranian proxy Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, and its other proxy, Hezbollah, began attacking Israel on October 8, Israel has managed to nearly dismantle these terrorist groups. 'The Iranian regime now has a big question,' Sazegara said. 'Now is the time for the leaders of Iran to think about the political consequences of such a defeat in its military doctrine.'

Lost Mayan city discovered in southern Mexico jungle	Archeologists in Mexico have discovered a huge, lost Mayan city, which they named Valeriana, hidden deep in the southern jungle of Campeche -- a sprawling, urban settlement, replete with architectural marvels and agricultural infrastructure.The discovery of what appears to have been a bustling urban landscape challenges the existing knowledge about the prevalence and density of ancient Mayan settlements. Valeriana was discovered by chance thanks to Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging, a technology that uses lasers to map and analyze archaeological landscapes. The dataset used for the study came from approximately 122 square kilometers (47 square miles) of high-quality airborne Lidar data collected in 2013 as part of a forest monitoring project called Alianza and led by the Nature Conservancy in Mexico, to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1bfmgj11je	2024-10-29T15:43:48-07:00	
From Lebanon, a close look at Hezbollah’s strategy to attack Metu...	The village of Kila, adjacent to Metula in Israel’s Upper Galilee region, was a strategic hub in Hezbollah’s plan to infiltrate northern Israeli communities; IDF soldiers have since dismantled terror infrastructures there, including a tunnel meant to funnel 1,000 terrorists across the border; Our reporter is on the ground with troops in southern Lebanon After nearly a year of war, the once-thriving village of Metula now stands abandoned and battered. Most of its homes lie in ruins from repeated Hezbollah strikes. Through its walls, the extensive destruction and devastation of Hezbollah’s terror infrastructure in the neighboring Lebanese village of Kila are clearly visible, the result of intense operations by Israel’s 769th Brigade of the 91st Division. In recent weeks, following the government’s authorization for the IDF to advance into southern Lebanon, bulldozers have been working tirelessly within three kilometers of the border to dismantle weapons caches and demolish terror strongholds. As tunnels are unearthed, the scale of Hezbollah's terror network, meant to facilitate a full-scale invasion of northern Israel, becomes clearer. For months, both government and military leaders awaited a diplomatic resolution with Hezbollah to withdraw its forces. However, with Hezbollah’s persistent attacks on northern communities, Israel has had no choice but to act, leading to the evacuation of thousands of residents from villages along the Lebanese border. On Monday alone, Metula endured 12 more rocket barrages. 'Kila represents everything Hezbollah had planned,' says Colonel Avraham Marciano, commander of the 769th Brigade, after crossing into Lebanese territory. From this vantage point, Marciano explains, Hezbollah fighters once targeted the northern Galilee and even the Hula Valley. Standing at a lookout where, last January, Hezbollah terrorists launched an anti-tank missile that struck the Ayalon family’s living room in Kibbutz Kfar Yuval, killing Mira Ayalon and her son Barak as they ate lunch, Marciano recounts the discovery of an underground network for surveillance and intelligence gathering aimed at coordinating attacks on Israel. 'Today, we're settling the score and dismantling Hezbollah’s infrastructure,' Marciano declared. In recent days, IDF soldiers have left their mark on the Lebanese side of the border wall, painting over Hezbollah graffiti honoring the slain leader Hassan Nasrallah. These walls, initially erected as a defensive barrier to delay enemy advances until reinforcements could arrive, were a response to Hezbollah’s longstanding threat. Standing mere meters from Metula's orchards, near a Hezbollah-owned gas station, Marciano points to a tunnel that had been primed for attack but did not breach Israel’s border. 'Fifty meters from here, inside those ruins, we discovered a tunnel entrance where they planned their invasion route. It’s a complex hundreds of meters long. They intended to move beneath the main street of Kila, regroup, and launch an assault from there,' he says. Hezbollah had planned for over 1,000 fighters from Kila to spearhead the assault on the eastern Galilee. As part of ongoing operations, IDF forces are systematically neutralizing these threats, both above and below ground. David, one of the soldiers, participated in locating the tunnel. 'We found it still equipped with digging tools. Nearly every building we entered contained terror infrastructure: shafts, tunnels, weapons, ammunition, combat vests, and medical supplies,' he said. Marciano estimates that the brigade is about two-thirds of the way through its mission. 'I believe it will take just a few more weeks to completely eliminate Hezbollah’s invasion capabilities,' he says. However, the thunder of artillery and the wail of sirens in Metula signal that the task of restoring security to the region is far from over. The sight of Kila’s gas station reminds me of years spent observing locals living under Hezbollah’s influence on the other side of the border fence, where terrorists documented and harassed our movements. Villagers from Kila often threw stones or waved hostile gestures at us and shone laser pointers into Metula’s homes. Now, I find myself on the Lebanese side, amid the ruins of that very gas station. Dust covers the ground, and in the rubble, I spot a receipt dated September 2023 from the gas station. Apparently, a Ferrari owner had filled up with 80 liters of gas, bought five liters of motor oil, and paid $450 for it all, including a car wash. Returning to Israel, I meet David Azulai, head of the Metula Local Council, who surveys the view of Kila from across the border. Over 60% of homes in Metula have been destroyed by Hezbollah rockets, he says. Despite his admiration for the IDF’s work, he expresses concern that the ground operation might conclude prematurely. 'It’s impressive, yes, but I have to think ahead,' Azulai says. 'What will happen a month from now when the army isn’t here? We’ve heard promises like this too many times.' Azulai is deeply worried that political leaders, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, might halt the mission without fully restoring security to the region. He is firmly against a negotiated settlement to end the war. 'There’s no need for an agreement that binds us to the other side,' he argues. 'We need to set the conditions and make it clear that any future violation will lead to an even more decisive response.' Azulai hopes the shattered villages on the Lebanese side will remain so, as a stark reminder to Lebanon of the cost of provoking Israel. 'We need a clear buffer zone from here to the Litani River.' The IDF now faces the task of proving to Metula and its surrounding communities that they are safe. 'We’re only halfway through this journey. I’m far from feeling secure here,' says Riki Gino, a native of the village and the council’s CEO. Like her parents’ home, her house was destroyed by Hezbollah rockets. 'I need to know what comes next. We need visible assurance that it’s safe to live here again.'

Watch injured IDF soldiers as they are evacuated from war zones	Since the beginning of the conflict, over 1,800 wounded have been airlifted from Gaza and southern Lebanon by Unit 669 and Air Force helicopters; Watch their heroic efforts to safeguard the wounded as bullets are still flying The Unit 669 combat search and rescue extraction unit, medical teams and Air Force helicopters have whisked more than 1,800 wounded from war zones over the past year. On Tuesday evening, the IDF unveiled footage capturing the pulse-pounding moments of these helicopter rescues: 'The fourth is on the ramp, the doctor is coming,' the teams called out in one of the videos documenting the seconds that the helicopter was on the ground. Since the start of the conflict, the Medical Corps, Unit 669 teams, and rescue helicopters have been active in three combat zones: the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon, and the West Bank. This week, the IDF has inaugurated a salute week for wounded and disabled IDF soldiers from the Gaza war, including many of those airlifted. Throughout the last year, Sikorsky CH-53 Yasur and Black Hawk helicopters have soared on over a thousand rescue sorties, leading to the evacuation and saving of more than 1,800 wounded. To date, about 200 of them have been airlifted from the northern sector, and approximately 1,600 from the southern sector, with additional wounded evacuated from various areas and incidents. Air Force helicopters undertake complex missions in compromised territories, supported by aircraft executing fire strikes to neutralize threats in the area. This is all to join forces with ground combat units and deliver advanced, life-saving care even as bullets rain down upon them. Senior caregivers work shoulder-to-shoulder with ground forces, ensuring initial medical response until evacuation arrives to guarantee the swiftest and most efficient life-saving treatment. 'Activities of the Medical Corps teams and the Air Force rescue teams have saved the lives of many combatants in all war arenas,' according to IDF spokesperson. On Tuesday, the Rehabilitation Division of the Ministry of Defense released its data: About 12,000 wounded IDF and security forces personnel have been received by the Rehabilitation Division since the beginning of the Gaza war, including 910 wounded evacuated to hospitals in the north since the start of the ground maneuver in Lebanon on October 1. Of these, 140 have already been received by the Rehabilitation Division, marking a 50% increase compared to security personnel wounded in the north last month who sought continued treatment. The remaining wounded were classified as lightly injured and returned to combat after receiving medical treatment. About 1,500 were injured twice in the war year. IDF's data stands at 5,184 wounded since the beginning of the war, but does not account for security personnel who are not soldiers, such as Shin Bet, police officers, emergency team members and those injured in routine events. The average annual cost of the treatment and economic support package for those wounded in war is estimated at about $40,000 per person.

US faces interceptor missile shortage amid Gaza war, global threa...	US sees missile stockpile depleting after over a year of aiding Israel in Gaza and the Red Sea; This raises concerns about US military readiness amid potential conflicts with Chinese aggression toward Taiwan and Russian aggression toward Ukraine The U.S. is facing a significant depletion of interceptor missiles after over a year of backing Israel in the Gaza conflict, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. This drain on U.S. military stockpiles is sparking anxiety in Washington over its readiness to respond to new potential flashpoints in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific, where tensions with China, poised to invade Taiwan, are escalating. American officials informed the paper that concerns about a potential missile shortfall have intensified following Israel’s recent strike on Iran, which might provoke Iranian retaliation with another salvo of ballistic missiles. The shortage pertains mainly to guided missiles from the AEGIS system, deployed on some U.S. Navy destroyers. These ship-launched missiles, pivotal in protecting Israel over the past year against direct Iranian assaults in April and early October, are the SM-3 models, each costing $15 million. These interceptors are essential for U.S. efforts against drone and missile attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen targeting Israel and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Since the conflict’s onset on October 7 of last year, the U.S. has reportedly fired over 100 'Standard' missiles. The Pentagon has declined to disclose the exact number of interceptors in its arsenal to prevent this information from being leveraged by Iran and its proxies. 'Over the past year, the Department of Defense has adjusted its regional deployments to protect U.S. forces and aid in defending Israel, while considering U.S. readiness and stockpiles,' stated Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh. The Wall Street Journal highlights the challenges the U.S. faces in ramping up production of these missiles. The main hurdle is the reluctance of U.S. companies to invest heavily in new production lines without guarantees of sustained Pentagon purchases. Carlos Del Toro, a senior Pentagon official overseeing the Navy, noted some progress in producing two models of Standard missiles, but acknowledged significant obstacles remain in boosting production. 'The more sophisticated the missile, the harder it is to manufacture,' he explained. These missiles are pricey, with each costing several million dollars, and the U.S. often launches two interceptors per detected threat. According to Navy data, since the war began last year, the cost of interceptions by American ships against Iranian and Houthi missiles and drones has reached $1.8 billion. A U.S. congressional source expressed frustration, stating, 'These are very expensive munitions to shoot down subpar Houthi targets,' noting the significantly lower production costs for Iranian missiles and drones. 'Each interceptor takes months to replace at a very high cost.' U.S. sources also voiced concerns about the Pentagon's ability to replenish its stocks as quickly as they're depleted. Adding to this strain is the extensive military assistance the U.S. is channeling to Ukraine, embroiled in a protracted conflict with Russia for over two and a half years. 'The U.S. hasn't developed a defense industrial base designed for large-scale attrition wars in both Europe and the Middle East while maintaining readiness standards,' remarked Elias Youssef, a security researcher at the Stimson Center in Washington. 'These are prolonged conflicts not accounted for in U.S. security planning.' RTX, the company developing Standard missiles, can produce several hundred annually. However, not all are destined for the U.S., as the company serves 14 other countries. As part of the 'arms economy,' during the Iranian attack on October 1, the U.S. and the Israeli Defense Forces sometimes refrained from intercepting certain missiles if they weren't targeting sensitive areas. Deployment of the THAAD air defense system to Israel is reportedly linked to concerns about the Standard missile shortage, as THAAD uses different missiles. The Pentagon has also sent additional Patriot batteries to the Middle East, despite their own limitations, as they are also being dispatched to Ukraine. American sources and commentators have warned that the rapid depletion rate of missiles could leave the U.S. 'more exposed' to potential conflicts in the Pacific, where concerns over China's aggressive behavior are rising. 'We've depleted a year's worth of Standard missiles, meant to bolster our defenses against China,' Mark Montgomery, a former U.S. Navy admiral and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the newspaper. Ynet analyst Ron Ben-Yishai noted that the agreement with the U.S. to deploy the THAAD air defense system in Israel stemmed as much from American constraints as from Israeli needs. IDF requires additional American interceptors and launchers to counter potential massive Iranian missile barrages. In such scenarios, the more missiles launched in a single or dual salvo to overwhelm defense systems, the more interceptors, launchers, and radars are required. Israel has multiple layers of interceptor missile systems. At the top is the Arrow 3 system, targeting missiles hundreds of miles outside the atmosphere. Below it is Arrow 2, intercepting missiles near the atmospheric boundary, over 62 miles away. Further below is David's Sling, designed for defense against long-range missiles within the atmosphere. The lowest layer is Iron Dome, providing localized protection and intercepting short-range missiles within about 62 miles.

Bloch, a resident of Mevo Horon, was expecting his first child and is survived by his wife Sapir, who is in the eighth month of her pregnancy; he also is survived by his parents and 7 siblings. Yedidia studied at Yeshivat Chitzim in Itamar in the northern West Bank, served in the Paratroopers Brigade and also fought in the 2014 Gaza War known as Operation Protective Edge. He continued his contribution to the IDF in the reserves, and in the current war he fought in Gaza and on the northern front as part of maneuvers in Lebanon. He was seriously injured last week in a battle in southern Lebanon, and after a long struggle in the Rambam Hospital he died Tuesday from his injuries. His family describes a man whose life was full of love for the country, generosity of heart and a genuine connection to every person he met. 'He was a devoted friend, with a big heart and always ready to help others, and a figure admired by all his nephews and nieces,' said a relative. His family donated his organs in order to save others. 'Someone asked me today what the name Yedidia means - and it is enough to see the light on your face to feel your friendship. Our beloved nephew and hero, the light of his eyes, the light of his heart,' Yedidia's aunt, Naomi, said in tribute to him. Yedidia's friend, Omri, wrote: 'Seven years ago when I was hiking the Israel Trail with my friend Assi, we arrived in the evening before sunset at Mevo Horon in the Latrun area. When we arrived we were so hungry and we met people told us that there was a pizzeria at the entrance of the community. Most of all I remember the reception of Yedidia when we met him there. He took our invitation, and he came to sit with us. I later found out that he served together with one of my best childhood friends and I knew at that moment that I had met a special person.' 'He was such a handsome man, blond, tall, with bright eyes. A light-hearted, funny guy and a smiling and happy person, and just as beautiful on the inside,' wrote Omri. 'I will never forget how when we came to pay him for the pizza, he simply said that it was on him. This kindness moved me so much at that moment. I thought about what a privilege it is to meet such kind people in a way that simply gives from the heart. Yedidia Bloch, you are the beautiful Israeli. This is how I will remember you as a man and a dear friend, a man of giving, laughter and true love. I will tell your child about you as soon as he grows up - so that he knows what a special and kind man his father was.' Nissan, another friend of Yedidia, wrote: 'In October 2017, I started studying, and on the first day I saw that I and another handsome blond guy with the only knitted kippa wearers. We immediately connected and were best friends for our college years. Always smiling, never angry and looking only to help and donate. For a whole year I followed every report and names of fallen soldiers in anxiety. For five days, we hoped but unfortunately sometimes God says no. You are now close to the throne of honor. Rest in peace friend.' Yisrael Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, where Mevo Horon is located, eulogized the fallen soldier. 'All these days we prayed for Yedidia. He went into battle with self-sacrifice and lived a noble life, and thus he fought and died for the sake of the people of Israel and complete victory. Thanks to him, the people of Israel will overcome and win.' Earlier on Tuesday, the names of four soldiers killed in battle in Jabaliya in northern Gaza were announced: Captain Yehonatan (Joni) Keren, 22; Staff Sergeant Nisim Meytal,20; Staff Sergeant Aviv Gilboa, 21; and Staff Sergeant Naor Haimov; 22.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkotpa0ejx	2024-10-29T13:43:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/29/yk14132071/yk14132071_1_67_710_400_0_small.jpg

From school teacher to international terrorist - Meet Hezbollah's...	He served as the Iranian proxy's number 2 for 34 years, and now Naim Qassem gets his 15 minutes of fame as head of the terror group, officially replacing Nasrallah; He is a Hezbollah co-founder and is also a former high school teacher Hezbollah officially named Naim Qassem as its new secretary-general on Tuesday. For 34 years, Qassem served as the deputy under the recently assassinated Hassan Nasrallah and his predecessor Abbas al-Musawi. Now, he steps into the limelight and into the thick of the conflict. Qassem wasn't the first pick to succeed Nasrallah. However, following the assassination of Hashem Safieddine, who was set to be the next leader, Qassem emerged as the natural choice among the surviving top brass. Since the assassination of Nasrallah in late September, Qassem has delivered three speeches for Hezbollah. His initial speech seemed unpolished; he appeared nervous, sweated a lot, and the background hinted he was in hiding. His third speech showed improvement, possibly due to feedback on his earlier appearances. In his latest address, Qassem declared: 'We are no longer in the phase of 'support' for Gaza but in direct confrontation with an Israeli war against us.' He claimed this shift began with the operation to blow up pagers in Lebanon. He insisted the organization is still operational and promised a new Secretary-General would be appointed soon. It's unclear if he knew then that he would assume the role. Naim Qassem has been a key figure in the terrorist organization for decades. Born in 1953 in the Al-Basta al-Tahta area of Beirut, his family hails from the Shiite-majority village of Qafar Fila in southern Lebanon. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, he is married with six children. Qassem has held the position of Deputy Secretary-General since 1991, during the tenure of former Secretary-General Abbas al-Moussawi, who was assassinated in 1992 by Israel. He remained in the role after Nasrallah's appointment. He began his political career with the Shiite Amal Movement in Lebanon, founded in 1974, and left in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution. Qassem participated in the meetings that led to Hezbollah's formation in 1982 and became one of its prominent spokesmen. He also served as the general coordinator for Hezbollah's parliamentary election campaigns since the organization first ran in 1992. Qassem studied under Shiite scholars in Lebanon while pursuing academic studies at the University of Lebanon in 1971, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry. He completed his master's degree in chemistry in 1977. Subsequently, Qassem worked as a high school teacher for six years. He helped establish the 'Lebanese Union of Muslim Students' during his university years to spread Islamic ideas in the 1970s. Over the years, he also served on Hezbollah's Shura Council. In 2005, he authored a book on Hezbollah's history, offering a rare glimpse into the organization. About six years ago, the U.S. government designated Qassem as an 'international terrorist,' subjecting him to economic and business sanctions. Earlier this month, a report from the Emirates, based on an Iranian source, claimed Qassem fled to Iran at the start of October, fearing assassination by Israel. According to the unverified report, he has been in Tehran since October 5. It was also alleged that he left Lebanon on an Iranian plane, accompanied by Abbas Araghchi, Tehran's foreign minister, first to Syria and then to Iran. The source claimed Qassem's last two speeches were actually delivered from Khamenei's homeland. Report: Shura Council made the decision - not Tehran The London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat published an article about Hezbollah's Shura Council, suggesting that if it managed to convene, it indicates – according to sources close to the organization – that the council has regrouped after significant setbacks and can now hold meetings of senior Hezbollah leaders despite security risks. It was also suggested that if the council convened, it shows Tehran did not take over Hezbollah's political and military leadership after Nasrallah's assassination, contrary to rumors. The paper noted that Hezbollah's organizational structure is divided into three main frameworks: The first—the Secretary-General, who holds extensive powers The second—the Shura Council, whose members head four organizational councils: the Jihad Council, the Legal Council, the Governmental and Parliamentary Work Council, and the Political Council The third—the Executive Council (formerly led by Safi al-Din before his assassination). The Executive Council is Hezbollah's core, from which most organizational units branch out. Among the councils, the Shura Council is the most important. The Shura Council includes seven members: the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, who is also the Chairman of the Shura Council, the Deputy Secretary-General of Hezbollah—Head of the Legal Council Mohammad Yazbak, Head of the Political Council Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid, Head of the Executive Council—recently assassinated—Hashem Saffiedine, the political assistant to the Hezbollah Secretary-General Hussein Khalil, the head of the parliamentary branch and leader of Hezbollah's party in the Lebanese parliament, 'Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc' (Hezbollah's political arm), Mohammad Raad. With Qassem's appointment, two positions remain vacant in the Shura Council: the Deputy Secretary-General and Chairman of the Executive Council. Qassem Kassir, a political researcher interviewed by the newspaper, said a Deputy Secretary-General has not yet been appointed and that it is a crucial appointment, 'a message from within and outside that Hezbollah is active and monitoring affairs.' Other sources interviewed did not rule out that even if a deputy to the new Secretary-General is appointed, his identity will not be disclosed, as he would become a strategic target for Israel, similar to Naim Qassem, who wants Hezbollah to remain leaderless.

GOP works to turn out pro-Trump Jewish voters in swing states to ...	The door-to-door outreach to Jewish voters with a history of backing Republicans is part of a new effort the Republican Jewish Coalition is undertaking this year in five presidential battleground states in hopes of boosting Trump Rachel Weinberg calls herself a religious Jew first, then a proud American. She said she had only one choice for president: Donald Trump. 'I don’t like everything he says,' the 72-year-old retired preschool teacher from Michigan said after volunteer canvassers for the Republican Jewish Coalition knocked on her door Sunday. 'But I vote for Israel. It is our life. I support Israel. Trump supports Israel with his mouth and his actions.' Weinberg’s home in West Bloomfield, in vote-rich Oakland County, was among more than 20 that the Republican Jewish Coalition was visiting that morning. She has voted for Trump in previous elections as well. The door-to-door outreach to Jewish voters with a history of backing Republicans is part of a new effort the group is undertaking this year in five presidential battleground states in hopes of boosting Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. Although surveys show that Jews vote decidedly Democratic, the Republican Jewish Coalition is hoping that the door-knocking will peel off enough votes to make a difference in an election year when the war between Israel and Hamas has stoked debate and provoked division. About 7 in 10 Jewish voters nationally backed Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, while about 3 in 10 backed Trump that year, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping electorate survey. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. Biden carried Michigan in 2020 by fewer than 155,000 votes out of roughly 5.5 million cast. Although Jewish voters account for only 2% of the state’s voters, the 15,000 new Jewish Republican voters the coalition has identified since the 2020 election — out of roughly 120,000 Jewish voters in the state — could make an impact in what is shaping up to be a very close race, said Sam Markstein, an RJC spokesperson. The Republican Jewish Coalition’s targeting is very specific in Michigan, as it is in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Here, its work is centered in Oakland County, the state’s second most populous county, with 1.3 million people just northwest of Detroit. It focuses on the upper-middle-class suburbs of Farmington Hills, Oak Park, Southfield, and West Bloomfield — the township with the state’s largest Jewish population, where Israeli flags hang in some front windows. Biden defeated Trump in 2020, 66% to 33%, in the West Bloomfield Township precinct where 82-year-old David Cuttner and 22-year-old Noam Nedivi were canvassing for the coalition on Sunday. The margin was not far off the national trend. The coalition’s robust effort is aimed at chipping away at Democrats’ advantages in this voting bloc. 'This includes direct mail, social, and digital, all hyper-targeted to the Jewish community. And it’s going to be a full thrust, the largest investment ever to turn out Jewish voters for Republicans,' Markstein said. The Republican Jewish Coalition has purchased $15 million in advertising in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. But it’s the $5 million it has committed to door-to-door outreach that is new for this election, chiefly its investment in voter data aimed at more efficiently identifying potential Trump supporters. Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said in a statement that Jewish voters are a key part of a winning Democratic coalition. 'Kamala Harris shares the views and values of the majority of American Jews, while Donald Trump threatens and denigrates us, trafficks in antisemitic rhetoric, aligns with dangerous extremists, and aspires to be a dictator on day one,' Soifer said. Tensions have been high since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took 250 people hostage. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the subsequent fighting, according to Gaza health officials. Republicans were more likely than Democrats to be supportive of Israel, while Democrats were more likely to be critical, a survey by the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found in September. The fighting has intensified the focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which has provided at least $17.9 billion in military aid since the war began. Many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests in cities and college campuses have made them feel unsafe. Nedivi, who was canvassing Sunday, said he had been a victim of antisemitism at the Michigan college he attends. Zeke Aharonov had an alternative message for his fellow observant Jews after standing in a line of more than 200 people to cast his early vote at the West Bloomfield library Sunday. 'As Jews, we must be attentive to fascism and to fight it,' the 26-year-old cybersecurity tech said as he left the library. 'And our way of fighting fascism is to vote against Donald Trump.'

Pentagon reassigns worker who leaked Iran attack plans to role wi...	Ariane Tabatabai to be moved to a position overseeing education and training within the Defense Secretary’s office; Pentagon still denies she was the leaker The Pentagon has reassigned Ariane Tabatabai, whose name has been linked to a leak of intelligence documents regarding Israel’s strike plans on Iran, to a role with significantly reduced access to intelligence and classified military plans. Although the Pentagon denied Tabatabai’s involvement in the leak, given her previous connections to Iran, it decided to move her to a position overseeing education and training within the Defense Secretary’s office. Tabatabai served as the head of the Office of Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a role that gave her unique access to high-level classified intelligence and information on nearly all U.S. covert operations. Her new position, by contrast, provides significantly limited access to intelligence and classified operational plans. Independent of the leak controversy, some Republican members of Congress have spent the past year pushing to revoke Tabatabai’s security clearance over reported ties to Tehran. Sky News Arabic reported a week ago that Tabatabai was the source of the leaked documents, which covered preparations for an Israeli strike on Iran and were published prior to the operation’s launch. Pentagon spokesperson Patrick Ryder denied these reports, stating that the Pentagon is investigating the matter and coordinating with Israel. To date, the source of the leak has not been identified. Tabatabai, an American of Iranian descent, previously held access to highly classified information. She formerly worked with Robert Malley, President Joe Biden’s ex-special envoy for Iran, who was dismissed about a year ago over improper connections with the Islamic Republic.

Migrant workers in Lebanon left stranded as war with Israel conti...	Caregiving remains a lifeline for Middle Eastern households, but these migrant workers battle loneliness, exploitation and insufficient protections amid regional crises; Home care in Israel is also heavily dependent on foreign workers In Lebanon, a country facing widespread destruction and displacement caused by the conflict with Israel, migrant caregivers are among the most vulnerable populations. Bram Frouws, director of the Mixed Migration Centre, highlighted the significant vulnerability of migrant care workers in Lebanon amid the ongoing conflict. 'Since the escalation of the war began, many employers fled the country or fled north, and left their migrant workers without pay, shelter, or food, and many were left stranded,' he said. 'Many migrant workers have now been left sleeping on the streets, with no access to basic necessities or humanitarian aid. Shelters often only permit entry for Lebanese citizens.' The immigration status of migrant workers in Lebanon is tied to the individual employer, Frouws explained, which opens up Lebanon’s 175,000 migrant workers to exploitation and abuse even during peacetime. Now, that vulnerability has been amplified. Many of these migrant workers don’t have access to their passports, which are held by the employers. 'Lacking financial resources and documentation really makes it near impossible to escape,' Frouws said. Language barriers, restricted mobility, limited social networks, and discrimination all exacerbate the situation. Frouws expressed concern that migrant workers are being left out of government and humanitarian responses to the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon. 'This is often the case with migrants who are caught up in a sudden conflict,' he said. October 29 marks the International Day of Care and Support, a day dedicated to recognizing and raising awareness about the vital role of caregivers. The UN established the day to spark conversations about the importance of care work, both paid and unpaid, which serves as the backbone of society and ensures that individuals and systems can thrive and function smoothly. Those conversations have a special significance in the Middle East, which relies heavily on migrant domestic workers to provide care to elderly and disabled individuals. Despite the critical contributions of migrant caregivers in Middle Eastern households, most still face unfair and unsafe working conditions, including long hours, minimal rest time, and vulnerability to exploitation. Legal protections and social safeguards for these caregivers are often inadequate or poorly enforced. Home care in Israel is also heavily dependent on foreign workers. As of the end of 2023, more than 75,000 foreign caregivers were working in Israel, according to data from the Population and Immigration Authority. The caregivers come from a diverse range of countries, with the largest groups hailing from the Philippines (26,673), India (19,924), and Uzbekistan (12,335). Many also come from Moldova, Sri Lanka, and Ukraine. About 60,000 of the workers have documents to work in Israel, and the other 15,000 do not. Meytal Russo, deputy executive director of Kav LaOved, an Israeli nonprofit dedicated to securing equal labor rights for all workers, explains that foreign caregivers in Israel face a complex and challenging bureaucracy. 'About 95% to 99% are coming with legal documentation, allowing them to stay here for five years and three months,' Russo said. That period applies to all foreign workers, but caregivers can apply to extend their stay to continue to serve the same elderly or disabled patient they had been caring for. 'There is a lot of bureaucracy involved in that,' Russo said. 'Caregivers are required to be available 24 hours a day, six days a week and are obliged to stay at the patient’s home,' she said. These workers receive only minimum wage without overtime pay and are excluded from the law mandating breaks. 'This exclusion stems from a Supreme Court decision that ruled it is impossible to quantify a caregiver’s rest time due to the nature of their work,' Russo explained. She also raised concerns about the high brokerage fees paid by caregivers to come to Israel. 'Many workers pay between $7,000 and $30,000 in fees, creating significant financial burdens,' she said, noting that most workers still rely on private work placement agencies despite government attempts to regulate the process through bilateral agreements. 'The situation remains business to business, with undocumented payments being made to private agencies abroad and sometimes to agencies within Israel.' The vast majority of migrant caregivers in Israel are women, and these female caregivers face substantial risks of sexual harassment and assault, Russo said. Often the perpetrator is a patient with dementia or one of the patient’s family members. 'The vulnerability of a migrant woman working in a home is very high,' Russo explained. Physical demands of the work also add to caregivers’ challenges, with many experiencing orthopedic issues due to heavy lifting and inadequate professional support. Living in a patient’s private home and developing a relationship with the patient and the family can also be challenging. 'There is a wide spectrum, with some very good relationships and others that are quite bad,' Russo said. All these challenges can lead migrant caregivers to experience burnout. 'If you are burnt out in a regular job, you can find another one,' Russo said. 'But here, you’re tied to the same employer, which creates a dangerous situation for both the caregiver and the patient.' Migrant caregiving is especially widespread in Gulf Cooperation Council countries. According to Migrant-Rights.org, a GCC-based advocacy organization focused on advancing migrant workers’ rights, over 90% of Kuwaiti households employ migrant domestic workers. The 620,000 migrant domestic workers in Kuwait represent more than 22% of the country’s total workforce. These workers often face significant disparities in wages and working conditions. In Bahrain, migrant domestic workers account for 10% of the entire workforce and 37% of the female workforce. Migrant workers dominate the domestic work sector in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, making up 95% of all domestic workers and personal assistants. About 20% of all foreign workers in the UAE perform domestic work. Around 96% of Emirati families hire domestic workers to care for their children. These 750,000 or so workers perform an estimated 80% of parental duties, outnumbering family members in 22% of Emirati households. Domestic workers constitute about 20% of the total expatriate workforce in the country. Domestic workers in Saudi Arabia face particularly long hours, averaging 63.7 hours per week – the second-highest rate globally. Similarly, in Qatar, domestic workers average 60 hours of work per week. Wages remain a significant issue for migrant domestic workers. In Qatar, domestic workers earn less than 30% of the average national wage, while in Kuwait, their earnings are under 30% of the average national wage. The minimum monthly wage for domestic workers in Kuwait is $147, but enforcement mechanisms to guarantee this payment are insufficient. In Saudi Arabia, domestic workers from Sri Lanka earn just 20% of the private sector’s minimum wage, receiving approximately $80-$100 per month. Santhosh, a 35-year-old caregiver from India, came to Israel last year. 'My patient is in very good condition and very supportive to me, so I am happy to be here,' he said. But he quietly added that he found the relentless nature of the job and the distance from his family to be challenging. 'It’s very lonely,' Santhosh said. 'Facebook and WhatsApp help, but I miss my family. I feel a constant loneliness.' Despite the difficulty, he expressed a sense of determination. 'I want to continue working, and I’m grateful for the opportunity,' he said. For a caregiver from the Philippines who asked to remain anonymous, the hardest part of the job is the emotional isolation. 'I was prepared for hard work, and I do it to support my family,' she said. 'But here, I became very lonely.' 'I feel like my whole life is online, and the rest is just me working. Nothing else,' she said. -This article is written by Veronica Neifakh and reprinted with permission from The Media Line Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1119gq0ljg	2024-10-29T10:06:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/29/SyLNXiRxye/SyLNXiRxye_0_0_3000_2065_0_small.jpg

Defense Ministry reports 12,000 soldiers injured since start of G...	Ministry's Rehabilitation Division reports at least 900 of injuries took place in Lebanon since start of IDF ground operation in region; Male reservist soldiers highest injured demographic Approximately 12,000 IDF soldiers and security force personnel wounded since the start of the Gaza war have been admitted to the Defense Ministry’s Rehabilitation Division, including 910 injured who were evacuated to hospitals in the north since the beginning of the military’s ground operation in Lebanon on October 1. Of these, 140 have already been registered to the Rehabilitation Division, marking a 50% increase compared to security forces personnel wounded in the north last month who requested continued treatment. The remaining wounded, classified as lightly injured, returned to service after receiving medical care. Around 1,500 individuals have been wounded twice over the course of the year-long ongoing war. Notably, IDF statistics record 5,184 wounded since the start of the war, though they don’t account for non-military security personnel, such as Shin Bet operatives, police officers, alert squad members and those wounded in routine incidents. The average annual cost for treatment and financial support for a wounded soldier is estimated at approximately 150,000 shekels ($40,000) per person. The Rehabilitation Division's budget, which stood at 5.4 billion shekels (about $1.5 billion) before October 7, 2023, has increased to 7.3 billion shekels (about $2 billion). However, division head Limor Luria warns that further budget increases are needed to provide adequate care. 'We need budgetary support,' she said on Tuesday. 'We've reached out to the Finance Ministry to help us address the high number of casualties, which is expected to grow in the coming years, and provide them with optimal care.' Men comprise 93% of the wounded; the percentage of women in the division remains at 7%, but the nature of injuries has evolved and the number of female combatants has increased. Of the wounded, 66% are reservists, 51% are aged 18-30 and approximately 8,500 (66%) face physical injuries. Among them, 14% are classified with moderate-to-severe injuries, including 377 with head injuries, of which 23 required skull reconstruction using a 3D printer. Eye injuries impacted 308 individuals, with 12 losing vision and needing prosthetics. Additionally, 104 suffered spinal injuries and roughly 60 had limb amputations requiring advanced prosthetic adaptations, five of whom required fittings abroad. A total of 5,200 (43%) developed psychological response conditions including anxiety, depression, adjustment issues and PTSD. The division anticipates the number will rise. 'It’s still early to gauge the extent of psychological injuries as these effects solidify over time,' Luria added. Each month, the division admits around 1,000 new wounded personnel, alongside roughly 500 additional recognition requests for past incidents. The number of individuals treated by the division has grown by 20% in a year, reaching approximately 74,000. The Rehabilitation Division estimates there will be around 100,000 disabled IDF veterans by 2030, 50% of whom will be dealing with psychological trauma. As of October 6, 2023, elderly disabled IDF veterans constituted about 50% of all disabled veterans. This dynamic has shifted considerably with the intake of younger wounded personnel, prompting the division to tailor support for educational reintegration, vocational training and occupational rehabilitation for the wounded. The Rehabilitation Division said it is continuing its 'rehabilitation before bureaucracy' policy, providing immediate medical and psychological care for all injured personnel while postponing medical evaluations for a year. Currently, 22,000 individuals dealing with psychological challenges are receiving support through various frameworks: 500 therapists have been recruited and 10 rehabilitation facilities have been established across the country. These offer body-mind workshops, discussion circles and varied agricultural activities. In the future, family-oriented activities will also be held at these locations. Additionally, PPS (primary psychological support) mobile units have been set up to provide immediate mental health aid and three care homes have been opened specifically for war-wounded personnel. IDF Disabled Veterans Organization Chairman Idan Kliman commented on the latest data, saying: 'At this time, when the State of Israel has a moral and ethical debt to wounded IDF soldiers who have sacrificed, and continue to sacrifice, their bodies and minds for the country’s survival, the Israeli government has decided to harm these soldiers in the 2025 Economic Arrangements Law by freezing their compensation for injuries sustained in service.' 'This decision continues the government’s total disregard for wounded IDF veterans, severely violating agreements with the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization and government resolutions, directly hindering the rehabilitation of our heroes and undermining national resilience,' he added.

Erdogan says Turkey aims to have 'Steel Dome' air defense system	President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Turkey aimed to have its own 'Steel Dome' multi-layered air defense system soon, adding that Ankara would also increase its long-range missile capabilities. NATO member Turkey has in recent years significantly reduced its dependence on external suppliers of defense equipment. It has become a leading manufacturer of armed drones for the global market and produces much of its own defense needs at home. Speaking at a ceremony in Ankara to inaugurate the home-made Gokbey helicopter for use by the gendarmerie at the headquarters of the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS), which was targeted by a deadly Kurdish militant attack last week, Erdogan likened the 'Steel Dome' to Israel's famed Iron Dome. 'It is understood much better now how vitally important our multi-layered air defense systems are for our security. If they (Israel) have an 'Iron Dome', we will have a 'Steel Dome'. We won't look at them and say 'why don't we have this',' Erdogan said, without giving a specific timeline. 'We will increase our long-range missile capabilities during this period too,' he added, saying Turkey would 'not rest' until it achieved full independence in the defense industry.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkp2wkagke	2024-10-29T07:41:38-07:00

New satellite images from Iran: Attack damaged Iran Revolutionary...	New footage following Israel's retaliatory strike on Iranian territory reveals damage to the Shahroud base, where the IRGC launches satellites into space; Iran is 'still assessing the damage' Israel’s attack on Iran over the weekend likely damaged a base run by the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard that builds ballistic missiles and launches rockets as part of its own space program, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press on Tuesday showed. The damage at the base in Shahroud raises new questions about the early Saturday attack, which took place in an area previously unacknowledged by Tehran and which involved the IRGC, a powerful force within Iran’s theocracy that so far has remained silent about any possible damage it suffered from the retaliatory strike. Iran only has identified Israeli attacks as taking place in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces — not in rural Semnan province where the base is located. It also potentially further restrains the Guard’s ability to manufacture the solid-fuel ballistic missiles it needs to stockpile as a deterrent against Israel. Tehran long has relied on that arsenal as it cannot purchase the advanced Western weapons that Israel and Tehran’s Gulf Arab neighbors have armed themselves with over the years, particularly from the United States. Satellite photos earlier analyzed by the AP of two military bases near Tehran also targeted by Israel show that sites there that Iran uses in its ballistic missile manufacturing have been destroyed, further squeezing its program. 'We don’t know if Iranian production has been crippled as some people are saying or just damaged,' said Fabian Hinz, a missile expert and research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who studies Iran. 'We’ve seen enough imagery to show there’s an impact.' Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The IDF declined to answer questions from the AP, but sent a previous statement acknowledging it targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities' in the attack. Images show major building at Shahroud base destroyed High-resolution satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken for and analyzed by the AP showed the damage at the Guard’s Shahroud Space Center in Semnan, some 370 kilometers (230 miles) northeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Semnan also hosts the Imam Khomeini Space Center, which is used by Iran’s civilian space program. The images showed a central, major building at the Shahroud Space Center had been destroyed, the shadow of its still-standing frame seen in the image taken Tuesday morning. Vehicles could be seen gathered around the site, likely from officials inspecting the damage, with more cars than normal parked at the site’s main gate nearby. Three small buildings just to the south of the main structure also appeared to be damaged. Iran has been constructing new buildings at the base in recent months. Another hangar to the northeast of the main building also appeared to have been damaged. Iran has not acknowledged any attack at Shahroud. However, given the damage done to multiple structures, it suggested the Israeli attack included pinpoint strikes on the base. Low-resolution images since the attack showed signs of damage at the site not seen before the assault — further pointing to Israeli missile strikes as being the culprit. 'We can’t 100% exclude the possibility it’s something else, but it’s almost certain this building got damaged because of an Israeli attack,' Hinz said. Given that the large building had been surrounded by earthen berms, that suggests it handled high explosives, said Hinz, who long has studied the site. That central site likely deals with solid propellant mixing and casting operations, he added. Large boxes next to the building likely are missile motor crates as well, Hinz said. Their sizes suggest they could be used for Iran’s Kheibar Shekan ballistic missile and the Fattah 1, a missile that Iran has claimed is able to reach Mach 15 — which is 15 times the speed of sound. Both have been used in Iran’s attacks on Israel during the Israel-Hamas war and the later ground invasion of Lebanon. The strike at Shahroud, coupled with others across the country, likely have put more pressure on Iran’s theocracy, particularly as it assesses the damage to its main weapon arsenal and tries to downplay the attack. 'Due to preparedness and vigilance of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s armed forces, and timely reaction by the country’s air defense, limited damage was caused to some of the points hit,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi claimed in a meeting with foreign diplomats Tuesday in Tehran. 'Necessary measures were taken immediately to restore the damaged equipment to operational state.' US worries Guard’s space program a cover for missile research A short distance from the destroyed buildings sits a concrete launch pad used by the Guard, which has conducted a series of successful missions putting satellites into space using mobile launchers. The Guard, which answers only to 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, revealed its secret space program back in 2020. The U.S. intelligence community’s 2024 worldwide threat assessment said Iran’s continued development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline to produce' an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. Parchin, one of the two military bases near Tehran targeted by Israel, saw a building linked to that program destroyed. 'Like with Iran’s nuclear program, you don’t build the system itself, you build all the technology under cover of a civilian program,' Hinz said. Then, Iran could make the decision to pursue the weapon — or use its knowledge as a bargaining chip with the West over international sanctions. But for now, the satellite photos suggest Iran is still trying to assess the aftermath of Israel’s attack. 'The picture that is emerging is one of significant damage to Iranian air defenses as well as missile launch facilities, both of which would be intended to show the Iranians that they are vulnerable to further strikes if they attempt retaliation,' an analysis published Monday by two experts at Britain’s Royal United Services Institute said.

Within walking distance: Six bereaved families mourn fallen soldi...	Grieving Jerusalem families, friends and comrades gather at the capital to mourn the losses of fallen soldiers from the city; these are their stories The homes of families mourning their loved ones killed in the war are easy to find. Buildings draped in Israeli flags with condolence notices at the entrance have become part of the landscape. Dozens of bereaved families across the country are sitting shiva, a number of them in Jerusalem are located just minutes from each other. Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg A mourning tent has been set up near the home of Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, who was killed in a battle in southern Lebanon. Rows of Israeli flags guide visitors there, paying respects to the deceased and marking the way. As in his life, Captain (res.) Goldberg's mourning tent is filled with a diverse crowd of people. High school students alongside older adults and female soldiers mingling among ultra-Orthodox men, all share in the painful space. One by one, the mourners shared reflections of him: a devoted educator, a gifted musician, a soldier who never missed a day of service and a cantor during the Jewish High Holidays. He was a kollel head, rabbi, teacher, father — a world. 'It’s just so him,' said his widow, Rachel, when visitors from Kibbutz Ginosar described his usual leading of Yom Kippur prayers in their kibbutz, sharing a voice message he sent with a Rosh Hashanah blessing after being unable to join them in the past holiday. 'That’s exactly who he was — he cared about everyone with all his heart.' Rabbi Goldberg left his eight children behind. 'Our father lived a life for the nation,' said his eldest son, Yehuda. 'His life was dedicated to the people of Israel, without ever considering what would be most comfortable for him. Wherever Israel needed him, that’s where he wanted to be.' Rabbi Goldberg, who fell at 43, continued serving in the reserves as both a soldier and military rabbi even after he was exempt. His absence was already felt over the past year — in his classroom, in the projects he led and most deeply, at home. 'This year prepared us to say goodbye,' Yehuda added. 'He wasn’t home often, both with us and with his students. Both God and our father made us ready for it an advance.' Warrant Officer (res.) Shmuel Harari A short walk away, another building bears the same painful front. The parents, widow and three children of Warrant Officer (res.) Shmuel Harari, who fell in Lebanon, are gathered at the widow Anna’s parents' home. Seventeen years ago, Shmuel made aliyah, enlisted in the IDF, started a family and stayed on for reserve duty. His parents and siblings have flown in from the United States to sit shiva with his wife, who lives in Safed and chose to mourn at her parents’ home in Jerusalem. 'He made aliyah at 17,' his brother Aivy said. 'He finished high school and immediately came to spend a year in a yeshiva in Israel, after which he enlisted and stayed here. Our parents really wanted him to stay in the United States; our dad wanted him to go to university and earn a decent living, but it wasn’t even a consideration for him.' Aivy shared that Shmuel 'was very eager to come to Israel. For years before he finished high school, he said he would make aliyah. He was very Zionistic despite our parents’ worry. He got married and lived in Safed because that’s where his wife studied medicine and she relocated to Jerusalem during the height of the war while he spent most of the year in reserve duty.' Last summer, the family gathered for what would become an unexpected farewell meeting. 'He finished his reserve duty in the summer,' Aivy recounted. 'We had a great time together; we were so happy to meet up. He delayed his return to work for a whole month to be with us and then, after the fighting began in Lebanon, he was called back. That’s how it ended.' Sergeant Hillel Ovadia Not far from there, a large mourning tent is also being set up beneath the family home of Sergeant Hillel Ovadia, filled with many mourners. Hillel, 22, who fell in Jabalia, was an Armored Corps soldier and a trainee in the tank commander course in the 196th Battalion, having graduated from the pre-military yeshiva in Brukhin. One by one, friends from his yeshiva and the military entered the tent to share stories about the young man who was always cheerful. In the yeshiva, he would deeply engage in study for hours; when it rained, he would lead joyous dances outside and would set the tone for serious learning after returning to the study hall. Sergeant Major (Res.) Gilad Elmalich Far from there, in northern Jerusalem, the family of Sergeant Major (Res.) Gilad Elmalich, sits shiva. His parents, brother, widow and children gather to mourn. 'Gilad wasn’t home much this year,' said his widow, Shir. 'He knew he would be there whenever the Israeli people needed him. He never thought of backing down or asking not to participate in any of the missions.' 'It was about his connection to the Torah and the values he believed in so strongly,' she added. 'Everyone felt he was their best friend. He felt a timeless connection to generations of the Jewish people, and always acted from that strength. He leaped into every mission. He volunteered with Holocaust survivors, always helping and all of it stemmed from his connection to the Torah.' First Sergeant Yaakov Hillel In Jerusalem’s Neve Yaakov neighborhood, among knitted kippahs and notices against conscription to the IDF on bulletin boards, shopping centers and yeshivas, sits the shiva for First Sergeant Yaakov Hillel, 21, a Golani Brigade soldier who fell in Lebanon. Yaakov came from a Haredi family and there is a notable presence of yeshiva students and rabbis at the shiva at his home, along with his friends and military commanders. His father, Rabbi Chaim Hillel, a well-known educator in the Haredi community, sees no contradiction between his son’s life path and that of his other siblings and family members. 'It wasn’t a different path,' Rabbi Hillel says. 'It was his own way. Yaakov was the third child among ten sons and daughters, all learning in Haredi frameworks. His brothers study in yeshiva,' the father said, 'and he wanted to enlist. He wasn’t raised to do so, but that was his choice. He was a man of truth first and foremost; he paved a genuine path and when he saw what was right for him, he wasn’t concerned about what others would say. That turly characterized him.' 'One of the things that gives us the greatest comfort is that we always walked alongside him,' the father continued. 'This was a path he forged with difficulty and effort, due to the different background he had compared to most soldiers. He was filled with a sense of mission and we were always by his side.' Captain (res.) Alon Safrai The family of Captain (res.) Alon Safrai, a Jerusalem resident, is also sitting shiva nearby. Safrai, 28, was a medical student — and wasn’t obligated to serve in the reserves. 'Alon was a student for whom everything came so easily; he was a star, and everything just flowed for him,' his classmate wrote. 'We envied him because he could study for a few hours for an exam and still get good grades without too much effort. Everyone loved him. He was such a friendly guy, so helpful and a good person. Of all people, he shouldn’t have had to go,' he added.

While Israel barred from Paris tradeshow French companies supply ...	One company provides a radar with a range of 170 kilometers (105 miles) to Guard's naval vessel while nine others supply Iran's energy sector While France banned Israeli security industry companies from participating in the Euronaval tradeshow in Paris in June, some of the 233 French companies that will take part in the event, were known to be licensed suppliers of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) naval vessels and the country's coast guard and nine companies were listed by Iran as authorized suppliers of its oil and energy industries. Some of the Iranian companies the French firms were doing business with, were under U.S.-imposed sanctions. The annual exhibition features hundreds of international companies that develop naval vessels and weapons and has always included numerous representatives of Israel's defense industries. Although the event is scheduled for June, preparations start many months in advance. An Israeli source said that France has become a symbol of left-wing embargoes on Israel, noting that French companies had asked President Emmanuel Macron to ban Israeli companies for commercial reasons behind the scenes. One French company provided a radar with a maximum range of over 170 kilometers (105 miles) that was installed on an IRGC ship. France said there was never any intention to ban Israeli companies from attending French tradeshows and the French government's position cannot be seen as a boycott of Israeli firms. 'Our support of Israel and its right to defend itself has always been unequivocal,' the Elysee Palace said. 'Proof if that is evident in our decision to continue to make components for the Iron Dome missile defense system.' The palace went on to say that while France has called for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon because it is the only way to stop the escalation and achieve regional stability and peace, it would be 'inconsistent to allow the promotion of weapons' used in those fronts, that was harming civilians.' Twelve Israeli companies were interested in exhibiting at the naval fair, and local participation will almost certainly be blocked from the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, the crown jewel of such exhibitions, should this negative trend continue.

Budget increase submitted by the government to parliament for approval includes an estimated 200% addition, government spokesperson tells local media Iran's government plans to raise its military budget by around 200%, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani was reported as saying by state media on Tuesday, after Iran and Israel exchanged attacks in recent months. The planned defense budget increase is part of a budget proposal that has been submitted by the government to parliament for approval. 'A considerable raise that amounts to 200% has been witnessed in the country's defense budget,' Mohajerani said, giving no further details. Iran and Israel have been trading missile salvoes for months, with Israel on Saturday striking Iran in retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage against Israel on Oct. 1, much of which Israel said was downed by its air defenses. Tehran said on Monday that it will 'use all available tools' to respond to Israel's weekend attack on military targets in Iran. Iran backs the Hezbollah terror group which is engaged in heavy fighting with IDF forces in Lebanon, and also the Hamas terror group, which is battling the IDF in the Gaza Strip.

One dead, at least three injured in northern Israel rocket strike	24-year-old Mohammed Naim was killed when a rocket hit his home in Tarshiha; IDF reports at least 50 munitions seen crossing from Lebanon toward the Galilee area; rocket marks direct hit in Ma'alot-Tarshiha home 24-year-old Mohammed Naim was killed and at three others were wounded after a missile hit Ma'alot-Tarshiha in Western Galilee, Magen David Adom (MDA) Director Eli Bin reported on Tuesday. Nai'm was critically hurt and later succumbed to his wounds sustained when a rocket made a direct hit on his home. 'It’s a complex scene; we saw extensive destruction in the house and began searching the area,' MDA medic Gilad Benhemo, who was present on the scene, recounted. 'We found an unconscious person who had no pulse and wasn’t breathing.' 'We performed a medical assessment, but his injuries were critical and we had to pronounce his death. MDA teams are providing on-site medical care to several individuals suffering from anxiety,' he added. The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported at least 50 projectiles were located crossing from Lebanon toward northern Israel’s Galilee region earlier on Tuesday. Meanwhile, as the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah continues, the Iran-backed terror group named Naim Qassem as the new head of the terror group after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in September. He was deputy secretary-general under Nasrallah since 1991. 'Based on the faith in Allah, our commitment to Islam and our dedication to its principles and purposes, Hezbollah, in accordance with its established mechanism, approves Naim Qassem as secretary-general,' the terror group said in a statement.

They’re still there, tortured and abused': freed hostage Mia rec...	Mia Schem speaks in an event held by Israel's New York consulate and tells of the moments after her kidnapping when she was held inside a cage with five other women who remain captives in Gaza Mia Schem, a former captive released as part of the first hostage deal with Hamas in November 2023, recalled her experiences in Gaza and the harsh conditions she endured. Speaking during a ceremony at the Israeli consulate in New York to commemorate the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the massacre Tuesday overnight, she spoke about the other women who are still held in Gaza. 'I was put in a cage with five young women; they’re still there, tortured and abused,' Schem said at the event. 'I was placed in a dark cage, with no air or light, only 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) high. Each of us had a brutal abduction story; we were wounded and shocked.' 'After 50 days, weak and injured, I was led to the tunnels. Two hours of walking with an armed terrorist in front and one behind, 60 meters (196 feet) underground. I was put in a cage with no light or air. In the cage, I met five young women, each with her own horrific abduction story.' 'We spent five days in that dark cage, with two armed guards switching shifts every 12 hours. I tried to encourage them and promised we’d be freed soon. We were wounded and shocked by what had happened to us. We were innocent young women only weeks earlier. On the fifth day, I was taken out. I managed to hug them and promised they’d be freed the next day, that we’d meet again in our homeland to pick up the pieces.' 'It’s been a year; I’m here physically, but my innocence was left in fields of blood and my heart remains captive in Gaza with five young women still held there, tortured and abused, with no air, in the depths of hell,' she added. 'I stand here before you today — no longer a child but a strong woman who won’t rest until everyone returns from those depths of hell.' Ayelet, the mother of hostage Yonatan Samrano whose body is still held in Gaza, spoke about her son’s abduction at the event. 'An UNRWA social worker kidnapped my son. This person, who worked in an organization meant to do good and alleviate human suffering, kidnapped my son. This UN worker took him after he was shot by terrorists. Today, we mark a year since the darkest, most haunted day since the founding of the Jewish state.' Her words come against the backdrop of a bill approved in the Knesset on Monday banning UNRWA’s activities in Israel. Around 600 guests attended the event, including Israeli-American Council (IAC) CEO Elan Carr, leaders of New York's Jewish community, bereaved families, foreign consuls general, social media influencers, journalists and more. In his speech, Israel's Consul General in New York Ofir Akunis, said, 'What Hamas intended on doing on that day was to destroy Israel. They aimed to commit genocide. As they wrote in their founding charter in 1987 — to destroy the State of Israel and build an Islamic state in its place. 'This wasn't the first massacre in our nation’s history. We've seen many since 1920. But this was certainly the most brutal. If anyone thinks the Jewish people will ever forget or forgive this, they're mistaken. If anyone thinks we'll apologize for defending ourselves, they're wrong.'

US blacklists firms tied to Iran, Pakistan weapons programs	The United States adds 26 companies from Pakistan, China, Egypt, and the UAE to a blacklist, citing support for missile and drone developments and violations of export controls The United States has imposed sanctions on more than two dozen companies, alleging their support for ballistic missile and drone development in Pakistan and Iran. The US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced last week that 26 companies from Pakistan, China, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates were blacklisted due to activities deemed contrary to U.S. national security, including violating export controls, aiding restricted weapons programs, and attempting to bypass sanctions on Russia and Iran. The BIS, a division of the US Commerce Department, stated that 'nine Pakistani entities were added [to the ban list] for acting as front companies for the Advanced Engineering Research Organization, listed in 2014, and seven others for contributing to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.' Three entities from the UAE and one from Egypt were also blacklisted for allegedly attempting to obtain restricted U.S. parts after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Additionally, six Chinese firms were sanctioned for assisting China’s military and procuring U.S. technology for Iran’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs. According to Thea D. Rozman Kendler, assistant secretary of commerce for export administration at the BIS, the U.S. will continue blocking entities 'that attempt to bypass our controls and endanger U.S. national security.' 'Programs such as Iran’s WMD program, their UAV program, and Pakistan’s ballistic missile program pose significant threats to the national security of the United States and will not be aided by U.S. technologies,' Kendler added. Matthew S. Axelrod, assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement at the BIS, stated, 'When we identify parties transshipping U.S. items to support WMD and UAV programs in countries like Pakistan and Iran, or aiding Russia’s war efforts, we take action. Today’s listings also make clear that when foreign parties engage in dilatory or evasive conduct with respect to our end-use checks, they will face consequences.' The U.S. State Department in April 2024 acted against four entities involved in weapons of mass destruction proliferation. These entities were accused of supplying crucial materials and technologies to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, including long-range missile capabilities. The State Department noted that 'three of the targeted companies are based in China, with the fourth in Belarus,' providing missile-related items to Pakistan’s program. In response to American sanctions on entities allegedly linked to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry voiced concerns, with spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch noting that 'similar listings have occurred before without any evidence being shared.' She suggested that Islamabad was open to transparency discussions to protect legitimate commercial ventures from being 'unfairly impacted by export controls.' Pakistan’s ballistic missile program is a key component of its national defense strategy, developed in response to regional security challenges and the country’s long-standing rivalry with India. As part of Pakistan’s strategic deterrence and conventional strike capabilities, its missile systems are designed to deliver both nuclear warheads and conventional munitions. To manage these weapons, specifically their precision and security during missile operations, Pakistan has implemented a state-of-the-art command and control infrastructure. Additionally, a specialized security force, operating under the leadership of a three-star general, has been deployed exclusively to protect these strategic assets. Arsenal mainly consists of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, with ongoing advancements in cruise missile capabilities This security framework aims to prevent unauthorized access, safeguard the country’s defense assets, and ensure swift and effective response in any scenario. The arsenal mainly consists of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, with ongoing advancements in cruise missile capabilities. Among Pakistan’s short- and medium-range missiles, the Shaheen-III has a range of approximately 1,710 miles, while the Ababeel can reach up to 1,400 miles. Islamabad has consistently emphasized that its advancement in missile technology is to maintain a credible deterrent and achieve strategic balance in South Asia. Dr. Maria Sultan, the Islamabad-based chair of the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute University and Pakistan’s leading defense and security analyst, told The Media Line: 'Pakistan’s ballistic missile program is indigenous and not reliant on U.S. technology, so the sanctions have minimal impact on its development.' 'Moreover,' she continued, 'if any listed companies were trading with the U.S., it suggests there were compliance lapses on the U.S. side.' Sultan added that the 'U.S. has lost its role as the leader of the non-proliferation regime since it has been the sole facilitator of not only leading an arms race in South Asia but has contributed towards the defense industry development of India after STA-1.' STA-1 or Strategic Trade Authorization-1, is a U.S. designation that enables certain countries to access advanced and sensitive American technology, including dual-use items for both civilian and military purposes. In 2018, India became the first South Asian country to receive STA-1 status. 'In a faltering U.S. Middle East policy, the creation of a false narrative surrounding sanctions against Pakistani and Iranian companies serves to deflect pressure and reflects an irresponsible unilateral approach to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which has been previously undermined by U.S. sanctions on Iran,' Sultan explained. The JCPOA is the 2015 agreement between Iran and six world powers—the U.S., UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany—to limit Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. 'The timing and nature of these sanctions appear more aimed at appeasing a domestic audience rather than genuinely addressing missile proliferation,' she added, stressing that 'this strategy ultimately detracts from the necessary efforts to control the proliferation of missiles.'

Hezbollah names Naim Qassem as new chief	Long-serving deputy secretary-general of the terror group is approved by Hezbollah's religious council after the designated successor of Hasan Nasrallah, Hashem Safieddine is also killed in a targeted strike Hezbollah on Tuesday named Naim Qassem as the new head of the terror group after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in September. He was deputy secretary-general under Nasrallah since 1991. 'Based on the faith in Allah, our commitment to Islam and our dedication to its principles and purposes, Hezbollah, in accordance with its established mechanism, approves Naim Qassem at secretary-general,' the terror group said in a statement. 'We are committed to working together to achieve Hezbollah's aims and to preserve the flames of resistance and our flag held high until victory is achieved.' Qassem was named as the new chief of the terror group after Nasrallah who served in the role for the past 32 years was assassinated in a targeted attack on his bunker in Beirut's Dahieh quarter along with other senior members, including the commander of South Lebanon, Ali Karaki. Israel also assassinated Hashem Safieddine, who was designated to succeed Nasrallah in a strike earlier in October. His death was confirmed by the terror group last week, three weeks after the IDF's targeted attack. Qassem who had been speaking publicly for Hezbollah even before Nasrallah's killing, said in a speech earlier this month that a cease-fire agreement could be reached apart from the war in Gaza. 'The solution is a cease-fire. Not from a position of weakness,' he said. 'We are no longer supporting Gaza and are now in war with Israel.' He said that since Israel was attacking all parts of Lebanon, the terror group had the right to target Tel Aviv, Haifa and beyond, as Nasrallah had wanted.

Iran threatens Israel in UN, US warns Tehran against further aggr...	Emergency UN Security Council session sees Iranian representative reiterating Tehran's right to act against Israel's retaliatory strike; U.S. says further Iranian aggression will have 'severe consequences' Iran's UN Ambassador Amir Saied said in an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday that his country reserves the 'inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing,' to what he called 'this act of aggression. The session was held to discuss Israel’s retaliatory attack in Tehran on Saturday. 'Israel’s attack constitutes a breach of international law. The U.S.’s support of Israel encouraged it to continue its aggression in Gaza and Lebanon,' Saied said. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council there would be 'severe consequences' should Tehran take any further aggressive action against Jerusalem. 'We will not hesitate to act in self-defense. Let there be no confusion. The United States does not want to see further escalation. We believe this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,' she said. 'As we have stated time and time again, we have the right and duty to defend ourselves and will use all the means at our disposal to protect the citizens of Israel,' Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon told the council. He also demanded the international body recognize the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, impose 'immediate, paralyzing sanctions against Iran’s military and economic infrastructure,' and implored the council to 'take every step necessary to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear state.' Meanwhile, members of Israel’s Security Cabinet discussed three main issues Sunday overnight including the Hezbollah drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea and deliberated on how to respond to Iran over the attack. Military representatives presented several options in the meeting; however, some ministers present were 'carried away' with their proposals and no decision was agreed on.

Strides in Lebanon cease-fire negotiations, Israeli officials say	Hochstein to arrive to finalize the deal stipulating a 60-day period of adjustment leaving IDF troops in tactical positions; Hezbollah to be kept north of Litani River while the Lebanese army to deploy thousands to the border; Russia to play a supervision role Senior Israeli officials said the negotiations on a cease-fire deal in Lebanon are 'in advanced stages.' White House special envoy Amos Hochstein may travel to Israel and Lebanon before the November 5 U.S. presidential elections, to attempt to reach final agreements. If the talks advance, the IDF will begin to withdraw most of its troops and redeploy forces in South Lebanon and leave areas where their mission to remove the threat from Radwan forces, has been completed, and likely remain only where there is tactical significance. The officials in Israel said that Lebanon's situation has completely changed after the IDF offensive and that there is an agreement in Beirut to disconnect both the Lebanon and Gazan fronts. They stressed the fact that fighting would continue while negotiations are ongoing and until they are completed. Western intelligence sources believe Iran would allow Hezbollah to agree to a ceasefire, and perhaps even encourage it, even if the fighting in Gaza does not end. The Israeli officials said a cease-fire agreement would begin with a 60-day acclimation period during which Hezbollah and the IDF withhold their fire and the Lebanese army will deploy to the south, while a new mechanism to supervise the region will be considered but there will be no new resolution passed in the UN Security Council. French and American officials said recently that Hezbollah, which suffered severe blows and lost all of its leadership, has been bolstered in the past two weeks, by the growing number of casualties among IDF soldiers. 'This is an opportunity that must not be missed,' they said. The proposed deal to be agreed by Israel, Lebanon, the U.S. and others, includes three components. The first is a wider implementation of UN resolution 1701, passed after the 2006 Second Lebanon War, that would ensure there would be no Hezbollah terrorists south of the Litani River, and at a significant distance from Metula. Lebanon's army is to deploy 5,000 to 10,000 troops along the border. UNIFIL forces will be increased, perhaps some, replaced by French, British and German forces. Israel has approached those countries to see if they would agree. The second component is the establishment of an international mechanism to supervise the area and consider violation claims by any of the sides. Israeli officials said the U.S> has agreed that if Hezbollah violates the agreement, for example by building fortifications south of the Litani, and the Lebanese army or UNIFIL fail to quickly respond, the IDF would be able to take prolonged action to remove the threat. Israel asked for a letter from U.S. President Joe Biden, stating Israel's right to self-defense, making it clear that the IDF would be able to act. American officials did not respond to questions on the matter. The third component in the agreement being negotiated is preventing Hezbollah from rearming. This means blocking military means, to be identified as banned, from being brought in by air, land or sea. Russia expressed a willingness to assist in implementing the agreement and is destined to play a part in stabilizing the region in Lebanon and Syria. 'The Russians will have a special role in preventing further escalation,' a foreign source said. Israel will engage with the Kremlin directly and is interested in Russian participation, in the hopes that it would contribute to the agreement's implementation and also to reduce its dependence on U.S. involvement. Netanyahu emissaries have been trying to enlist other countries to join supervision roles in the pending agreement. Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer has been working with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has discussed the matter with Hochstein.

Guterres says UNRWA indispensable, after Israel banns agency	UN secretary-general says bill passed by Knesset could have devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees and will be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that the implementation of a law banning the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from operating in Israel 'could have devastating consequences for Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which is unacceptable.' The Knesset passed a law to cut official ties with and halt the activity of the UNRWA, some of whose operators are suspected of participating in the massacres on October 7. The law passed by a vote of 92-10. 'There is no alternative to UNRWA,' Guterres said in a statement. 'The implementation of these laws would be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for peace and security in the region as a whole. As I said before, UNRWA is indispensable,' adding he would bring the matter to the attention of the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. Under the new law, UNRWA will not 'operate any institution, provide any service, or conduct any activity, whether directly or indirectly,' in the sovereign territory of Israel. In effect, UNRWA's activities in East Jerusalem will be terminated and the body's powers will be transferred to Israel's responsibility and control. Israel revealed the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, 2023 and the identity of another member of the organization who was a Hamas operative in Lebanon. Others are active in both Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

North Korea's foreign minister leaves for Russia after sending tr...	North Korea's foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, has left Pyongyang to visit Russia, state media KCNA said on Tuesday, amid concerns about the two countries' growing cooperation over Russia's war in Ukraine. KCNA said a delegation led by Choe left on Monday for an official visit to Russia, without elaborating. Her visit comes as NATO joined Seoul, Washington and Kyiv in confirming Pyongyang's dispatch of troops to Russia, saying North Korean military units had been deployed to Russia's Kursk region near the Ukraine border. The Pentagon said North Korea has sent 10,000 troops to eastern Russia for training, up from its estimate of 3,000 last Wednesday, adding Washington will not impose new limits on Ukraine's use of American weapons if North Korea enters the fight.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk3l0y6xyg	2024-10-28T14:22:09-07:00	
This is where where 1,000 armed Radwan fighters were poised to in...	Ynet reporter on the ground with troops in South Lebanon: For over 20 years, Hezbollah planned to capture Metula to invade the Upper Galilee; The IDF's 769th Brigade destroyed underground facilities and arms depots in Kila, a major Hezbollah hub, thwarting their invasion plans For more than two decades, Hezbollah has been plotting to capture the border town of Metula as a launch point to push into the Upper Galilee and northern Israel. However, since the outbreak of hostilities a year ago, and particularly in recent weeks, the Israel Defense Forces have been actively dismantling Hezbollah's attack infrastructure in the nearby village of Kila, located in southern Lebanon. Under the leadership of the 769th Regional Brigade, part of the 91st Division, Israeli forces have discovered and destroyed dozens of underground facilities, weapon depots, observation posts and hundreds of terrorist infrastructures scattered throughout and within Kila village. This village is considered one of Hezbollah's main terror strongholds, from which over 1,000 armed Radwan fighters were poised to invade Israel at a moment's notice. A tour of the ravaged village and neighboring Lebanese areas quickly reveals the scale of the destruction and the high level of Hezbollah's readiness to execute their 'Conquer the Galilee' plan, a strategy they announced in 2011 and have been preparing for ever since. 'The village of Kila represents all the evil and what Hezbollah intended to do,' explained Colonel Avraham Marciano, commander of the 769th Brigade. He added that, from this Shiite village adjacent to Metula, 'there was a plan for several battalions to storm into Israeli territory.' The IDF's heavy machinery is carrying out extensive demolition in the area, continuing to destroy homes and terrorist infrastructures located so close to the border wall. Just yards away from Metula's orchards and across from the Har Tzofiya neighborhood, near a local gas station owned by Hezbollah, Marciano described an exposed underground terror tunnel that did not breach Israeli soil. 'Fifty yards from here, within the rubble, we uncovered an underground shaft they planned to use,' he detailed. 'It was several hundred yards long, and from its entrance the terrorists planned to go underground on the main street of the village, collect their equipment, prepare for an attack and emerge from here.' Forces are now destroying this tunnel, along with other above and below-ground terrorist infrastructures. David, one of the soldiers protecting us, participated in uncovering the tunnel. 'We found it with the excavation equipment,' he recounted. 'There's no doubt we halted its further digging. In almost every house here, we uncovered terrorist infrastructures. Whether it's shafts, tunnels, or just weapons, in every house, you can find weapons, ammunition, vests, combat gear, or medical supplies.' In nearby areas, Hezbollah set up observation posts from which they monitored movement in Israel for years. Since the conflict began, the Lebanese Shiite terror organization has used these posts to direct fire and launch direct attacks on Israeli communities, including Kfar Yuval. 'From this point, they fired at the Ayalon family home while Mira and her son Barak were having lunch in their kitchen,' Colonel Marciano described. 'Today, we are settling scores and destroying Hezbollah's infrastructures.' He explained that the military activity in the area, which oversees the northern communities, aims to 'destroy the infrastructures, seize the weapons – and prevent Hezbollah's surprise invasion capability from Kila village.' According to the colonel: 'We're doing similar things in other villages. This is how the operation looks. Our response, besides eliminating the terrorists, their commanders, and the commanders of their commanders, is to ensure that the infrastructure does not exist.' However, he acknowledged this activity does not address the remote and steep-trajectory anti-tank fire. For example, during the tour of villages near Metula, they repeatedly took shelter due to mortar fire from the nearby village of Al-Khiam, where the IDF is not operating. Marciano emphasized that the forces on the ground are vigorously working to destroy Hezbollah infrastructures. 'We live every day as if it's the last day of the maneuver,' he said. 'We have a sense of activity and urgency. The machinery doesn't stop, the soldiers don't stop. The soldiers even push us, wanting to move forward and do the work. We don't want to stop.' He promised that 'we are doing everything we can – and everything that needs to be done – to ensure that the residents of the north can live here safely. We've waited for this for a year. Today we stand here, realizing what we've waited for, not because we are war-hungry; quite the opposite, we want peace. And for that, we need to come from a position of strength and bring this strength and victory to the people of Israel, who have waited for it for so long.' 'Hezbollah needs to flee, feel hunted, lose all its infrastructures, all the operatives we can take out now, and if we need to go deeper – we will.'

PM: Israel will 'facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza...	Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in a post on the prime minister's official account on the X platform referred to the approval of the law prohibiting UNRWA activities in Israel, and wrote in English that 'UNRWA workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable. Since avoiding a humanitarian crisis is also essential, sustained humanitarian aid must remain available in Gaza now and in the future.' He added that: 'In the 90 days before this legislation takes effect – and after – we stand ready to work with our international partners to ensure Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not threaten Israel’s security.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhldypeje	2024-10-28T13:58:15-07:00

The United States warned Iran at the United Nations Security Council on Monday of 'severe consequences' if it undertakes any further aggressive acts against Israel or U.S. personnel in the Middle East. 'We will not hesitate to act in self defense. Let there be no confusion. The United States does not want to see further escalation. We believe this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,' U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the 15-member council. The Security Council met after Israel struck missile factories and other sites in Iran before dawn on Saturday. It was retaliation for Iran's Oct. 1 attack on Israel with about 200 ballistic missiles. Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saied Iravani accused Washington of being 'complicit' through military support for its ally. 'Iran has consistently championed diplomacy,' he told the council. 'However, as a sovereign state, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserves its inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing to this act of aggression.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjamvt6ejl	2024-10-28T13:52:37-07:00

Yemen's Houthis said on Monday that they targeted three ships in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, attacks they called part of their efforts to enforce a naval blockade on Israel. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said in a televised address the vessels were targeted for attempting to approach ports bound for Israel. According to the latest data from LSEG, all three targeted vessels were Liberia-registered. One of the vessels, identified by the Houthis as Motaro, was last seen off Yemen's western coast in the Red Sea, en route from Egypt's Suez Canal to Shanghai, according to LSEG data. Another vessel, the SC Montreal, was reportedly targeted in the Arabian Sea while travelling from Seychelles' Port Victoria to Salalah, Oman. The third vessel, the Maersk Kowloon, was tracked by LSEG in the western Indian Ocean, also en route from Salalah. The Houthis said they will continue these actions until Israel halts its offensive on Gaza and Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkghiyaxjl	2024-10-28T13:49:55-07:00	
IDF soldier seriously injured by antii-tank missile in Jabaliya d...	Major Guy Yaacov Nezri, 25, dies a week after being injured in northern Gaza Strip; He told high school students: 'We're here to fight and stay alive. It's good to live for our country, and I'm not here to die' Major Guy Yaacov Nezri, 25, from Atlit, commander of a platoon in the 52nd Battalion of the 401st Brigade, died of his wounds after being severely wounded in a battle in the northern Gaza Strip on October 19, the IDF announced on Monday evening. Since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, 772 soldiers have fallen, including 361 who were killed during fighting in the Gaza Strip. Nezri was seriously injured in the incident in which Staff Sergeant Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and Sergeant Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, were killed after being hit by anti-tank missile fire in the battle in Jabaliya in northern Gaza. He is survived by his parents, a twin sister and a brother. His funeral will be held in Atlit. Tamar, his twin sister, posted a video of Nezri on Facebook, before his death was determined. 'Blessed are the people that have these men as their commanders. My brother, the hero who was seriously injured by anti-tank missile fire in Gaza, speaking to the students of the Hanasi School in Haifa, eight months before the injury. These are the words he chooses to use. We love life, fight for life, we are here to stay,' she wrote. Tamar added: 'Our nation is a strong nation that has survived difficult wars and suffered many losses and has always stood on its feet, with its head held high. Today marks the anniversary of the Iron Swords War. Guy fought for a year for a better life in our country, that was the goal and that's where we're going. We are not afraid of a long journey. Guy is still hospitalized and fighting for his life. Devote this day to his healing and the healing of all the wounded of this war, who sacrificed their bodies and souls so that we can live here united and loving!' In the meeting that his sister wrote about, Nezri told the students: 'I want to tell you something else. It's good to live for our country. It's good to live for our country! And I'm not here to die. I'll tell you the truth, we are here to fight and remain alive, to appreciate the continuity of the nation of Israel. The people of Israel are a strong people, they will not remain as we saw them on October 7. This is not the people of Israel. It is a people that has experienced destruction - And just as it falls, it also gets up very quickly and becomes even stronger.' Asif Izak, head of the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council, said: 'Guy was the salt of the earth, who grew up in Hof HaCarmel as a member of a deep-rooted and moral family. On behalf of the entire Hof HaCarmel community, I would like to hug the dear Nezri family, and hope that we will be worthy of the best of our sons that we lost, including Guy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1l00cotx1l	2024-10-28T13:43:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/28/Hkz92walJe/Hkz92walJe_0_36_736_414_0_small.jpg

Knesset passes law banning UNRWA activity in Israel, despite oppo...	Under the law which passed overwhelmingly, an agreement from 1967 that allowed the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency to work in Israel will be canceled, and UNRWA activities in the country will cease. Some of the agency's employees are suspected of participating in the massacres on October 7. US is 'very concerned' The Knesset plenum approved Monday evening in its second and third readings a law to cut official ties with and halt the activity of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, some of whose operators are suspected of participating in the massacres on October 7. The law passed by a vote of 92-10. Under the new law, UNRWA will not 'operate any institution, provide any service, or conduct any activity, whether directly or indirectly,' in the sovereign territory of Israel. In effect, UNRWA's activities in East Jerusalem will be terminated and the body's powers will be transferred to Israel's responsibility and control. Israel revealed the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, 2023 and the identity of another member of the organization who was a Hamas operative in Lebanon. Others are active in both Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee Yuli Edelstein said at the beginning of the debate in the plenary: 'As part of the committee's discussions on the law, a video was shown that proves the involvement of UNRWA personnel in kidnapping a body to the Gaza Strip and other evidence of their activity in Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. In addition, the person who commanded the massacre in the Be'eri bomb shelter, where 16 Israelis were murdered and from which four were kidnapped to Gaza, was a UNRWA terrorist.' 'In light of this, and since it has been proven to the State of Israel that UNRWA and its employees acted against the State of Israel, the State must determine that UNRWA's activities in its territory will be stopped,' Edelstein also said. 'The State of Israel will provide every service it is obligated to provide to its citizens and residents in all those places where UNRWA operated, coordinated by the Jerusalem Municipality. There is no place for enemies in the heart of the capital of the Jewish people.' One of the law's author's, Likud lawmaker Boaz Bismuth, said UNRWA's work has been counterproductive for years. 'If you really want stability, if you really want security, if you want real peace in the Middle East, organizations like UNRWA won't bring you there,' said Bismuth. 'If the United Nations is not willing to clean this organization from terrorism, from Hamas activists, then we have to take measures to make sure that they cannot harm our people ever again,' lawmaker Sharren Haskel, another author of the law, said. 'The international community could have taken responsibility and made sure that they used the proper organizations to facilitate humanitarian aid, like the World Food Organization, like UNICEF, and many others who work all around the world.' During the voting, Kobi Samerano, the father of Jonathan Samerano, who was murdered on October 7 and whose body was kidnapped into Gaza by a UNRWA worker, was present in the plenum. Despite the broad support for the legislation, both the coalition and the opposition voiced concern among that the vote or implementation would be delayed because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under great pressure in recent weeks from both the United Nations and the United States, due to the lack of an alternative body that would provide a humanitarian response for the Palestinians in Gaza. On Sunday, senior officials in the Foreign Ministry warned that if the legislation stating that ties with UNRWA must be severed is passed in the second and third readings in the Knesset Israel would be suspended from the United Nations, since this is a violation of the organization's charter. The foreign ministers of Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Great Britain issued a joint statement Monday before the vote calling on Israel to stop the legislation, expressing 'grave concern,' especially in light of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. 'UNRWA provides vital and life-saving humanitarian assistance and basic services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank and throughout the region,' the statement reads. 'This will have devastating consequences on an already difficult humanitarian situation, which is rapidly deteriorating, especially in northern Gaza.' U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Washington 'has made it clear to Israel that it is very concerned about the legislation that could ban the agency's activities in the Gaza Strip, because it plays a role in providing irreplaceable humanitarian aid. The humanitarian aid does not reach the residents of Jabaliya, where the IDF has increased its activity, and the U.S. will not agree to that.' In recent days, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew and officials at the embassy have appealed to Yesh Atid Chairman and Opposition Leader Yair Lapid, Yisrael Beitenu Party head Avigdor Liberman, and Nastional Unity party head Benny Gantz, with a request that they agree to postpone the advancement of the legislation at least until after the U.S. presidential elections. Lapid reportedly told U.S. officials that he disagreed with them and that the law is correct and appropriate, leading Liberman and Gantz to also reject the U.S officials' request. Knesset members from the Arab Hadash-Ta'al party objected, and Knesset member Ahmed Tibi said: 'Those who support this bill are those who do not recognize the Palestinian people. It is not new that people here in the Knesset ask to stop the activities of UNRWA .There will be no need for UNRWA when the occupation ends and a Palestinian state is established.'

Joe Biden waits in line 40 minutes to cast early ballot in Delawa...	The current US president chatted with voters and pushed a woman in a wheelchair in line ahead of him President Joe Biden, who will end a decades-long public career in January, cast an early ballot in the 2024 general election. Biden voted on Monday at the state of Delaware Department of Elections, not far from his home outside Wilmington, Delaware at an early voting site, where voters were lined up down the street to cast ballots. It’s a bittersweet moment for Biden, who decided to end his reelection campaign in July because of growing concerns about his health and Democrats’ worries about his chances of defeating former President Donald Trump. Biden chatted with voters as he waited in line to cast his ballot, and helped push an older woman in a wheelchair who was ahead of him. The president waited in line for about 40 minutes before he cast his ballot. He handed his identification to the election worker, who had him sign a form and announced: 'Joseph Biden now voting.' As the president cast his ballot behind a black drape, some first-time voters were announced and the room erupted in cheers for them. Outside the polling place, Biden was asked by reporters if he thought Democrats - including Vice President Kamala Harris - would win. 'I think we will,' he said. He also was asked about the war in Gaza and said that it 'must end.' Biden emphasized: 'We need a cease-fire. We have to stop this war. It has to end. It has to end. It has to end.' For all but a few years since 1970, Biden has either held office or been running for one during election season.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkzkn8plje	2024-10-28T10:56:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/28/SkokoSTxJl/SkokoSTxJl_0_148_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Northern mayor laments removal of protective barriers on border w...	A year after regular attacks from Hezbollah began, the protective barriers placed in major intersections in northern Israel have been removed, which has Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern concerned; 'It feels like a hasty move, signaling to residents that it’s safe to return home' Israeli Defense Forces have dismantled large protective barriers that were put in place about a year ago along major traffic routes near Kiryat Shmona, extending to Metula and Kfar Yuval on the northern border. This decision seems linked to the decreased threat of direct anti-tank missile attacks following military operations in southern Lebanon, especially over the past month. Mayor Avichai Stern of Kiryat Shmona voiced strong concerns over the timing of this decision. 'Why take them down now? They should be removed after the conflict is truly over. What’s the rush? It feels like a hasty move, signaling to residents that it’s safe to return home,' he said. Stern is worried that, while the army claims to have destroyed nearby terror infrastructures, the threat from more distant villages, which could still launch anti-tank missiles, remains unaddressed. He emphasizes that these concrete walls were installed as a protective measure when the military was not present in Lebanon. Although Stern understands the rationale behind their removal, he stresses that, for residents, these walls represent the necessary defense against Hezbollah forces just across the border. He expressed a personal wish to live in a city without these 'ugly defensive walls,' but insisted they should only be removed when there is absolute certainty they are no longer needed. Stern suspects political pressures might be pushing the IDF to wrap up operations in Lebanon, achieving only a temporary distancing of Hezbollah. He also fears a potential agreement that allows Hezbollah to regroup, which he believes should not be permitted.

ICC prosecutor who charged Netanyahu with war crimes says will co...	Karim Khan has called for internal investigation into allegations made by a female aide; Court officials say accusation part of an Israeli intelligence smear campaign to discredit the court. The International Criminal Court’s top prosecutor has called for an internal investigation into allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her. Karim Khan’s request Monday follows an investigation by The Associated Press detailing allegations made in May by two co-workers in whom the woman confided as the chief prosecutor was preparing to seek charges against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of Hamas over their actions in Gaza. Khan has previously said there was 'no truth' to the misconduct allegations and court officials told the AP they may have been made as part of an Israeli intelligence smear campaign to discredit the court. In a social media post Monday, the British jurist complained that recent media reporting had breached the confidentiality of the court’s internal proceedings and spread 'disinformation' that violated his rights as well as those of the alleged victim. Khan said he would cooperate fully with any inquiry made under the court’s Independent Oversight Mechanism — the same watchdog that closed an inquiry just five days after receiving the third-party complaint. The inquiry should be 'permitted to do its work without interference so that the crucial work of the Office may continue unimpeded,' he said, declining further comment. The court’s watchdog previously determined no investigation was necessary, and didn’t question Khan about his behavior, when the alleged victim opted against filing a formal complaint. People close to the woman, who still works at the court, told AP that she opted against a complaint at the time because she didn’t trust the internal watchdog and has since asked the body of member-states that oversees the ICC to launch an external probe. AP pieced together details of the accusations through whistleblower documents shared with the watchdog and interviews with eight ICC officials and individuals close to the woman. All spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the allegations or fear of retaliation. Among the allegations told to AP is that Khan during a foreign trip asked the woman to rest with him on a hotel bed and then 'sexually touched her,' according to the documents. Later, he came to her room at 3 a.m. and knocked on the door for 10 minutes. Other allegedly nonconsensual behavior cited in the documents included locking the door of his office and sticking his hand in her pocket. He also allegedly asked her on several occasions to go on a vacation together. While the watchdog could not determine wrongdoing before ending its initial inquiry, it nonetheless urged Khan in a memo to minimize contact with the woman to protect the rights of all involved and safeguard the court’s integrity.

International Criminal Court's prosecutor demands probe into misc...	The International Criminal Court's prosecutor Karim Khan has asked the ICC's oversight mechanism to open an immediate investigation into allegations of misconduct made against him, he said on Monday. According to the prosecutor, the investigations should cover the allegations and disinformation surrounding them, and he will cooperate fully. Last week, Khan denied accusations of unspecified misconduct after the court's governing body confirmed that it had been notified of the allegation. The Independent Oversight Mechanism said in its annual report for 2024 that the alleged victim in the Khan case would not explicitly confirm the allegations in talks with the oversight body earlier this year and therefore no formal inquiry had been launched. ICC judges are reviewing Khan's request in May for arrest warrants against Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense chief and Hamas leaders.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rja7qrax1g	2024-10-28T09:31:37-07:00

Iran executes Iranian-German national after terrorism conviction	Iran executed Iranian-German national Jamshid Sharmahd after he was convicted of carrying out terrorist attacks, Iranian state media said on Monday. Sharmahd, who also holds U.S. residency, was sentenced to death in 2023 on charges of 'corruption on earth.' He was accused by Iran of heading a pro-monarchist group accused of a deadly 2008 bombing and planning other attacks in the country. Sharmahd's arrest was announced in 2020 in an intelligence ministry statement that described him as 'the ringleader of the terrorist Tondar group, who directed armed and terrorist acts in Iran from America.' Based in Los Angeles, the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran, or Tondar, says it seeks to restore the Iranian monarchy that was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution. It runs pro-Iranian opposition radio and television stations abroad	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by8oubteyg	2024-10-28T09:16:41-07:00

Ben Shapiro, one of the world's most influential Jews, has some advice for Israel: 'Instead of advertising Tel Aviv's beaches in Santa Monica, start introducing your enemies to the world'; He speaks to Ynetnews ahead of the staging in Israel by the Aspaklaria Theater of a musical he wrote which has taken on new meaning following the October 7 massacre Ben Shapiro is one of the world's most influential Jews - with over 20 million followers on social media and firm connections at the top of American politics - and is a one-man media empire. About a decade ago, he founded The Daily Wire, and later a popular podcast - The Ben Shapiro Show - which was ranked second in the United States by Podtrac. Since then, he has not hesitated to confront Israel's opponents, and become a one-man advocacy enterprise. In a special interview with Ynetnews, he talks about disappointment with the West, which he says has normalized antisemitism and hatred of Israel; asks that we learn a historical lesson from what he says Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar understood well - that social divisions are the country's weak point; and explains why Israel repeatedly fails in the propaganda war. 'If Trump is elected, I think that the war in the Middle East will come to a swift and decisive conclusion,' he says, adding that 'I have significant doubts about the what a Kamala Harris administration would look like for Israel.' Shapiro spoke with Ynetnews on the occasion of the staging in Israel of a musical he wrote which has taken on new meaning following the October 7 massacre, 'We Will Rise,' by the Aspaklaria Theater, in collaboration with the Israel Sinfonietta Be'er Sheva.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he hopes to reach peace deals with more Arab countries once the war against Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah is complete.

But the day after includes something else of utmost importance,' Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament. 'I aspire to continue the process I led a few years ago of the signing of the historic Abraham Accords, and achieve peace with more Arab countries,' he said. Israel, under the U.S.-brokered 2020 accords, normalized relations with four Arab countries - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.

Erdoğan accuses Israel of genocide, and then bombs the Kurds	Turkey conducted over 130 airstrikes across most towns and cities along Syria's northern border hitting civilian homes, factories, and oil facilities of the Kurds, according to reports Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has emerged as one of Israel's most vocal critics since the onset of the war. He has urged the Arab world to unite against Israel, claiming that it has no intention of stopping in Gaza and will extend its actions to Turkey. Erdoğan repeatedly refers to the ongoing war against Hamas as 'genocide,' even labeling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as 'the Hitler of our time.' Meanwhile, Erdoğan continues to carry out ruthless operations against the Kurds in Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Wednesday marked a new escalation in the already strained relations between Turkey and the Kurdish groups seeking independence. An attack targeted the headquarters of Turkey's aerospace industry company TUSAS in Ankara, resulting in five fatalities and 22 injuries. Videos from the scene circulated on social media. According to Turkish reports, at least two assailants were involved, and they were killed. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya stated immediately after the strike that it was 'very likely' that the attackers were Kurdish operatives from the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Turkey designates as a terrorist organization. On Friday, the PKK claimed responsibility for the attack. Even before the PKK took responsibility, Turkey launched intensive air and ground strikes against Kurdish positions in Syria and Iraq. According to the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, positions of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes a significant Kurdish military component in Syria, were targeted. Turkey's Defense Ministry announced on Wednesday evening that it had attacked PKK targets in northern Iraq and northern Syria: 'In accordance with our rights to self-defense, an air operation was conducted against terrorist targets in northern Iraq and Syria. A total of 32 targets were successfully destroyed, and operations are ongoing.' Following the events, Erdoğan declared that 'no terrorist organization attacking our country will be able to realize its hopes.' According to a report on Sunday from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organization linked to the Syrian opposition based in London, Turkish forces have intensified their air and ground assaults in northeastern Syria since Wednesday. The report noted that over 100 airstrikes had been conducted, including 84 drone strikes and 18 by fighter jets. Ground assaults also were reported in several areas, resulting in 17 deaths and more than 60 injuries. The observatory indicated that many civilian homes, oil facilities and factories were damaged in the attacks. Protests against the Turkish escalation were reported in several locations across Syria. Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, associated with Hezbollah, also covered the Turkish strikes, noting that sources on the ground indicated Turkey had conducted over 130 airstrikes across most towns and cities along Syria's northern border within four days. In the targeted areas in Syria, some claimed that Turkey was using the Ankara attack as a pretext to target groups unrelated to the incident. Syria's media reported that Turkey employed a significant amount of ammunition during these strikes. Turkey's Defense Ministry claimed it was targeting 'terrorists,' but the reality is that Turkey has long fought against the Kurdish quest for independence, ruthlessly attacking Kurds in Turkey, Syria and Iraq out of fear that the ethnic group might realize its aspirations in the Kurdistan region. The historical animosity between the PKK and Turkey is not new. The PKK is a Kurdish armed organization founded in Turkey in 1978 by Abdullah Öcalan and Kurdish activists. Initially focused on advocating for Kurdish rights, it later sought independence for southeastern Turkey. In its early years, the PKK was viewed as a political movement, but it is now recognized as a terrorist organization in Turkey and many Western countries, including the U.S. A report from Saudi Arabia's Al-Arabiya network highlighted significant events influencing the PKK, such as Öcalan's arrest in 1999 and his subsequent life imprisonment. The report noted that the PKK has carried out attacks against the Turkish military and government sites, primarily in southeastern Turkey. The conflict between Turkey and the PKK spans borders, particularly since Turkey accuses the organization of strengthening ties with Kurds in neighboring countries like Iraq and Syria, launching attacks on PKK positions in those states. Efforts to reach a cease-fire between the two sides have repeatedly failed, as Ankara remains firmly opposed to the PKK's demands for independence. Over the years, there have been numerous reports of connections between Israel and the Kurds, whose population numbers in the millions and spans Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia. The Kurds have often expressed warm sentiments toward Israel. In Iraq, the autonomy achieved by the Kurds is referred to as the Iraqi Kurdistan.

Hostage negotiations summit in Doha concludes with progress repor...	Talks cover several proposals by mediators, with sources indicating momentum toward aligning these frameworks within the week; officials aim to convene follow-up summit, potentially engaging Hamas directly A negotiation summit in Doha concluded on Monday with reported progress toward a unified framework for a hostage release plan, following intensive discussions between Mossad Director David Barnea, CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al Thani. The talks, which saw Barnea remain overnight in Qatar, reportedly covered Egyptian, American and Qatari proposals, with sources indicating momentum toward aligning these frameworks within the week. Officials aim to convene a follow-up summit with top intelligence leaders, including Egypt’s new intelligence chief Hassan Rashad, potentially engaging Hamas directly. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Sunday floated a proposal involving a 48-hour cease-fire to facilitate the release of four hostages in exchange for some Palestinian prisoners, describing it as a trust-building measure. Hamas welcomed the Egyptian proposal but expressed concern over the lack of Israeli guarantees and reiterated its stance that no deal could be finalized without a comprehensive cease-fire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, including the strategic Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors. Israeli and Qatari sources familiar with the discussions at the summit noted reluctance from both sides on smaller deals, as both parties are focused on a more comprehensive agreement that could potentially involve both Gaza and Lebanon. Negotiators also considered the broader regional context, with some Israeli officials insisting that any truce in Lebanon would depend on Iran and Hezbollah pressuring Hamas toward an agreement. A diplomatic source quoted by Lebanon’s LBCI said the Doha talks had shown incremental progress on Gaza and noted genuine interest in a future prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel.

The first fallen soldier in Oct. 7: 'Steinberg was always a compa...	Nahal Brigade Commander Colonel Yehonatan Steinberg was killed on October 7 and left a void in the hearts of his loved ones; his widow shares stories about the revered commander When the late Colonel Yehonatan Steinberg left his house on the morning of Simchat Torah last year, his wife felt that she had no reason to worry. She was already used to sudden calls to base; on Saturdays, holidays, at odd hours. ''There is an infiltration of terrorists from the Gaza Strip and I am going to my soldiers in Kerem Shalom.' I walked him to the door, gave him some cookies and sent him on his way. Nothing unusual,' recalled Yiska Steinberg. However, she had another reason to be calm. During Operation Guardian of the Walls, Yehonatan's force was under fire in the West Bank while he was the Binyamin Division commander. His communications officer was slightly injured, as well as an officer who was with them, but he came out unscathed. 'Yehonatan managed the event calmly and rescued his men under fire,' continued Yiska. 'This is the moment when I said to myself: My husband is protected. There is no one who can beat him.' It was an illusion. In the morning hours of October 7, 2023, the commander of the Nahal Brigade, Colonel Yehonatan Steinberg, was killed in battle against a squad of 12 terrorists near the Ma'on junction near Nir Oz. He was the first IDF soldier whose name was allowed to be published. Col. Steinberg, 42, left behind six children and a wife. Two more brigade commanders died in battle that morning: Colonel Asaf Hamami and Colonel Roy Joseph Levy. More than a year has passed since then, but Yehonatan's spirit, legacy, and dedication continue to accompany the Nahal Brigade. The brigade lost 53 officers and soldiers in the war, 22 of them on the cursed October 7 Massacre. 'He wasn't the commander of the sector but he summoned the brigade and went ahead, knowing he was there alone under fire,' said the current brigade commander, Col. Yair Zuckerman, who replaced Steinberg after his death. 'When Yehonatan detected the Nukhba forces, he got out of the vehicle and fought. His act of heroism was later reflected in all the brigade's fighting in Gaza: the initiative, the desire to be in front, to complete every task. When the commander behaves like this, it affects us all.' The wedding and an operation in Jenin We met last week at the spot where Steinberg fell: his widow Yiska, Col. Zuckerman and two of Yoni's subordinates: the commander of the 932nd Battalion, Lt. Col. Dotan Malul, and the brigade's logistics officer, Major Shahaf Cohen. Somewhere between Ma'on Junction and Eshkol Park, the late Lieutenant Colonel Yehonatan (Barnash) Tzor, commander of the Nahal patrol, who also came from home into the line of fire, was also killed in battle on October 7. At the place of Yehonatan Steinberg's fall, there are two olive trees. One was planted not long ago. The other, ancient and embroidered, was specially brought here. On Memorial Day, more tender saplings were added to them. 'When I planted the first tree, I said: In the place where Yoni's life was cut short, we are planting life and deepening roots,' said Yiska. She grew up in Gush Katif in the former Gaza settlements. She met Yehonatan, from Givat Ze'ev, when he was a deputy platoon commander in the 931st battalion. 'A week after the wedding, Yoni went on an operation in Jenin for 18 days. Immediately after that, he spent another 21 days away from home,' she recalled. 'Today it sounds like nothing, but back then there was no war. This was our routine.' According to her, despite his intensive service Yoni was a devoted husband and father. 'He would do everything in the house: clean, wash. Everything you need. He would arrive very tired from the army, but that didn't stop him from having a full family Shabbat meal. 'Officers usually fall asleep after the Kiddush,' she added. He instilled the value of family in his subordinates as well. 'My wife told me that she wanted to go abroad with her family and that I should stay with the girl,' said Major Shahaf, the brigade logistics officer. 'I told her: 'I'm in the army, how will I be with the girl at home for five days?' I didn't know how to tell Yehonatan the brigade commander that I had to take time off. When I told him he said 'Of course you should let her travel. She needs it and she will appreciate you for it.'' On the morning of Simchat Torah, when Yehonatan was on his way south, the residents of Shomriya, where the family lived, were asked to stay in their homes due to the terrorist infiltration. 'I said, well, if this is my Simchat Torah, we'll make it happy,' Yiska pointed out. 'The little children danced with the Torah books and the older ones threw candy at them. I look at them and said, 'How sweet, I can't wait to tell Yoni what a Simchat Torah we had.' When the soldiers knocked on the door, around six p.m., we were in the middle of a Stratego game. Unitl then I was disconnected from what was happening in the country. I keep Shabbat, but this time Shabbat kept me from all the chaos and anxiety of that day.' The division commander stopped the vehicle and told me 'Take command of the Nahal Brigade.' Col. Zuckerman was at home in Moshav Nov in the Golan Heights on October 7. A month and a half earlier, he concluded his tenure as deputy commander of the 162nd Division (to which the Nahal Brigade belongs) and was about to be appointed commander of the Northern District of the Home Front Command. 'I was debating whether to go to the district or go down south,' he said. 'I decided to go south, to the brigade's headquarters in Nahal Sorek, and when I got there I joined the 162nd Division Commander Brigadier General Itzik Cohen. We both already knew that Yehonatan was not answering since the morning. When we arrived at the Kibbutz Beit Kama area, we spoke with Lt. Col. Yoni Dahan, who informed us that he had found Steinberg's body. The division commander stopped the vehicle and told me 'Take command of the Nahal Brigade.'' Dahan, who had finished his position as 932nd Battalion's commander two months earlier, was at the time a squad commander in the company commander course. 'I was at home, in Kfar Haroeh, and I went down south with a relative who is also a combat officer,' he recalled in a telephone interview. 'On the way, I called Malul, who replaced me as the battalion commander in Hebron, and he sent me reinforcements. We passed through the Nova music festival, fought with terrorists in Urim, and then we were asked to come to Ein HaShlosha to back up Golani. 'We drove through the fields and until we spotted terrorists on road 241. We unloaded the vehicles and opened fire on them. Then I see a kippah on the side of the road that looked familiar. I look and see Yehonatan Steinberg lying lifeless. I also saw Barnash's car there, but I didn't make the connection. Then an officer I knew called me and told me that he found Barnash dead and evacuated him. At Around 11 a.m. the division commander asked me to take command of the patrol force. I asked one of the officers to evacuate Yehonatan and drove to Kerem Shalom to join the patrol. Only when I got there did Zuckerman call me and inform me that he was now the brigade commander.' 'The earth was shaking' After several months of commanding the patrol, Dahan passed the reins to Lt. Col. Naor Bublil, who was appointed to be the patrol unit's commander before the war, and returned to his previous position. 'Yehonatan was my battalion commander and then my brigade commander. I experienced difficult things that day, but when I saw him lying there I felt like the earth was shaking. If they took Steinberg away from us, it's already a drastic event. Steinberg was always a compass for us, in his life and certainly after his death. Every time you are in a dilemma, you ask yourself what Steinberg would have done,' said Dahan. And this compass also guides the soldiers and junior officers. 'When I commanded the patrol unit, there were quite a few soldiers and commanders who were wounded and returned to combat,' he added. 'They told me - 'If our brigade commander gave his life, who are we to say anything?'' Col. Zuckerman knew Steinberg even before he was drafted into the IDF. 'Yehonatan was an instructor at the Bnei Akiva branch in Givat Ze'ev with my friends. In the army, he was always a position ahead of me. We studied together for our bachelor's degree in education with a teaching certificate. Yoni was tall and a splendid leader,' he said. Yiska finds solace in the beautiful years they had. 'The greater the pain, the greater the gratitude that we were blessed with such a meaningful life together and such wonderful and sweet children,' she said. 'I cry that it's over, and in the same breath, I feel the power of gratitude. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Yoni.'

IDF clears out Hamas terror base in northern Gaza hospital	Army says completed raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya, used as Hamas command center, seizing weapons, funds and documents tied to terror group, with 60 suspects arrested inside, including some linked to October 7 attacks The IDF announced Monday that it had completed a high-stakes raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya, which the army said served as a 'terror command center' for Hamas terrorists. The raid, led by the 162nd Division, uncovered weapons, terror funds and Hamas documents, with 60 terrorists reportedly apprehended within the hospital itself, including some linked to the October 7 attacks. These detainees were questioned on-site by Unit 504 intelligence operatives before being transferred to Israel for further investigation. During the raid, IDF commandos from the elite Shayetet 13 unit were captured on film searching hospital grounds and questioning an ambulance driver, who claimed that Hamas used hospital premises and ambulances to transport wounded fighters. 'Hamas operatives are everywhere—yards, gates, offices, schools, hospitals. They even use ambulances to move their fighters,' the driver reportedly said, expressing frustration at the situation. The military noted that the operation would continue in Jabaliya with two brigades remaining while a third unit would be rotated out. The IDF estimates a few hundred Hamas fighters are still present in the city, while around 600 terrorists surrendered in the broader campaign, including many who reportedly passed through new checkpoints around Jabaliya's refugee camp. The IDF’s larger effort across northern Gaza has also seen significant challenges, with Hamas employing extensive guerrilla tactics, explosive devices and fortified positions. The operation revealed what the military says is Hamas' reliance on explosive devices fashioned from unexploded Israeli ordnance scattered across the sector, which IDF forces neutralized via controlled detonations to prevent future use.

The IDF estimates that only a few hundred Hamas fighters remain in Jabaliya, noting that the concentration of Hamas forces in the northern Gaza sector underpins the significance of the recent operations. The military reported initial difficulties in evacuating civilians from Jabaliya, but this hurdle has eased over the past week as more residents reportedly feel less constrained by Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syejqg6ejl	2024-10-28T03:23:04-07:00

Close call: IDF says investigating near-collision between F-16s a...	Fighter jet cleared for strike mission in Lebanon aborts takeoff at last moment upon spotting another aircraft on runway, veering sharply to avoid potential collision; 'It’s coming, it’s coming. Aborting takeoff,' pilot heard saying in recording A potentially catastrophic incident was narrowly averted over the weekend at northern Israel's Ramat David Air Base when an F-16 jet preparing for a strike mission in Lebanon cleared for takeoff nearly collided with another fighter jet crossing the same runway, the IDF reported Monday morning, adding that it was investigating what has led to the near-collision. According to a recording of the event, the F-16 pilot was forced to quickly adjust, averting a close call that raised immediate concerns about airfield safety protocols. Video footage reveals the pilot urgently relaying, 'It’s coming, it’s coming. Aborting takeoff.' The quick response kept the F-16 from advancing within a few hundred feet of the other plane on the runway. According to the military, the near-collision was caused by an erroneous takeoff clearance from the air traffic control tower with the pilot’s rapid response preventing what could have been a major accident. No damage or injuries were reported. Brig. Gen.

ICC in turmoil as top prosecutor's harassment scandal deepens, re...	Sources allege Karim Khan pressured female staffer for nearly a year to deny sexual harassment claims against him amid speculation arrest warrant requests for Israeli leaders might be cover for allegations International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan has allegedly pressured a female subordinate to deny sexual harassment claims against him, British newspaper The Guardian reported on Sunday. According to the report, Khan allegedly tried to engage in unwanted sexual relations with the employee and reportedly 'pressed his tongue' into the woman’s ear, as well as making other inappropriate advances. When she sought to file a complaint, Khan allegedly pressured her to submit a written statement retracting her allegations. The report also noted that the ICC swiftly dismissed the case after a brief investigation, despite having warned Khan to avoid contact with the woman. The case has prompted internal scrutiny and raised questions about the ICC’s handling of harassment complaints against senior figures. As speculation circulated, the newspaper clarified that Israel is not implicated in these emerging allegations, despite unrelated tensions over Khan’s recent calls for arrest warrants against Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The Guardian has previously been critical of Israel, having published claims of Israeli surveillance targeting ICC officials, though it did not link this recent investigation of Khan to his rulings on Israel-Palestine cases. The allegations were first reported by the Daily Mail, and according to The Guardian, based on interviews with 11 court officials and sources, there has been internal upheaval at the ICC as Khan faces these accusations. The ICC has yet to comment on any actions it may take regarding Khan’s role. At home, in the office, in hotel rooms The report alleges that Khan has harassed a lawyer under his supervision, with reports suggesting that the harassment spanned a year, from April 2023 to April 2024, escalating across various settings including Khan’s office, his home and on work trips. Sources indicated that the lawyer, in her 30s, attempted to distance herself from Khan, leading to adverse effects on her work. On one work trip to London, Khan allegedly held her hand and, over time, made repeated attempts to initiate physical contact, reportedly even engaging in inappropriate physical acts such as inserting his tongue in her ear, as shared by colleagues. Documents obtained by The Guardian suggest the lawyer feared filing an official complaint due to potential repercussions on her career and family. She also reportedly worried that critics of the ICC, such as Israel, might exploit her allegations. The ICC’s independent review mechanism advised Khan to avoid contact with the lawyer. However, the response to the allegations reportedly consisted of a rushed meeting with the victim in a hotel room in The Hague, where, according to the report, the investigation was closed within two days after the lawyer expressed distrust in the ICC’s handling of the review. The Guardian's investigation highlights persistent issues within the ICC’s internal processes, where skepticism about the independent review body has led some employees to avoid official complaints. Despite the ICC claiming the lawyer refused an external investigation, records show she agreed to meet with investigators again, contradicting claims that an outside review was offered. The incident has stirred controversy amid the ICC’s ongoing high-profile work, including Khan’s requests for arrest warrants for Israeli officials. The attempted silencing After the allegations surfaced, the court advised him to limit his contact with the employee, including avoiding evening or solo meetings and refraining from taking her on business trips. However, sources claim that, in defiance of these guidelines, Khan allegedly continued to interact with the employee, including discussing the allegations directly with her in private meetings and phone calls. An associate in Khan’s office reportedly pressured the employee to write a letter retracting her claims, emphasizing Khan’s concern about the potential political fallout if the allegations were made public. The Guardian further reports that Khan and his associate persistently encouraged the employee to retract her claims in writing between May and September, suggesting this would allow a return to 'normalcy' in their professional relationship. The employee declined to retract the allegations, yet also refrained from filing a formal complaint, though sources believe Khan's attempts to suppress the accusations may have ultimately led to a complaint being filed regardless. The Israel link and the next step Khan, 54, has firmly denied the allegations, dismissing them as a possible 'smear campaign' by court opponents. While Khan has not directly accused Israel, he has insinuated that critics of the ICC may be exploiting these claims. However, The Guardian noted that there is no evidence linking Israel to the allegations against Khan. The investigation reported that senior officials at the ICC are increasingly concerned about the court's internal handling of the allegations. Additionally, the court's staff union has called for an independent probe, managed externally to ensure impartiality. Meanwhile, the complainant is reportedly in communication with the Assembly of States Parties (ASP)—the ICC's oversight body—although no formal investigation has been launched. Sources within the ICC told The Guardian that while they worry the scandal could be politically exploited by ICC critics, including Israel, they emphasized that the arrest warrant requests against Netanyahu and Gallant were in motion before Khan was made aware of the allegations. Khan’s legal team has also denied claims that he or his associates pressured the complainant to retract her allegations, saying no such requests were made on his behalf. The ASP’s response and potential action in the matter will determine Khan’s future as ICC prosecutor, though the organization has yet to announce any formal inquiry.

IDF says investigating near-collision between F-16s at northern I...	A potentially catastrophic incident was narrowly averted over the weekend at northern Israel's Ramat David Air Base when an F-16 jet cleared for takeoff nearly collided with another fighter jet crossing the same runway, the IDF reported Monday morning, adding that it was investigating what has led to the near-collision. The F-16 pilot was forced to quickly adjust, averting a close call that raised immediate concerns about airfield safety protocols. According to the military, the near-collision was caused by an erroneous takeoff clearance from the air traffic control tower. The pilot’s rapid response prevented what could have been a severe accident. The Israeli Air Force has since launched an in-depth investigation to understand the circumstances and ensure such an incident does not recur.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sya2paneyx	2024-10-28T01:28:10-07:00	
Satellite images show extent of Israeli strike at 2 Iranian bases	Additional satellite images from Parchin base, previously linked to nuclear development, reveal destroyed building and damage to others; significant damage also visible at Khojir production site An Israeli strike on Iran damaged facilities at two military bases southeast of Tehran, previously linked by experts to Iran's former nuclear weapons program and its ballistic missile efforts, according to satellite images analyzed on Sunday. Some damaged structures were at Iran’s Parchin military base, where the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suspects high-explosive tests connected to nuclear weapons were conducted in the past. Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful, though the IAEA and Western intelligence agencies say Tehran had an active weapons program until 2003. Further damage was visible at the nearby Khojir military base, believed by analysts to house an underground tunnel network and missile production facilities. Iran’s military has not acknowledged damage at either Khojir or Parchin from Israel’s attack early Saturday, though it has said the assault killed four Iranian soldiers working in the country’s air defense systems. Iran announced Sunday a civilian also had been killed, but provided no details. Satellite images reveal damage to facilities used for combining solid fuel for missiles. Researcher David Albright noted that images from Parchin show damage to three buildings, including two used for integrating solid fuel into ballistic missiles. Another researcher stated that Planet Labs satellite photos from Parchin indicate Israel destroyed three buildings used for ballistic missile production with solid fuel, along with a warehouse. Images from Khojir show two similar buildings were also destroyed. It remains unclear how many sites in total were targeted in the Israeli attack. There have been no images of damage so far released by Iran’s military. Iranian officials have identified affected areas as being in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. Burned fields could be seen in satellite images from Planet Labs PBC around Iran’s Tange Bijar natural gas production site in Ilam province on Saturday, though it wasn’t immediately clear if it was related to the attack. Ilam province sits on the Iran-Iraq border in western Iran.

Israel inks $500 million defense deal for expanded laser intercep...	This deal heralds a new era—the era of laser defense,' Defense Ministry says after signing massive deal; first operational deployment of ground-based laser system expected next year The Defense Ministry announced Monday a major deal worth approximately NIS 2 billion (around $500 million) to boost its acquisition of advanced Iron Beam laser interception systems. Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, who signed the agreement Sunday, said, 'This deal heralds a new era—the era of laser defense,' adding that the first operational capability of the ground-based laser system is expected to be deployed within the next year. The multi-billion-shekel agreement, reached between the Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&D) and primary contractors Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems, marks a significant increase in production pace to ensure timely, high-volume delivery of laser units. The Iron Beam system, designed to intercept various aerial threats such as rockets, mortar shells, drones and cruise missiles, has demonstrated its capabilities in recent trials and is set to join Israel’s multi-tiered defense network as a cost-effective addition to the Iron Dome. 'Since the outbreak of the war, the Defense Ministry has signed hundreds of procurement orders worth billions to bolster Israeli-manufactured defense capabilities and ensure Israel’s self-reliance,' said Zamir. The ministry’s statement noted that the integration of Iron Beam will significantly enhance Israel's defensive capacity against current and future threats at a fraction of conventional interception costs. 'Global superiority' 'The Iron Beam is yet another testament to the professionalism, creativity and innovative prowess of our defense industries, supported by partnerships between defense companies and startups,' DDR&D head Brig. Gen. (res.) Dr. Danny Gold said. He noted that Israel's capability to develop and deploy advanced laser interception technology on the battlefield is a reflection of both technical mastery and effective project management. Rafael CEO Yoav Turgeman highlighted that after years of research, the Iron Beam laser system—the first of its kind worldwide—is set for deployment. 'Rafael is proud to lead the development of this high-powered, versatile laser interception system. Following a series of rigorous tests, the Iron Beam will soon reach operational maturity,' Turgeman said. Elbit President and CEO Bezhalel Machlis (Butzi) Machlis called the development 'a significant leap forward in defense against diverse threats.' Elbit, known as Israel's 'laser powerhouse,' collaborated closely on Iron Beam’s development. 'Our teams at Elbit have played a critical role in advancing this groundbreaking defense capability, which we believe will set a new standard in strategic defense for Israel,' Machlis said.

Mother recounts how she saved her infant as Hamas terrorists set ...	Amy Laban, a member of Kibbutz Nirim, recalls how she, her husband Uriel, their newborn son Kai and her mother Deborah huddled in the safe room for 6 hours, opening and closing the window to get some fresh air until IDF troops arrived to rescue them Nothing prepared 30-year-old Amy Laban, a Kibbutz Nirim member and teacher in the Eshkol Regional Council, and her husband, Uriel—a capoeira instructor and hydrotherapist—for the traumatic turn their parental leave would take. Just 10 days before the October 7 Hamas terror attack they welcomed their first son, Kai. The day before, they celebrated Simchat Torah in a decorated sukkah with their kibbutz community. The joy was threefold—they celebrated the holiday, Kai’s circumcision, and their official acceptance into Kibbutz Nirim, where Uriel had grown up after emigrating from Argentina at age 10. Amy's mother, 60-year-old Deborah Mintz from Eilat, had come to celebrate and stayed overnight. 'We woke up to rocket sirens, Amy recalled. 'I called my mom, and we rushed to the safe room. We thought it would be like usual—a few rockets, then we’d have breakfast and move on. But the rockets didn’t stop, and we realized something was different. After an hour, we started hearing gunfire and people shouting in Arabic around the kibbutz. We didn’t understand much, but my husband and I locked the safe room door and shut the metal window tight, waiting for whatever came next.' 'At 8:30 am, I heard them break into our house. We couldn’t see anything because they’d cut the power. My husband and I held the safe room door handle tightly, while my mom held our 10-day-old baby, trying to quiet him by gently putting a finger in his mouth. They couldn’t break in—they only managed to chip a small slit in the door. That’s when they set the house on fire.' 'We were in the safe room, with my mother and our 10-day-old, as the house burned around us. Smoke and soot filled the air for six hours. I got our dog into the room, but my mom’s smaller dog, scared, hid under the couch outside. When they set the house on fire, we heard him crying. We believe he was burned. They even torched our cars to make sure we had nothing left. We begged for rescue on WhatsApp. It was terrifying, but we each focused on a task. After the fire started, I stayed by the door while my husband opened the window intermittently to release the smoke. My mom held the baby.' 'I nursed Kai whenever he cried. When we thought things were quiet outside, we’d open the window and let him get some air. Whenever a terrorist passed by, we’d quickly pull him in, put him on the bed, shut the window, and crouch down. They even shot at the metal window, but thankfully, the glass held. For six hours, we played a game of opening and closing the window just to breathe until they finally rescued us. Our kibbutz’s amazing response team managed to neutralize a few terrorists with the help of four brave members until the army arrived around 2:30 pm.' 'They broke down the shutters and got us out, took us to a shelter, and guarded us outside. They found an oxygen tank to share before we headed to the hospital. Since the ambulance couldn’t reach us, two incredible soldiers, unarmed, took the risk and drove us to Soroka Medical Center. Kai was hospitalized for three days. Thankfully, all his tests came back normal. My husband and I alternated in the ER with eye irritations and smoke inhalation; we’re all still coughing. A few days later, we managed to relocate with the kibbutz to Eilat, where my mom lives.'

Chicago police investigate shooting of Jewish man en route to syn...	Gunman exchanges fire with police, reportedly shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ during confrontation; local Jewish community expresses frustration, criticizing law enforcement for not acknowledging religious identity of victim in initial reports A 39-year-old Jewish man was shot in the back while walking to a synagogue in Chicago’s West Rogers Park neighborhood on Saturday morning, in what some community members allege may be a hate-driven attack. The incident, reported by Yeshiva World News, occurred around 9:35 a.m. in an area with a significant Orthodox Jewish population. Witnesses recounted that the shooter, reportedly a 23-year-old man, yelled 'Allahu Akbar' as he exchanged fire with responding officers. The suspect initially fled but returned to a nearby alley about 20 minutes later, where he reportedly fired at police and emergency responders, striking an ambulance during the exchange. Police noted that the suspect fired from multiple locations, prompting a prolonged confrontation that ended when officers shot him multiple times, leaving him in critical condition at St. Francis Hospital. The victim was treated at a local hospital for a shoulder wound and has since been discharged. Chicago police have not publicly addressed speculation about the attack’s potential antisemitic motive, although local Jewish leaders have voiced frustration over the absence of statements acknowledging the victim's background. Police recovered the weapon used in the shooting and have refrained from commenting on an alleged motive, while local Jewish groups continue to press for answers and assurances regarding the safety of their community.

‘We’re negotiating with ourselves’: Israeli officials pessimistic...	In first summit since Sinwar’s death, Israel remains skeptical of Egypt's proposal, while officials stress any cease-fire requires Hezbollah and Iran to pressure Hamas toward negotiations Mossad Director David Barnea began talks in Doha on Sunday with CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani in an effort to renew negotiations on possible frameworks for a deal to secure the release of 101 hostages held by Hamas. This marks the first high-level meeting between the parties in two months and the first since the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The primary goal of this meeting is to advance a new plan that takes into account recent proposals brought forward by the negotiating teams. Officials have indicated that a broader, four-party summit, potentially involving Egypt and Hamas representatives, could take place in the coming days to advance these efforts. Positive developments for Israel in Gaza and Lebanon are seen as creating significant momentum for returning to intensive negotiations. The Egyptian proposal Meanwhile, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi publicly presented Cairo’s proposal, which involves a 48-hour cease-fire in exchange for the release of four hostages in return for some Palestinian prisoners. The proposal, aimed at 'moving the situation forward,' would allow for a 10-day negotiation period to discuss terms for a long-term cease-fire. According to sources cited by Al Arabiya, Hamas has welcomed Egypt’s proposal but expressed reservations about the lack of Israeli guarantees. Hamas reportedly opposes a cease-fire without a full Israeli withdrawal from northern Gaza and the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors. 'Our demands are clear and transparent, and an agreement is within reach if [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu commits to the terms discussed,' Hamas official Hossam Badran told Al Jazeera. ‘We’re negotiating with ourselves’ Israeli officials expressed skepticism about any potential breakthroughs in negotiations with Hamas, citing the upcoming U.S. presidential election on November 5 as a significant factor likely to delay progress. Officials in Jerusalem remain unconvinced of the viability of a proposal from Egypt’s intelligence chief, Hasan Rashad, according to sources familiar with the discussions. 'It’s been like this since January,' said an official close to the talks. 'We’re negotiating with ourselves, or at best with intermediaries. At no point has there been a real negotiation with Hamas. They’ve set a demand and haven’t moved an inch from it: a complete end to the fighting and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and that’s not happening.' This pessimism is rooted in a widespread belief in Israel that Hamas will settle for nothing less than a full withdrawal from Gaza, including from the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah crossing. Netanyahu is seen as unlikely to agree to such terms, fearing it could destabilize his coalition due to opposition from ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. Still, Mossad Director Barnea has been developing a new negotiation framework over the past three weeks. On Thursday, Barnea met with Rashad in Cairo to update him on the plan, which will likely incorporate elements of both the Egyptian proposal and other options. Barnea remains hopeful that the intimate setting of Doha could restart direct negotiations for a hostage deal. The discussions in Doha are also expected to touch on the Lebanese front. According to a source quoted by The Wall Street Journal, Barnea does not believe Israel should agree to a cease-fire in Lebanon unless Hezbollah and Iran pressure Hamas to release the hostages in Gaza. Separately, Lebanese network LBCI cited a diplomatic source who said, 'The meeting in Doha has opened a door. There’s been slight progress on Gaza, and there’s genuine interest in a prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel.' The diplomatic source added that Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri had informed Qatar and Egypt that Hezbollah is willing to separate the fronts and accept UN Resolution 1701 as part of a combined package, meaning the Lebanon issue will be included in the ongoing negotiations. A Qatari-Egyptian meeting with Hamas is expected, and a high-ranking Qatari security envoy is set to visit Beirut to address Lebanon’s concerns and demands. In response, Berri’s office said, 'The recent media reports on Speaker Berri’s remarks regarding the negotiations are inaccurate.'

Victim of suspected Glilot attack named as Betzalel Carmi	Retired educator, 72, survived by his Holocaust survivor parents, Abraham and Rivka, his four children—Uri, Anat, Yuval and Shlomit—and his grandchildren The man killed in a suspected ramming attack in Glilot on Sunday has been identified as Bezalel Carmi, 72, a father of four from Rishon Lezion. Police have not yet determined if the incident was an accident or an attack. Hundreds gathered for Carmi’s funeral at the Gordon Cemetery in his hometown. Rishon Lezion Mayor Raz Kinstlich wrote: 'Bezalel leaves behind two Holocaust survivor parents, Abraham and Rivka, along with four children—Uri, Anat, Yuval and Shlomit—and grandchildren. A psychologist by profession, Bezalel was an educator with the Youth Aliyah movement, an organization dedicated to education, Aliyah and Zionism. Bezalel’s family has deep roots in the city, where he raised and taught generations of people. 'During a tour with a group of retirees in the Glilot area, he was struck by a truck as he stepped off a bus. It’s still unclear if this was an attack or an accident, but it was a tragic and devastating event. Bezalel's life and story were cut short in an instant. Rishon Lezion shares in the family’s profound grief and mourns his passing.' The driver, identified as Rami Nasrallah from the Arab town of Qalansawe, reportedly had about 70 previous traffic violations. His body was sent to Tel Aviv’s National Center of Forensic Medicine for an autopsy to determine if a medical event, such as a heart attack, might have contributed to the incident. Nasrallah’s family has denied any terrorist motives, claiming he had a heart condition and had recently undergone open-heart surgery. 'It was not an attack,' said his brother, Mahmoud Nasrallah. 'My brother has health issues and wouldn’t do such a thing. He is a simple man just trying to earn a living and go home. He has no connection to anything like that, either closely or distantly.'

Battered and cornered: How Hamas clings on after major losses	Since Oct. 27, 2023, the IDF has swept through Gaza to dismantle Hamas and retrieve hostages; a year on, Hamas’ tunnel network and arsenal are mostly destroyed and 117 hostages have returned; however, Hamas persists in the military's dead zones Hamas’ deadly surprise attack, which catalyzed the now more-than-year-long war, proved that the perennial Gaza problem won’t resolve itself. In a single strike, the terrorist organization shattered the previous notion that maintaining its rule in Gaza, along with cash infusions into the Palestinian enclave, could serve as a sufficient deterrent or smokescreen. Hamas terrorists brutally attacked Israeli territory in what many see as one of Israel’s worst security, political and intelligence failures. Yet, even more than a year after the massacre, the Security Cabinet has not defined a strategic policy for Gaza’s future. Questions remain unresolved about what should take shape 'the day after'—whether weakened Hamas control, Palestinian Authority governance, moderate Arab states’ involvement or even Jewish settlement—all possibilities that have yet to be formally decided. The focus has largely shifted to distant fronts in Lebanon and Iran, leaving Gaza’s fate uncertain. Nonetheless, there is consensus on one point: the IDF must maintain operational freedom in Gaza to prevent the rebuilding of terrorist organizations’ power, a priority that contrasts starkly with the approach before October 7. This is the situation on the one-year anniversary of the ground offensive in Gaza. Fighting in circles On October 7, faced with an unprecedented assault, Israel saw no alternative but to initiate a full-scale war with two core objectives: dismantling Hamas' military and governance capabilities and securing the return of hostages taken during the attack. In response, the Israeli Air Force launched extensive airstrikes across Gaza, which began after several hours when forces were unable to counter the onslaught effectively. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of reservists reported for duty, with an unprecedented mobilization rate, preparing for action across multiple fronts. This marked the initial phase of operations in Gaza, during which a ground offensive was delayed for nearly three weeks as plans were finalized and political leaders evaluated potential consequences. After initial hesitations, Israel entered Gaza on October 27, aiming to exert military pressure on Hamas to secure the hostages' release and ultimately weaken the organization’s grip on Gaza. However, it soon became clear that achieving the second objective could drag on indefinitely. Following a brief month of ground operations, fighting paused for a week-long hostage exchange during which Hamas released 80 women and children. Israel resumed its offensive thereafter, pushing into Khan Younis and later, under renewed diplomatic pressures, advancing into Rafah as well. The guiding belief—'military pressure would coerce Hamas into a hostage deal'—proved ineffective. Currently, though a formal cease-fire was not declared, combat operations in much of Gaza have concluded without Israel fully achieving its strategic goals. This final phase unfolded unevenly; by early 2024, Israel had ceased its ground offensive in 70% of Gaza's territory, and by August, 20% more—including Rafah—was similarly quiet. In the remaining areas, the presence of hostages led to a halt in direct military action, especially following the execution of six hostages in a Rafah tunnel. The IDF is currently concentrated along the Philadelphi Corridor and in the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as along the Netzarim Corridor, which divides northern Gaza from the rest of the territory. From these key positions, forces conduct targeted raids, including those in Jabaliya and Beit Lahia. The IDF has prepared extensively for this prolonged deployment, establishing outposts along the Netzarim Corridor and constructing operational roads in both Netzarim and the Philadelphi Corridor, where forces are able to navigate even with light, unarmored vehicles. IDF officers note that fighting in Gaza has become cyclical. The buildings where soldiers are now engaging in Jabaliya and its refugee camp are the same areas where the 98th Division previously operated and cleared in May, and the 162nd Division did so again during the height of the ground offensive last November and December. In these zones, Hamas has managed to reactivate some of its tunnels that were previously destroyed by the IDF and has rigged many areas with explosives, some of which are reportedly made from unexploded IDF munitions left on the battlefield in recent months. Effectively, Hamas has reestablished its presence within these zones, using the cover of the local population. In Rafah, the IDF continues to target sites where Hamas is attempting to re-operate or where it still retains certain capabilities, especially underground assets. However, these operations are primarily localized, carried out at the battalion and brigade levels, and are focused on securing and maintaining control of the nearby Philadelphi Corridor. As time passes, the IDF increasingly acknowledges that a full withdrawal from Gaza’s Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors, where Israeli forces maintain a continuous presence, remains unlikely in the near future. As a result, reserve brigades are being informed of continued deployment rotations in these areas through 2025. 'Hamas rule won’t collapse unless an alternative governance structure is established,' military officials say. Meanwhile, the government has delayed settling on a clear long-term strategy, instead considering local solutions with uncertain effectiveness, such as distributing aid to Gaza residents through American contractors. This approach, say officials, effectively leaves Hamas in power, weakened but still present. Without an official directive for a 'post-Hamas' Gaza, the military cannot plan effectively beyond conducting limited, targeted operations. The IDF has not operated across most of Gaza's territory for over six months. In large cities such as Khan Younis, signs of Hamas' resurgence are apparent, even more so than in northern Gaza. Israel’s 'maintenance tax' to the U.S. for humanitarian supplies—fuel, electricity and medicine—often ends up in the hands of Hamas or local militias, underscoring the instability in areas without Hamas' control. Ironically, some residents are reported to prefer the group’s return for the relative order it once imposed, as street safety has deteriorated in its absence. As a military force, Hamas has sustained significant losses. Estimates indicate that 80-90% of its mid- to long-range rocket stockpile has been destroyed, and roughly 15,000-20,000 Hamas fighters have been killed or incapacitated out of an original 30,000, though some consider these figures high. Despite this, Hamas continues to recruit, while thousands of additional fighters come from other factions, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The IDF estimates that large portions of Hamas’ tunnel network remain, particularly as disconnected local structures rather than the integrated 'metro network.' Many are located in areas where the IDF has refrained from operating in, such as central Gaza towns, due to fears that these sites may be holding hostages. ‘Force is not the answer to everything’ On October 7, Palestinian terror groups kidnapped 251 people, both alive and deceased; of these, 117 have been returned—most through negotiations—along with the bodies of 37. Yet, 97 remain captive, among them long-held detainees Hadar Goldin, Oron Shaul, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed. Current estimates indicate roughly 50 captives remain alive, surviving in harsh conditions. Talks for their release resumed on Sunday, with a summit in Qatar following prior attempts that failed over Hamas’ demand to end the war and Israel’s insistence on maintaining a military presence in Gaza. However, a new dilemma complicates this round: who holds decision-making power on the other side? Following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, high-ranking commanders remain in Gaza, including Rafah brigade commander Muhammad Shabana, northern Gaza’s Az al-Din al-Haddad, and Sinwar’s brother Muhammad. Yet, some hostages are held by other groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad and rogue factions. Thus, while Sinwar’s elimination may have created new negotiating opportunities, it also presents new complexities. 'Not every objective can be achieved solely through military action,' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant emphasized in his address at the state memorial ceremony for war casualties at Mount Herzl, facing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'Force is not the answer to everything. To fulfill our moral duty—to bring the captives home—we may need to make painful compromises. We must do this for them, for their families, for the soldiers who fell for this cause, for the legacy of the IDF and for our Jewish and national ethos. 'This is our responsibility—my responsibility as defense minister, just as it was on the morning of October 7, throughout the entire year of war, encompassing both achievements and failures, the heavy costs, and the national challenges we are committed to addressing.' In a letter to the Cabinet, Gallant noted that the war’s goals require a strategic shift. A well-known point of contention is that the prime minister is unwilling to make the same concessions as the defense minister to secure the release of Israelis still held captive— a disagreement that nearly cost Gallant his position. In recent weeks, both sides have even discussed a 'small deal,' a step that could pave the way for a broader agreement, one that many families continue to hope for. Against this backdrop, Osnat Sharabi Matalon, whose brothers Yossi Sharabi and Eli Sharabi remain captive in Gaza, described the emotions felt by families amid renewed talks following prior dashed hopes. 'We’ve learned not to hope,' she said. 'We’re always hopeful for negotiations and an agreement to bring back all the hostages, and we’ll keep rising each day with that hope in our hearts. But we’ve also learned not to listen to the noise around us. Until I see Eli, until I see the hostages in a Red Cross vehicle, I won’t believe it’s real.' Osnat added that the last sign of life from her brother Eli arrived many months ago but explained that 'it doesn’t mean much. He’s in a war zone. We’re very worried. The last six hostages were alive just moments before they were killed, so proof of life doesn’t tell us anything, even if there’s some tiny piece of information. Just bring them back.' Her brother Yossi has been confirmed to have been killed in captivity. 'I wish decision-makers could walk in our shoes,' she added. 'I wish they could feel what it means. Our loved ones are there. If it were their loved ones, they’d be talking differently; I’m sure of it. If there’s a way to save someone who is still down there in those tunnels, without food, air or water, and in the worst physical and mental condition, then they must do everything possible. Don’t forget why we went to war and why we’re still at war.' Dedicated heroes amid the high costs of war Since October 7, the war has claimed the lives of 771 Israeli soldiers, including 360 who fell in Gaza. The ground offensive across the Gaza Strip has also left 2,368 soldiers wounded, with 452 seriously injured, 726 sustaining moderate injuries and 1,190 with minor injuries. 'He talked about the fact that there was a real price to be paid within this war but that they were willing to pay it,' said Marcy and Howard Oster, the parents of Sergeant First Class (res.) Amichai Yisrael Yehoshua Oster who was killed on January 1 by an explosive device on the outskirts of the Daraj Tuffah sector in northern Gaza. When the war broke out, he had been in the United States but quickly returned to Israel. 'He felt that he needed to be fighting for his country. He felt he needed to be part of it.' His mother shared a poignant memory: 'A couple of weeks before he fell, we had this conversation, where I told him that I felt terrible that he was fighting this war, that we brought him here. We knew he would have to serve in the army. And he looked at me and said, 'what makes you think that if we hadn't made Aliyah, I wouldn't be here fighting anyway?' And that has given me a lot of comfort over the last few months.' Gideon Abbas, the brother of Maj. Jamal Abbas who fell on November 18 in Sheikh Ajlin in northern Gaza, described his brother as one of the first forces to enter the hostile territory. 'This was always his way,' he said. 'Even as a child during the Second Lebanon War, he wouldn’t go to the shelter. He’d say, ‘If everyone is fighting, we’re with them.’ The longing for him, the pain—it’s indescribable. You think life goes on, but the emptiness remains the same, and you try to build around it, which isn’t easy.' Gideon noted that, on October 7, Jamal 'rushed forward, feeling that this was his moment.' He added that he believes the bravery of soldiers like his brother deserves more recognition in Israeli society. 'People did things you only see in movies. Look at Yom Kippur War; what we accomplished was remarkable, yet all people remember is the failure. We want them to remember the courage, to know there’s a generation here that hasn’t forgotten the essence of Israel, the reason it was established, and ran into the fire for the hope that we could live better.' Abbas also referenced the Nation-State Law, which alienated many of Israel's minorities, including the Druze community, and a recent tense meeting with Interior Minister Moshe Arbel, saying, 'We’re not mercenaries, here just to die for the state. That’s not how it works. There’s talk of creating separate legislation for the Druze community, and my grandfather was outraged by this. Twelve of our best Druze sons have fallen in this war alone, leaving aside the 432 who’ve fallen over the years—and even more if we count before Israel’s establishment. The feeling of second-class status isn’t felt in the streets; Israeli society embraces us, and everyone shares the burden. But that’s not how the state treats us. We want equality for the Druze, without being separated from the Jewish people.'

According to the Guardian, the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court allegedly responded to a formal complaint of sexual misconduct by trying to persuade the alleged victim to deny the claims. Multiple ICC staff with knowledge of the allegations against Karim Khan said the prosecutor and another official close to him repeatedly urged the woman to disavow claims about his behavior towards her. The alleged attempts to deter the woman from formally pursuing the claims took place in phone calls and in person, four sources said.

Smotrich: 'Palestinians are part of Iran's axis of evil'	Finance minister calls for US and Western allies to seize 'rare opportunity' to remove Iranian regime and its proxies and eliminate Tehran's nuclear program Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Sunday that the 'Palestinians are part of the axis of evil,' urging the next U.S. administration, along with Western allies, to topple the mullah regime in Iran. Smotrich added that 'Iran's nuclear program, which threatens the State of Israel and the entire Western world must be terminated.' Speaking at a local conference, Smotrich declared that 'once in several generations, a rare opportunity arises to reshape history, alter global power structures and redefine the future. In the near future, we will face crucial decisions that could lead to a new, right Middle East.' Smotrich outlined two main pillars supporting this vision: a shift in Israeli and international perspectives and dismantling the axis of evil. 'The awakening in Israel and globally is a historic opportunity we must not miss to establish a new Middle East, where west of the Jordan River there exists one and only national definition—the state of the Jewish people,' Smotrich said. 'The world has witnessed the horror and brutality that emerged from Gaza, and, like Israeli society, it now understands that if there is an Iranian axis of evil and a bloc of moderate states signing the Abraham Accords, the Palestinians are deeply embedded within Iran's axis of evil.' 'The vast majority of Gaza’s residents supported Hamas and its massacre, as did the Palestinian Authority and much of the Arab public in the West Bank,' he added. 'Those who back such acts and have not condemned them to this day are on the wrong side of history. They are deeply part of the Iranian axis of evil, ‘the problem,’ and cannot be part of the solution.' Smotrich falsely claimed that the PLO Executive Committee convened to hold a memorial for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Instead, Palestinian officials held a memorial for all those killed in Gaza. 'The axis of evil has been metastasizing for many years and poses a threat not only to Israel but to the entire Western world,' he said. 'We are eliminating Hamas, defeating Hezbollah, destabilizing the Iranian regime and acting beyond that. In one month, Israel has taken out Sinwar, Nasrallah and top terrorist figures, some of whom the U.S. has been pursuing for years. We can and must continue to join forces, work to bring down the Iranian mullah regime, and dismantle their nuclear program, which threatens global peace.'

Iran says informed of Israeli attack hours in advance	Iranian FM claims messages exchanged with 'various parties' ahead of upcoming air raid; Netanyahu's office denies claims Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi claimed Sunday that Iran had been informed by 'various parties' in advance of Israel's attack over the weekend, according to Iranian media. Araghchi indicated that hours before the Israeli strikes, messages were exchanged with undisclosed parties, prompting unspecified actions by Tehran. In a letter to the UN Security Council, Araghchi condemned Israel’s actions as a 'serious threat to international peace' and called for an urgent session. He asserted that Iran reserves its right to a 'legal and legitimate response' per international law and the UN Charter. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian echoed this stance, saying, 'We do not seek war, but we will defend our nation's rights,' and pledged a response to what he called the 'aggression of the Zionist regime.' Earlier on Sunday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said that Israel’s attack against Iran 'should neither be exaggerated nor minimized.' Meanwhile, Ebrahim Azizi, head of the Iranian parliament’s national security committee, told Qatar’s The New Arab newspaper that Iran’s response would be 'smart,' 'timely,' and 'deterrent' to ensure the 'Americans and Zionists regret these actions.' Reports indicate mixed reactions to the advance notifications: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denied having sent any such message to Iran regarding the attack’s timing or targets. However, The Wall Street Journal reported that Arab and European countries relayed warnings to Iran beforehand. Iranian officials also told The New York Times that Israel’s targeting of air defense systems, specifically the S-300s supplied by Russia, has raised significant concerns for Iran, as critical energy and economic sites may now be more vulnerable to future attacks. Following these developments, the Security Cabinet convened late Sunday to discuss the potential for Iranian retaliation and to review the ongoing hostage negotiations.

THAAD deployment paved way for Israeli retaliatory airstrikes on ...	Military experts suggest Israel 'broke its fear barrier,' potentially leading to future strikes on Iranian nuclear sites Just days after the US bolstered Israeli air defense by deploying a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and 100 soldiers, Israel on Saturday carried out a large retaliatory strike on Iran. An estimated 100 Israeli aircraft participated in the hourslong operation over Iran's night skies. The Israeli military stated that it had 'conducted targeted and precise strikes on military targets in Iran—thwarting immediate threats.' Military sites in Tehran, in the heart of Iranian territory, were among those struck. 'This was a game changer, a transition from the shadow war to a new level of the game which is now out in the open,' Sharona Shir Zablodovsky, an expert on public policy and national security at the Dvorah Forum said. 'Israel demonstrated the ability to attack several sites simultaneously, showing it has precise intelligence.' Israel’s military said the strike targeted missile manufacturing facilities used by Iran in attacks over the past year. Iranian surface-to-air missiles and 'aerial capabilities that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran' were also targeted 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran,' the statement continued. Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies’ Iran Program, said the THAAD deployment signaled US trust that Israel would not act against American interests. 'This was a meaningful strategic and operative move that was a message to both Iran and Israel,' Citrinowicz told The Media Line. 'It was a fruitful American effort to coerce Israel into operating only against military targets but also sent a message to Iran that the US will back Israel, especially in defending it.' He described the strike as 'a historical event that completely changed the relationship between Iran and Israel.' 'The attack reflected an Israeli will to balance the deterrence equation vis-à-vis Iran, signaling that massive rocket fire toward Israel cannot go unanswered, but without leading to a wider escalation, while also taking into consideration the will of the American administration to not escalate before the US elections,' he said. For more than a year, Israel has been entangled in a multifront war with Iranian-backed groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, and other areas. This year marked the first time Iran and Israel exchanged direct blows after years of engaging in a shadow war. Prior to Saturday, the latest direct attack occurred last month when Iran fired at least 180 ballistic missiles toward Israel, most of which were intercepted before reaching their targets. Last weekend, a drone launched by Hezbollah, Iran’s Lebanese proxy, targeted the private residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That incident escalated Israel’s threats of retaliation against Iran, which materialized over the weekend. 'Israel had to respond to an attack by a country which shares no border with Israel and threatens its existence,' Shir Zablodovsky said. 'The defense echelon is well aware of Iran’s ability to take a major toll on Israel.' Now the region once again awaits Iran’s decision on whether to respond, in what has become an increasingly violent tit-for-tat. On Sunday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei posted on the X social media platform that the damage from the Israeli strike 'should neither be exaggerated nor minimized.' His post did not make clear whether Iran intends to retaliate. Shir Zablodovsky said that Khamenei would not give up easily on his '40-year-old project to destroy Israel.' The full extent of the Israeli strike and the damage exacted remains unclear. Media reports quoting unnamed Israeli, American, and Iranian officials indicate that Iran’s ability to manufacture long-range ballistic missiles and drones has been crippled. Other reports allege that Iranian air defense capabilities have been significantly hit. Online satellite imagery shows apparent damage to a suspected nuclear site in Parchin and a missile production facility in Khojir. Israel’s yearlong war began after Hamas, the armed group ruling the Gaza Strip, carried out a surprise offensive on Israel’s southern border. The conflict soon expanded, with Hezbollah in Lebanon firing rockets and drones toward northern Israel. The northern front mostly simmered below the surface until this summer, when Israel pivoted the main focus of the war to Lebanon. After numerous attacks on Hezbollah, including the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, the terror organization is scrambling to recuperate with the help of Iran. For decades, Iran has funded and armed Hezbollah as a cornerstone of its regional strategy. With Iran and Israel more than 1,000 miles apart, the presence of Hezbollah on Israel’s border helped Iran deter Israel from an attack. That strategy of deterrence now seems to have failed. 'The Iranians underestimated how much the weakening of Hezbollah gives Israel freedom to attack on Iranian soil,' Citrinowicz said. Israel is believed to have previously contemplated a preemptive strike against Iran’s nuclear program, but such an attack has not been carried out, perhaps due to numerous logistical challenges. These include the large distance between the two countries, the need for Israeli jets to fly over and refuel in enemy territory, and the requirement for sophisticated, heavy bombs capable of penetrating underground nuclear targets. Additionally, Israel was deterred by concerns that Hezbollah, one of the world's strongest terrorist organizations, would unleash its capabilities on Israel at Tehran's behest. So far, Hezbollah attacks have not devastated Israel as security experts had feared. However, the group has not been a paper tiger, continuing to fire dozens of rockets and drones at Israel daily. Over the weekend, two Israeli citizens were killed by a rocket fired at an Arab-Israeli village near the border. On Sunday morning, a Hezbollah drone hit an aviation plant in northern Israel. Hours later, Hezbollah fired over 75 projectiles in a single barrage toward the same area, signaling it was still ready to fight. 'Hezbollah should not be eulogized just yet,' Shir Zablodovsky said. 'They still have military power, which they prefer to use incrementally by exhausting Israel and its society.' Iran may still call on Hezbollah to strike back at Israel if the Islamic Republic chooses to respond to Saturday’s attack through a proxy. Before settling on the military sites targeted in this strike, Israel is believed to have considered targeting Iranian nuclear sites or oil production facilities. Netanyahu was under significant American pressure to scale down the operation to avoid causing a major escalation just days before the US presidential election. 'There is no doubt that the election had a direct effect on Israel's decision,' Shir Zablodovsky said. 'It did not strike where it wanted to strike. Israel would have wanted to target major infrastructure but did not. Had it targeted Iran’s oil depots, prices would have skyrocketed, and this would have had an effect on the vote in the US, as the economy is the main issue Americans vote on.' In Israel, the strike is being portrayed as a success with potentially widespread implications for the direction of the war. 'If in the past, there was a low probability that Israel would attack nuclear facilities without American backing, this has now changed,' Citrinowicz said. 'Looking into the future, with Hezbollah now weakened and Israelis’ ability to operate freely in Iranian airspace, as Iran progresses with its nuclear program, this option can no longer be ruled out. Israel broke its fear barrier with this attack.' Shir Zablodovsky described the ongoing conflict as 'a chess game, not a short war.' 'The difficulty in this game is that there are many players with significant military power,' she said. 'This is a historical era which will redesign the Middle East.'

Explosions heard at US base near Iraq-Syria border, report says	Pro-Iranian Iraqi militia-affiliated news agency Sabereen News reported Sunday on explosions at the Al-Tanf base, a U.S.-controlled military installation near the Iraq-Syria border. The report, attributed to a militia-associated source, alleged that the base was attacked by drones, although official confirmation was not immediately available. Earlier, Iraq’s pro-Iran Kataib Hezbollah, part of the so-called Islamic Resistance in Iraq, issued a statement condemning Israel’s recent strikes on Iranian targets, reportedly conducted through Iraqi airspace. The group described the air raids as 'a dangerous precedent that Iran had not previously encountered,' warning that the use of Iraqi and regional airspace to facilitate such attacks could not have occurred 'without prior coordination and agreement with the U.S., which controls Iraqi skies.' The militia group warned the U.S. that 'aggression against Iran represents a serious violation that should not go unanswered' and that America 'must pay for its recklessness.' Additionally, the statement emphasized that if Israel 'is not made to pay a heavy price for its aggression, it will likely continue to escalate its actions, not only against Iran but potentially against Iraq as well.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk00gsfhg1x	2024-10-27T11:59:20-07:00

Israel probes truck's ‘black box’ for clues in suspected Glilot a...	Body of driver Rami Nasrallah to undergo autopsy to determine if he suffered a heart attack before the crash that killed one and injured dozens; police disclose he had nearly 70 prior traffic violations Israeli authorities announced on Sunday they are analyzing data from the 'black box' of a truck involved in a suspected ramming attack in Glilot, which resulted in one fatality and injuries to 36 others. Officials have not yet confirmed if the incident was deliberate or a freak accident. The truck's Electronic Control Module (ECM), often called a 'black box,' captures data like speed, braking and engine status, especially useful in accident investigations. The driver, identified as Rami Nasrallah from Qalansawe, reportedly had about 70 previous traffic violations. His body was sent to Tel Aviv’s National Center of Forensic Medicine for an autopsy to determine if a medical event, such as a heart attack, might have contributed to the incident. Nasrallah’s family has denied any terrorist motives, claiming he had a heart condition and had recently undergone open-heart surgery. 'It was not an attack,' said his brother, Mahmoud Nasrallah. 'My brother has health issues and wouldn’t do such a thing. He is a simple man just trying to earn a living and go home. He has no connection to anything like that, either closely or distantly. 'He probably had a heart attack or something that happened; he has a medical history. He is married and has five children. We want his body returned to us. He is an ordinary person who went out to provide for his kids; they can check this. This was just an accident; he has never harmed anyone in his life.' The police said they were considering all possible motives and assigned the case to the Tel Aviv district's central unit, and initial findings dismissed claims from witnesses suggesting the driver was armed with a knife. Meanwhile, the identity of the deceased has not been disclosed. Most of the injured were retired bankers on a group trip, and six remain in serious condition.

Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili called on Sunday for people to take to the streets to protest the results of Saturday's disputed parliamentary election, which the electoral commission said the ruling party, the Georgian Dream, had won. Zourabichvili, a former Georgian Dream ally, said she did not recognize the results and referred to the vote as a 'Russian special operation.' She also called the elections 'a total fraud, a total taking away of your votes,' The results were a blow for pro-Western Georgians who had cast the election as a choice between a ruling party that has deepened ties with Russia and an opposition aiming to fast-track integration with Europe.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjltpwnejg	2024-10-27T10:39:31-07:00	
IDF directs media to Hezbollah's secret cash bunker under Beirut ...	IDF Arabic spokesman directs journalists to revisit Beirut’s Al-Sahel Hospital, alleging Hezbollah bunker with $500 million hidden beneath; he calls on Lebanon’s media and government to investigate, asserting Israeli intelligence identified concealed entry IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee addressed Lebanese journalists on Sunday, directing them to search for an alleged Hezbollah underground bunker beneath Beirut's Al-Sahel Hospital. The facility, according to the military, is reportedly used by Hezbollah as a secure storage site for approximately $500 million in assets. Lt. Col. Adraee’s remarks follow attempts by Lebanese journalists to locate the entrance to the bunker. Adraee questioned journalists’ expectations, saying, 'Did you expect Hezbollah to simply guide you to Nasrallah’s hideout?' He emphasized that Hezbollah would likely take measures to obscure the site’s true purpose but confirmed that Israeli intelligence had identified the entrance location. In a detailed description, Adraee referenced various televised reports that showed Lebanese journalists searching a basement area under the hospital. The footage, he explained, shows key features, such as a 15-meter wall suspected of hiding the bunker entrance. He encouraged journalists and authorities to revisit the site, examine structural points like stairwells and walls, and investigate further to confirm the bunker’s existence. Adraee concluded by inviting Lebanon’s government, international human rights organizations and media to examine the hospital’s alleged Hezbollah connections, noting Israel’s knowledge of other related locations and activities.

We're fashioning post-war Gaza': The contractor set to facilitat...	Israeli businessman Moti Kahana, head of US-based logistics company GDC chosen to deliver aid to Palestinian enclave, says Hamas' days of looting aid and selling it are almost over 'We're not here to replace the IDF, to hunt down terrorists or kill Hamas operatives. Our role will be to secure humanitarian aid and ensure that civilians in Gaza receive it and that Hamas and other criminals don't steal it. This will give a better future for Gazans and allow Israel to focus on fighting terrorism where it needs to. The U.S. Army sometimes brings in contractors and that’s how we should be seen too.' So says Moti Kahana, an American-Israeli businessman and CEO of the American logistics company GDC, which has been chosen to serve as a contractor to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza by the IDF and secure 'humanitarian zones,' which will be like neighborhoods in Gaza cleared from terrorists. GDC has been in talks with the Defense Ministry and the U.S. for seven months, but things have come to fruition only now. Israel has concluded that international organizations can no longer distribute humanitarian aid because it has been looted by Hamas, allowing it to maintain its grip on power. At first, some ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, demanded that IDF soldiers distribute aid. However, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi opposed this, leading to the idea of enlisting a company with extensive experience in this area. Kahana is known for rescuing the last Jew from Afghanistan and for standing behind humanitarian operations in Syria and Iraq, such as bringing hundreds of injured Syrians to Safed's Ziv Medical Center in 2016. His security company will protect the humanitarian convoys to secure neighborhoods in Gaza, which will be cleared of terrorists. The company, which presented its plan to the U.S. State Department and the White House, operates under international law and maintains contact with the UN, the World Bank and various humanitarian organizations. 'I'm essentially a contractor. The company is made up of former soldiers from elite units in the U.S., UK and France. The common denominator is that none of them are Jewish,' Kahana said in an interview with Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth. 'There will surely be incidents when the IDF distributes aid, as has happened in the past, and civilians would get killed. The whole world goes crazy, and antisemitism skyrockets. When an IDF soldier tries to help, the world screams 'Jews are killing Arabs.' I'm not distributing aid as the IDF does but as a logistics company.' A new sheriff in town 'Gaza is starting to look like Somalia,' Kahana added. 'I saw this in Afghanistan. The Islamic State began with bombings against the Taliban. That's what's going to happen in Gaza. When you bring in aid, you’re bringing in money and then Hamas tries to steal it. It's not only Hamas; there are also criminal organizations. Then attacks will start within Gaza, and fatalities won't include only Palestinian civilians.' According to Kahana, his company's employees have extensive experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'These are people with 25 years of experience or more. They've been in Baghdad and Kabul. This is what's going to happen: You, as Israelis, bring in aid, don't secure it and criminals or Hamas steal it and build terrorist capabilities.' 'You're putting in money to fund them. That's our job. The company is made up of 'war junkies,' people who love fighting bad guys. They really believe this is the right thing to do,' he explained. Aren't you afraid of Hamas and what will happen in Gaza? 'We are, but we have the experience to ensure we don’t die. You trust your equipment and your background. These are people who have fought terrorism their whole lives.' What will happen if someone tries to rob your convoys? 'First of all, there's an initial team that comes in with protective gear and non-lethal equipment. The first line is not there to fight. They can deter using rubber bullets, water or warning shots. But if that doesn’t help, the second team will come in. If something happens, we'll send a message to Gazan residents: you don’t want to mess with us. 'I promise you that message will get through quickly. They'll understand that a new sheriff is in town. There may be a bit of chaos at first, but they’ll get it soon enough. What’s important is that they will discover there’s food, bakeries and kindergartens in protected neighborhoods. We're the ones fashioning post-war Gaza.' Kahana stressed the company will initially operate as a pilot project but plans to expand its activities throughout Gaza. 'I want to stress that we’re not talking about a ghetto. People will be able to come and go from the secured neighborhoods. There will be plenty of food and excellent schools inside. 'Before long, all of Gaza will want to look like this and we’ll build another neighborhood and another. The whole world will contribute money if they see there’s hope. The same thing happened in Baghdad.' 24/7 coordination with the IDF 'This will begin stabilizing post-war Gaza,' Kahana continued, 'so that people there will understand there’s free food available. There isn’t a starvation problem in Gaza. The problem is that criminals steal food and sell it, becoming very rich. The American plan is to flood Gaza with so much food that the price of sugar won’t make it worth stealing.' 'Israel delivered over $500 million to Gaza in humanitarian aid in one year. Hamas took that aid and sold it and now they have money. If you want to destroy Hamas – stop funding them,' he said. One of the people managing the project is an extraordinary figure: Justin Sapp, a Green Beret colonel and CIA officer. After the September 11 attacks, he and 11 other soldiers were sent to Afghanistan by the U.S., riding horses to capture one of the country's major cities. His story, along with his comrades, was the basis for the film 12 Strong. He's now constructing the entire operation strategy for operating in Gaza. Aren’t you worried about clashing with IDF soldiers? 'That's what I fear the most. I need 24/7 coordination with the IDF and that’s why I brought in several former high-ranking Israelis from the Mossad, the Border Police Counter-Terrorism Unit and others to be responsible for those stationed at the command post.' How much will your aid cost? 'We told the Americans, 'You wasted $350 million on a pier that sank after eight weeks.' We gave the Americans a discount: $200 million for six months and it won't sink.'

Dr. Homayoun Sameh voices support for Iran’s 'legitimate defense' against what he describes as 'aggression by Zionist regime on Iranian territory' A member of Iran’s parliament representing the Jewish community condemned on Sunday Israel's strikes on Iran over the weekend and called for a 'strong response to this aggression at the appropriate time.' Dr. Homayoun Sameh voiced his support for Iran’s 'legitimate defense' against what he described as 'aggression by the Zionist regime on Iranian territory.' Offering condolences to the families of Iranian soldiers killed in the attack, he acknowledged their sacrifice, saying they 'gave their lives for the country.' He also praised Iran’s military and the Revolutionary Guard, commending their commitment to 'safeguarding the nation’s security.' Dr. Sameh added that, despite reports, Iran’s air defenses had been effective, intercepting 'numerous enemy drones targeting military sites.' Dismissing the strike’s impact as 'minimal,' he argued that reports of extensive damage were 'false propaganda' and emphasized that the aircraft involved had 'failed to penetrate Iranian airspace.' Criticizing Western support for Israel, Dr. Sameh said, 'The Zionist regime instigated these hostilities and has repeatedly engaged in acts of terror and sabotage.'

Hamas offers new deal: End the war or no hostage deal	Senior Hamas official says terror group plans to present 'comprehensive deal to end war,' which includes Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and release of all hostages Hamas officials revealed that the terror group plans to propose a 'comprehensive deal to end the war immediately,' Saudi network Asharq reported on Sunday. The proposal would call for Israel to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip as part of a prisoner exchange that includes the release of all Israeli hostages. A senior Hamas official emphasized that such a deal 'would end the war once and for all, and would include a prisoner swap where all Israeli hostages are released in exchange for an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons.' The official added that Hamas would consider other ideas from mediators but stressed that ending the war is non-negotiable. 'Without that, there will be no deal,' he declared. Another senior Hamas official, speaking anonymously with the Qatari channel The New Arab, dismissed Israel’s claims of a shift in Hamas’ position following the death of its leader Yahya Sinwar, saying, 'Those claims show that they do not understand how decisions are made within Hamas,' he asserted. 'Hamas’ principles remain unchanged, before and after Sinwar. We have made our red lines clear to all mediators — full withdrawal from Gaza, the return of all displaced persons to their homes across the region and the assistance and reconstruction necessary for our people.' Meanwhile, the Security Cabinet is set to convene on Sunday, with ministers expected to receive an update on hostage negotiations. The meeting follows Mossad Director David Barnea's anticipated departure for Doha, where he will attend a summit with the CIA director and the Qatari prime minister. The gathering is intended to jumpstart negotiations. The summit facilitates direct talks between negotiation teams to finalize deal details. Later, an expanded four-party summit involving Egypt is expected. Over the last three weeks, Barnea has worked on a new framework, which he shared with the Egyptian intelligence chief in Cairo on Thursday. This proposal is expected to be adjusted to incorporate aspects of the Egyptian framework and additional strategies.

Israeli retirees victims in suspected ramming attack in Glilot; 1...	Bus taking participants on guided tour of the area arrived seconds before truck rammed bus stop, killing at least one and injuring dozens After one Israeli was killed and at least 37 others injured in varying severities after a suspected truck ramming attack near Glilot, police are still investigating the incident to say whether it was a planned attack or an unusual accident. Most of the injured in the incident were retirees who arrived in the area as part of a guided tour. 'As soon as we stopped and started getting off [the bus], we heard a boom. I turned around and saw people being thrown about,' Avraham Zohar, who participated in the tour, recounted. 'My wife was thrown and then dropped to the ground because she thought it was a bombing attack. I picked her up and started moving forward. I went back because people were piling and we began pulling them out one by one. It was a graphic sight, but we had no choice. The truck driver was trapped inside and we told the police and then I heard two or three gunshots and realized they had neutralized' the driver, he said. Zohar said the police informed them that it was a terror attack. 'We didn't realize it was a terror attack. The police came and said it probably was. An officer asked where the truck driver was. I told him he was stuck inside. The officer climbed up and started talking to him, and the driver began moving and then I heard gunshots.' Yechiel Ben Moshe, an 81-year-old from Petah Tikva, also participated in the tour. 'We were a group of retirees going to Glilot to visit a museum and listen to a lecture,' he said. 'The bus parked, and people got off. A truck came from behind and I heard a huge noise from the truck; it drove toward us to run us over.' 'I moved aside and managed to escape while others around me fell and some were hit. I was already off the bus so I wasn’t hurt. Around me, everyone was injured and bleeding, and others were in shock. It looked like an accident at first, but then shots were fired at the terrorist,' he added. Shuki Green was also on the scene as part of the tour. 'When we were told to get off the bus, my wife and I exited through the front door and were lucky to be unharmed,' he said. 'Those who got off through the middle door were hit by the truck. We didn’t realize it was a terror attack. Some said the driver was holding a knife but I didn’t see it. I thought a missile had landed because there was dust and metal and stones flying in the air. I ran and fell several times,' he said. 'We saw the truck speeding and it was lucky the bus had stopped,' his wife Dvora added. 'Large forces arrived immediately. Everything was chaotic, and a thick cloud of smoke formed. We heard a boom at the moment of the ramming. It was an attack; he sped toward us, where the people were standing. We had been really looking forward to this trip.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Police Commissioner Daniel Levy also arrived at the scene. 'This incident is being investigated as a terror attack and that's how it should be treated. I fully support the police and civilians who neutralized the attacker,' Ben-Gvir said. The driver, Rami Nasrallah from the Arab town of Qalansawe, was shot and killed. His relatives claimed the incident wasn't a terror attack. 'That's a lie. Rami suffers from illnesses and lost control of the truck due to a medical issue,' a relative said.

Hezbollah fires one of its largest volleys on the Galilee area resulting in injuries in the Arab town of Tamra in northern Israel; IDF continues to fight terror group in Lebanon A 57-year-old woman was seriously injured on Sunday after a Hezbollah rocket hit Tamra, an Arab town located in northern Israel. Magen David Adom emergency service paramedics arrived on the scene and gave her medical attention alongside another resident who sustained minor injuries. Another home in the town suffered a direct hit. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit said shortly after the incident that 75 rockets were identified crossing from Lebanon to northern Israel in Hezbollah's barrage, marking one of the heaviest seen toward the Galilee region since the war began. Meanwhile, as the fighting against the Iran-backed terror group continues, the IDF began expanding its operations in South Lebanon into the second line of towns and villages some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the border with Israel, after finding massive stores of Iranian-made and Russian-made weapons and ammunition in every home. Initially, the IDF said publicly and assured the U.S. that it would limit its offensive to removing the threat of an invasion of the Galilee by Hezbollah's Radwan force, in an area containing up to 20 Shiite villages, spread along the 130-kilometer (81-mile) frontier.

Israel destroyed facility manufacturing 'critical components,' Sa...	Israeli official says operation destroyed Iranian facility manufacturing surface-to-surface missiles and critical components for propelling them, and believes Iran is unlikely to respond; The Biden administration is reportedly satisfied with the strike, which might adversely affect Russian capabilities against Ukraine In a daring nocturnal Friday operation, Israel targeted Iranian facilities pivotal to the production of surface-to-surface missiles, delivering a strategic blow that complicates Tehran's future missile manufacturing efforts. An informed Israeli insider said on Saturday that 'with the added impairment of air defense systems, the intended message is unmistakable.' He emphasized that any Iranian retaliation against Israel could provoke a far more robust counteraction, leaving Iran 'vulnerable and exposed.' The New York Times highlighted this strike as an assault on a 'critical component.' The Saudi website Elaph, known for its occasional insights from the Israeli defense sphere, cited a knowledgeable source stating that the targeted components were numerous fuel mixers at a facility integral for propelling the 'Kheibar' and 'Qassem' ballistic missiles, previously launched toward Israel on October 1. The report estimated each mixer's value at a minimum of $2 million. Industry insiders from Iran's missile sector, referenced in the report, indicated that the facility's operational recovery would take no less than two years, marking a profound disruption to Iran's missile production capabilities. A fuel mixer is a critical component for producing special solid fuel used to propel precision missiles. Missiles with liquid fuel need to be positioned upright for fueling, making them easy to detect and vulnerable. Solid fuel propulsion allows for better protection under cover and, more importantly, precision targeting; The same fuel is used in a computerized mechanism that navigates the missile by emitting combustion jets in different directions, achieving accuracy to within a meter and allowing for mid-flight trajectory adjustments. This makes it much easier to hit strategic targets and harder to intercept. 'The U.S. benefits from this strike' The informed source stated that 'Israel complied with Biden's request not to attack oil and nuclear facilities; there was an agreement between Israel and the Americans regarding targeting military objectives. The U.S. benefits from this strike because Iran will struggle to produce missiles and transfer them to Russia against Ukraine,' he said. Despite reports that Arab and European countries sent warning messages to Iran, the source claimed Israel did not warn Iran before the attack. 'In the strike, Israel hit the surface-to-surface missile production plants in three waves, thereby preventing them from continuing missile production. There was maximum coordination with the Americans,' he said. 'This was no mere skirmish; it was a strategic blow that signals an end to the era of fearing Iran,' asserted the source. 'Israel intended for Iran to fully grasp the severity of the situation. Prepared for any escalation, Israel watched as Iran opted for retreat. The regime is now attempting to downplay the magnitude of the strike, but deep down, they understand the reality.' Visuals of Air Force jets embarking on the Iranian mission 'Israeli intelligence moved through Iran unimpeded, and the Air Force executed its operations freely. By dawn, Tehran found its air defenses weakened and its ballistic missile capabilities compromised. The Ayatollahs' response was to concede. This marks a shift in the status quo,' according to a high-ranking Israeli official. Another senior figure commented on the domestic reaction. 'While public sentiment may crave more overt displays of power, it is the duty of the leadership to evaluate and decide based on comprehensive security and diplomatic considerations. The collaboration with the U.S. is a crucial factor in this equation,' he said. Biden hoping for a conclusion Concurrently, top U.S. officials believe Iran is unlikely to retaliate against Israel's strike, in light of Israel's extensive reach. 'No developments are expected before the elections,' an official suggested. 'Our alliance with Israel has been steadfast. A massive defense initiative is in place to safeguard Israel, incorporating the most advanced defense systems. Our commitment to supporting Israel is clear, and both Israel and Iran are well aware of this.' Senior officials asserted that Israel was fully justified in defending itself by launching a strike against Iran. 'What Iran did to Israel on October 1 is something no nation should tolerate,' one commented. 'The Iranians are keenly aware Israel can reach any target it chooses. I don't anticipate a counteraction from them in response to Israel's move. I suspect they will refrain from retaliation — but time will tell.' U.S. President Joe Biden expressed hope that the cycle of reciprocal strikes between Israel and Iran would cease, noting that Israel did not appear to target non-military sites. On the other hand, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared that Tehran has 'no limits' concerning its defense of territorial integrity, yet he stopped short of making explicit threats of retaliation. The Israeli operation in Iran received unanimous approval in a political-security cabinet meeting conducted via telephone, lasting about an hour. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a cabinet member, stated post-Sabbath that 'the strike on Iran serves as a crucial opening maneuver to weaken Iran's strategic assets, and it must pave the way for subsequent actions. This is my stance, and I will continue to advocate for it in the appropriate forums. We bear a historical responsibility to neutralize the Iranian threat to Israel's existence.'

The Israeli Air Force struck and eliminated Ahmed Jafar Maatouk, the commander of Hezbollah's Bint Jbeil area, the IDF announced on Sunday. The operation with the direction of IDF intelligence took place on Friday. A day later, directed by IDF intelligence, the IAF struck and eliminated his successor. Additionally, Hezbollah's head of artillery in the Bint Jbeil area was eliminated in the strike. These terrorists directed and carried out numerous terror attacks from the Bint Jbeil area including launching anti-tank missiles toward Israeli civilians and IDF troops operating in southern Lebanon, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkyk2iie1g	2024-10-27T04:07:34-07:00

We woke up to very loud booms that lasted for almost three hours...	Azita, a resident of Tehran, talks to Ynet about the ordeal Iranians went through as Israel attacked, long lines at gas stations, regime efforts to project normalcy and the desire to show Israel that Iran isn't just another Gaza 'Despite being prepared that the confrontation was approaching, it caught us by surprise,' Azita, a resident of Tehran, tells Ynet. 'We woke up to very loud booms. This lasted for almost three hours. It's a strange mix of emotions: many of us in the opposition are hopefully waiting for an Israeli attack, because what could be worse than the current situation? But it's still frightening. Bombs are still being dropped on your home, on your country. The colors in the sky, the movement, the sounds – it was very, very scary. We're used to seeing these things on TV from Lebanon and Gaza, and suddenly it was above our heads. 'There were two types of reactions once we realized the attack had begun. There were the people who support the regime, who immediately took to the streets, gathered and started marching and shouting that nothing happened, that the Israeli attack did no damage, and that the regime succeeded in keeping the citizens safe. And then there were the more practical people. They got into their cars with fuel containers and drove to gas stations, both to stock up in case of a shortage or price increase and to have the option to escape Tehran in case it became a primary target. People waited for hours in line at gas stations. 'State-run media quickly reported that the Iranian air defense proved itself much more than its Israeli counterpart. They repeatedly said Iranians should be proud of themselves and the regime that provided them protection from the 'Zionist enemy,' but the truth is that among many people, even among regime supporters, there is a certain degree of skepticism about these statements. The Israeli planes managed to bomb Iran. 'In the eyes of many, this is a crossing of red lines that Iran should not have allowed to be crossed. The regime and the authorities made every effort to return everything to normal as quickly as possible, ensuring there were no disruptions to daily life. They tried to convey that nothing happened, that it was an unsuccessful Israeli attempt. Many people walked the streets, the parks were full, and so were the markets. There was an attempt, more than usual, to project normalcy. 'Opinions here are also divided. Some people say it's a disgrace that we were bombed and that Iran must respond like a country whose sovereignty has been violated, but there are also many others who think the attack shows Iran's strength. They feared that Israel would bomb the oil sites or the nuclear bases and facilities and, in the end, it didn't happen, so there's a bit of relief. But the general feeling is a desire for revenge, to show Israel that Iran is neither Lebanon nor Gaza. 'All the attacks and repeated attacks are nerve-wracking. You don't know what to expect, when, how or with what intensity. There's also no one to really share with because there aren't many answers; we all live in constant uncertainty. The authorities have also increased their control over censorship and warned of severe punishments for anyone who shares materials from the attack with Western media. So, it's a fear that comes at you from both sides.'

Severing ties with UNRWA could suspend Israel's membership in UN,...	Bill up for final vote Monday could signal an Israeli violation of the UN charter leading to a suspension of membership in the international body Foreign Ministry officials on Sunday warned against legislation being advanced in the Knesset to cut official ties with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, Israel's membership in the United Nations could be suspended for violating the body's charter. The bill, proposed by Likud lawmaker Boaz Bismuth, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is scheduled for a second and final reading on Monday and has broad support. Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said he was for the legislation calling UNRWA a disaster. Israel revealed the involvement of UNRWA employees in the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7 last year and the identity of another member of the organization who was a Hamas operative in Lebanon. According to the proposed law, Israel would sever ties with UNRWA, it would lose its diplomatic status, its officials would be prohibited from having contact with the agency, its employees would be refused visas and customs officials would not be able to handle their imported equipment and goods. UNRWA's tax benefits would also be revoked at a later date. U.S. Ambassador Jack Lew asked opposition party leaders to agree to postpone a vote on the bill until after the November 5 U.S. presidential elections. Bismuth was also asked by members of Netanyahu's coalition, to delay the vote. U.N Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that if the legislation passes, UNRWA will be unable to continue operating and would then need to raise the issue at the UN General Assembly. 'It’s deeply concerning that legislation is being considered in a member state of the United Nations that would fundamentally contradict the principles of the UN Charter,' Guterres wrote in an urgent letter to Netanyahu earlier this month. The draft legislation currently under discussion in the Knesset, if passed, could prevent UNRWA from continuing its operations in the occupied Palestinian territories, thereby denying Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank the essential aid and protection that UNRWA has provided them since 1949,' he wrote. Guterres said UNRWA operates in nearly 400 schools and more than 65 health clinics in the West Bank. providing education to more than 350,000 children and over 5 million medical consultations annually. 'UNRWA also provides vital assistance to the poor and social services,' Guterres wrote. According to the senior Foreign Ministry officials and other professionals, there is no doubt that UNRWA is a corrupt, rogue organization that is part of the problem and not the solution. But despite that, the proposed legislation could be more problematic for Israel than for UNRWA. 'We know there are anti-Israeli elements and Palestinians who are waiting for such legislation to unleash the gates of hell on us,' they said. 'This would bring Israel to violating the UN charter.'

Amit Chayut and Master Sergeant (res.) Gilad Elmaliach all served at the 8207th Battalion The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported on Sunday that four reserve soldiers were killed in action in southern Lebanon as part of Israel's ground operation against Hezbollah. They are: Major (res.) Eliav Amram Abitbol, 36, from Eitan, a Company Deputy Commander in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade; Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, 43, from Jerusalem, a Military Rabbi in the 8207th Battalion, 228th Brigade; Captain (res.)

Three additional reserve soldiers and one soldier in compulsory service from the 8207th Battalion were severely injured, alongside a combat engineering officer from the 228th Brigade. 'The soldiers fell and were injured in a battle with terrorists in southern Lebanon. The details of the battle are under investigation,' The IDF said in a statement. 'Amit was a wonderful person with a heart of gold' Captain (Res.) Amit Hayut, 29, from Haifa, was killed in a battle in southern Lebanon. 'Our hearts are broken; Amit was a wonderful person with a heart of gold, a cheerful, responsible and noble man. He was always surrounded by friends,' his brother Dvir said. Amit was the son of Tzippi and Yehoshua and the youngest in his family. After his studies, he attended a year-and-a-half-long pre-military program and enlisted in the Golani Brigade. He completed a commanders' course with honors. Amit had a partner named Shiri, also a resident of Haifa, and his family said that the couple planned to get married. 'He completed over 300 days in the reserves. He had been serving in the north since October 7 and we knew he was now in southern Lebanon,' his brother said. 'The last time we talked with him was when he took a short break during Sukkot a week and a half ago. He returned on Saturday and we hadn't heard from him since he entered Lebanon,' he recounted. A day after Rosh Hashanah, Captain (res.) Rabbi Avraham Yosef Goldberg, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Everyone has left their families and children, eager to go out to Your war, fighting to save brothers from the threat of murder. How many tears and hearts and souls and eyes have been poured out to You! Approaching the Holy Ark, filled with awe, with an incredible sense of mission and You will hear their cry from the heavens and their plea for help.' 'Their cries are here, calling out before You, and You will fight their battles for them, that they may not falter with their weapons, nor fail in their running, nor be frightened by the fire of the enemy and You will uproot the government of evil from the land!' The Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot published a statement mourning the loss of Master Sergeant (res.) Gilad Elmaliach, saying: 'The Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot, its rabbis, students and alumni mourn the death of our alumnus Gilad Elmaliach, in the battle for the revival of Israel and in defense of the northern border.

Israel miscalculates will of Iranians, supreme leader says	In his first response to the Israeli attack on Iran's military targets including its aerial defenses, Al Khamenei says the response must be determined by the best interests of the Iranian people people Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that Israel made a mistake when it attacked Iran. Speaking for the first time since the Israeli strike on Iranian military targets early on Saturday, Khamenei said Israel miscalculated and must understand the will of the Iranian people. 'The evil committed by the Zionist regime (Israel) two nights ago should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated', Khamenei said. He said Iran's power should be demonstrated to Israel, adding that the way to do so should be 'determined by the officials and that which is in the best interest of the people and the country should take place.' An Iranian official told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper that Iran maintains the right to defend itself against any aggression. 'Whether its response would be immediate is unclear and the decision will be made based on security and political considerations and the conditions in the region,' the official said adding that Iran prefers to preserve its territorial integrity rather than engaging with Israel's plans to alter the regional order and break up the 'axis of resistance.' The security cabinet is scheduled to meet later on Sunday to discuss the strike on Iran, its results and a possible Iranian response.

British man sentenced to 12 years in prison for encouraging terro...	Gabriel Budasz, 24, was convicted on four counts of encouraging terrorism, including against Jews; The investigation began after the British Jewish security organization CST collected evidence from his social media accounts Gabriel Budasz, 24, who encouraged his followers on social media to carry out acts of terrorism - including against Jews in the country - was sentenced to 12 years in prison in Britain. He was convicted of four counts of encouraging terrorism, one count of distributing terrorist propaganda and one count of sending an electronic message with intent to cause distress or anxiety. Budasz, who was born in Poland and lived in Weston-super-Mare, in North Somerset, UK, published detailed instructions on how to make explosives from readily available household items, and created a plastic gun using a 3D printer. Judge Brian Forster wrote in the sentence, published Thursday: 'The evidence reveals that you had a clear interest in white supremacy, other terrorists including Brenton Tarrant, and massacres, including the shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand.' The judge later said: 'You also posted on Twitter: 'I'm going to build a bomb'. You distributed instructions on how to build a bomb, with the intention of encouraging terrorism.' Among the materials Budasz posted online was a video of him wearing clothes similar to the outfit Trent wore the day he live-streamed the 2019 murder of 51 Muslims at two Christchurch mosques. 'You said things like 'kill the Jews, kill the political leaders'. You also encouraged the need to take action,' Judge Forster added. Budasz posted a video on Telegram with 'horrifying and graphic' footage and gave instructions on how to torture and eventually murder a victim with a knife. The British Jewish security organization CST began investigating the defendant's online activity in September 2022. The organization said they collected evidence from Budasz's social media accounts, and handed the evidence over to counter-terrorism police in the summer of 2023. Budasz was arrested on August 1, 2023. During his trial, Budasz claimed that the videos he posted online were meant to be funny, from the point of view of a 'comedic' far-right figure. However, Judge Forster said that 'there is no direct connection between Budasz's mental disorder and his crimes.' During a search of Budasz s home in August 2023, various items of a far-right nature were seized books, masks and memorabilia, as well as a 3D-printed firearm.

Israel mulls expansion of Lebanon offensive	Forces operating in South Lebanon find massive amounts of weapons and ammunition placed in advanced of a planned invasion of the Galilee; commanders on the ground push for more time The IDF began expanding its operations in South Lebanon into the second line of towns and villages some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the border with Israel, after finding massive stores of Iranian and Russian-made weapons and ammunition in every home. Initially, the IDF said publicly and ensured the U.S. that it would limit its offensive to removing the threat of an invasion of the Galilee by Hezbollah's Radwan force, in an area containing up to 20 Shiite villages, spread along the 130-kilometer (81-mile) frontier. A decision to continue to expand the offensive to include up to 70 villages and towns would depend on the government, the rising number of casualties and the urging of military commanders on the ground, to allow them to fight on. The military believes there are between 5,000 and 10,000 well-maintained weapons in every village, put there to await Hezbollah's planned invasion. According to the IDF, it is easier for infantry troops operating in South Lebanon to capture members of the Radwan Force, because of their ability to maneuver quietly, in the terrain. Tanks and APCs are more exposed to Hezbollah's attacks. Troops have also begun using the weapons and ammunition found in the villages, that would eventually have to be destroyed. On Saturday, a controlled detonation of some 400 tons of explosives, triggered earthquake warnings.

Russian plane lands in Israel for possible mediation effort with ...	Israeli officials refuse to comment on an aircraft from Moscow, which landed in the country as reports suggest the Kremlin is negotiating the release of Israeli-Russian hostages in Gaza A Russian aircraft landed in Israel on Thursday afternoon and later headed back to Moscow for reasons that are currently not clear. Officials denied reports a Russian delegation arrived in the country to negotiate the release of two Israeli-Russian captives held by Hamas: Alexander (Sahsa) Trufanov and Maxim Herkin. Hamas' deputy politburo head Mousa Abu Marzouk visited Moscow on the same day and spoke with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov about their release. Abu Marzouk said that the two Russian citizens would be a high priority for release in any future deal with the terror group. The Russian arrival in Israel raised several questions: Why did a Russian plane connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin arrive? Was its arrival related to the delivery of messages from Israel to Iran via Russia or was it an attempt by Putin to mediate between Israel and Iran? Did Russia convey Israel's messages to Iran, clarifying that nuclear facilities would not be targeted but military sites would be and that Israel would retaliate harshly should Iran attack again? Israeli officials declined to comment on the plane's landing, leaving answers unclear. The Tu-214SR aircraft that landed in Israel is part of the special 'Russia' flight unit, which is under Putin's administration. Russian media reported the plane had previously landed at Ben Gurion Airport on October 17. The reports added that Hezbollah temporarily halted its rocket fire into Israeli territory for several hours during the Russian plane's stay. During a weekend press conference, Putin said that Israel faced a terrorist attack last year, but that its response was disproportionate and cannot be forgiven. 'No person on Earth can help but feel their heart bleed when they see what is happening in the Gaza Strip,' Putin said. He suggested that the war could be resolved via the establishment of a Palestinian state, adding that Russia 'is in close contact with Iran.' He also stressed Russia's intention to resolve Tehran's conflict with Israel based on compromises. 'Russia has been attempting to mediate between Iran and Israel for several weeks now,' social activist Alex Tenzer, who monitors Russian media, said. 'This is evident from Putin's words and meetings between Russia's Bogdanov and Israel's ambassador to Russia. Russia is trying to preserve its interests in the Middle East which are steadily deteriorating as Iran loses power.'

Satellite images show aftermath of Israel strike on secret Iran b...	Images show damage to Parchin missile production site; expert says even if key materials removed before strikes building would have provided 'intrinsic value for future nuclear weapons-related activities. An American researcher said an Israeli airstrike on Saturday hit a building that was part of Iran's defunct nuclear weapons development program, and he and another researcher said facilities used to mix solid fuel for missiles also were struck. The assessments based on commercial satellite imagery were reached separately by David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector, and Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a Washington think tank. They told Reuters that Israel struck buildings in Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran. Israel also hit Khojir, according to Eveleth, a sprawling missile production site near Tehran. Reuters reported in July that Khojir was undergoing massive expansion. Eveleth said the Israeli strikes may have 'significantly hampered Iran's ability to mass produce missiles.' The Israeli military said three waves of Israeli jets struck missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran early on Saturday in retaliation for Tehran's Oct. 1 barrage of more than 200 missiles against Israel. Iran's military said the Israeli warplanes used 'very light warheads' to strike border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and around Tehran. In posts on X, Albright said commercial satellite imagery showed that Israel hit a building in Parchin called Taleghan 2 that was used for testing activities during the Amad Plan, Iran's defunct nuclear weapons development program. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and U.S. intelligence say Iran shuttered the program in 2003. Iran denies pursuing nuclear weapons. Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security research group, was given access to the program's files for a book after they were stolen from Tehran by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency in 2018. On X, he said the archives revealed that Iran kept important test equipment in Taleghan 2. Iran may have removed key materials before the airstrike, he said, but 'even if no equipment remained inside' the building would have provided 'intrinsic value' for future nuclear weapons-related activities. Albright told Reuters that commercial satellite imagery of Parchin showed Israel damaged three buildings about 350 yards (320 m) from Taleghan 2, including two in which solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed. He did not identify the commercial firm from which he obtained the images. Eveleth said an image of Parchin from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, showed that Israel destroyed three ballistic missile solid fuel mixing buildings and a warehouse in the sprawling complex. Planet Labs imagery also showed that an Israeli strike destroyed two buildings in the Khojir complex where solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed, he said. The buildings were enclosed by high dirt berms, according to the image reviewed by Reuters. Such structures are associated with missile production and are designed to stop a blast in one building from detonating combustible materials in nearby structures. 'Israel says they targeted buildings housing solid-fuel mixers,' Eveleth said. 'These industrial mixers are hard to make and export-controlled. Iran imported many over the years at great expense, and will likely have a hard time replacing them.' With a limited operation, he said, Israel may have struck a significant blow against Iran's ability to mass-produce missiles and made it more difficult for any future Iranian missile attack to pierce Israel's missile defenses. 'The strikes appear to be highly accurate,' he said. Axios reported that Israel destroyed hit 12 'planetary mixers' used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, quoting three unnamed Israeli sources as saying this severely damages Iran's ability to renew its missile stockpile and could deter Iran from further massive missile strikes against Israel. Iran has the Middle East's largest missile arsenal and supplied missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine, and to Yemen's Houthi rebels and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, according to U.S. officials. Tehran and Moscow deny that Russia has received Iranian missiles. Planet Labs imagery reviewed earlier this year by Eveleth and Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey showed major expansions at Khojir and the Modarres military complex near Tehran that the pair assessed were for boosting missile production, Reuters reported. Three senior Iranian officials confirmed that conclusion.

Iran's vulnerability after Israel's attack concerning, officials ...	After Israel takes out Iranian aid defense systems protecting critical oil, petrochemical and gas sites sources say Iran's respond must be carefully considered because of the risks posed by another Israeli strike Israel's attack on Iranian air defenses early on Saturday has raised deep alarm in Iran, according to three Iranian officials who spoke to the New York Times. They protected several critical oil and petrochemical refineries and a large gas field and a major port in southern Iran, critical energy, and economic hubs, leaving them vulnerable to attack if the exchanges of blows between the two countries continue. The sites include Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex, in Khuzestan Province; the major economic port Bandar Imam Khomeini, adjacent to it; and at the Abadan oil refinery, the refinery for the gas field, called Tange Bijar, in Ilam Province, according to the officials, one of them with Iran’s oil ministry. Hamid Hosseini, an expert on Iran's oil and gas industry and a member of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce said Israel was sending a clear message to Iran. 'This can have very serious economic consequences for Iran, and now that we understand the stakes we need to act wise and not continue the tensions.' Iranian and Israeli officials told the paper that four Russian S-300 systems were destroyed in addition to those attacked last April when Israel attacked Iran in response to the Iranian missile and drone attack. 'This looks like a potential preamble to a much more effective strike against Iran’s infrastructure and even nuclear sites,' said Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group. 'Iranians don’t have the capacity to replace these systems in a timely manner, which renders the country much more vulnerable in future tit for tats.' In addition to the aerial defenses, the sources said, the Israeli strike also targeted three large missile production bases: Falagh, Shaid Ghadiri and Abdol Fath, which belong to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and military sites in Parchin and Parand, using drones. While Israeli officials said the attack disrupted Iran's ability to produce missiles, the Iranians said the damage was minimal and production would resume quickly. The Iranian military said four of its soldiers who operated the defense systems were killed. Local media said the number of fatalities was expected to rise. Two of the soldiers were from the city of Mahshahr, near the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex. Two Israeli officials said the initial plan of attack, prepared soon after Iran's October 1 ballistic missile strike, included attacks on Iran's energy industry and nuclear program. But the Biden administration urged Israel to avoid those targets, out of concern that they would prompt a severe response that would destabilize the world's economy and drag the United States into a regional war. Iranian officials including Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said repeatedly in interviews and to their Arab counterparts that those targets would be a red flag and if attacked, Iran would respond forcefully. Agraghchi also sent a letter to the UN on Saturday urging the condemnation of Israel and calling its attack 'unlawful and aggressive' and 'against the sovereignty and territorial integrity' of Iran. Iran's military claimed it successfully thwarted most of the Israeli attacks on its air defenses. In a statement the military said Israeli fighter jets did not enter Iran's airspace and fired missiles and drones from the airspace over Iraq. The force also accused the United States of complicity in 'the crime,' while Washington denied taking any part in the attack. Three Israeli officials told the New York Times that command and control sites and a radar, were also targeted. Israel believes those were damaged severely and were put out of use. One of the officials said that satellite images after the attack showed that only the defense systems at the Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex were hit and not the complex itself. Iran's supreme council met for an emergency session on Sunday and was briefed by military commanders about the damage and the targets that were attacked. Three Iranian officials told the paper that the council discussed how Iran would respond but said no decision was reached. Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei has the authority to order an attack on Israel, in his role as supreme military commander. He is expected to issue a statement later on Sunday.

IDF deception tactics leave Iran weighing its next move	Israeli officials anticipate Iranian response, though specifics remain unclear, while US sources suggest Tehran may hold back; reports indicate high-level discussions in Iran, with its vice president saying response would come 'at appropriate time' Operation Days of Repentance, the Israeli response to Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack, targeted advanced Iranian air defense systems and missile production facilities following. According to sources, over 100 aircraft participated, focusing on gaining air superiority for future operations and disrupting Iran’s missile capabilities. Foreign reports indicated that Israel struck critical missile production components, including high-value planetary mixers essential to Iran’s missile program. The operation involved advanced maneuvers and deceptive tactics to enter Iranian airspace, with Israeli forces also targeting anti-aircraft batteries in Syria intended to shield Iranian facilities. Damage assessments are ongoing, with Israeli officials indicating it may take days to determine the full impact. According to opposition-aligned news outlet Iran International, F-35 jets also took part in the elaborate operation. As Tehran weighs its response, assessments of its likely course vary. While senior American officials suggested in comments to Ynet that Iran may hold off on retaliation, Israeli sources expect a response, though the timing remains unknown. According to Reuters, citing two regional sources briefed by Iran, Tehran held high-level meetings to determine the scale of its reaction to the strikes. One source described the damage as 'minimal,' though noted several Revolutionary Guard bases around Tehran were impacted. Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref, visiting Hamas headquarters in Tehran, issued a warning, saying, 'The aggressor should await a response; we will respond at the appropriate time.' Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking in conversations with Qatari, Saudi and Egyptian counterparts, urged international action to prevent further regional conflict, stressing Iran’s 'unlimited' commitment to its territorial defense. However, he refrained from mentioning a direct act of retaliation. In a statement, Iran’s military confirmed its right to respond but also called for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, a message AP analysts interpreted as a signal to avoid further escalation. The Iranian military alleged that Israel used U.S.-controlled airspace in Iraq to approach its targets near Tehran and along borders in Ilam and Khuzestan provinces. Several female navigators took part in the overnight sorties, as has been seen in similar operations previously. Major General Aviad Dagan, who is set to assume the role of head of the IDF’s Telecommunications Division, also joined the missions as a navigator. Dagan, a former commander of the Hatzerim Airbase, was among the experienced reservists participating, as more than 60% of the pilots involved in the operation were reserve forces. Israeli sources, meanwhile, indicated the operation struck a significant strategic blow to Iran, reducing its defense capabilities. 'If Iran chooses to respond, it risks a much stronger action, as its defense systems are now severely weakened,' an Israeli official said, adding, 'they are completely exposed.' 'This wasn’t a minor strike; it was a strategic blow and proof that Israel no longer fears Iran,' said another official. 'Israel did not aim for containment but was prepared for escalation, while Iran chose to retreat. The regime is downplaying the attack and may try to spin the narrative, but they know the reality.'

Can Qatar and Egypt’s rivalry drive a breakthrough hostage deal?	Mossad chief set to meet CIA director and Qatari PM in Doha create framework for potential deal; Qatar, noting Cairo’s increased involvement, aims to stay central in talks; US officials believe major breakthrough may only come after US elections Mossad head David Barnea will head to Doha on Sunday to join CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al Thani for a summit focused on resuming hostage negotiations. The talks aim to reignite discussions on a potential hostage exchange deal, despite U.S. officials reportedly believing that any major agreement would likely be deferred until after the U.S. presidential election in early November. Egyptian intelligence head Hassan Rashad, who met with a Hamas delegation in Cairo over the weekend, is not expected to attend the summit, though Hamas could join the negotiations later. This meeting marks the first in Doha since the August summit and comes after the elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, a move Israel saw as removing a major obstacle to a deal. Israeli officials are cautiously optimistic, noting that a restrained Iranian response to Israel’s overnight attacks could shift Hamas’ focus away from regional conflict and back to negotiation. In recent weeks, Israeli and American officials, including Barnea, have coordinated behind the scenes to draft a framework that considers recent shifts in regional dynamics. CIA Director Burns hopes to use this momentum to push for consensus on a renewed framework. A proposed 'mini-deal' from Egypt that would release four hostages in exchange for a temporary two-week ceasefire is also under discussion. Encouraged by various recent developments—including Sinwar's assassination, Hamas’s engagement with Egyptian officials, and Hezbollah’s weakened position—Israel believes the timing is ideal for negotiations. With both Qatar and Egypt vying for influence in facilitating a potential deal, Israel hopes the Doha summit will align the Qatari and Egyptian frameworks into a unified proposal. The summit's outcome may hinge on U.S. pressure on Qatar, which Israel sees as capable of applying strong leverage on Hamas but thus far has refrained from doing so. An Israeli official emphasized that time is critical in resolving the hostage situation, adding, 'We are committed to advancing a deal as quickly as possible.'

Report: Israel struck Iran’s solid-fuel missile plant, disrupting...	Saudi media reports strike took facility completely offline, destroying around 20 heavy fuel mixers, each worth estimated $2 million; sources familiar with Iran’s missile industry say site will likely require at least 2 years to resume operations Israel targeted an Iranian solid-fuel plant crucial to the production of Kheibar and Qasem ballistic missiles, which were fired at Israel earlier this month, Saudi news site Elaph reported on Saturday, citing an informed source. According to the Saudi news outlet, which often receives security information from Israel, the strike is said to have taken the facility completely offline, destroying around 20 heavy fuel mixers, each worth an estimated $2 million. Sources familiar with Iran’s missile industry told Elaph that the facility will likely require at least two years to resume operations. Solid-fuel missiles, produced using these mixers, allow greater precision and defense advantages by avoiding the need for visible refueling seen with liquid-fuel systems. The solid-fuel propulsion improves both strike accuracy and durability, offering precision within a meter and increasing resilience against interception. Earlier, The New York Times reported that Israel targeted a 'critical component' in Iran’s long-range missile production facilities. Israeli sources described the strike on Iran's surface-to-surface missile production facilities as a 'strategic blow' that would severely hamper Tehran's missile manufacturing capabilities for years to come 'With the added damage to Iran’s air defense systems, the message is clear,' an Israeli official familiar with the strike said Saturday evening, warning that any Iranian retaliation 'risks an even stronger response, with weakened defenses that leave them vulnerable.' Struck with US coordination An official reported that the Israeli strike was coordinated with the United States, targeting missile production sites rather than oil or nuclear facilities, per a U.S. request. 'Both countries agreed on strategic military targets,' the official said, adding that the operation weakened Iran’s missile production and complicated its ability to supply weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Despite reports that Arab and European nations issued warnings to Tehran, Israel refrained from notifying Iran ahead of the strike. The operation included three waves targeting surface-to-surface missile factories, a move the official described as a 'strategic blow' and a clear message that 'the fear of Iran has ended.' Iran responded by downplaying the impact, though Israeli officials claim the strike caused severe damage to Iran’s air defenses and ballistic missile capabilities. Another senior Israeli source noted, 'Israel’s intelligence and Air Force operated in Iran as they saw fit, leaving Iran’s leadership to face the new reality.' The official also remarked that while Israeli public opinion often expects dramatic displays, the high level of U.S.-Israeli cooperation on security matters weighed heavily on operational decisions. The Security Cabinet unanimously approved the operation in a one-hour phone meeting, with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir emphasizing that 'this strike is an opening move against Iran’s strategic assets, a necessary step to counter the Iranian threat to Israel.'

IDF detonates 400 tons of explosives in Hezbollah bunker, rocking...	Built over 15 years, site larger than similar Gaza facilities and held supplies and weaponry to support two battalions; some launch bases may still be undiscovered The IDF on Saturday detonated approximately 400 metric tons of explosives to destroy a major underground Hezbollah facility in Lebanon, reportedly built over the past 15 years. The site, said to be the largest underground Hezbollah base neutralized by Israel to date, was operated by the terrorist group's elite Radwan Force and contained dozens of rooms and armories designed to support as many as two battalions consisting of hundreds of fighters, the IDF said. According to the military, the complex was over 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) long and equipped for extended stays with beds, food, storage units, anti-tank missiles, rockets, RPGs, mines and explosive devices. Forces from the 98th Division, the elite combat engineering Yahalom Unit and other specialized IDF units carried out the operation. At least two Hezbollah operatives were killed, while others reportedly escaped through a tunnel exit leading into the mountainside. The powerful blast triggered minor tremors, measured at a magnitude of 4.5 in northern Israel's Galilee region. To ensure safety during the explosion, Israeli troops were instructed to move about a mile from the blast zone.

Tehran resumes normalcy after Israeli strikes amid public fears, ...	Iran downplays impact of overnight attack, with state media emphasizing normalcy across capital and country; while some residents scoff at Israel's capabilities, others worried about potential Middle East conflagration Tehran sought to return to normal Saturday following a night of explosions from Israeli airstrikes, which Israel conducted in response to an earlier missile attack against it this month. Iranians returned to work, cafes and the streets as state media downplayed the attack’s impact. Officials emphasized that schools and sports events continued as scheduled. In Tehran’s streets, reactions ranged from indifference to unease over potential escalation with Israel. Some residents, like Houman, 42, who heard explosions while working his night shift, expressed anxiety about being drawn into a broader regional conflict. 'It was an echoing, dreadful sound,' he told AFP. 'There is now a war in the Middle East, and we fear being dragged into it.' Another resident, Moharram, 51, voiced concern that Tehran could face stronger retaliation from Israel if the conflict escalates. Flights over Iranian airspace were briefly halted following the strike but later resumed. Iranian media reassured citizens that Israel caused only 'limited damage,' crediting the Islamic Republic’s air defenses for containing the threat. Throughout the day, Iranian television showed scenes of regular traffic across major cities, stressing that life was carrying on uninterrupted. One broadcast featured residents singing and dancing atop a Tehran building during the strike, taunting Israel. Sepideh, 30, a Tehran insurance manager, described waking up and heading to work as usual. 'War is frightening, but I don’t think it will come to that here,' she told AFP. Another Tehran resident told Reuters, 'War harms ordinary people, and we’re already suffering.' Others conveyed defiance, with resident Hana Avniki saying the limited scale of the strike suggests Israeli caution. 'Some worry about further clashes, inflation and issues piling up—but it hasn’t affected my life yet,' she said, adding, 'If it continues, that will change.' One Tehranian was more direct: 'If by ‘attack’ Israel means last night’s firecrackers that didn’t even wake up anyone in Tehran, that’s their ‘power’—then shame on them.' Another resident dismissed concerns, saying, 'The Israeli regime is doomed, disappearing automatically without any need for an Iranian response.'

Hezbollah fires 125 rockets in 2 hours as IDF seizes launcher tru...	Terror group continues heavy rocket fire on northern Israel, launching 150 rockets since morning as IDF ramps up operations in Lebanon; army reports destroying launcher used in strikes on Majd al-Krum; fire crews tackling multiple blazes Hezbollah launched about 125 rockets toward northern Israel Saturday afternoon, with 150 total launched by 5 p.m., the IDF reported, amid a continued barrage that has persisted despite intensified Israeli operations against the terrorist group. The escalation follows a month of heightened Israeli strikes on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, particularly since Israel expanded its ground operations in the region. Friday marked the highest daily total of Hezbollah-claimed operations since hostilities began last October, with the group assuming responsibility for 48 separate incidents, a record number. Hezbollah’s rocket, missile and drone attacks have increased in precision and coordination, according to Israeli analysts, moving away from the sporadic strikes seen in September and early October to more strategic targeting intended to achieve both military and psychological impact. However, analysts note that heavy missile fire aimed at central Israel remains limited, possibly due to Israeli strikes on Hezbollah’s launch infrastructure or Iranian orders to hold back larger missiles for potential use in the event of an Israeli attack on Iran. The IDF said approximately 130 Hezbollah launchers were destroyed over the past week, including the one responsible for Friday's deadly strike on the Arab Israeli town of Majd al-Krum. Two civilians, Hassan Sawaed, 21, and Arjwan Manna, 19, were killed, and seven others were injured in that attack. Additionally, the military reported that 91st Division forces located four trucks this week loaded with launchers containing approximately 160 rockets ready for launch. Several fires erupted near She'ar Yashuv, in the Misgav industrial zone and the Hula Nature Reserve due to Saturday’s strikes. Northern District firefighting teams report that the fires have been contained.

Israel targeted ‘critical component’ in Iran’s long-range missile...	New York Times reports Israel's 2nd strike wave in Iran targeted 'critical component' in Tehran's long-range missile production; first wave struck sites in Syria and Iraq, with missile debris later found near Baghdad In the second wave of Israeli airstrikes on Iran overnight, Israel targeted a 'critical component' in Tehran’s long-range missile production process, The New York Times reported on Saturday, citing an Israeli source. While the source did not disclose the specific nature of the targeted component or confirm its destruction, they emphasized it as a uniquely prioritized objective. The report, which corroborates accounts from Arabic media outlets, indicated that Israel's initial strikes focused on air defense systems and radar installations in Syria and Iraq to reduce interception risks. Footage surfaced hours after the strike, showing missile debris near Samarra, north of Baghdad, though it remains unconfirmed if it is linked to Israel. Similar remnants were documented following an April strike in Iraq. Israel's military operations reportedly involved dozens of fighter jets and drones, targeting 20 locations, including military compounds, air defense systems, missile production facilities and ground-to-ground missile launchers in Tehran, as well as Iran’s Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in the west. Iranian sources informed The Times that an S-300 air defense battery positioned at Imam Khomeini International Airport, which protects parts of Tehran, was also struck. They noted that at least three Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps missile bases were damaged. Tehran has since acknowledged that two Iranian soldiers were killed in the strikes, with reports claiming that two additional soldiers died of their injuries hours later. Iranian officials additionally claimed that Israel had succeeded in hitting the Parchin military base, a site near Tehran associated with missile and suicide drone technologies as well as nuclear technology development. One drone reportedly struck the facility while others were intercepted. For over three hours, the Israeli Air Force conducted strikes in three separate waves, targeting military sites, air defense systems and missile production and launch facilities throughout Tehran and western Iran. According to The Wall Street Journal, Israel sent advance warnings to Iran through Arab and European intermediaries. The message outlined Israel’s planned targets and cautioned that any Iranian retaliation would prompt even more forceful Israeli responses. Following the strike, Iran’s Tasnim News Agency indicated that there would be a 'proportionate response' to the Israeli actions. Israeli officials assessed that Iran might retaliate. In a statement, IDF confirmed, 'Intelligence-guided air force strikes targeted missile production sites used by Iran to launch projectiles at Israel in the past year. Additionally, we struck Iranian ground-to-air missile arrays and other air defense capabilities intended to restrict Israel's operational freedom in Iran. The IDF has significant operational capabilities, many of which were exercised today in striking strategic sites deep within Iran. Israel reserves the right and responsibility to protect its citizens should the Iranian regime continue its attacks.' The military added that the scope of damage would become clearer in the coming days but noted the Air Force now has 'greater operational freedom.' With escalated readiness for defense and offense, Israel’s focus remains on the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza, while remaining vigilant against Iran’s attempts to instigate regional escalation. 'Our ability to strike anywhere in the Middle East has been demonstrated,' the IDF said.

Iran: Israeli strike hit 'secret military base', possibly conduct...	Israeli forces attacked strategic military targets across Iran, including the covert Parchin base near Tehran, known for missile and nuclear technology development; Parchin site had previously been identified by the IAEA for potential nuclear weapon research Beyond Iran's admission of two soldiers killed, including an officer equivalent to the rank of major, Iranian sources informed The New York Times on Saturday afternoon that Israel successfully struck the secret military base at Parchin on the outskirts of Tehran. 'One of the drones hit, while others were shot down,' they claimed. This base, also referred to as a 'security facility' in various reports, is known for developing missile and suicide drone technologies, alongside nuclear technologies. The Israeli strike involved dozens of fighter jets and aircraft, reportedly focusing on 20 different targets. According to the IDF, the operation targeted military complexes, air defense systems, missile production facilities, and ground-to-ground missile launchers in the Tehran province, as well as in the Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in western Iran. Iranian sources also told The New York Times that Israel attacked an S-300 air defense battery stationed at Imam Khomeini International Airport, which provides protection for parts of the Iranian capital. They added that at least three missile bases of the Revolutionary Guards were damaged in this round of Israeli strikes. The Parchin area, located approximately 18 miles east of Tehran, has been a focal point of Iran's military activities. Our analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, highlights that Iran has previously conducted experiments in this area aimed at enabling the production of nuclear weapons—the nuclear explosive device. While there is no solid information indicating Iran has renewed its efforts to develop a nuclear warhead, if reports of the Parchin facility being attacked are accurate, the goal seems to have been to thwart Tehran's ability to conduct experiments that would advance it in producing a bomb, should it decide to do so. According to foreign reports, this is not the first time Israel has targeted this mysterious Iranian base. In May 2022, an 'incident' was reported there, resulting in the death of engineer Ihsan Gad-Beigi. The New York Times reported then that the facility was attacked by drones. According to the report, quadcopter suicide drones exploded on a 'building of the Iranian Defense Ministry, where research is conducted for the development of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles.' The newspaper noted that the method of operation mirrored previous Israeli strikes, to which Israel declined to comment. A few days after the strike, Iranian military announced that Iranian Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri and Iranian Army Commander Abdolrahim Mousavi visited a 'subterranean drone base' whose location was undisclosed. An Iranian state television reporter covering the visit mentioned that the visit took place on a Thursday and involved a 45-minute helicopter flight from Kermanshah in western Iran to the 'secret underground drone facility.' He reported that he was allowed to remove his blindfold only upon arrival at the base, allegedly leaving him unaware of its location. Photographs released by Iranian television showed rows of drones armed with missiles inside a tunnel, reportedly hundreds of meters underground. The base where nuclear ambitions were nurtured In a severe 2011 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, about four years before the signing of the nuclear agreement, it was noted Iran built a facility at the Parchin military base for conducting hydrodynamic experiments, indicative of potential nuclear weapon development. The base was highlighted as a main focus of Iran's nuclear program, with reports of efforts to simultaneously detonate explosives integral to the bomb mechanism, alongside hydrodynamic experiments related to nuclear weapons development. At Parchin, it was claimed, there exists a special facility where Iranians attempted to develop the explosive casing to encase enriched uranium hemispheres, initiating the nuclear reaction. Ben-Yishai noted that this casing must explode simultaneously with precision measured in nanoseconds, requiring special detonators known as krytrons, which time the explosion and thus initiate the reaction—resulting in a nuclear explosion. In the months following the severe report, assessments and satellite images suggested Iran was cleansing the Parchin site of evidence of military-related nuclear activity. Among other actions, the Institute for Science and International Security revealed satellite images showing a 'pink cover' over a building at the military base, which UN inspectors sought to visit. The cover likely allowed Iran to clean or operate in the facility in a manner that prevented satellite tracking. A Western envoy said at the time that purification activities at Parchin were 'intensifying,' casting doubt on whether IAEA inspectors could find solid evidence there—even if granted access to the military site. It became evident that the Iranians sought to conceal the existence of experiments on the casing and miniaturization of the bomb intended to allow its insertion into the warhead of ballistic missiles. They attempted to remove soil layers in the area to obscure radioactive traces emitted during the use of nuclear materials, and also flushed the area with strong water currents. In fact, only in September 2015, four years after demanding access to the facility, did IAEA officials finally gain entrance—two months after the nuclear agreement was signed with world powers. That said, Iran has numerous underground facilities, some of which have been exposed in recent years. These underground bases typically house various types of drones, alongside missiles and electronic warfare systems, often located at significant depths underground. Additionally, nuclear development sites have been relocated underground following previous strikes. Regarding air bases, according to Al-Jazeera, Iran possesses dozens of air bases spread across its western, eastern, and southern command regions. These bases are associated with either the Iranian Air Force or the Revolutionary Guards and support various military missions.

Iran says two soldiers, one of which was an officer, were killed ...	As the Islamic Republic contemplates whether to respond or swallow their pride, an announcement says two Iranian troops were killed during the Israeli strike; Al-Mayadeen, associated with Hezbollah, says this was 'a win for Iran' On Saturday morning, around 11:00 AM, Iranian military acknowledged two soldiers were killed in the Israeli attack, one of whom held a rank equivalent to a major. Almost simultaneously, Sky News Arabic reported that Iran communicated to Israel, via a third party, that it had no intention of retaliating. If this report is accurate, it suggests that Israel's strategy was effective. This operation was described as a larger-scale response compared to the one Israel launched in April, during which Israeli forces struck central Iran, and Iranian officials claimed no damage was caused. The Wall Street Journal reported that, hours before the attack, Israel sent a warning to Iran through Arab and European intermediaries. This warning detailed the targets Israel intended to strike and indicated any Iranian retaliation would be met with even stronger subsequent attacks. Meanwhile, 'Nour News,' affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, stated that 'Tehran’s policy regarding the Israeli attack is to respond without haste. Israeli aggression cannot be ignored.' The Tasnim news agency reported that 'Iran reserves the right to respond to any aggression. Israel will face a proportional response to any action.' Conversely, the Lebanese network 'Al-Mayadeen' claimed, 'The confrontation ended with a victory for Iran. The resistance against Israel has established a new equation in the region.' In the meantime, Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement asserting that 'Iran is entitled and committed to defending itself against external aggressive actions.' So far, local media have been broadcasting images of normalcy from various cities across Iran this morning, including Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran, which was reportedly attacked. Iranian networks have mocked the Israeli attack, distributing videos of residents dismissing the threat, as well as a video comparing the Iranian attack on Israel to the Israeli attack on Iran. The only documented evidence of the attack's damage was broadcast by the Qatari channel 'Al-Arabi,' showing the destruction in the city of Shamsabad, south of Tehran, as a result of the Israeli strike. According to reports from media associated with the Iranian opposition, the target was an 'industrial innovation' factory in the city, which might produce drones. Additionally, Iranian sources informed The New York Times that among the sites attacked in Tehran province was an S-300 air defense battery at Imam Khomeini International Airport. According to these sources, this battery provides protection for parts of Iran's capital. They also claimed that at least three missile bases belonging to the Revolutionary Guards were damaged in the Israeli attacks, adding that 'drones attacked the secret military base at Parchin on the outskirts of Tehran. One hit the base, while others were shot down.' Our analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, highlights that in the Parchin area, Iran has previously conducted experiments intended to enable the production of nuclear weapons—the nuclear explosive device. There is no solid evidence indicating that Iran has resumed efforts to develop a nuclear warhead, but if the reports of the Parchin facility being attacked are accurate, the goal appears to have been to disrupt Tehran's ability to conduct experiments that would advance it in producing a nuclear bomb, should it decide to do so. Officially, Iranian officials remained silent this morning, with Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref merely posting on social media that 'Iran's strength humiliates the enemies of the homeland.' 'Impact comparable to hitting Rafael's missile production line' According to the IDF, during the night, Israel conducted three separate waves of attacks targeting missile production facilities, surface-to-air missile systems, and additional aerial capabilities in Iran. Despite Iranian mockery, Israeli sources asserted that 'Iran is trying to claim that the explosions were due to their successful air defense. This is false. They were a complete failure with zero interceptions.' Israeli assessments suggest that Tehran is expected to respond to the strike, though the nature of this response remains unclear. An Israeli source familiar with the details stated, 'The intelligence provided by the Military Intelligence Directorate in this event is like science fiction, far beyond imagination. The strike precisely targeted factories producing surface-to-surface missiles, ensuring a particularly significant impact on Iran. This is 16-digit precise intelligence (full coordinates) on an irreplaceable factory, with a precise Air Force strike, not near or approximate.' The source added, 'We attacked most of the surface-to-surface missile production capabilities. The goal was to prevent Iran from continuing their production. It's as if someone dismantled Rafael's missile production line.' In preparing for an Iranian response, it is worth noting that the U.S. warned Iran of 'consequences' for such actions and clarified that it was prepared in advance to defend Israel against a potential Iranian retaliation. IDF Spokesperson Brigadier General Daniel Hagari emphasized that Israel still has a 'large target bank' in Iran and will not hesitate to strike if Tehran chooses to attack. By targeting Iran's air defense systems first, and reportedly similar systems in Syria and Iraq, Israel effectively granted its Air Force planes and aircraft operational freedom in Iranian airspace. This knowledge—that Israel can strike Iran again without its defenses—will likely make Tehran reconsider before retaliating.

Washington post: Israel designed attack so Iran could 'deny major...	The American paper says the Israeli attack, made known ahead of time to the Biden administration, was designed to limit civilian casualties and allow the Iranian regime to save face, effectively taking the sting out of a possible response; Arab Sky News says Iran has notified this attack will not elicit another retaliation A source familiar with Israel's plans told the Washington Post on Saturday morning that 'Israel designed its strike with the intention of minimizing casualties and keeping the impact to a level that would allow Iran to deny major damage and contain the situation, according to a person briefed on Israel’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified matters.' According to the source, 'This was a larger-scale version of Israel's response in April when Israel struck central Iran, and Iranian officials claimed no significant damage was done.' It's worth noting that after Israel's response to the Iranian attack in April, which National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir even called 'weak,' sparking anger in Israel, Iran did not retaliate—thus effectively closing the chapter until it was reopened with the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Although Israel anticipates some form of response from Iran to last night's attack—which was significantly broader than the one in April—Tehran currently seems to be trying to de-escalate. Only hours after the strike did Iran's military admit that two of its soldiers were killed in the attacks, which focused on Tehran and the Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in the west. Earlier, Iran insisted that the strikes caused 'minimal damage' and that most were intercepted. Sky News in Arabic reported that Iran informed Israel, through a third party, that it would not respond to the attack. Conversely, according to 'Nour News,' affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, 'Tehran's policy regarding the Israeli attack is to respond without haste. Israeli aggression cannot be ignored.' Meanwhile, local media broadcast images showing normalcy from various cities across Iran, including Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport, which was reported to have been attacked. Iranian networks mocked the Israeli attack, sharing videos of residents dismissing it, as well as a video comparing the Iranian attack on Israel to the Israeli attack on Iran. While Iranian officials maintained silence this morning, Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref limited his remarks to social media, stating, 'Iran's strength humiliates the enemies of the homeland.' Despite Iran's ridicule, Israeli sources stated that 'Iran is trying to claim that the explosions are due to their successful air defense. That's a lie. They were a complete failure, with zero interceptions.' According to Israeli assessments, Tehran is expected to respond to the attack, though it is still unclear how. An Israeli source familiar with the details said, 'The intelligence provided by the Military Intelligence Directorate in this event is beyond imagination, extremely so. The strike was precise on factories producing surface-to-surface missiles to ensure a significant impact on Iran. This is 16-digit precise intelligence (full coordinates) on an irreplaceable factory, with a precise Air Force strike, not near or approximate.' The source claimed, 'We attacked most of the surface-to-surface missile production capabilities, aiming to prevent Iran from continuing their production. It's as if someone dismantled Rafael's missile production line.' Regarding the anticipation of an Iranian response, it is worth noting that the U.S. warned Iran of 'consequences' for such an action and stated it was prepared in advance to defend Israel against any potential Iranian retaliation. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari clarified that Israel still has a 'large target bank' in Iran and will not hesitate to strike if Tehran chooses to attack. The decision to first target Iran's air defense systems, reportedly also in Syria and Iraq, effectively allowed Israeli Air Force planes and aircraft free rein in Iranian skies. This knowledge—that Israel can strike Iran again without its defenses—will likely make Tehran think twice before retaliating.

Israeli Air Force strikes in Iran: Exact timeline	Military installations, air defense systems and missile manufacturing facilities were all in the IDF's sights as the attack unfolded overnight; responses from the international community pouring in, the Biden administration was updated ahead of time and details of the attack exemplify military precision About 900 miles from Israel, in the early hours of Saturday, precisely 25 days after Iran's ballistic missile attack, reports of explosions in Iran began to emerge at 2:00 AM, signaling the start of Israel's counterattack. For over three intense hours, across three separate waves, dozens of Israeli Air Force fighter jets and aircraft targeted military complexes, air defense systems, missile production facilities, and surface-to-surface missile launchers in Tehran, as well as in the Khuzestan and Ilam provinces in western Iran. According to the New York Times, 20 different targets were hit, though Tehran downplayed the situation in the morning, given warnings they received from the U.S. against a possible response. The Home Front Command instructions have not changed for now. The first wave began, as mentioned, at 2:00 AM (Israeli time) with reports of explosions in Tehran, as well as in Syria and Iraq, leading to the closure of their airspace. Reports indicated that this wave primarily targeted air defense systems in all three countries, likely to allow Israeli Air Force aircraft the freedom to proceed with their strikes. However, at the time, the situation was unclear: with the sound of explosions, frightened residents in Iran took to the streets, fearing that airports in the Iranian capital might have been hit. Shortly afterward, around 2:30 AM, the IDF spokesperson officially confirmed: 'The IDF is carrying out precise military strikes in Iran, in response to the ongoing attacks by the Iranian regime against the State of Israel in recent months, in accordance with the directive of the political echelon.' IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated in an English-language declaration to the foreign media that Israel 'has the right and obligation to respond' to Iran, 'like any other sovereign country in the world.' He noted the strike is a response to months of Iranian actions against Israel since October 7, including those by its proxies. At this stage, the Iranians focused on downplaying the events, with reports from the country stating that the source of the explosion sounds was the air defense systems intercepting the IDF attack. BBC noted shortly afterward that it was unclear which sites were hit in Iran, as Tehran claimed that routine life continued, and Israel did not disclose what it was targeting other than 'military targets.' Around 3:00 AM, it was reported that President Joe Biden was 'closely updated' on the developments. About half an hour later, the Pentagon clarified that the U.S. was not involved in the strike in Iran, although it was informed about it. Israel, in fact, shared with the U.S. what it planned to do and did not surprise it despite Pentagon document leaks. At 4:15 AM, further reports indicated that President Biden and Vice President Harris were updated on the attack. Despite this, until almost 4:00 AM, global media continued to report it was still unclear what was hit and where, also noting Syria reported Israeli airstrikes hitting military sites in its center and south. Then, reports of another wave of attacks in Iran surfaced, along with footage of interception attempts in the skies. In this wave, Israel hit Iranian surface-to-surface missile production facilities, with an informed Israeli source stating, 'The intelligence provided by the Military Intelligence Directorate in this event is science fiction beyond all imagination. The hit on factories producing surface-to-surface missiles was precise, to ensure significant impact. This is 16-digit precise intelligence (full coordinates) on an irreplaceable factory, with a precise Air Force strike, neither near nor approximate.' Meanwhile, as pilots were still in enemy territory, offices of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant began releasing photos of them in the Operations Directorate's command bunker. The New York Times reported that the strikes in the additional wave concluded about half an hour after they began, around 5:00 AM, targeting air defense systems, missile production facilities, UAVs, and launch sites. 'If Iran makes a mistake - we will respond.' At 6:00 AM, IDF announced that the Air Force jets had returned safely to the country after striking air defense systems and surface-to-surface missiles in Iran, stating that the operation was named 'Days of Repentance.' According to the official IDF statement, 'Air Force jets attacked, with intelligence guidance, missile production means that Iran launched toward the State of Israel in the past year. Simultaneously, surface-to-air missile arrays and additional aerial capabilities of Iran were attacked, which were intended to limit Israel's aerial freedom of action in Iran. IDF has many offensive operational capabilities, some of which were carried out today in striking strategic arrays deep within Iran. The State of Israel reserves the right and duty to protect its citizens if the Iranian regime continues its attacks against Israel and its citizens.' 'The extent of the damages and results will be revealed later, but already there is broader freedom of action for the IDF,' they said. 'We are focused on the objectives of the war in Lebanon and Gaza, and Iran is pushing for regional escalation. We are at peak readiness in defense and offense, with no change in the Home Front Command instructions at the moment. We are in ongoing intelligence and operational assessment. We have proven that we can strike at any point in the Middle East.' About 20 minutes after the IDF's announcement, in a conversation with reporters, a senior White House official stated the U.S. fully backs Israel and warns Iran of 'consequences' if it responds to the IDF strike — which was defined as 'self-defense.' According to the official, 'We deployed a missile battery and acted to strengthen Israel's air defense systems in anticipation of tonight's response. President Biden and Vice President Harris have clearly demonstrated that we will always help protect Israel from Iran and its terrorist organizations.' However, in Israel, it is estimated that Iran will respond. After attempting throughout the night to downplay the results of the strikes, at 6:30 AM, it admitted for the first time that 'minimal damage' was caused at several sites, but emphasized that its air defense systems successfully confronted 'Israeli aggression.'

Bereaved families left to cope with immense loss after 13 IDF tro...	Ground incursions into southern Lebanon have began taking an immense toll, as no less than 13 troops have lost in their lives in less than two days, leaving shattered families behind, left to pick up the pieces; 'How do you process something like this? I need you more than ever,' said the daughter of a fallen soldier During the Simchat Torah holiday, while many celebrated across the country, 20 children were left fatherless, all perishing in battles in southern Lebanon. These children, aged between 4 and 17, faced the profound loss of a parent at an early stage in their lives. In the clashes in southern Lebanon during Simchat Torah, 10 soldiers were killed, six of whom were parents. Shlomo Aviad Naiman, 31, left behind four children: Haggai (12), Tzuriya (9), Carmi (8), and Rafael (4). Mordechai Chaim Amoyal, 42, left behind six children. Shmuel Harari, 35, left behind three children. Guy Idan left behind two daughters, Libi (17) and Avishag (13). Dan Maury, 43, left behind two sons. Omri Lotan, 47, left behind two daughters and a son, Mika, Gaya, and Amit. Aside from the tragic addition of many orphans to the circle of bereavement in just one day, October 2024 has been the most challenging month in the conflict since December 2023, when 114 people were killed. In fact, this month has been the deadliest in the war since the beginning of the year, with 69 fatalities from operational activities, rocket, and UAV attacks, and terrorist incidents. Since the start of the ground maneuver in Lebanon about a month ago, on September 30, 27 soldiers have been killed, 5 of them in the last 24 hours. Guy Idan was laid to rest: 'You are the salt of the earth, my beloved son' On Friday, in the military section of the cemetery at Kibbutz Shomrat, Sgt. Major (Res.) Guy Idan, a 51-year-old resident of the kibbutz, was laid to rest. He was killed on Thursday by a projectile explosion near a structure in the central sector of southern Lebanon. 'If there is a definition for the term ‘salt of the earth,’ it’s you, my beloved son,' eulogized his father, Yigal. His 17-year-old daughter, Libi Idan, added, 'How do you process something like this? I need you more than ever.' Guy’s father described him as someone who was 'always giving and doing for everyone,' and recounted how he refused to forgo volunteering for reserve duty. Guy’s mother, Rachel Sela, eulogized him as well, describing him as 'a great man with an even greater heart, always volunteering and giving of himself.' She recalled the moment he left for reserves and how she asked him 'not to be a hero,' adding, 'I never thought something would happen to you. I can’t and don’t want to believe it. I am in a nightmare.' Guy Idan was the cousin of Tzachi Idan, who was abducted from his home in Nahal Oz on October 7. 'He will no longer see him return from captivity in Gaza,' wrote a family member. The family said that Guy did everything he could to bring back the abductees, both as a civilian and in the army. Amir, Guy’s brother and Tzachi’s cousin, told Ynet that 'Guy was a very special person, a redhead as a redhead should be. He always loved the army and security. In Kibbutz Shomrat, he established the standby squad to perfection, instilling a sense of security for all the residents. They called him for everything, even when it wasn’t his role because they knew they could rely on him. As a younger brother, I knew I had someone to rely on for everything; he always protected me and always delivered.' 'The world has lost one of its best sons': Mordechai Amoyal was laid to rest On Friday, Sgt. Major (Res.) Mordechai Haim Amoyal (42), a resident of Lod who fell in the battles in southern Lebanon during Simchat Torah, was laid to rest on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Mordechai is survived by his wife Rina and six children. 'How I dreaded being in this place. Since the beginning of the war, I have watched in awe as courageous women eulogized their husbands, what strength and power,' Rina said. 'The world has lost one of its best sons today. What a man you were, what presence, always at the forefront.' She described how 'you were always preoccupied with living a meaningful life. You always aspired higher, and since October 7, you didn’t have time to beat yourself up for not going south. You were a person full of depth, aspiring to the most meaningful life possible, never settling in one place. You were the best partner I could have asked for, the most attentive, the most loving, the closest. You were an amazing and diligent father to our children, a prankster, and a child at heart.' She addressed her children, who were left without their father, saying, 'It’s important for me that you know, kids, that Dad was proud of you, and there is so much of him in each of you. Everywhere you went, you were loved and significant. I want to say thank you for all the good we had together, for making me feel like a queen, for who you are.' His daughter Shira spoke over her father’s fresh grave, saying, 'You always tried to give more and more, asking what would make me come to more classes, trying to think of creative ideas to ignite our passion for Torah. You always said I didn’t have to study at school but to do something with my time—because that was you. You used every minute, listened to lessons on headphones every moment, never wasted a minute, maybe you understood even then that you need to make the most of every minute? Your connection to us as a family was important to you; you wanted to play, travel—because that was you.' His daughter Ayana also eulogized, saying, 'My dad, I remember he was always there for me. He was loved and beloved, he was always there for us. I already miss you, Dad.' His young son added, 'I remember your last visit home, how proud you were of us for building the sukkah by ourselves, just as you were proud last year when we dismantled it ourselves. Thank you for everything, Dad.' Shlomo was laid to rest: 'It’s hard to imagine life without you' On Friday, Sgt. 1st Class (Res.) Shlomo Aviad Naiman (31) from Mitzpe Yeriho was laid to rest on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, 12 siblings, his wife Shir, and four children. 'I can’t believe this really happened to us. We have so many dreams yet to fulfill together. A man of dreams, a man of vision. Our home, which you worked so hard to build and still haven’t finished,' eulogized his wife. 'Our beloved children who need you so much. And I, who don’t know what life is without you. We’ve been together since I was 16. I knew from the start you were mine and I was yours.' His brother Amichai added, 'It’s hard to imagine life without you. You always jumped to volunteer for every task, and everything was always done with joy. In the office, he was defined as the COO, but in practice, he was everything no one else would do, no matter what the task was. For him, the motto was to do what was needed, quietly.' He said, 'We promise to continue your kindness, desires, aspirations, and dreams—with lots of positive activity, charity, and kindness. We will take care of your heroic wife Shir and the children.' Yehudit, his sister, eulogized, saying, 'On the eve of the holiday, I sat in the sukkah and felt something bad. I thought it was a feeling you get after what we all went through last year. I wrote about it on my phone, and today I saw it was exactly at five, when we parted from you. I realized that’s what it feels like to lose a brother. How will the world go on without you? I know you did it because you are invincible. We are an unbeatable nation, thanks to you and all the heroes.'

Explosions in Lebanon prompt false earthquake alerts in northern ...	Shortly after IAF jets return from Iran, residents all over the north receive a series of alerts on their phones, warning of an impending earthquake; IDF Spokesperson clarifies it was brought on by a series of controlled explosions in southern Lebanon In the early hours of Saturday, shortly after a sequence of strikes in Iran by the Israeli Air Force, an unusual flurry of earthquake warnings jolted residents across dozens of locales in the Golan Heights, Haifa, and surrounding communities. People recounted receiving urgent messages on their mobile devices, with some in Haifa noting alerts instructing them to reach safety within a mere minute. This wave of alerts wasn't due to natural tectonic shifts but rather the result of a significant, controlled blast in Lebanon. The Geological Survey of Israel clarified, 'The earthquake warnings were set off by a considerable, controlled explosion that took place this morning in the north. Our alert system mistook the explosion for seismic activity, hence the widespread notifications.' IDF spokesperson reassured the public, stating unequivocally that this was not a security breach. 'In recent minutes, explosive sounds have echoed across northern Israel, a byproduct of IDF operations in southern Lebanon. There is no cause for security concerns,' the statement read. Golan Regional Council informed its residents, 'Israeli forces neutralized an enemy compound, and following the detonation of a vast amount of explosives in Lebanon, earthquake alerts were activated across wide areas of the country. No changes in safety guidelines are necessary.' A Haifa local shared with Ynet, 'My phone warned of an earthquake, but nothing happened. We all went outside as instructed, yet no quake occurred.' Another resident remarked, 'We've grown accustomed to waking up at 7 AM to missile alerts. Suddenly, an earthquake alert blared from the app. It was terrifying.' The alerts sparked anxiety among residents, given the longstanding belief that a major earthquake is due in Israel. It is generally thought that Israel experiences a significant quake roughly every century, with the last one striking 96 years ago. In 2012, Israel felt one of its strongest earthquakes in two decades. With a magnitude of 5.3, its epicenter lay southeast of Cyprus, and tremors were felt across northern, central, and eastern parts of Israel. Only two instances have seen stronger quakes in the vicinity, both with epicenters further away from Israel. In 1995, a 6.2 magnitude quake shook the Red Sea, about 90 miles south of Eilat, causing road cracks in the city. Last year, a 5.9 magnitude tremor originating from Crete was felt in Israel and neighboring countries. A somewhat less powerful quake occurred in 2008, registering at 5.3 magnitude. Its epicenter was near Tyre in Lebanon, yet it was distinctly felt throughout most of Israel. The last earthquake to cause tangible damage in Israel struck eight years ago. In February 2004, a 5.1 magnitude quake shook the Dead Sea region, leading to partial collapses of several buildings and an evacuation of the government complex. These moderate-intensity tremors have so far spared the population from casualties, but a slightly stronger quake could alter this reality dramatically. In 1956, around 150 people perished in a quake in Mount Shouf, Lebanon. The 1927 quake, with a magnitude of 6.2, wreaked havoc and claimed numerous lives in what was then a sparsely populated region. More than 300 people were killed in what was then Palestine, and about a thousand homes were destroyed. Cities like Nablus, Tiberias, Ramla, and Lod faced prolonged rehabilitation. In the 19th century, the most devastating earthquake struck in 1837. Thousands perished in Safed alone, Tiberias’s city walls crumbled, and massive waves battered the shores of the Sea of Galilee. The tremors also impacted Jericho and Jaffa, not sparing the northern regions alone. The belief that a significant quake hits Israel approximately every 100 years is supported by historical events. Nearly a century prior, in 1759, a colossal quake struck, killing thousands in Lebanon and affecting Tiberias and Acre. Estimates from that time suggest around 200 fatalities occurred in Safed.

A source claimed in a report by the Iranian news agency 'Tasnim' that the Israeli attack in Iran was conducted from outside the country's borders and caused limited damage. The source stated, 'The Israeli claim that 20 sites were attacked is unrealistic and is part of psychological warfare.' The source reiterated that no Revolutionary Guard military facility was targeted and that the report of 100 aircraft participating in the attack is 'false and intended to exaggerate the weak strike.'

U.S. satisfied after Israeli Iran strike, warns Tehran of consequ...	A White House official speaking to reporters after the strike says the administration urged Israel to carry out a precise, targeted strike that would deter Iran from further attacks and avoid regional escalation A senior White House official on Saturday said that the Biden administration worked with Israeli leaders in recent weeks to encourage them to carry out a precise and proportionate strike on Iran with minimum risk to civilian casualties, in retaliation for the Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier this month. The Israeli strike 'was extensive, it was targeted, it was precise,' he said. Israel launched a three-hour strike on Iranian military targets around the country, outside populated areas. According to the IDF, the military targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities.' The official who spoke to reporters after the Israeli strike ended, said U.S. President Joe Biden discussed the situation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week and encouraged him to plan an attack that would deter further Iranian strikes against Israel while reducing the chance for further escalation. He said that was the goal of both the U.S. and Israel. The official mentioned the U.S. deployment of the THAAD missile defense system to Israel, to protect against Iranian missiles and said that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have proven that they would always come to the defense of Israel against Iran and its terrorist proxies. He said that if Iran chose to respond once again, 'We will be ready and there will be consequences on Iran.' However, he added, the administration does not want to see that happen.

According to MDA, two young men, aged 21, were critically injured, while an 80-year-old man sustained serious injuries. MDA teams are transporting the injured to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, along with several others wounded by shrapnel. The Hezbollah terrorist organization claimed responsibility for 'a large-scale barrage of fire' directed at Karmiel and the surrounding area. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported that some 30 rockets were launched from Lebanon toward the Karmiel and Upper Galilee area, with some intercepted.

Mission accomplished IDF says after attack on Iran	Military says all planes return safely after three-hour-long strike reportedly targeting missile production sites, surface-to-air missile arrays, other Iranian aerial capabilities; IDF warns Iran not to respond Israel on Saturday completed a three-hour-long strike on Iran, 25 days after an Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel on October 1. The military said all Israeli aircraft returned safely to their base after the mission was completed and its objectives reached. Some 20 sites were attacked, according to a report in the New York Times. 'The strike was conducted in response to the attacks by the Iranian regime against the State of Israel and its citizens in recent months. The retaliatory strike has been completed and the mission was fulfilled,' the IDF said. Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel demonstrated the capabilities and the resolve to act in defense of the country and warned that if Iran were to continue its attacks and the escalation of violence in the region Israel would respond. In a written statement the military said that based on intelligence, IAF aircraft struck missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles. 'These missiles posed a direct and immediate threat to the citizens of the State of Israel. Simultaneously, the IDF struck surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel's aerial freedom of operation in Iran. Israel avoided attacking targets that could drag the region into an all-out war including Iran's oil production and nuclear sites. Dozens of aircraft participated in the attack that was carried out at a distance of 1,600 kilometers (994 miles) from Israel's borders and in several areas of Iran. 'The extend of the damage and the results of the strikes will become known later but as of now, the IDF has a wider range of freedom to operate,' military sources said adding that Israel still has targets it can strike in the future. 'We are now focused on the war in Gaza and Lebanon and Iran has been pushing for regional escalation,' the sources said. 'We are on full alert in our defensive and offensive capabilities and there are no changes to Homefront instructions to the public. We are continuing our intelligence and operational assessments. We've proven we can attack anywhere in the Middle East.' Iran confirmed that damage was caused by the Israeli attacks but claimed it was limited. Iran's air defenses said Israel attacked military sites in Tehran Province as well as in the provinces of Khuzestan and Ilam in the west of the country. A White House official expressed home that Iran would not retaliate for the Israeli strike and threatened 'consequences' if it does. This should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between the two countries, the official said, adding that the U.S. has multiple direct and indirect channels of communication with Iran where it has made its position clear.

'There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes,' Tasnim quoted the sources as saying. Israel launched strikes on Iran early on Saturday targeting military bases including ballistic missile sites, weapons storage facilities and air defenses according to reports in waves of attacks estimated to continue for hours. According to a report in the New York times late on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ai Khamenei instructed his military to prepare for war against Israel but the paper added that if the Israeli attack would be limited, Iran may not respond. Israel's attacks came in retaliation for an Iranian ballistic missile attack on October 1. Israel was expected to launch attacks on Iran and was considering its targets in coordination with the United States. The U.S. urged Israel to avoid leading to a regional war by refraining from attack son Iran's nuclear facilities or its oil production. Sources, two of them identified as members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) told the Times that an Israeli strike that would cause substantial damage could be responded to by a barrage of up to 1,000 ballistic missiles; escalated attacks by Iranian proxies in the region; and disrupting the flow of global energy supplies and maritime traffic through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.

No change to Homefront Command regulations	Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized,' IDF spokesperson says 'We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel' The IDF said early on Saturday that there are currently no changes to the guidelines of the Homefront command after Israel began its attack on Iran. 'Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel,' Hagari said. Israel launched 'precise strikes on military targets in Iran,' Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said, which is a retaliation to Iran's ballistic missile strike on Israel on October 1. Special emergency regulations have been in place in northern Israel amid rocket and drone attacks from Lebanon's Hezbollah terror group but on Friday, Some municipalities in the Galilee said they planned to resume in-school learning on Sunday, after a two-week break for the holidays. In the center of the country, no limitations were in place on schools, but crowding was limited to no more than 2,000 people.

Tehran downplays Israeli strike claiming not significant damage	This could be seen as an effort to avoid the need to retaliate; local TV network claims airports are operating normally and there have been no incidents that 'require intervention.' Iran claims explosions heard in its cities were caused by its own air defenses, while an Israeli strike was underway early on Saturday against Iranian military sites. 'This is a lie,' an Israeli official said. 'There have been no intercepts.' Iranian television reported that both its international airports were operating normally and showed images of Tehran's sky devoid of any smoke or sign of explosions. The network said there have been no incidents that 'require intervention.' A correspondent for the network said that there were Israeli attempts to attack three bases in the Tehran Province but the air defenses thwarted the attack. This can be seen as an Iranian effort to avoid the need to launch a retaliatory strike against Israel. According to a report in the New York Times late on Thursday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei instructed his military to prepare for war against Israel but added that if the strike is not a significant one, there may not be a response.

Explosions heard in Iran, Karaj, in strike attributed to Israel, ...	It was so loud and the sky became red,' an eye witness tells Iranian semi-official TV; reports of explosions also in the area of Damascus | This is a breaking story Israel began its attack against Iran early Saturday morning local time in retaliation for its massive ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1, two sources with knowledge told Axios. Several loud explosions were heard in Iran's capital Tehran and the nearby city of Karaj city, Iranian media said, adding that the cause was unknown. There was no official comment about the source of the explosions. Witnesses in Tehran confirmed hearing loud explosions. 'It was so loud and the sky became red,' said an Iranian resident in Tehran, who asked not to be named. Explosions were also heard in the Damascus countryside and central region, according to Syrian state TV. Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic missile attack carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, Tehran's second direct attack on Israel in six months. Iranian authorities have warned Israel against launching an attack, saying any strike on Iran would be met with a stronger retaliation.

We thought we were the only ones developing drones, we weren't p...	UAVs have become Hezbollah's effective attack weapon in the war, causing deaths, injuries, heavy damage, and quite a bit of a headache for the Israeli Air Force; How did these simple drones manage to evade Israel’s sophisticated air defense systems? And how did Israel overlook this threat all these years? Before reporting to military reserve duty, Refael Kauders and his wife Judith went on a weekend to celebrate their wedding anniversary. They had a lot to celebrate: four lovely children, a house in Tzur Hadassah, great love. The 39-year-old Kauders, who served as religion and tradition coordinator of the 5030th Infantry Battalion, did not have to report to reserves duty, but he was determined to contribute his share. Upon his return from the weekend, Kauders set out for the Druze town of Hurfeish, where he and his fellow reservists in the infantry battalion were busy setting up the camp, near a soccer field. Some soldiers in the battalion thought it was dangerous to set up a camp in such an exposed area, near the Lebanon border, arguing that 'staying there endangers the lives of dozens of soldiers', but the location of the camp was not changed. On Wednesday, June 5, afternoon, Hezbollah experimented with a new method of attack, launching two suicide drones toward the Horfeish area in the upper Galilee. It is not clear yet whether Hezbollah had advance information on the whereabouts of the soldiers, or if the drone operators were simply looking for targets and found them. Either way, the crossing of the drones was not identified, and no warning alarm was triggered. One drone exploded on the soccer field, and the second continued to hover in the air for a few more minutes, waiting for rescue forces to rush to the scene of the first explosion, and then it exploded as well. Staff Sergeant (res.) Kauders was killed, and 12 were injured, including a female soldier who was seriously injured. 'We felt like ducks on a shooting range,' said a reservist from the battalion who survived the attack. The UAVs again took a bloody toll. The IDF announced that a thorough investigation will be carried out and lessons will be learned, but Hizki Bezalel, the brother-in-law of the late Kauders is troubled. Since the disaster, he began to explore UAVs, trying to understand why Israel was not able to deal with them. 'It upsets me that a device that costs about $2,000 causes us more trouble than all the expensive weapons, and we continue to get equipped with F-35 and the Air Force refuses to listen,' he said this week. 'The army is reluctant to consider a cheap solution. Instead, they prefer to develop expensive and sophisticated weapons. The problem is that senior military officials are unwilling to consider non-prestigious solutions. After all, no F-35 can handle a strike of a hundred UAVs launched simultaneously. We are not angry, we just want them to learn a lesson. They should conclude and understand that reality has changed. They just need to understand how the UAVs work, and whether there are solutions available. To this day our case has not been investigated.' Since October 7, Hezbollah alone has launched about 2,000 unmanned aerial vehicles into Israeli territory. Iran, the Houthis, and the Shiite militias in both Syria and Iraq are also trying to send UAVs. There are no official figures on how many of them hit their targets, but at least eight Israelis were killed in drone attacks and many dozens were injured. The property damage cannot yet be estimated, and it is certainly impossible to set a price tag for all the times that drones urged Israelis to run for shelter or disrupted the course of their life. The late Mikhail Samara from Kafr Yasif was the last person killed (until the publication of this article) by a Hezbollah drone, as he was hit by an IDF intercepting rocket that missed the drone in the Nahariya area. In the same Hezbollah drone attack, 19 people were injured, including six soldiers. Before Samara, drones also claimed the lives of the late Yevgeny Ferder, who was killed by a Houthi drone strike that hit his apartment in Tel Aviv; the late Major Dor Zimel, who was killed by a drone strike on a building in Arab al-Aramshe, where his department stayed; Command Sergeant Major (Res.) Yehezkel Azaria, who was killed by a hit near Margaliot community in the north; Major (Res.) Dan Kamhaji, and Staff-Sergeant-Major (Res.) Nachman Nathan Hertz who was killed by a hit near Metula; and Master Sergeant (Res.) Valeri Chefonov, who was killed by a drone attack on Kibbutz Kabri. While the Iron Dome systems, David's Sling, and the Arrow missiles provide broad protection - although it is not airtight - a small, slow, often unsophisticated vehicle has become a major threat, especially in the north. Indications that UAVs were becoming a weapon that must be addressed were here long before the October 7 massacre. Why didn't it happen? As usual, it depends on who you ask. The bottom line, Israel's security system is trying while under fire to find solutions for that threat. 'The professional challenge is great, but it had to be prioritized' UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) is a general name for all aircraft that do not include a human pilot onboard. Some drones can be purchased cheaply online and armed, and there are larger drones, such as Hermes and Eitan, operated by the Israeli Air Force or the Americans. The benefits of the UAVs are clear: they are usually smaller, cheaper, and simpler to operate than a fighter aircraft; they can be easily adapted to a variety of purposes, and the simpler models do not require a complicated operation, or complex technical setup, airports, or pilots. Having a good and advanced air force is complicated and can be maintained by wealthy countries that have technological capabilities. In contrast, UAVs have also allowed terrorist organizations to establish their aerial threats. Hezbollah began using Iranian-made UAVs in the early 2000s. Their first attack was modest: almost 20 years ago, in November 2004, Hezbollah's first UAV entered Israel's airspace without being detected, hovered for several minutes above Nahariya in the north, turned to the sea, and then fell. Over the years, there were more infiltrations by Hezbollah drones, also in the Second Lebanon War in 2006, but they were usually intercepted. In the meantime, Hezbollah accumulated more and more Iranian drones of various types and established a special drone division, called Unit 127, which engaged in developing their flying capabilities. Israel followed these developments closely, sand sometimes reacted - in December 2022 Israel bombed Uthe nit 127 facility in Lebanon, for example - but somehow, Israel underestimated the potential of the threat. Among the mass of urgent tasks in the north, such as combating Hezbollah's missile precision project and preventing Iranian entrenchment in Syria, the UAVs were not Israel's top priority. This was, of course, a mistake. The war that is taking place in Ukraine, almost 2,000 km from here, should have been a warning signal. At the beginning of last year, Russia and Iran signed a huge deal for the purchase of UAVs. Iran has supplied Russia with drones 'Shahed 131' and 'Shahed 136', both suicide drones, which are a cheap alternative to the expensive Russian missiles, which have been running out. These are relatively 'dumb' aircraft, but the Ukrainians learned very quickly how deadly they were. Hezbollah is also equipped with these two types of 'Shahed', in addition to several other types of drones. The terrorist organization currently uses mainly suicide drones and intelligence-gathering drones and recently released videos documenting drone flights over Haifa port and onsite security facility in Haifa Bay. Moreover, Hezbollah also has Iranian attack drones of the 'Karar' type ', which can carry bombs or missiles, launch them, and return to their base, or launch them and then crash themselves on the target. The Iranian attacking drones do not have the sophistication and accuracy of Israel's UAVs, and still, if Hezbollah decides to use them, it could cause great damage. 'The fact that we reached October 7 without an adequate response to the threat of UAVs is a failure of the Ministry of Defense along with the air defense system,' says a source familiar with the UAV world. 'They should have seen what was happening in Ukraine and adapted it to the Israeli reality. We did not react quickly enough to the threat. One could have realized that once the Russians used it in Ukraine, bearing in mind that the Iranians are their allies, at some point, it will reach us - and we should have created a response to it. Unfortunately, it did not happen.' Why not? 'Officials I talk to claim that budgetary constraints forced them to equip with less good systems, especially radar systems. The sooner UAVs are identified, the chances are to intercept them. Currently, IAI's radar production time is long. The second problem is that some of the existing radars are positioned at high altitudes aimed to detect missiles, but UAVs fly at a different angle relative to the radar system. The Iron Dome, for example, underwent adjustments for UAVs and improved its detection capabilities, but it does not provide an airtight solution. The third point is that Israel is currently facing many fronts, about seven. And still, this is not the security system's biggest nightmare.' What is its biggest nightmare? 'A 'swarm' drone attack. It could cause damage to air force bases and strategic facilities.' Brigadier General Ran Kochav, former commander of the air defense system between 2018-2021, admits that 'the Israeli Air Force has determined that UAVs were not an existential threat, and therefore was a second priority,' but he also states that 'I'm not sorry about that.' Why? 'Because it was necessary to prioritize. The aerial defense is not perfect, but on April 14 (the night of the first Iranian attack) and in October, the defense was excellent. UAVs pose a great challenge. There are many types of drones: fuel-powered, electric-powered, remotely controlled, one-way drones, such as suicide UAVs, attacking drones, and drones used for taking pictures. A UAV that flies from Iran is not similar to a drone that flies from Marjayoun in south Lebanon to Metula in the north of Israel. UAVs are not characterized only by their variety but also by their quantity. They are inexpensive and therefore replaced the rockets. Our enemy realized that the air defense system can cope well with rockets and missiles, so it began sending swarms of drones.' Quite a few claim that the problem, as seen in the war in Ukraine, was right in front of us, but we failed to realize it was coming our way, and we didn't prepare ourselves 'It's not true that we didn't look at the Russians in Ukraine. Operations teams that studied the war there concluded that it was a challenging threat but not an existential one and that it did a lot of psychological damage, and we had to deal with it. Technologically speaking it's difficult to handle it because the UAV is very simple. It causes great damage, but it's not scientifically complicated. We were not prepared for UAVs in the Iron Sword war because it wasn't a top priority. We needed to buy another tank, a submarine, and an iron dome, so we prioritized. Imagine what would have happened if we had set a different priority, and instead of thousands of rocket interceptors we had thousands of UAV interceptors - rockets would have killed more. We need both. It generated a perception of the 'absurdity of success'.' What does 'absurdity of success' mean? 'Since the success of the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow 2 and 3 systems is so great, an 'absurdity of success' perception is generated. The public praises us for our achievements, but he does not forgive us in terms of the drone attacks, where the success rate was 'only' 75% and not 95%. I hear terms like 'failure', 'scandal' or 'how could this happen?', which do not reflect reality.' Can you talk to me in numbers? 'In this war, the number of rocket and missile interceptions was of 4-digits, and by the time this article is published there will be another 200, these are huge amounts. In terms of UAVs and other flying objects, the interceptions are 3-digits.' 'Things keep changing' The main problem, as mentioned, is that UAVs are difficult to detect. The Israeli radar systems are very advanced, but they know how to detect planes, missiles, and even rockets of a certain size. That's what they were designed for, as this was the main threat. But UAVs, especially the smallest ones, are slow speed, flying at low altitudes deep inside valleys in the Galilee, and since Hezbollah launches them near the border, there is not enough time left to detect them, while they dive toward their targets. Their size is very confusing, and they are also made of a variety of materials. In the first months of the war, there were cases where the Iron Dome radar detected a UAV threat in the north which turned out to be innocent migrating cranes, says an officer involved in the production of radars. 'It happened that we shot at flocks of cranes mistakenly identified as aircraft infiltration, and we launched Iron Domes and David's sling interceptors.' 'Our main problem is detection because when we don't see, we don't shoot', says Brigadier General (res.) Kochav. 'It is difficult to detect UAVs because they fly below the radar and leave a low radar signature. They do not have much metal, so a radar designed to detect an aircraft by its metal, fails to identify the drone, and if you lower the sensitivity of the radar, then many false alarms are triggered. Therefore, the main challenge is detection. It is possible to detect them by observation, or by acoustic radars, as was done in World War II, or using electronic warfare by receiving GPS signals, but it's very difficult', he adds. 'Furthermore, we may detect the drone, but it will be hard to follow it because it flies slowly compared to a rocket or an airplane. And if we've already managed to track it, it's not certain that we'll be able to launch a fighter plane to intercept it, bearing in mind that air defense systems are not deployed everywhere. Besides, we might not even know whose drone it is.' What do you mean? 'If a rocket is launched at you, for example, it must be the enemy's. But how can you tell whom a drone or another flying device belongs to? It might belong to Metula's standby security squad. Moreover, regulation issues also pose a problem. Any child can buy a drone and equip it with explosives. I'm not trying to make excuses. The result is not good enough. We need 100 percent success, but because Iron Dome's success rate is 95% or more, then 75% is not acceptable.' It's maybe 75% now. But what will happen in the event of a swarm attack of dozens, maybe hundreds of UAVs simultaneously launched toward a certain target? Does this sound like an extreme scenario? 'In my view, an extreme scenario would involve a simultaneous attack, by Hezbollah, Syria, Iran, and Yemen, launching both cruise and surface-to-surface missiles and flying devices, using different methods, some electric, some motorized, some armed, some precise. This may sound like a far-fetched scenario, but I can't say 'This will never happen'. There is no perfect airtight defense, and there is no solution available for every scenario. However, our air defense system is one of the best in the world, and if citizens are under attack, they'd better be here than in Beirut, Damascus, or Tehran. Is this an existential threat? No. Also, dozens of drones do not pose an existential threat. It's not good when such an aircraft crashes in Tel Aviv. But let's calm down.' Prof. Daniel Weihs, Head of the Autonomous Systems and Robotics Program at the Technion, has been eating, breathing, and planning drones for 50 years. And yet, he admits that he too only recently realized the potential of the threat. 'No one, including me, thought they could use it against us. Only in the last few months did I realize it, as it started to become real and not just an episode.' So, what do we do? 'I know that now they are working frantically to find solutions, including those that I can't disclose. We are a country that has developed drones and UAVs more than any other country, the problem is that we thought we were the only ones doing it, and we did not prepare ourselves for an attack.' In the meantime, the security system does not have a complete solution for UAVs, certainly not at the level of the Iron Dome system. Dr. Liran Antebi, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies INSS, believes that it's not just the IDF's responsibility. 'After all, the IDF does not budget itself,' she says. 'There is a great deal of blame on Israel's decision-makers. There were several years when Israel lacked an approved state budget, which made it impossible to build military strength. Today there are excellent systems, but they are not suitable for UAVs.' And meanwhile, time passes. 'The time that has passed between the war in Ukraine, the October 7 massacre, and today, was preparing ourselves better for such a challenge, and we are closing the gap today, while under fire when it could have been done when we were not at war.' The Directorate of Defense, Research, & Development (DDR&D) at the Ministry of Defense, is not worried about looking for 'solutions under fire'. We work better when we're under pressure. That's the Israeli nature', says an official in DDR&D. However, it would have been better to find solutions for UAV threats beforehand. 'Over the years, the security system has faced multiple and diverse threats. But things keep changing. The Iron Dome system is constantly improving, because the UAV is also changing in terms of communication, color, and power source; today it runs on fuel and tomorrow it's electric. We have to adjust to these changes. But we have some solutions in store, and we believe we are headed in the right direction.' The quick solution and the open hole The need for quick solutions to handle UAV threats led the defense establishment to re-use the old Vulcan cannon which had been in service with the Israel Air Force in the past and received modifications as the 'Racquet' variant. It is a six-barrel rotary cannon able to fire 22mm 6,000 rounds per minute. This cannon was stationed on top of an armored personnel carrier (APC), originally designed to shoot down aircraft, mainly slow ones, and surfboards. As the planes became faster, and the threats became missiles and rockets, its use decreased, until it was retired in 2006 after the Second Lebanon War. Now the security establishment is considering reusing the Vulcan. The UAVs fly slowly enough, and this is a relatively cheap solution, although the problem of detection remains. It will probably be designated to protect military facilities. In May, for example, a Hezbollah UAV hit the large Sky Dew observation balloon located near the Golani junction in the north. It's possible that some Vulcans could have protected it. 'The Vulcan was very useful in the Yom Kippur War, it was a fantastic weapon,' recalls Brigadier General (Res.) Kochav. Is this the solution? Vulcan from a generation ago? 'Even the Vulcan will not perform 100 percent. It will add 5-10%. But eventually, the drone is made up of an engine and a propeller. It's a very simple engine. In terms of the aviation world, a UAV is going backward, so the anti-aircraft missile is also going backward. But make no mistake, there are also other methods, some are classified.' The official in the DDR&D also assures that Israel is developing interception solutions for UAVs. 'There are technologies in Israel's arsenal that have not yet been deployed. We have already spent hundreds of millions of shekels on solutions to the threats of drones and UAVs. Besides, Iron Dome, Barak (a defense system against naval missiles), and also pilots, know how to intercept these threats, as they resemble military UAVs. The challenge is posed by radio-controlled planes, kites, and products that one can buy on AliExpress. In that case, we take measures that are more suitable for drones.' Prof. Weihs from the Technion emphasizes that the solution for UAVs involves money. If a UAV costs a few thousand dollars, but intercepting it costs ten times as much, this is a problem. 'So, one of the challenges is not how to take down drones, but rather to take them down cheaply,' he explains. 'You use fighter jets or Iron Dome, which cost a lot of money, against a small, cheap aircraft. If something costs ten thousand dollars and you use a hundred thousand dollars to shoot it down, it won't last long. And there's another problem. Once you launch interceptors above a populated area, pieces of the interceptors can fall and injure people.' So, what can be both cheap, effective and safe? 'Disruptions, for example. But to disrupt drones, one has to be familiar with the system. The disruption should focus specifically on the direction of the UAV. Too much disruption might act against you as well. This is one of the problems. On the other hand, if you try to disrupt at a great distance, the power is lessened.' Can this also help us in the event of a swarm drone attack? 'It's difficult, but possible. A swarm is centralized, so you can transmit the disruption to focus only on it.' In the end, everyone hopes that the 'Magen Or' laser system will be operational soon and could provide a solution to the UAV threat. The system, which will be Israel's first air defense layer, will launch a powerful laser beam toward the UAV during its flight. The laser is supposed to produce a high temperature, thus causing the drone to explode in the air or it will be taken down. It's a relatively cheap solution (each laser launch will cost about a thousand dollars, compared to about $50,000 interceptor of the Iron Dome). However, the system is still in experimental phases, and the best-case scenario will be operational next year. 'The goal of the Ministry of Defense is to deploy a powerful laser system as part of the Iron Dome architecture,' explains an official from the Ministry of Defense. How will it work? 'The 'brain' will make an automatic decision whether to launch a laser beam or an interceptor that hits the target. The British have the DragonFire laser which is under development; the South Koreans introduced it a month ago a small laser, and of course, the Americans, have a mobile laser system. But we are developing a ground laser for air defense purposes. By the way, there are other variations of a powerful laser, which will eventually be able to intercept high-altitude threats, but this will take a decade to develop.' Not everyone is convinced that laser is the magic solution. Lior Segal is CEO at Third Eye Systems. Shortly before October 7, his company developed 'Meduza' an electro-optical scanning system dedicated to drone recognition. 'The arsenal developed by the big industries doesn't know how to respond to small objects (like UAVs),' he says. 'The use of laser, for example, in my eyes is an amazing idea that was efficient ten years ago, but it does not offer a magic solution for UAVs, because it is a super-expensive system, and above all because the northern border is complex in terms of its topography. These are not the plainlands of Ukraine. The laser is 'Nice to have', but it will not solve all our problems. Rafael is unlikely to develop a drone that intercepts a drone; so this is where small companies like ours fit in and make the difference'. Still, the hole in Israel's sky is open. Prof. Weihs however believes, from his many years of experience, and as someone who was there when the first Tadiran-made UAVs went into the air, that 'every threat is eventually resolved,' he states. And then what? 'Then comes the next generation.'

Inside Lebanon with IDF reservists: 'We are here to do what we di...	The 646th Reserve Brigade uncovered Hezbollah's Radwan Force plan to invade the Galilee, dismantling extensive weapon stockpiles and infrastructure just hundreds of meters from the border; 'Even our emergency reserves don’t have vests fully loaded with magazines and grenades at this scale,' says one soldier A short drive separates Israel's western Galilee from a Lebanese village harboring terrorist strongholds, where the IDF’s 646th Battalion is gathering massive caches of weapons. A year after the reserve paratroopers defended Kibbutz Be’eri near Gaza, they now find themselves conducting offensive operations in Lebanese villages. 'Last year, on Simchat Torah, we were in defensive mode. Now we're on the offensive,' said Col. Elad Shoshan, who became battalion commander just a week before the war began in October 2023. In the past year, Shoshan and his troops fought in Gaza's border region, Jenin, Nur a-Shams, and Rafah. Most recently, they had been stationed in northern Israel, poised for this moment—to cross the border and restore the peace and security lost to tens of thousands of displaced Israelis. 'Just as we defeated the enemy in Gaza, we're here to do the same in the north,' Shoshan said. 'We're dismantling enormous terror infrastructure, weapons caches beyond comprehension.' Troops who left behind families, careers, and lives now cross into Lebanon to change the situation on the ground. Shoshan noted, 'Ultimately, civilians rely on us—this is our army. There's no other military, and they know they can depend on us.' Across the border, I saw soldiers deeply engaged and surprisingly upbeat. Their mission is difficult and high-risk, yet immensely rewarding. Many sent messages of appreciation to families who celebrated the recent holidays alone, awaiting their return. 'Our reservists are both the citizens calling for action and the soldiers executing it,' Shoshan said. 'They’re here, answering each call, leaving entire lives behind to do their part.' Shoshan, who grew up in the Gaza-adjacent Moshav Yated, has lost friends and comrades in battles over the past year. Among them was Col. Aliim Saad, deputy commander of Brigade 300, who died in an encounter with terrorists that infiltrated Israel from a village near Adamit on October 9, 2023, along with two members of his command team. 'We have unfinished business with Hezbollah,' Shoshan said. 'Today, we’ve taken back the village where that cell launched attacks last year. We’re uncovering weaponry stockpiles large enough to arm an entire battalion, stored just 500 meters from our border. Every street and home here was filled with equipment, ready for an attack on Israel. And this is just one of many positions Hezbollah prepared in its planned assault on the Galilee.' Driving through the village paths, soldiers march past houses, securing and neutralizing terror sites. The IDF, now operating with five brigades along Lebanon's border, aims to eliminate Hezbollah’s capabilities, enabling displaced residents in the north to return home only when the threat is eradicated. At a command post, soldiers unload large quantities of weapons and gear uncovered in homes and underground facilities nearby. In recent weeks, they discovered a vast underground complex meant for Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, complete with bunk beds, supplies, weapons, and launch sites abandoned during their retreat. 'Look at what we’ve found in just the past two hours,' Shoshan said, pointing to piles of combat vests packed with grenades and magazines, each labeled with a fighter’s name. 'Even in our own reserves, we don’t have vests this fully equipped,' he admitted. Next to the vests lay stacks of kneepads, uniforms, winter gear, tactical helmets, and advanced night vision devices. They also found rocket launchers, shells, anti-tank missiles, machine guns, explosives, and countless rounds of ammunition, some clearly marked as coming from Moscow, Russia. 'In these fortified combat zones Hezbollah built—some just 50 meters from our border—we found fighting trenches and mines ready to be deployed,' Shoshan added. 'Hezbollah operatives could have approached the border in civilian clothing, armed and ready within minutes.' 'I never expected this scale in a small Sunni village,' he said. In some houses, troops were laying explosives for detonation as I crossed back over the border, seeing a massive gray cloud appear in the distance. 'To the people of northern Israel, this is how we’re dismantling Hezbollah’s offensive network,' he stated. In the sky to our south, within Israeli territory, interceptor trails lit up as they countered another rocket barrage from deep inside Lebanon, severely injuring a Nahariya resident. More than 100 rockets had been launched just before the holiday. As I looked up in frustration, Shoshan explained, 'We're not here to occupy all of Lebanon. Our mission is to dismantle enemy infrastructure and remove any threat near the border. The IDF has nearly completed this task.' According to him, 'Thousands of Hezbollah fighters and leaders have been neutralized, and their long-range launch capabilities are diminished, but that alone won’t stop the fire from Lebanon. It will require a binding agreement to make clear the consequences of non-compliance. If that fails, the IDF will respond forcefully. We can no longer rely on external enforcement, as we did after 2006. We’ll take full responsibility this time.' Just before heading home, I met Maj. A, deputy commander of 420th Battalion and resident of Kiryat Shmona. A month ago, at the start of this ground maneuver in Lebanon, I interviewed him near his hometown. 'The people here aren’t interested in strategy or tactics; they just want the Hezbollah threat gone—an objective only achieved by pushing in and clearing out,' he had told me then. Now, with a look of relief, he’s beginning to envision a future where he can persuade his wife and six children to return home after the war. 'It’s unbelievable to think that we lived here on a powder keg,' he said. 'We thought we were in the safest place, but our home was actually one of the most dangerous in the world. Hezbollah made a grave miscalculation by joining Hamas's attack, pushing the army to intervene. Without this response, we would’ve faced another failed model like Resolution 1701, risking a future surprise attack. Compared to what they had prepared for us here, Hamas was a mere warm-up.'

Macron’s Dirty Game: The price of silence on Hezbollah	A report by journalist Georges Malbrunot claims that Rodolphe Saadé, owner of BFM TV and CMA-CGM, secured a billion-dollar contract to rebuild the Beirut port market after the 2020 blast in exchange for Macron's silence on Hezbollah’s weapons, avoiding French taxes France’s recent hostility towards the Jewish state may be motivated by an additional layer of corruption, a respected French journalist has revealed. Renowned journalist at Le Figaro and Middle East expert, Georges Malbrunot, made waves after he brought attention to the secret deal allegedly made in 2020 between French President Emmanuel Macron and Hezbollah in Lebanon — reported both in his book and in Le Figaro. Malbrunot reported that the deal allegedly ensured Rodolphe Saadé, owner of BFM TV and the French maritime transport company CMA-CGM, received the contract to rebuild the market of the port of Beirut after the deadly Beirut Blast in 2020, in exchange for Macron’s silence when it comes to Hezbollah’s weapons. This was a deal worth billions of dollars and one that also allowed Saadé to avoid French taxes on much of the deal. In his book, Malbrunot quotes Hezbollah’s Mohammed Raad who met with Macron during his visit to Lebanon in 2020 in a then unprecedented meeting between a Western democratic state and a terrorist organization: 'Emmanuel Macron recognizes the existence of Hezbollah in the region and its importance, which is very important to us…' Malbrunot further quotes a Lebanese source close to Hezbollah who stated, 'The French had told us that Emmanuel Macron would not address the issue of our weapons…' Malbrunot notes that Saadé, who traveled to Lebanon with Macron during that same time period, also offered to send his private plane to Hezbollah backed Lebanese Minister of Transportation Ali Hamieh, to bring him to Marseille to close the contract. In the end, CMA-CGM did win the contract, and according to Mabrunot citing Lebanese sources this week, Hamieh was indeed sent Saadé’s plane following the completion of the lucrative business deal. If confirmed, which appears likely given Malbrunot’s sources, the secret pact demonstrates profound corruption at the highest levels in France and can explain France’s recent hostility towards Israel’s actions in Lebanon — including the condemnation of Israel’s operations in Gaza and Lebanon, the call for of an arms embargo of Israel, accusations that Israel is 'intentionally' targeting UNIFIL troops, and the exclusion of Israel from the recent Euronaval defense show conference in France. This week France also pledged to provide $100 million in aid to Lebanon after Prime Minister Netanyahu and French President Macron exchanged tense words regarding Israeli military actions in Lebanon, in which Macron accused Israel of 'sowing barbarism.' Macron’s increased hostility to Israel was also met with harsh condemnation from Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant who wrote on X, 'Macron's actions are a disgrace to the French nation and the values of the free world, which he claims to uphold…' In response to the publication of the discrete pact back in 2020, Macron had a public altercation with Malbrunot in which he harshly criticized the journalist calling his report 'irresponsible for France, irresponsible for those concerned here, and serious from an ethical point of view.' However several years later, it seems Malbrunot’s report proved accurate based on the evidence thus far. It appears that the French President has put the corporate profits of CGM-CMA above the security of Lebanon and Israel alike — and in doing so has legitimized the Iranian backed terror group Hezbollah, despite their hijacking of the Lebanese government and terrorist activities. As such, it shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone to see Macron making the kind of biased and unfounded accusations he has made in recent months against Israel.

War in the north through camera lens of a mental health officer	Guy Shmueli serves as a reserve mental health officer at an IDF base, and in his spare time, he pulls out his camera to document small moments that, through his talent, transform into moving and inspiring images; 'Photography is a form of therapy for me amid the ongoing tension of this period' he says The war has entered its second year, and Guy Shmueli, a reserve mental health officer serving at an IDF base in northern Israel, continues to capture moments of humanity and normalcy amid a complex and tense reality through his camera lens. 'Photography is a form of therapy for me during this ongoing tension, helping me find the 'human,' the 'warm,' and the beautiful, alongside the complex emotions,' Guy said. 'I hope my photos convey at least part of my experience.' What does a mental health officer do during such a sensitive time? 'The role of a mental health officer in wartime consists of two main parts: one involves systemic work with groups of commanders and soldiers, providing mental preparation talks, tools to identify emotional difficulties, and guidance on initial mental health assistance and debriefing after significant events. The second part focuses on individual work with soldiers experiencing emotional challenges who require support. Amid all this, I move around and take pictures as a way to maintain my mental health—capturing human moments within the routine of war.'

Iran’s imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate sentenced to another...	Free Narges Coalition says Narges Mohammadi was sentenced on Oct. 19 to an additional 6 months in prison on the charge of 'disobeying and resisting orders' Iranian authorities have issued an additional six-month prison sentence against Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, a group campaigning for the activist said. The Free Narges Coalition said in a statement on Thursday that Mohammadi was sentenced on Oct. 19 to an additional six months in prison on the charge of 'disobeying and resisting orders.' According to the statement, the charge was brought after Mohammadi staged a protest against the execution of another political prisoner in the women’s ward of Evin Prison on Aug.6. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003. Mohammadi, 52, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and years behind bars. She is being held at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison, which houses political prisoners and those with Western ties. She already had been serving a 30-month sentence, to which 15 more months were added in January. Iran’s government has not acknowledged her additional sentencing. The latest order reflects the Iranian theocracy’s anger that she was awarded the Nobel prize in October 2023 for years of activism despite a decades-long government campaign targeting her. Mohammadi was a leading light for nationwide, women-led protests sparked by the death last year of a 22-year-old woman in police custody that have grown into one of the most intense challenges to Iran’s theocratic government. That woman, Mahsa Amini, had been detained for allegedly not wearing her headscarf to the liking of authorities. The statement demanded Mohammadi’s unconditional release, saying her health situation has deteriorated drastically during her long incarceration and she is suffering from heart disease.

From observation balloons to air force bases, Iron Dome batteries to the ports of Ashdod, Haifa and Eilat—22-page indictment details surveillance photos taken by northern residents charged with espionage for Iran, documenting their activities nearly daily A 22-page indictment filed Friday charges seven northern Israeli residents with espionage for Iran, detailing an alleged year-long surveillance operation during which they reportedly photographed sensitive military and strategic sites across Israel. The seven suspects allegedly operated as a cell recruited by an Iranian agent, collecting information and taking photos of key military bases and infrastructure. These included air force bases, Iron Dome defense batteries, ports and major highways, among other sensitive sites, prosecutors said. The group’s suspected leader, Aziz Nisanov, 43, from Haifa, allegedly maintained contact with two Iranian handlers, recruiting additional members for the cell. His deputy, Alexander Sadikov, 58, also from Haifa, was reportedly responsible for coordinating assignments and distributing payments. Other defendants include Nisanov’s son, Yigal Nisan, 20; Vyacheslav Gushchin, 46, of Haifa; Yevgeny Yoffe, 47, from Nof HaGalil; and two minors aged 16 and 17.

IDF names 3 fallen soldier in northern Gaza Strip battles	The tank in which Captain Barak Israel Sagan, Sergeant Ido Ben Zvi, and Sergeant Hillel Ovadia were in was hit by a powerful explosive device, and another soldier was injured in the incident The IDF reported Friday that Captain Barak Israel Sagan, aged 22, from Petah Tikva, Sergeant Ido Ben Zvi, aged 21, from Shomrat, and Sergeant Hillel Ovadia, aged 22, from Jerusalem, all soldiers from the 196th Battalion's Tank Commanders Course, 460th Brigade, fell during combat in the northern Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the war, 765 IDF soldiers have been killed in battle. The incident occurred around 5 am when a Merkava Mark 4 tank was heavily damaged, likely by a powerful explosive device, and in the incident another soldier was injured. The force had been operating against a renewed Hamas stronghold in a refugee camp at the city’s center, previously maneuvered by the 98th Division months ago. The 460th Brigade is one of three brigades operating in Jabaliya for roughly a month amid renewed Hamas activity in the northern Gaza Strip city. Though most Jabaliya residents have ultimately evacuated the area, which is encircled by the IDF, several thousand Gazans remain, and the raid is expected to continue for several weeks, according to estimates. Since the operation began about a month ago, the IDF reports that around 45,000 Gazans have been evacuated from the encircled area in Jabalia. The data also shows that IDF forces have detained 300 terror suspects through checkpoints set up around Jabalia. In the past 24 hours alone, the IDF says it has killed about 50 militants, part of hundreds killed in the area over the last month. Earlier on Friday, the military also reported that five troops were killed in South Lebanon fighting when a building they were in was bombed. The soldiers are Major (Res.) Dan Maori, Captain (Res.) Alon Safrai, Warrant Officer (Res.) Omri Lotan, Warrant Officer (Res.) Guy Idan, and Master Sergeant (Res.) Tom Segal.

2 critically hurt dozens wounded in rocket fire to Galilee	IDF says a barrage of 30 rockets targeted the town of Majd al-Kurum, some were intercepted but others landed causing the critical injuries; an 80-year-old man was in serious condition, MDA says At least eight people were hurt, two critically in a rocket attack on Friday. The critically hurt men were in their 20s and an 80-year-old man was in serious condition after rockets hit the Galilee town of Majd al-Kurum. The military said Hezbollah fired a barrage of some 30 rockets at the Upper Galilee region. Some were intercepted but others landed causing injury and damage. Israel's emergency rescue services Magen David Adom (MDA) said the wounded were transported to area hospitals among them some also suffering from shock. Hezbollah targeted the Galilee since the early morning hours causing fires in the community of Shomera near the border with Lebanon. Since 4pm local 45 projectiles were launched against Israel from Lebanon the military said.

Senior Hamas official rejects reported partial deal for Gaza	Osama Hamdan says Israel attempts to work around basic demands to withdraw its troops and end the war Osama Hamdan a senior member of the Hamas terror group on Friday rejected a proposal for a 'small deal,' that would see the release of some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Families of hostages said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told them during his visit to Israel earlier in the week that he was trying to secure an initial deal to 'test the waters' and see who can now speak for Hamas after the killing of its leader Yahya Sinwar. Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the first big U.S. push for a Middle East ceasefire since Israel killed the leader of Hamas last week - and the last attempt before a presidential election that could upend U.S. policy. The two men met for 2.5 hours before the secretary met with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Speaking to the Hezbollah-affiliated al-Mayadeen network, Hamdan said Israel was trying to work around the Hamas terms for a deal that would include a withdrawal of troops and an end to the war. 'Israel wants to get some hostages in exchange for a few days of calm without committing to ending the war and pulling out its troops. Hamas rejects the proposals that do not meet our basic demands,' he said.

Russia helps Houthis attack Western vessels in Red Sea, report	Russian satellite data given to the rebels in Yemen by IRGC members, allows a broader area to be attacked and serves Putin's strategic aim to destabilize the Middle East by prolonging the war Russia provided targeting data for Yemen’s Houthi rebels to target ships in the Red Sea, the Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday, as Russian President Vladimir Putin strengthened his ties with Iran and worked to further destabilize the Middle East. The Houthi rebels who have been targeting maritime traffic since the outbreak of the war, claiming to support Hamas in Gaza, were given satellite data from Moscow that enabled them to increase their attacks in a broader area, the Journal reported citing two senior European security sources and another person in the know. One of the sources said the data was provided to the Houthis by members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who were embedded with the rebel group. According to the paper, the assistance to the Houthis demonstrated how far Putin was willing to go to undermine the West's political and economic order and to destabilize the Middle East and Asia. According to analysts, by prolonging the war in the region, Moscow was forcing Washington to allocate resources and concentrate its attention away from Russia and China. 'For Russia, any flare-up anywhere is good news, because it takes the world’s attention further away from Ukraine and the U.S. needs to commit resources—Patriot systems or artillery shells—and with the Middle East in play, it’s clear where the U.S. will choose,' said Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a think tank based in Berlin. Russia has increased its cooperation with Iran and North Korea and has involved them in the war in Ukraine. Both countries have supplied the Russians with ammunition, drones and missiles and North Korea also sent some 3,000 of its soldiers to train in Russia. According to U.S. and South Korean officials, the assistance is vital for the Russians who are suffering a shortage of manpower and weapons and contributes to Russia's strategic aims in the Middle East.

Spy ring provides photos, intel, on orders from Iran	Seven members of the group are charged with aiding and abetting the enemy in time of war and could face life in prison; among missions they carried out are photographing military bases and strategic civilian infrastructure Members of an Iranian spy ring were indicted on Friday on charges of aiding the enemy in time of war, carrying a penalty of life in prison. The seven, including a father and his two sons, photographed military and strategic installations on orders from Iranian intelligence handlers for two years, before being caught. According to court filings, the five adults and two minors photographed the air bases at Nevatim, Ramat David, Tel Nof and Palmachim, as well as other bases around the country including the Glilot complex north of Tel Aviv. They also photographed Iron Dome missile defense system batteries in the Haifa area, government buildings in Haifa, the ports of Haifa, Ashdod and Eilat, the Hadera power plant, and the IDF observation balloon in the Golani Junction area. The suspected leader of the group is Aziz Nisanov, 43 from Haifa who was in contact with two Iranian handlers and enlisted the other members of the spy ring. His deputy was Alexander Sadikov, 58 also from Haifa who ran the group's operation and handed out assignments to its members. One of the minors indicted is charged with carrying out most photographing missions and sending the images to the Iranian handlers. Other members of the group are Yigal Nisan, 20 Nisanov's son, Vyacheslav Guschin, 46 from Haifa and Yevgeni Ioffe, 47 from Nof Hagalil, and another minor. They are charged by Haifa prosecutors of carrying out missions for two years, for Iranian intelligence for the purpose of gathering intelligence for Iran on military installations and civilian infrastructure and surveillance of Israelis. They were instructed to photograph the Nevatim airbase one day after Iran's April attack on Israel. They were sent exact locations of sites, maps and aerial photographs and on some occasions were told the exact locations from which to take the pictures. One of the underage defendants was the locations that would be required for future missions, including the Golani training base's dining room which was hit in a deadly drone strike earlier this month and a defense industry site in the north. Nisanov was also asked to gather information on a lecturer at Haifa University who was a gas engineer and an expert on the Caucasus, including her schedule, her family, what car she drove and more. According to the indictment, one of the Iranian handlers asked Nisanov to attend and photograph the opening of the Azerbaijan embassy in Tel Aviv in March 2023 after he disclosed that his mother had been invited to attend. The event was closed and Nisanov's mother took pictures of the opening, which he then sent to his handler. In September, before the ring was arrested, Nisanov was asked to rent a yacht and sail to Cyprus to film the port there and the maritime rout from Cyprus to Haifa. After enquiring about the rental of a boat or alternatively training as a captain, Nisanov relayed the estimated cost to his handler, who then scrapped the plan. The indictment described another mission the group was given in September which was to photograph a soccer match and training sessions for adults and children at the soccer stadium in Beer Sheva. They were also asked to take pictures of the city's museum and the nearby community of Lahav, including its streets, its fences and areas around it. Nisanov informed his handlers that he had been invited as a musician to play in an event honoring the Bukhara community, that was to be attended by President Issac Herzog and members of the government. He provided the list of attendees and a description of who they are and was asked to photograph them but was arrested before the event.

Iran prepares for war with Israel if strike significant, report	Khamenei instructs the military to prepare optional retaliation plans if IDF inflicts significant damage, including the launch of 1,000 ballistic missiles, disruption to the world's energy supplies in maritime traffic in Persian Gulf and Straits of Hormuz Iran was preparing for war with Israel, the New York Times reported overnight, claiming Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei gave the order to prepare to respond to any Israeli attack, proportionately. The report also claimed that if the Israeli attack on Iran is relatively contained, Tehran may not launch a counterattack. The Times said Khamenei instructed the military to prepare different plans to respond to an Israel strike on Iran. Four officials in the Islamic Republic told the paper that if an Israeli attack would cause substantial damage, Iran would respond but if the attack is limited to military installations and weapons stores, there may be no Iranian retaliation. The sources, two of them identified as members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that an Israeli strike that would cause substantial damage could be responded to by a barrage of up to 1,000 ballistic missiles; escalated attacks by Iranian proxies in the region; and disrupting the flow of global energy supplies and maritime traffic through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Officials in Israel denied reports in the London Times claiming an attack on Iran was postponed because of classified documents leaked from the Pentagon, outlining Israeli preparations for the strike. Intelligence sources told the Times that the leak required Israel to change parts of the attack plans. Israel planned a strike on IRGC and military installations and promised the Biden administration that it would not target Iran's nuclear program or its oil industry. Michael Allen, a partner at Beacon Global Strategies, a security advisory firm, and former National Security Council official in the George W. Bush administration told the Washington Post that Israel may choose to target military sites rather than oil installations because it may hamper future Iranian strikes. 'They’re not going to waste a bullet,' Allen said. 'I think it’s going to be very purposeful targeting.' He said adding that targeting Iran’s launch sites would be 'the most logical option for Israel if it wants to degrade Iran’s abilities to strike back.' The post said Iran has a handful of launch sites, including the Tabriz, Bakhtaran and Imam missile bases in the west and Bandar Abbas in the south, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a Washington think tank. The launch sites in western Iran are key, as they are closer to Israel.

Hostages are important bargaining chips,' Sinwar writes	The documents published in East Jerusalem paper refer to scriptures from the Quran on how hostages are to be treated; Al Quds does not detail where they were found, or how the publication received them but claims they are in Yahya Sinwar's handwriting The Palestinian al Quds newspaper published in east Jerusalem revealed documents it described as instructions left by slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar written by his own hand in which he refers to the hostages abducted by Hamas, describes them and how they are to be treated. The paper published three such documents written over a year ago, before the only hostage release, last November. They include instructions to protect the hostages, details about them and the names of 11 women that have since been released. The first documents include scriptures from the Quran referring to how hostages are to be treated. 'They must be protected, they are an important bargaining chip,' he wrote. The second document lists hostages by gender and age and whether they are soldiers or civilians. It lists five men over the age of 60, ten men under 60, three soldiers, three women under 40 marked X, presumably dead, and four women over 40. 25 in total, 22 of them alive. According to the document, 25 hostages were being held in central Gaza including six soldiers, 12 reservists, the oldest being 53, and seven young people aged 21 to 27. In Rafah, two men over the age of 60, were held along with four Bedouins, one aged 55 and the others 18-22. In the Gaza City district – six soldiers, male and female and three reservists were held along with four young people and and a 66-year-old Bedouin. In total the document lists 71 hostages. The third document includes a list of female hostages, most elderly and all eventually released including their ages and if they had non-Israeli nationalities. Al Quds did not report where the documents were found or how they were received by the paper.

Hezbollah converted villages in southern Lebanon to command cente...	IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari says Hezbollah built underground command centers for the Radwan unit, with entrances intentionally placed beneath residential buildings The IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed Thursday that Hezbollah's Radwan Force turned civilian villages in southern Lebanon into fortified combat zones and military staging areas concealed beneath dense vegetation. 'For years, Hezbollah has been planning how it would launch an incursion into our territory on command, and now we are exposing their strategy,' said Hagari. 'For the past month, our forces have been operating in villages and areas near the border to push Hezbollah away from the front line,' he said. 'The terror group has built a system of underground combat facilities beneath thick vegetation, where they store various weapons.' Hagari explained that in these areas, Hezbollah has 'hidden' underground command centers for the Radwan unit, with entrances intentionally placed beneath residential buildings as part of their preparation for an attack. 'Over the past year, the Northern Command has carried out a series of strikes and special operations targeting these infrastructures in southern Lebanon to weaken Hezbollah's capabilities and eliminate the threat to northern residents,' he said. Hagari presented two examples to illustrate what Israeli forces have encountered, showing how Hezbollah has prepared the area in the Lavona region of southern Lebanon as a forward base for potential incursions. 'Hezbollah has constructed a network of underground combat facilities beneath dense vegetation. Our forces have operated in the area over the past month, clearing it of terrorist infrastructure, including the dense vegetation,' he noted. In adjacent areas, he mentioned, living quarters with beds and combat equipment were found concealed in dense foliage near the border. Another example highlighted was the IDF's activity in the rural areas of southern Lebanon, where villages have long become Hezbollah strongholds. 'In the village of Mhaibib in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah hid an underground command center for the Radwan unit. The entrances to the command center were deliberately located beneath residential homes. Along hundreds of meters of underground pathways, we discovered long-term living quarters that included bedrooms, kitchens, food supplies, showers, scooters, and a large cache of weapons—all part of their preparation for an attack.' He noted that the forces confiscated and destroyed the weapons found on-site and neutralized the 'main route' of the local tunnel network. 'Hezbollah has built all this over the years and invested substantial resources, and now we are denying them that capability,' Hagari said. 'The underground infrastructures I presented here do not cross into Israeli territory. These are underground staging areas that Hezbollah has built beyond the border as part of their strategy to launch incursions into Israel. So far, we have identified only one tunnel that crossed just a few meters into our territory—and we destroyed it.' He added, 'In the past month alone, we have attacked more than 3,200 targets in southern Lebanon, including around 350 weapons depots.'

Sapir feared suffocation; Staff Sergeant D. found bodies: People ...	Sapir Cohen, freed from Hamas captivity, describes a life devoid of light, plagued by moisture and mold; Staff Sergeant D. shares experiences of engaging terrorists in the tunnels; Prof. Kobi Michael warns that other enemies are focusing on underground warfare; Brigadier General (Res.) Ido Mizrahi evaluates both failures and successes regarding tunnel operations, while Prof. Silvana Fennig examines the long-term psychological effects of this underground existence For two decades the combination of the words 'Hamas Tunnels' has been considered a nightmare for Israelis. Such a tunnel exploded underneath the JVT outpost at the Philadelphi corridor in 2004, killing five soldiers. Such tunnels were used for the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit and the bodies of Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul. At Operation Protective Edge in 2014 Nukhba terrorists infiltrated Israel via such underground tunnel dug from Gaza into Israel, and they were recorded killing Israeli soldiers. On the morning of October 7, 2023, when hundreds of Israeli abductees were being dragged or marched into the Gaza Strip, all Israelis cringed at the thought that within minutes they would be led tens of feet underground. A year has passed, and the horror has not faded. In some respects, and certainly after presenting videos of the dark tunnel where Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat, and Alex Lobanov were murdered at the end of August, the fear has intensified. And yet, since the onset of the ground maneuver about 11 months ago, we know much more about the massive underground network that Palestinian terrorist organizations have dug under the Gaza Strip over the years. This was made possible due to the countless hours of IDF soldiers operating inside it, but tragically more so, thanks to firsthand stories of hostages who have returned, helping to shed light on the life, if you can call it that, inside the tunnels. Here are monologues by five people who summarize what Israel knows about the most significant strategic asset held by the Gazan enemy. I said to the terrorists: Maybe it's better to be down in the tunnel / Sapir Cohen After a long walk, during which I stepped with my bare feet on nails and other unfamiliar objects, I was brought to a place that looked like a shelter, with concrete and thick walls, and I was ordered to enter the elevator. The 'elevator' was a concrete block that somehow moved vertically. I didn't know I was in a tunnel because I entered straight into a space with porcelain paving, but I quickly learned that there are 'tunnels' and there are 'passages between the tunnels', through which one can cross from one space to another. A 'passage' is, for example, the narrow tunnel where the bodies of the six murdered hostages were found at the end of August. These are the narrow, low, and arched passageways that Israelis know from the pictures. After spending a few days in an underground tunnel, I climbed up using a ladder, and I was moved through the passages to houses located above the ground. All the houses I was held in were connected by tunnels. When I stayed in the houses I would hear terrible bombings and thought it would be better to be down, inside the tunnel; but when I told this to the terrorists, their answer was: 'No. If there is a bombing you will suffocate down there.' Still, after a short while, I returned to the underground tunnel. Inside the tunnel, there is no light at all. Sometimes a terrorist would turn on a flashlight, but still, I could see nothing. There is no air either. One of the terrorists had an oxygen cylinder; there was this time when I had trouble breathing so he let me use it. However, when in the tunnel no one can hear you, so you can speak loudly, unless it annoys the terrorist. There were some tunnels with electrical infrastructure, which sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. The senior terrorist who was guarding my group had some knowledge of electricity, so now and then he would fix it. Sometimes there were batteries available, and I also saw generators there, but it didn't help us. The tunnels are damp, and you constantly have to wipe the water that drips from the ceiling onto the walls and floor. The five thin mattresses we slept on were also soaked. The humidity caused mold, and the smell was so terrible that it was impossible to fall asleep. When I went from the houses back to the tunnel I took a Q-tip I found there, and a day later it turned green. People developed skin diseases, and wounds started appearing on their bodies. They scratched because there were lice and fleas, and you couldn't shower. We looked pale, with dark circles under the eyes. In the tunnel, there is nothing to do besides talking to the other hostages. Also, there is no sense of time. At first, I had no idea when it was morning or night because everything looked the same. But the terrorists prayed five times a day, so I was able to tell, roughly, what part of the day it was. The main food you get is pita bread. When there were no pitas, we would eat nothing. Since every tunnel with hostages is located adjacent to a house, one of the terrorists would climb the ladder, take food, and bring it down. There was this time when the house near us was bombed and the children there were seriously injured by shrapnel, so whoever lived there did not allow providing us with any food at all. There was a small refrigerator in the tunnel, but of course, it didn't work. There was also a tap with salted water, and it didn't always work either; so, if the terrorists didn't provide us water - we wouldn't drink. We tried to save food, but the pita would get dry and moldy after a day. Our tunnel had a gas unit, and when it had gas in it, we would heat the pita so it would be easier to bite. We would try to find ways to take food without the terrorists noticing, to hide it and remove the mold from it. The terrorists held daily 'meetings', they would go into a nearby room, so we managed to take pitas and hide them. Still, there were days when there was no light, no electricity, no gas, no water, and no food. We were lucky to have toilets in our tunnel, which was unusual because other groups of hostages didn't have any at all, or they had ones that wouldn't flush. I know that this was the case in the tunnel where they held the elders. There was no medical treatment either. There was a hostage with me whose leg was injured and swollen, and he was limping. There was nothing we could do about it. The tunnels in Gaza are so ramified that even terrorists had trouble finding their way around. You need to have someone who knows it well and can tell where to go and which turn to take. I heard from other hostages that they had to walk underground for hours because the terrorists who held them didn't know how and where to go. Each group of hostages had several terrorists who served as guards. Some terrorists carried their weapons in public and some hid their weapons. Now and then we would hear a weapon being cocked, which is petrifying. We were mostly afraid that Israeli soldiers would try to rescue us because we knew that in this case, the terrorists would shoot at us. All this time I knew I was underground in Gaza and was surrounded by terrorists, but I didn't internalize it. For a certain period, I lived in another world, disconnected, as if something happened to my body. But things change. I met hostages who didn't know what happened to their families, or those whose family members were murdered in front of their eyes, and I felt the need to put my problems aside and help them. I said to myself that no matter what, I would do everything in my power to help, bring them food, and talk to them. That's what kept me going. This has become my life's mission. Sapir Cohen, 30,was abducted on October 7 from her partner's house, Alex (Sasha) Trufanov, in Kibbutz Nir Oz. She was released with his mother Yelena and his grandmother Irena Tati in the final swap deal after spending 55 days in captivity. Her partner Trufanov is still in captivity. Other armies are already learning from us / Prof. Kobi Michael In the Iron Swords War, the IDF was exposed to a different reality in Gaza from the one it once knew, or thought it knew, because IDF's last maneuver in the field occurred a decade earlier, in Operation 'Protective Edge'. They knew that Gaza was networked with tunnels, but never imagined they would discover tunnels in such dimensions in terms of their scope, depth, system, and sophistication, including the connecting points between the various tunnels. They did not know that the underground network allowed Hamas terrorists to enter the tunnel in the Philadelphi corridor and end up above the ground in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. They did not realize that hostages could stay inside for a long period and did not know that they were connected to civilian infrastructures such as hospitals. The professional building of the tunnel network indicates that they used external help and expertise. The IDF needed quite a long learning time to deal with the tunnels that were gradually unfolding, since entering the tunnels is complex to begin with – usually via hidden, narrow, and sometimes very deep shafts. But over time they managed to deal with it, and could also tell the difference between tactical tunnels that were used for combat and attacks, and strategic tunnels that included equipped and advanced command and control rooms, which supported the tactical tunnels and were essential for Hamas activity. The next challenge the IDF had to face was how to destroy the tunnels. After various strategies were examined, such as flooding, which was proved unsuccessful, other methods were developed, apart from the use of explosives. The IDF continues to this day to uncover the underground infrastructure, but it is complex due to the enormous number of tunnels and their ramified structure. Moreover, the tunnels must first be discovered. The tunnel in Rafah where the bodies of the six hostages were found at the end of August, was unfolded almost by accident since its shaft was hidden inside a children's room in a residential building. Imagine how many more shafts are out there, especially in densely populated or ruined areas. However, the IDF has already learned about the close connection between the civilian infrastructure, the population, and the tunnels. Not only do they know that Gaza citizens participate in the digging, but they know also about the critical importance that Hamas attaches to the symbiosis between life above and below the ground: there may be a shaft in every school and a tunnel under every hospital. The connection between the upper construction and the lower construction adds to the complexity. As a result, the IDF has developed a new theory for underground warfare. There is no other army in the world that faces such a threat at such a level. And apparently, this is not over yet. Until the IDF leaves the Gaza Strip - if they ever will - they will continue to learn, improve, and develop capabilities and new fighting methods. Other armies worldwide are already learning from the IDF. The bad news is that Hamas tunnels are not an unusual phenomenon among our enemies. We discovered the giant tunnels penetrating from Lebanon already in 2018, and only recently, underground routes - albeit short ones - were located in Tulkarm and Jenin as well. This will have consequences on the IDF's forces, which will require more engineering forces, expanding units such as the Yahalom (Special Operations Engineering Unit), and investing in the development of combat measures and methods. Prof. Kobi Michael is a senior researcher at INSS and Misgav Institute I crawled between the crumbling walls / Staff Sergeant D. During the war I did everything in the tunnels - I scanned, destroyed, ran into combats, and even rescued bodies of hostages. On the one hand, fighting underground involves a greater risk, because if something happens you are in trouble: it is complex to get assistance from the outside, and the only ones who can help you are your comrades who are with you. On the other hand, it is a relatively quiet place, and if we reach it, it means that the odds of encountering the enemy there are not high. It wasn't discussed much in Israel, but some fighting in the tunnels of the Gaza Strip took place already a decade ago, in Operation 'Protective Edge'. Based on this experience, among other things, we trained for underground activity long before the 'Iron Swords' war began. Did we know what we were getting ourselves into? We didn't expect everything we saw there this time, but the truth is, there was nothing we encountered that we couldn't handle. Before entering the tunnels, there is excitement among the soldiers. I cannot define it as 'fear', but we feel we were trained for a unique mission and know that we are ready for it despite the dangers involved. Besides, we had time to prepare ourselves mentally, because, in the beginning, we were mostly busy destroying the tunnels that were found. It took a while until we engaged in rescuing and encountering terrorists. Before we enter the tunnels there is a preparation phase. We use technologies and intelligence to understand what is happening down there. Sometimes we know in advance where the rooms of senior officials are located. But still, we enter with caution. The danger is always there. You can always miss a booby trap or confront an ambush at any given moment. I can't remember how many tunnels I entered, but there were lots of them. The sense of danger hovers above you all the time. You feel the sand falling on you, and you see that the walls are shaking. Most tunnels are about 27 inches wide and 5.6 feet high. I have also seen lower ones or ones that are crumbling. Sometimes I would find myself crawling between half-ruined walls that had collapsed inward. On the other hand, there are also large tunnels with rooms, showers, and running water. Once we were surprised to discover a tunnel that had nice toilets, air conditioning, and lots of water. They didn't build it for a week's stay but planned it for years ahead. In the other tunnels the oxygen level is reasonable, and we were able to breathe during the activity, but it is impossible to stay there for a long time. They have mold, gases, and dust. We monitor the air quality when we are inside, and if the oxygen level is too low - we plan. In most tunnels, we don't expect to find hostages alive. We focus on scanning and task completion. But as mentioned, there were cases when we entered and found bodies. Some were in such bad shape that we didn't recognize they were corpses. Once, at a depth of 82 feet, we found corpses in an advanced state of decay inside white sacks. The sight of it doesn’t leave you, especially when it's the first time you have to handle it, but today we are trained. The only difference is the fighting inside a tunnel as compared to fighting outdoors, where you can see at a distance what's ahead of you and sometimes take cover. In the tunnel everything is limited. The terrorists can suddenly surface and strike. Therefore, the fighters who stand first in line know that they are at the greatest risk. If something happens - they get hit first. We mainly engaged in destroying tunnels, one tunnel after the other, either by using explosives that we placed manually, or by airstrikes. But beforehand we do everything in our power to make sure there are no hostages inside; this can take days and thus delay the operation, but there is no other choice. The fear that there might be Israelis inside never leaves you. We still ask ourselves if our operations destroy the tunnels completely or if Hamas can come after we're done, clear some rubble, and reuse them. As far as I can judge, considering my activity since the beginning of the war, we neutralize them completely. Whoever wishes to reuse these tunnels will have to dig and rebuild them. Yes, we discovered an elaborate underground tunnel network in the Gaza Strip, certainly more complex than we expected, but I think we can destroy it all. It's only a matter of time. Staff Sergeant D. is a fighter in an elite unit. Like running up a descending escalator / Brigadier General (res.) Ido Mizrahi Hamas is a sub-state terrorist organization that uses the underground to store its military and other assets. This is their only way to offset the absolute advantages of Israel and the IDF. As much as Israel enhanced its capabilities in technology and the air force - Hamas deepened its capabilities underground and expanded the 'underground infrastructure'. I use this term because it is important to clarify: These are not just tunnels. Many of the important assets and means of Hamas – military headquarters, production workshops, and storehouses - are underground. Handling this subterranean complex requires a continuous learning effort. It is equivalent to running up a descending escalator: you can't stand still. As you level up, the enemy also makes its next move - deeper and more hidden. In the Iron Swords war, we learned how wide and deep this underground network of Hamas is really like. At this stage we have very good control in the field - one should never say 'absolute' - and we use it for learning. This is one of the most beautiful processes I've seen until I finished serving as Commander of the military's Combat Engineering Corp in January 2024; since then I have continued watching it from the outside: a military unit encounters a certain challenge, deals with it, learns lessons from it, the knowledge is passed on to the neighboring units, then to the entire military and civilian system, and then relevant solutions are offered to handle the problem. Sometimes it involves the top of technology and sometimes it uses medieval low-tech. Since the main characteristic of the underground network in Gaza is concealment, it is very difficult to know what is under our feet; therefore, a great effort is invested in gathering intelligence, and technology and in locating and mapping the tunnels, long before the neutralization stage occurs. To neutralize the tunnels, we tried almost every possible solution, be it technological or other, and every idea that came up was granted legal approval by international law. One of the solutions, which was also published in the media, was the 'Atlantis' project, in which we channeled seawater into the tunnels. But the ground in the strip is too sandy and a large part of the water seeped through it. To make it work, you needed a substance that could move and not be absorbed. I will not go into details about how long we tried it and to what extent it eventually helped us. Fighting underground requires unique training. It is not suitable for every soldier. As in many fields in the IDF, here too there is a wide range of skills. That is: some units have undergone a few weeks of basic training in underground warfare, and there are units such as Yahalom (Special Operations Engineering Unit), whose soldiers train for months for tunnel warfare. The training is carried out in special training facilities that simulate an underground infrastructure. In the field, one of the most significant challenges in underground warfare is that once you send a force into the tunnel, it is very difficult to communicate and know what's happening. Fortunately, we are the army of the 'Startup Nation', and after presenting this problem to the defense industry, they came up with a solution, in an impressively short time. This is not a case of 'fire and forget'. Still, this is a very risky fighting, compared to a classic ground operation, but everyone who enters the tunnel is provided with communication devices that enable them to portray a situational picture and also keep the troops safe. We are still using all the knowledge we have accumulated until October 7, 2023, but there have been developments and changes in tactics since then. Every team that has operated underground since then has learned lessons of do's and don'ts. Some of them are tactical, and some are at a higher level, which requires building a new capability, a new technology, to gather new intelligence on a scenario we haven't encountered before. Learning lessons during a war is not obvious. The IDF does it impressively. Brigadier General (res.) Ido Mizrahi is the former Commander of IDF Combat Engineering Corp. No one can tell if the damages caused by the tunnels are reversible / Prof. Silvana Fennig. Many of the returned hostages that were treated by us spent most of their captivity time in houses of families, and they went underground only when bombings were taking place. The time spent in the tunnels must have been terrible for them, partly due to a lack of stimuli and light. The sense of claustrophobia and the lack of air make it difficult not only physically but mainly psychologically. The long-term damages are also mainly mental. Despite the deficiencies and the weight loss, the children did not experience anything physical that might be irreversible, however, the psychological damage is not always reversible. I cannot tell what the future holds for them, but generally speaking, children who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder might experience anxiety and depression even years later. The terrible fear of death may affect one's personality fundamentally. They suffer a complex trauma because they were taken to captivity after experiencing a previous trauma. They were hiding for hours in terrible fear, and after they were pulled out of their hiding place they witnessed murder and horrible sights; with these images in mind, they were taken to Gaza. Everything adds up. Their coping depends on how they spend their time in captivity. If they were with a family there, then the situation is completely different than being alone. The children who were there with their parents experienced a certain sense of security, and this is also true for the adults who went through it along with someone close. This is very helpful for survival; we know it for a fact from both research on the Holocaust and the experience of Yom Kippur War captive soldiers. When the hostages returned, after the celebration and all the excitement around them, they returned to a shattered community, as evacuees, without a home. The gap between the collective joy of millions of Israelis and their individual story is not simple. They continue their life routine while they are no longer in the news headlines, and they are no longer the heroes. We took this into account when we decided to reduce stimuli - including limiting the number of visitors, even the happy ones - because transitions are not easy. We usually operate by evidence-based study rules and techniques with worldwide supporting scientific evidence, but there are no guidelines available for treating children who returned from captivity during a war because it is extremely rare. We knew that we would have to 'learn on the go'. Professionals base their treatment on past studies and professional literature, and here we had nothing to base our work on. In total we received 26 people, 19 of them were children. We built an inpatient care ward for both young and adults, away from the media, to reduce damage. It was a quiet, sterile, and remote area, with as little stimulation and noise as possible. We had to act at their pace, follow them step by step, respect their routines and rituals, and hear and listen, without pre-built formulas. Beyond the obvious physical medical needs, it was important, psychologically speaking, that they return to a place that can provide professional help. But we knew that our help was only temporary. We were debating whether it was right to bring them back home directly from captivity. Unfortunately, most of them didn't have a home to return to, anyway. They were evacuated from their homes.

Smotrich and Ben Gvir criticize Netanyahu over Qatar delegation: ...	Smotrich says Qatar is an enemy state that supports Hamas and backs its positions in negotiations; Ben-Gvir adds Israel must not give Hamas any breathing space, particularly after the elimination of Sinwar Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir voiced Thursday opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's directive to send Mossad head David Barnea to Qatar to advance a possible hostage deal. 'The continued involvement of Qatar in negotiations for the release of hostages is a serious mistake,' Smotrich said. Ben Gvir, who also opposed the previous deal that saw the release of 80 Israeli women and children from captivity, added: 'The dispatch of the negotiation team was not done with the consent of all Cabinet members, and therefore I oppose it. 'I deeply regret the prime minister’s decision to approve the Mossad chief's trip for negotiations with Qatar, ' Smotrich continued. 'Qatar is an enemy state that supports Hamas and backs its positions in negotiations. Its goal is to prevent us from destroying Hamas. Qatar owns Al Jazeera, which severely damages Israel's global image and undermines our existential fight. Nothing good can come from its involvement, and we should reject it outright. The only way to bring the hostages home is through Hamas' surrender, achieved by continuing the military pressure our heroic soldiers are currently applying in northern Gaza.' 'At this critical point in Israel's confrontation with Hamas, particularly after the elimination of Sinwar, we must not give Hamas any breathing space,' Ben-Gvir added. 'We should continue working toward its defeat. That is the surest and safest way to achieve victory and bring the hostages home, not through deals that will allow Hamas to regroup, rebuild its military capabilities, and harm our soldiers again.' He concluded by praising Netanyahu, the IDF, and Israel's security forces for their positive trend over the past two months. 'Israel is acting aggressively and engaging the enemy on multiple fronts, and I urge them to continue this path until total victory.'

IDF eliminates Hamas terrorist, employee of UNRWA involved in Oct...	IDF says Mohammad Abu Itiwi and the terrorists under his command threw grenades into the shelter where partygoers from the Nova music festival were hiding; also directed multiple terror operations against IDF forces operating in Gaza The IDF reported Thursday that the Israeli Air Force, in cooperation with the Shin Bet, eliminated Mohammad Abu Itiwi, a Hamas commander who led the massacre at the Re’im shelter and was also an employee of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. On the day of the October 7 massacre, Abu Itiwi and the terrorists under his command threw grenades into the shelter where partygoers from the Nova music festival were hiding. In one of the most memorable moments from that day, Nahal Brigade soldier Aner Shapira was seen in footage deflecting seven grenades with his hands. The eighth grenade exploded before he could throw it back. Of the 27 people inside the shelter, 16 were murdered, four were kidnapped, and only seven survived. One of those kidnapped, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was later murdered in a tunnel in Rafah. In a statement delivered Thursday, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said, 'We will continue to pursue and reach all those involved in this brutal massacre. We must remember the 101 hostages still held in inhumane conditions in Gaza. We are committed to bringing them home.' A joint statement from the IDF and Shin Bet explained that Abu Itiwi, a commander in Hamas’s Nuhba unit in the Bureij Battalion of the Central Camps Brigade, was targeted and killed on Wednesday in an airstrike by the Israeli Air Force, coordinated with the Gaza Division's fire center. It was noted that Abu Itiwi, who had worked for UNRWA since July 2022, was involved in the murder and kidnapping of Israeli civilians on October 7. During the war, he also directed multiple terror operations against IDF forces operating in Gaza. Following this incident, representatives from the Israeli Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) demanded clarifications from senior international and UN officials regarding the involvement of UNRWA employees in the October 7 massacre and other terror activities against Israel.

IDF names 4 fallen soldiers in southern Lebanon battles	The incident occurred as the forces approached a Shiite village in the western sector of southern Lebanon and were attacked by terrorists who emerged from a tunnel shaft The IDF reported Thursday that Command Sergeant Major (res.) Mordechai Haim Amoyal, aged 42, from Lod, Sergeant Major (res.) Shmuel Harari, aged 35, from Safed, Master Sergeant (res.) Shlomo Aviad Nayman, aged 31, from Mitzpe Yeriho, and Sergeant First Class (res.) Shuvael Ben-Natan, aged 22, from Rehelim, fell during combat in southern Lebanon, all troops from the 222nd Battalion, 2nd 'Carmeli' Brigade. The incident occurred as the forces approached a Shiite village in the western sector of southern Lebanon, which the brigade was preparing to seize and clear of Hezbollah's Radwan force. Around 6:50 pm, a group of terrorists emerged from a concealed tunnel shaft and attacked the forces. In the incident, six soldiers were injured, three of them seriously. In addition, on Thursday a commander from the 75th Armored Battalion was critically injured in Lebanon by an anti-tank missile; a reservist from the 7155th Paratroopers Battalion was wounded during an encounter with terrorists; and a reservist from the 6226th Reconnaissance Battalion sustained shrapnel injuries in the north. All injured personnel were evacuated by air and ground to hospitals, and their families have been informed. Since the ground operation began on September 30, a total of 21 soldiers have fallen in Lebanon.

Possibility to achieve a decisive outcome in the north' IDF chie...	Halevi adds elimination of Sinwar was not planned, but it wasn't random either, its a result of a methodical approach and pressure on Rafah IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi held a situation assessment at the Jabaliya area in the Gaza Strip, stating that 'in the north, there's a possibility of achieving a decisive outcome. We have thoroughly dismantled Hezbollah’s senior command structure.' Halevi added 'The elimination of Sinwar was not planned, nor were the troops from the 450th Brigade or the tank commander course; they didn’t know who they were targeting. While it wasn’t planned, it was not random either.' 'This methodical approach results from the pressure on Rafah and the dismantling of the Rafah Brigade,' he continued. 'It reflects the regional command's insistence on deploying more troops during this holiday month, pushing forward, maintaining operational control, and confronting the problem directly. It’s a systematic effort, not a coincidence. Determination and persistence are key.' 'They are determined too, but we are much more so. We are better, more justified, and stronger. Another achievement is that Jabaliya is falling, marking a significant psychological blow—both physically and mentally. If we eliminate the Northern Gaza Brigade commander, it will be another significant collapse. I cannot predict what we will encounter tomorrow, but this pressure brings us closer to further achievements.' Meanwhile, U.S. and Israeli negotiators will gather in Doha in the coming days to try to restart talks toward a deal for a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza, officials said on Thursday. Mossad head David Barnea will travel to Doha on Sunday, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, adding that CIA director William Burns would be present for the talks.

Our troops are more reservists than civilians': A year inside Ga...	Photographer Ziv Koren spent the past year documenting the reservists of the 8119th Reserve Battalion, part of the 16th Infantry Brigade, who completed 180 days of duty in three rotations—each time leaving everything behind to defend their homeland 'On that black Saturday, everyone was looking for a way to contribute. But the real challenge is showing up for reserve duty during routine times—in the peak of summer heat or pouring rain, while balancing school deadlines, career, or when your kids are on summer break. The true heroism is being there all the time, and that’s our pride as a brigade—we were ready for the mission,' said Lt. Col. (Res.) Lotem Paran Farah, 45, commander of the 8119th Reserve Battalion, part of the 16th Infantry Brigade, whose soldiers completed 180 days of reserve duty in the past year across three rotations. The 16th Infantry Brigade, also known as the Jerusalem Brigade, was established during Israel’s War of Independence and has participated in every war since. It operates under the Southern Command’s Sinai Division and consists of four infantry battalions and one logistical support battalion. Over the years, its soldiers have fought in key battles, including the liberation of Jerusalem in the Six-Day War and the defensive battles against the Egyptian army along the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur War. On October 7, 2023, its soldiers were called up for a 75-day mission in Gaza. In February, they were summoned for another 45-day reserve stint, with their battalions deployed to the West Bank and the Golan Heights. In July, they embarked on a third deployment—60 days in Gaza. 'The Jerusalem Brigade has been part of many historic moments in Israel’s history,' said Col. Nir Ifergan, 39, who took command of the brigade in June. 'Now, we’re fortunate to be part of writing another chapter.' 'On October 7,' recalled Lt. Col. (Res.) Paran Farah, 'Soldiers arrived even before they were officially called with emergency orders. We faced equipment shortages and maintenance issues, but we knew we had to head south as quickly as possible with whatever we had. People were determined—they grabbed their weapons, helmets, and rushed to the mission.' One of those soldiers was Capt. (Res.) Michal Fadler, 27, a technology and maintenance officer in Battalion 8119. 'I had friends at the Nova festival, and a close friend was killed in the fighting in the south—it was a Saturday filled with fear,' Fadler said. 'But I couldn’t stay away. I knew I had a responsibility.' Fadler, a student from Tel Aviv, is currently hospitalized at Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva, undergoing rehabilitation after being moderately injured during the brigade’s third deployment in August. 'The Humvee in front of me hit a roadside bomb and exploded. I heard a massive blast, and at the same time, a terrorist squad appeared and started shooting at us,' she recounted. 'Leonid, the soldier with me, returned fire. Luckily, he wasn’t hit, but Maj. (res.) Yotam Itzhak Peled and Mordi and Sgt. Maj. (res.) Mordechai Yosef Ben Shoam were killed. Yotam was a beloved and admired commander, and Mordi was a skilled and humble fighter. Their families are a source of strength for us. I hope they never know more sorrow and that they take pride in their heroic sons.' Speaking about her injury, Capt. Fadler said, 'I was hit by shrapnel in the face. My mouth filled with blood, and I could barely speak. I radioed, ‘We’ve been hit, we’ve been ambushed, we’re injured.’ I arrived at Soroka conscious but in moderate condition. I underwent emergency surgery to remove the shrapnel. The injuries to my head affected my jaw, tongue, and neck. I was incredibly lucky that the nerves and spinal cord weren’t damaged. I understand firsthand the danger we’re facing. I’m still in the recovery process, but it’s hard to be in the hospital while our forces are out there. I hope that once I’m rehabilitated, I can return to the brigade.' 'That’s the spirit of our brigade,' Lt. Col. (Res.) Paran Farah said. 'I personally knew and commanded four of the soldiers we’ve lost. They understood the mission and responsibility, even though the cost was difficult and painful. We’re at war, and we know no one else can do this for us. That sense of duty to their comrades and the country is what drives our people.' It isn’t easy to serve 180 days a year and leave your personal life behind at a moment’s notice. 'The balance is broken,' said the brigade’s commander, Col. Ifergan. 'Our soldiers are now more reservists than civilians, and they grapple with feeling like ‘invisible citizens.’ The personal sacrifices we make must always be recognized by Israeli society. But alongside the difficulties—and there are many—my wife and I believe in the message we’re passing on to our children, in the values they’re growing up with. Even at a young age, they understand the need.' Lt. Col. (Res.) Paran Farah added, 'My parents have been evacuated from Rosh HaNikra for a year. How will they ever go home if we don’t show up and carry out our tasks?' Brigade Commander Col. Ifergan emphasized: 'We currently have the upper hand in Gaza, but the war’s objectives have not yet been achieved—the return of all hostages and the dismantling of Hamas’s capabilities. The work isn’t finished.'

IDF unveils new evidence of Hamas-Al Jazeera collaboration	Documents detail instructions from Hamas to Al Jazeera, including prohibiting criticism of Hamas, hiding information about failed rocket launches, and setting up a secure communication line between the two sides After revealing the affiliation of six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza with Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the IDF on Thursday presented additional documents pointing to close collaboration between the terror organization and the Qatari news channel. The documents outline directives from Hamas to Al Jazeera, including barring criticism of Hamas, concealing failed rocket launches, and establishing a secure communication line between the two parties. One of the documents, from 2022, describes how Hamas gave Al Jazeera clear instructions on covering a failed Islamic Jihad rocket launch in Jabaliya that killed several Palestinians. Among the directives was a prohibition on using the word 'massacre' to describe the incident, along with advice to minimize the number of images shown and to prevent panelists from criticizing Hamas. 'We recommend you contact the Islamic Jihad leadership to understand the organization’s guidelines and highlight its efforts in manufacturing and developing capabilities,' Hamas wrote to the Qatari network. Another document from the same year reveals the instructions Hamas gave to journalist Tamer Almisshall regarding his coverage of the Islamic Jihad during Operation 'Breaking Dawn' on his program 'More Hidden than Revealed'. The instructions were to support the 'resistance' in Gaza and to prevent any criticism of the Islamic Jihad’s rocket capabilities, in light of the high number of failed launches. Additionally, a 2023 document shows Hamas decided to establish a 'Jazeera Phone'—a secure line for classified communication with the channel, particularly for emergencies. 'The documents reveal how Hamas directs Al Jazeera's media coverage to serve its own interests, preventing the public in Gaza and around the world from discovering the truth about its crimes against Gazan civilians,' an IDF statement said. Meanwhile, Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani was asked about the IDF’s allegations concerning Al Jazeera journalists’ involvement in terrorism. He responded, 'Al Jazeera must take action if there is any truth to Israel’s claims against its journalists.' At a press conference following his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, he added, 'These allegations should be treated with skepticism.' 'We are very proud of the Al Jazeera institution and its war coverage,' the Qatari prime minister continued. 'Al Jazeera operates according to the highest international standards of journalism. There is no justification for attacking journalists in conflict zones, and the excuses for doing so are unacceptable.' Blinken was also asked about the matter and said he could not verify the Israeli claims.

Antony Blinken says options to capitalize on this moment and the next steps to move the process forward were discussed; Qatari PM says Doha reached out to Hamas representatives U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that negotiators will meet in the coming days to work on reaching a truce in Gaza as he again urged Israel and Hamas to strike a deal. 'We talked about options to capitalize on this moment and next steps to move the process forward, and I anticipate that our negotiators will be getting together in the coming days,' Blinken told reporters after talks with key mediator Qatar. Blinken’s visit to Doha follows earlier talks with leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia. It marks his 11th visit to the region since the start of the war in Gaza after Hamas’s deadly October 7 attack last year. Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said American and Israeli teams would travel to Qatar, without providing a specific timeline. 'A negotiating team from the United States will visit Doha alongside the negotiating team from the Israeli side to discuss the means by which a breakthrough can be achieved,' he said. Asked if Qatar had communicated with Hamas following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the prime minister said: 'We re-engaged with them. There has been an engagement with the representatives from the political office in Doha.' 'We had some meetings with them in the last couple of days. I believe that until now, there is no clarity what will be the way forward.' Qatar, along with the U.S. and Egypt, has been leading mediation efforts between Israel and Palestinian terrorists, aiming to secure a Gaza truce and facilitate a hostage and prisoner exchange.

Macron rejects Netanyahu’s ‘civilization vs. barbarism’ framing i...	Speaking at international conference aimed at supporting Lebanon’s population, French president reiterates call for arms embargo on Israel, takes swipe at PM’s ‘war of civilizations’ narrative French President Emmanuel Macron took a swing at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, dismissing the Israeli leader's portrayal of the Israel-Hezbollah hostilities as a 'war between civilization and barbarism.' Responding to Netanyahu’s remarks in a French TV interview, Macron countered, 'I’ve heard recent talk of a ‘war of civilizations,’ but I believe there is a possibility for culture and civilization in the region.' Macron made the remark during an international conference in Paris to support Lebanon’s population and sovereignty amid ongoing hostilities. The French president reiterated his call for an immediate cease-fire and criticized Israel's continued operations in southern Lebanon and Beirut. He outlined four key goals for the conference: strengthening Lebanon’s sovereignty, providing humanitarian aid, reinforcing UN peacekeepers (UNIFIL) and supporting Lebanon's security forces. The conference saw participation from 54 countries, including EU members, Gulf states, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Japan and Australia. The U.S. was represented by deputy secretary of state after Secretary Antony Blinken and Special Envoy Amos Hochstein were unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts. Macron called for an end to hostilities, saying, 'The war must end quickly.' He condemned Hezbollah’s drone attack on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea and criticized Israel’s military operations in Lebanon, warning that a military offensive alone 'will not solve the problem.' Macron, who recently suggested an arms embargo on Israel, stressed the need to separate the Gaza war from hostilities in Lebanon. 'We must not export a war from another region to Lebanon,' Macron said. France pledged €100 million in aid to Lebanon, as part of the €426 million in needs assessed by the UN. Macron called for a return to UN Resolution 1701, which calls for the disarmament of militias in Lebanon and the deployment of Lebanese and UNIFIL troops along the Israel-Lebanon border, to restore peace and security. Macron expressed full support for UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, and condemned attacks on its personnel, saying, 'Nothing justifies the shelling of UNIFIL soldiers.' Regarding Lebanon’s military, Macron pledged France’s assistance in training and equipping 6,000 new soldiers at Lebanon’s request. He praised Lebanese security forces for their role in maintaining order and fighting ISIS, and called for political stability in Lebanon. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the international community to expand its support, stressing that a cease-fire is essential for stability and the rebuilding of the nation. He reaffirmed Lebanon’s commitment to implementing UN Resolution 1701 and supporting the U.S.-French proposal for a 21-day cease-fire.

Israeli forces uncover Hezbollah underground base in southern Leb...	Israeli paratrooper reservists from the 646th Brigade uncovered an underground Hezbollah facility in southern Lebanon, intended to be used by the terrorist group's elite Radwan Force in its plan to 'conquer the Galilee,' the IDF said Thursday. The site contained bunk beds, storage cabinets, food supplies and infrastructure for long-term stays, as well as a significant cache of equipment, weapons and rocket launch pads left behind by the terrorists. In recent days, Israeli forces also discovered four weapons depots, some located in civilian homes, the military added. Among the seized arms were AK-47 rifles, ammunition, rockets, mortars, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs and advanced anti-tank missiles.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1r11qnvxyl	2024-10-24T04:45:35-07:00

The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday published new details regarding sexual harassment allegations against International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, which he links to what he calls a 'smear campaign' against his efforts to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to the report, Khan’s aggressive push for these arrest warrants is seen as an attempt to divert attention from the accusations against him. The Journal has called for an investigation into the matter, citing troubling details. The report describes growing concerns within the Hague-based court over Khan's handling of the Israeli cases. The Journal claims that Khan's intense efforts to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders may serve to distract from internal allegations of harassment. It warns that before the ICC's judges consider issuing such warrants, an internal investigation into the prosecutor himself should be conducted.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bysagndxjl	2024-10-24T04:43:33-07:00	
Report: Warrants for Israeli leaders a smokescreen for ICC prosec...	Wall Street Journal report says Karim Khan, when confronted with sexual harassment allegations, initially said he'd 'have to resign' but instead allegedly threatened victim and witnesses; days later, he announced warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday published new details regarding sexual harassment allegations against International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, which he links to what he calls a 'smear campaign' against his efforts to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to the report, Khan’s aggressive push for these arrest warrants is seen as an attempt to divert attention from the accusations against him. The Journal has called for an investigation into the matter, citing troubling details. The report describes growing concerns within the Hague-based court over Khan's handling of the Israeli cases. The Journal claims that Khan's intense efforts to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders may serve to distract from internal allegations of harassment. It warns that before the ICC's judges consider issuing such warrants, an internal investigation into the prosecutor himself should be conducted. According to the article, Khan's focus on Netanyahu and Gallant, while excluding political rival Benny Gantz—who was also a member of Israel's wartime cabinet—raises suspicions of bias. The Journal suggests that anti-Israel bias may explain the prosecutor's actions. The investigation also reveals that Khan had promised Western leaders a thorough probe into the Israel-Gaza conflict. He reportedly assured a group of U.S. senators that he would not rush to judgment before hearing Israel’s side, even scheduling meetings in Israel for May 20. However, instead of visiting Israel, Khan appeared on CNN to announce his intent to pursue arrest warrants. The Journal attributes Khan's sudden shift to allegations of sexual harassment that surfaced weeks before his announcement. According to the report, the ICC remained silent on these claims for over five months, until an anonymous social media account brought them to light last week. The alleged victim, a junior staff member in Khan’s office, reported repeated harassment, including being locked in his office and subjected to inappropriate physical contact. A report submitted to the ICC’s independent oversight body, obtained by the newspaper, includes disturbing details of Khan’s behavior, such as entering the woman’s hotel room late at night and lying on her bed under the pretense of checking on her well-being. The report was filed by a colleague of the alleged victim, who worked directly under Khan. When confronted with the allegations, Khan reportedly appeared shocked and confused. According to a witness, the prosecutor expressed surprise and remarked that he would 'have to resign.' However, instead of stepping down, Khan and his wife allegedly began applying pressure on the whistleblower, including demanding that he leave for Uganda. The Journal also highlights that the ICC’s oversight mechanism acknowledged the reported incident in its annual report on October 18 but determined that no investigation was necessary, as the alleged victim had refused to pursue a formal complaint. The article questions this decision, suggesting that fear of retaliation may have prevented the victim from proceeding with the case. It calls for an investigation, arguing that if the allegations are proven true, they would cast serious doubt on Khan’s integrity and the ICC’s commitment to impartial justice. An unnamed Israeli official responded to the report, stating: 'The picture is becoming clearer. The entire issue of war crimes and the ICC’s decision to pursue arrest warrants against the prime minister and defense minister is an attempt to cover up sexual harassment accusations against Karim Khan. 'He misled U.S. senators when he said he would not act against Israel before visiting and hearing its side. He canceled his visit in May and rushed to announce his decision instead. By targeting Israel and its leaders, Khan is trying to gain favor with the global progressive left and shield himself from the accusations.' Khan has denied the harassment allegations, telling the Daily Mail last week, 'I absolutely can confirm there is no truth to suggestions of misconduct.'

Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran delayed due to Pentagon docum...	According to British daily The Times, leak forced Israel to revise plans and develop alternative strategy; 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take,' intelligence source says Israel’s planned retaliatory strike on Iran has been delayed due to the leak of classified Pentagon documents detailing the specifics of the operation, British daily The Times reported on Thursday, citing an intelligence source familiar with Israel’s preparations. The leak, initially shared on a pro-Iran Telegram channel and later on X (formerly Twitter), included details about Israel’s plans to use ballistic missiles against Iran, helping Tehran anticipate the attack patterns. The report indicates that the leak forced Israel to revise its plans and develop an alternative strategy. 'The leak of the American documents delayed the attack due to the need to change certain strategies and components,' the source said. 'There will be a retaliation, but it has taken longer than it was supposed to take.' Israel had been preparing to target Iranian Revolutionary Guard military installations but had assured the U.S. that its response would not involve Iran's nuclear or oil infrastructure. The planned strike would be a retaliation for Tehran’s October 1 attack, which saw over 180 ballistic missiles fired at Israel. The leaked documents, classified as 'top secret' and dated October 15 and 16, were verified by U.S. officials. They detail Israeli military preparations, including a large-scale air force deployment exercise and an aerial refueling drill. The documents also refer to Israeli handling of air-launched ballistic missiles, with at least 16 missiles, codenamed 'Golden Horizon,' and 40 others called 'ISO2' or 'Rocks,' being prepared for use, the latter a surface-to-air missile developed by Israeli defense contractor Rafael. According to Rafael’s website, the Rocks missile is designed to hit targets from long distances, traveling at supersonic speeds, and is capable of penetrating well-protected underground sites. The documents were compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) and detailed Israeli military movements, including missile exercises and air force maneuvers in preparation for a potential strike on Iran. The absence of accompanying satellite images in the leaked files has led to speculation about how the information was obtained and disseminated. The Pentagon has denied reports that Ariane Tabatabai, a U.S. Defense Department official of Iranian heritage, was behind the leak, as had been suggested in an earlier Sky News Arabia report. Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder confirmed that Tabatabai was not under investigation, while emphasizing that the department is fully cooperating with the inquiry into the classified documents. The leak has heightened tensions between Israel and the U.S., with former Israeli intelligence officials warning of the broader implications. 'The real harm is that it shows the U.S. is struggling to keep secrets,' a former Israeli official told CNN. As part of the ongoing investigation, U.S. authorities are examining who had access to the leaked documents, which were circulated on social media and picked up by major news outlets like CNN. The leak comes amid growing concerns about Iran’s activities in the region, including its support for Hezbollah and proxy militias in Iraq and Syria. Israel has been preparing for potential military action, particularly following reports earlier this year of a similar Israeli strike that allegedly destroyed an air defense radar near Isfahan after an Iranian attack in April.

The machine that saved Pablo's life on October 7	At 6 a.m., Rafi Litwak finished his shift at the Microgil quarry, leaving Pablo Dulitzky alone to take over; shortly after, sirens blared, and Pablo recalls seeing dozens of terrorists pouring into their kibbutz; his quick thinking saved his life Pablo Dulitzky had long planned where he would hide if terrorists ever attacked. Since a previous warning about an infiltration, he had a spot in mind, much like his colleague, Rafi Litwak. 'I planned to hide in the electrical closet,' Rafi, 38, from Be’er Sheva, shared. The two men work at Microgil, a quarry plant adjacent to Kibbutz Nir Oz. On the morning of the attack, Pablo, 61, the only worker at the plant that day, found himself hiding for hours. Rafi, who had just finished his shift, had left five minutes before the terrorists arrived. 'My shift started at 6 p.m. on Friday,' Rafi recalled from the control room, where security camera feeds monitor the plant. 'At 4 a.m., I felt tired and went up to the roof to get some air. It was a quiet night, peaceful and even a bit boring. Pablo arrived at 5 a.m., as usual, for coffee and a chat. We hugged, exchanged shifts and I said, 'See you tomorrow.' 'Then, just minutes later, I heard explosions and interceptors in the sky, like fireworks. Normally, I’d pull over and lie down, but this time there was an alarm in Be’er Sheva, so I decided to drive straight home to my wife and kids. That saved my life. Just minutes later, at the Meon Junction, terrorists killed a family driving there. By 7 a.m., I reached home, only to hear that terrorists had breached Nir Oz. I called Pablo, but he didn’t answer. I feared the worst.' 'When Rafi left,' Pablo described, 'I sat in the control room, preparing for the day. Suddenly, 'Boom-boom-boom,' and a Red Alert siren. I ran outside, and bullets rained down on me like it was pouring rain,' he said in his thick Argentine accent. 'I ran back to the control room and saw through the cameras that dozens of terrorists were entering Nir Oz. I called Yossi Vahav, the plant manager, and said, 'Yossi, there are terrorists in the kibbutz.' He thought I was joking. I sent him a video.' Moments later, Pablo watched in horror as four terrorists breached the plant's gate. 'One of them stole my motorcycle. I shut off all the machines to keep quiet and watched as they brutally killed people at the gate of Nir Oz. I saw my death right in front of me. But I didn’t feel fear. My adrenaline kicked in, and I was laser-focused. I just stared at the stone crusher machine.' Between iron chains and conveyor belts Lying between iron chains and conveyor belts that moved stones, Dulitzky listened as terrorists looted the plant and shouted 'Allahu Akbar,' knowing that stepping out would mean death. 'I climbed inside the machine, and for hours I saw the terrorists and heard everything, but they didn’t see me,' he recalled. 'They stole everything that wasn’t bolted down, even throwing a forklift against the gate. I knew I couldn’t leave.' As the attack unfolded, Dulitzky texted his daughter, an IDF officer, who was on her way to her base when the alarms sounded. Plant managers had contacted the military, and friends spoke to the police, all telling him to wait. Dulitzky, without food or water, took refuge inside the machine. Twice, when the terrorists weren’t nearby, he ventured out to grab two cucumbers and a small bottle of water, which he refilled from a toilet tank and drank sparingly. By 6 p.m., terrorists reentered the plant, looting and firing their weapons calmly, as Dulitzky's phone battery miraculously held on. 'I just kept thinking about getting out to my family,' he said. Rescue finally came around midnight, after nearly 12 hours in hiding. 'One of the managers told me the forces were on their way,' Dulitzky said. 'I told him, ‘If they don’t say exactly, 'Pablo, IDF, come out now' in that order, I’m not coming out.’ They called and said it just like that, and I knew they were at the gate.' When asked if he was injured, Dulitzky replied, 'No, just get me out of here.' Though safe, he continued to hear gunfire in his head for days after the ordeal. Back to work From the rooftop of their plant, Pablo and Rafi stood silently, gazing toward Gaza. Two months after the October 7 terrorist attack, the longtime colleagues reunited for the first time, following Dulitzky’s trip to Argentina. 'When I returned, I felt the weight of everything on me,' said Dulitzky. 'I realized I needed help because I wasn’t feeling well. Talking to someone helps a lot.' Litwak had resumed work earlier. 'We met again during a shift change,' Litwak recalled. 'We made coffee, just like we did the morning of October 7. But this time, we talked, each sharing our story, and couldn’t believe we survived. I think about how I made it out by minutes, and how he was stuck here but made it through.'

France is hoping that the meeting will raise about 500 million euros ($540 million) in humanitarian aid, according to a French foreign ministry framework document for the conference.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyn00otwl1x	2024-10-24T01:56:00-07:00

France will provide a 100-million euro ($108-million) aid package to support Lebanon, French President Emmanuel Macron told an international conference Thursday in Paris. Macron said, 'in the immediate term, massive aid is needed for the Lebanese population, both for the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war and for the communities hosting them.' The war between Hezbollah terrorists and Israel has displaced a million people in the country, killed over 2,500 and deepened an economic crisis. French organizers hope participants' financial pledges of humanitarian aid will meet the $426 million the United Nations says is urgently needed. Paris also seeks to help restore Lebanon's sovereignty and strengthen its institutions.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjnmiywx1e	2024-10-24T01:54:57-07:00

The injured were evacuated to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya. Sirens warning of rocket and missile fire were triggered in Nahariya and several towns across the Western Galilee, including Shlomi, Klil and Kabri, among others. Additional alarms were sounded in the Upper Galilee, including Kibbutz Malkia and Moshav Dovev. The IDF reported that approximately 50 rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, with some intercepted and others hitting open areas. Meanwhile, Israeli Air Force fighter jets, guided by precise intelligence, struck multiple Hezbollah military sites in Beirut's Dahieh district overnight. These sites, used for the production and storage of weapons, were located within and beneath civilian buildings in heavily populated areas. 'This is yet another example of Hezbollah's cynical exploitation of Lebanese civilians and infrastructure as human shields,' an IDF spokesperson said, noting that several precautionary measures, including advance warnings to civilians, were taken to minimize casualties. Meanwhile, the IDF said that Israeli fighter jets, guided by precise intelligence from the Military Intelligence Directorate, targeted several Hezbollah military sites used for the production and storage of weapons in the Dahieh district of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. The sites were located within civilian buildings, highlighting Hezbollah's use of civilian infrastructure as human shields. 'This is another example of the terror group's cynical exploitation of Lebanese civilians and facilities,' the IDF said, adding that numerous precautions, including advance warnings, were taken to minimize harm to civilians.

Suspects, including one from Iraq, allegedly paid 50,000 Sri Lankan rupees to execute attack; arrest made based on intelligence received from India's spy agency Sri Lankan authorities arrested two individuals overnight Thursday on suspicion of planning a terror attack targeting Israeli tourists in the Arugam Bay area, following a severe travel warning issued by Israel’s National Security Council the day before. According to local reports, the Sri Lankan defense forces received intelligence from India's spy agency about a planned attack on Israelis between October 19-23 in Arugam Bay. One of the suspects is believed to have traveled from Iraq, and investigators discovered that one of the two detainees had previously been imprisoned on international drug trafficking charges. Authorities also revealed that the suspects were allegedly paid 50,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($170) to carry out the attack. The travel warning issued by Israel on Wednesday urged all Israelis to immediately leave the Arugam Bay area and coastal regions in southern and western Sri Lanka due to 'updated information on a specific terror threat targeting tourist areas and beaches.' Officials said the intelligence indicated an imminent attack, describing it as a 'hot alert' similar to a foiled Iranian plot to target Israelis in Turkey during the summer of 2022.

Alan Yazbek was photographed at the Oct. 6 rally in Sydney's central business district holding a sign that replaced the Star of David on the Israeli flag with a blue swastika, accompanied by the words 'Stop Nazi Israel.' The 56-year-old Yazbek was also photographed holding another sign in the green and yellow colors associated with Hezbollah — a designated terrorist organization in Australia — with the words 'our boys in green and gold will win.' The rally took place a day before the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, carried out by Hamas. Yazbek — the co-founder of the Nomad Group, which owns three high-end restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne — was the only person charged following the rally, which saw an estimated 10,000 people in attendance. Police initially tried to prevent the rally but later reached an agreement with organizers, allowing it to proceed peacefully. Yazbek faces a potential sentence of up to 12 months in jail or a fine of 11,000 Australian dollars ($7,300). He is due to be sentenced on Dec. 10.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjqfwivgje	2024-10-23T22:15:54-07:00

IDF targets Beirut's Dahieh after rocket volley to central Israel	Lebanese media reports wave of airstrikes in Hezbollah's stronghold in the country after terror group fired four rockets toward Tel Aviv and surrounding area Lebanese reports on Wednesday reported significant airstrikes were seen in Beirut’s Dahieh district, considered to be Hezbollah’s stronghold in Lebanon, following the terror group’s targeting of central Israel with four rockets fired at the area earlier. The strikes come after the IDF’s Arabic Spokesperson Col. Avichay Adraee called on residents of the area to evacuate prior to the military’s actions. Footage from the scene showed massive explosions and smoke plumes. Following Hezbollah’s firing toward central Israel, Palestinian sources reported late Wednesday one rocket fell in the West Bank town of Qalqilya, resulting in one man receiving minor injuries. The two sides continue to escalate the conflict in the area amid the war in Gaza. Hezbollah said in an earlier statement, published via its operations room, that it used 'precision missiles' and new types of drones for the first time in their clashes against IDF troops. The terror group said it had been able to push back Israeli troops in clashes in several border villages in southern Lebanon. However, the organization had made several such claims in the past that were proven inaccurate. Meanwhile, Saudi news outlet Al-Hadath reported that an earlier IDF strike in Beirut was aimed at the offices of Hezbollah-affiliated network Al-Mayadeen. According to a Lebanese source talking to Reuters, the strike destroyed an office used by the pro-Iran Al-Mayadeen broadcaster. Two other security sources confirmed the office had been hit in an IDF strike on a multi-story building.

The world is watching, do not fail us': Former Israeli hostage s...	Amit Soussana addresses ambassadors in special event on sexual violence in conflict, recalling her assault by a Hamas terrorist while in captivity Former Israeli hostage Amit Soussana, who was released in the first hostage deal with Hamas after 55 days in captivity, addressed UN ambassadors in a special event held at the international body’s New York headquarters. 'I was held captive alone, chained by my ankle with a metal chain, unable to move, and had to ask for permission to use the bathroom,' Soussana recounted. 'In that house, I was sexually assaulted by the Hamas terrorist who guarded me. He forced me to go to the shower and entered the room, pointed his gun at me. He was breathing heavily and had a monstrous, beast-like face.' 'I knew exactly what he was planning to do, and yet I couldn’t do anything to prevent it. I was utterly helpless. When the assault was over, I wasn’t even allowed to cry or to be sad. I had no one to comfort me and was forced to act nice to the person who had just sexually assaulted me in the most horrifying way,' she added. 'Not a day goes by that I don't think about what that terrible man did to me. We were held in such inhumane conditions. No person should ever be subjected such brutal and ruthless treatment.' 'Now, I speak before the UN Security Council pleading with you to fulfill your duty. Take immediate action to secure the release of those still held captive. Every day that passes steals another piece of their soul and endangers their life. Act now before it's too late, I urge you: do not turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed against innocent civilians,' she said. 'It is your responsibility to protect human rights, to combat terrorism and to bring those responsible for these heinous crimes to justice. The world is watching, waiting for the UN Security Council to live up to its mandate. I beg you, do not fail us. Secure the freedom of the hostages and ensure that no one else would suffer the same fate,' she called on the international body. 'Remember, it is our collective duty to combat terrorism and protect human rights. The time to act is now.' Soussana spoke at a special event held at the UN to mark 15 years of the mandate on sexual violence in conflicts, organized by the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten. Patten was behind the report released earlier this year by the UN regarding the horrific rapes and sexual violence committed by Hamas terrorists during the October 7 massacre. In her speech, Patten reiterated her report’s recommendations published last April, which also called for the unconditional release of all hostages, an immediate cease-fire and the facilitation of an independent investigation of sexual violence by Hamas in order to bring the guilty to justice. 'Amit Soussana bravely shared the horrors, the violence, the sexual violence and the sheer evil she experienced from the moment she was abducted from her apartment in Kibbutz Kfar Aza until her release from Hamas captivity,' Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said during the event. 'Amit, you're strong, powerful and inspiring. Thank you for sharing your story with the world and exposing once again the true face of the Hamas terror organization. It's important to remember that the IDF’s stretched arm will reach anyone associated with Hamas and eliminate them. We won't stop until the release of all 101 hostages held by Hamas.'

Caught between sympathy and fear: Egypt’s Christians confront the...	Egypt’s Coptic Orthodox Christians are torn between support for Palestinian civilians and fear of Hamas, complicating their response to the ongoing war A year after Hamas’s October 2023 assault on Israel, Egypt’s Coptic Orthodox Christians remain divided over how to respond to the ongoing war in Gaza. As the Middle East’s largest Christian community, Copts are caught between sympathy for Palestinian civilians and deep fears of Hamas, the Islamist group linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, whose rule in Egypt was marked by violence against Christians. Coptic Christians make up Egypt’s largest Christian minority and the largest Christian population in the Middle East. Most belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church, which traces its roots to the early days of Christianity in Egypt. Egypt is also home to a significant population of Evangelical Christians, whose church, founded as a mission in the 19th century, is the largest Protestant denomination in the Arab world. Despite their numbers, both Copts and Evangelicals face ongoing sectarian violence. On August 31, 2024, a fire at the Coptic Diocese of Beni Suef destroyed the building and injured several people, though no lives were lost. While authorities blamed faulty wiring, many in the Christian community remain skeptical, citing a history of arson attacks on churches. 'My friend from the supermarket downstairs asked me about the Christian position on what he called Israeli aggression in Gaza,' said Isaac Ibrahim, a Copt writer in Cairo. 'He wanted to know if our solidarity with Palestine had shifted since the death of Pope Shenouda.' The late Pope Shenouda III, head of the Coptic Church from 1971 until his death in 2012, forbade Copts from visiting Israel, reflecting the pan-Arab stance of the time. His successor, Pope Tawadros II, has taken a more cautious approach, aligning the Church’s position with Egypt’s official diplomatic policies. 'Pope Tawadros doesn’t want to provoke conflict,' said John Gabriel, an Egyptian Dominican priest, speaking to The Media Line from a Franciscan monastery in Leuven, Belgium. 'He follows the government’s line, condemning violence on both sides but avoiding the hardline rhetoric of the past.' This shift has created a more muted stance within the Coptic Church, but divisions remain. While older Copts hold onto anti-Israel sentiments from Shenouda’s era, younger Copts are more skeptical of Hamas and other Islamist groups. For many Christians, Hamas’ role as a leader in the global 'Palestine solidarity' movement complicates support for the Palestinian cause. 'Because of the Brotherhood’s treatment of us, some Copts see Jews as similarly persecuted by Islamic extremists,' Gabriel told The Media Line. 'They ask, ‘Why defend Palestinians when groups like Hamas, who terrorized us, are leading the fight?’' Makarios Lahzy, a Cairo-based human rights lawyer, says the complex dynamics of the Arab-Israeli conflict put Christians in a difficult position. 'Christians in the East are weakened and exhausted,' Lahzy told The Media Line. 'For centuries, we’ve been blackmailed and accused of disloyalty, leading most to become confused and hide. Some Christians exaggerate their hostility towards Israel to avoid such accusations, while others align with Israel as a defense against Islamic domination.' Lahzy warns that rising support for Hamas in Egypt, especially after the killing of Hamas political leader Yahya Sinwar, could embolden Islamist factions within Egypt. 'The backing Sinwar receives from the Arab street reflects a deep-rooted anti-Jewish sentiment in the Islamic mindset,' he told The Media Line. 'What worries us is that glorifying Hamas could turn Islamist factions in Egypt back toward Christians.' Tensions are heightened by official statements from Al-Azhar, Egypt’s top Islamic authority, which has framed the conflict in religious terms. After Sinwar’s assassination, Al-Azhar mourned him as a 'martyr of the Palestinian resistance.' 'When Al-Azhar talks about Jerusalem in terms of jihad and resistance, it taps into old fears of Islamist violence,' Gabriel said. 'It’s not just about foreign policy—it raises fears of a revival of sectarian violence in Egypt itself.' The ongoing war in Gaza has reignited theological debates within Egypt’s Christian community. 'Palestinian Theology,' a Christian liberation theology that ties the Palestinian struggle to biblical themes of freedom, has been met with strong opposition from many Copts. 'It’s not theology—it’s a political movement with an antisemitic agenda,' said Bassem Al-Janoubie, a liberal Coptic commentator, speaking to The Media Line. 'It’s driven by the fusion of progressive European and North American Lutheran evangelical ideology and political Islam.' One of the most contentious aspects of this theology is the portrayal of Jesus as a Palestinian. 'Jesus was a Jewish king, born of royal blood,' Al-Janoubie told The Media Line. 'To suggest he was Palestinian is to deny his role as the Messiah, as depicted in the Gospels.' This theological friction adds to the wider tensions within Egypt’s Christian community. 'Yes, Jesus was in Palestine, but it was the land of Israel,' Gabriel said. 'For many Christians here, there’s no distinction between biblical Israel and the modern state.' These theological and political divisions are mirrored by practical concerns about security and sectarian violence. The fire at the Coptic Diocese of Beni Suef, though officially attributed to an electrical fault, has sparked fears of a return to the days when attacks on Christian churches were more frequent. Muslim arson attacks on Coptic churches have a long history, with nearly 1,000 churches attacked or torched since the 1970s. The war in Gaza, meanwhile, has only deepened these anxieties. 'If Hamas wins, many of us fear that Islamists here will turn their attention back to us,' Gabriel warned. 'It’s like a nightmare scenario: what if the flames spread to Egypt?' A year after the October 7 attacks, Egypt’s Coptic Christians remain divided. While many sympathize with Palestinian civilians, fears of Hamas and political Islam make it difficult to take a clear stance. 'We share the Arab world’s sympathy for the Palestinian people,' Gabriel told The Media Line, 'but we’re also fearful of what groups like Hamas represent for us as Christians.'

Iranian president threatens Israel on BRICS sideline	Masoud Pezeshkian in Russia visit swears damage to Israel would be 'unimaginable' should it attack Tehran in response to its ballistic missile attack; Gallant visits airbase hinting at close retaliation Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the BRICS international summit in Russia on Wednesday, warned Israel against a powerful response against Tehran following its missile attack on the country on October 1. 'If Israel makes a mistake, Iran will respond with force. Israel might cause us some damage, but the response it will suffer and the scale of damage inflicted will be unimaginable,' Pezeshkian said. His remarks came shortly after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reiterated Israel would strike Iran in response to its ballistic missile attack earlier this month. He made his statement during a meeting with pilots and technical staff at the Israel Air Force’s Hatzor Airbase. 'After we strike in Iran, people in Israel and elsewhere will understand what your preparation, readiness and capabilities entail. We have very high confidence in your abilities, both individually and as a team, as well as complete confidence in the IDF,' Gallant said against the backdrop of leaked U.S. intelligence documents detailing some of Israel's preparations for an attack on Tehran. Gallant's office added that the minister received a briefing on operational activities across all combat zones at Hatzor Airbase from the base’s commander, Brig. Gen. Amichai Levin and squadron commanders, including 'increased readiness for potential offensive actions in other fronts.' It was also reported Gallant spoke with air and ground crews, expressing his appreciation for their wartime activities over the past year. 'You have the privilege of participating in the seven-front war, and the IDF and the Air Force are present in all these fronts — Gaza, Lebanon, the West Bank, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran,' Gallant told the pilots. 'They've paid a heavy price wherever they've tried to harm us. Those who had dreams of defeating us and striking us in Gaza a year ago are no longer living after (Yahya) Sinwar and a long line of leaders have been eliminated, thanks the IDF’s actions,' he added. Meanwhile, U.S. efforts are ongoing to moderate Israel's response to Iran, aiming to prevent a dramatic escalation just before the November presidential elections. Secretary of State Antony Blinken requested that Israel further temper its response to Iran during a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. According to reports, the attack is already expected to focus on military assets in Tehran rather than Iran's nuclear or oil facilities. Blinken also urged an end to the IDF’s ground operation in Lebanon, advising Israel to leverage its military gains and turn them into strategic achievements. 'The campaign’s management is in Israel's hands,' an Israeli official said in response.

IDF exposes six Al Jazeera journalist as Gazan terrorists	Military reveals documents detailing names of reporters belonging to Qatari network affiliated with Hamas and Islamic Jihad activity in the Strip before and during October 7 The IDF reported on Wednesday that military intelligence and documents located in the Gaza Strip confirmed the affiliation of six Al Jazeera network journalists in Gaza with Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The reporters include Anas Jamal Mahmoud Al-Sharif, Alaa Abdul Aziz Muhammad Salama, Hossam Basel Abdul Karim Shabat, Ashraf Sami Ashour Saraj, Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar and Talal Mahmoud Abdul Rahman Aruki. 'The terrorist-journalist Ismail Farid Muhammad Abu Omar was struck and injured a few months ago in Gaza. The documents once again confirm his involvement in terrorist activities. The Al Jazeera network has attempted to disassociate itself from Omar's terror activities,' the military said in a statement. In a 2021 list of Hamas operatives, Abu Omar was described as a platoon commander in Hamas’ Khan Yunis Brigade. He is known for accompanying the terrorists on October 7 and documenting the massacre at Kibbutz Nir Oz in real-time. After being injured, he was transferred for treatment in Qatar. The documents include personnel tables, lists of terror training courses, phone directories and salary records for terrorists, clearly proving their roles as military operatives in Gazan terror groups. For example, Alaa Salama's name appears in a 2022 salary document for Islamic Jihad operatives, and Talal Aruki is mentioned in a 2019 injury tracking document describing he suffered a fracture in his right leg bone, which was treated with a splint. 'These documents serve as proof of the integration of Hamas terrorists within the Qatari Al Jazeera media network,' The military added. 'Most of the journalists that the IDF has exposed as operatives in Hamas's military wing spearhead the propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera, especially in the northern Gaza Strip.'

Three killed in attack on Turkish aerospace industries headquarte...	Footage broadcast on local media shows several armed assailants entering TUSAS complex, where gunfire and loud explosion reported; interior minister describes incident as 'terrorist attack'; sources indicate hostage situation An attack on the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS) headquarters near Ankara on Wednesday left three people dead and five others wounded, officials confirmed on Wednesday. The assault, which occurred in the Kahramankazan district, targeted one of Turkey's most critical defense and aviation facilities. Selim Cirpanoglu, the mayor of Kahramankazan, reported the casualties during an interview with Turkish TV channel Tele1. Footage broadcast on local media showed several armed assailants entering the TUSAS complex, where gunfire and a loud explosion were reported. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya described the incident on social media platform X, calling it a 'terrorist attack' and expressing condolences for the 'martyrs and injured.' He provided no details about the perpetrators, and the motive behind the attack remains unclear. Initial media reports suggested a suicide bomber may have been involved, and some sources indicated that hostages could have been taken. However, these details have not been confirmed by officials. Witnesses at the scene told Reuters that employees were escorted to shelters, and exits were sealed off amid reports that explosions had occurred near multiple building exits as workers were leaving for the day. Private broadcaster NTV reported that the attackers arrived in a taxi during a shift change, detonating a bomb at the entrance before entering the facility armed with assault rifles. At least one woman was among the assailants, according to security camera footage, which showed attackers in plain clothes carrying backpacks and rifles. State-owned Anadolu Agency reported that emergency services, including security forces, ambulances, and firefighters, were quickly dispatched to the site. Helicopters were seen circling above the premises, and a gunfight was reported in the complex’s parking lot. TUSAS, a state-run company that produces both civilian and military aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other defense systems, employs more than 10,000 people. It is responsible for key projects such as KAAN, Turkey's first national combat aircraft. Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the attack, and authorities are working to determine whether Kurdish militants, the Islamic State group or leftist extremists, all of which have previously carried out attacks in Turkey, may have been involved.

The secret Hezbollah tried to bury: Unmasking the Golan File	Established in 2018, unit attempted to operate covertly in Golan Heights while evading Israeli intelligence; however, military ultimately delivered crushing blow to group's activities Although Hezbollah spent the last few years focusing on its 'plan to conquer the Galilee,' the terror organization had also been planning a similar attack on the eastern sector of Israel's northern border. While fighting continues in southern Lebanon, the IDF is also operating in Syria to neutralize the threat in the Golan Heights, known as the Golan File. On October 9, the IDF eliminated Golan File member Adham Jahata in an airstrike. This terrorist operative had passed intelligence from the Syrian regime and Syrian frontlines to Hezbollah, enabling the Lebanese terror group to act against Israel through the Golan. His assassination adds to a series of countermeasures carried out by the IDF since the unit was first exposed in the winter of 2019, shortly after its formation. How is a terrorist organization created? Like most terror groups, the Golan File began as an idea: to establish an elite force that would plan and execute terror activities against Israeli civilians through the Syrian border. The unit was intended to serve as an intelligence-gathering branch, avoiding detection by the IDF, and launching attacks when ready. The current leader of the Golan File is Ali Musa Abbas Daqduq, also known by the call sign Abu Hussein Sajed. He was chosen due to his extensive history with Hezbollah. In addition to supporting attacks from Lebanon on Israel in the 2000s, he trained Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force. Later, he was sent to Iraq by the organization to build a terror network targeting U.S. forces. In the summer of 2018, Hezbollah noticeably shifted its operations in the Golan Heights, turning the idea into reality. A covert unit was established, with constant operational readiness to strike Israel at a moment’s notice. Hezbollah accomplished this using existing terror cells in southern Syria, undetected by the Syrian regime. However, the unit’s secrecy did not last long. Israeli intelligence quickly identified the threat and revealed its existence to the Israeli public and the wider world in March 2019. A look inside the operation Over the years, the IDF continued to gather intelligence, closely monitoring and combating the threat in secret. The Golan File resurfaced in the headlines in January 2023 when IDF forces captured Ghaith Abdullah, a Syrian resident and operative of the unit, while he crossed into Israel. During interrogation, Abdullah confessed to his involvement and identified three other operatives: Maan Al-Hamad, Abu Jud and Abu Hassan Al-Asha, the unit's Syrian recruiter known by the call sign Abu Ali. He detailed his recruitment process and the mechanics of how Syrian collaborators were activated. Hezbollah’s recruitment of local supporters relies on two main strategies: identifying Syrians with a history of anti-Israel terrorism and exploiting the poor living conditions in Syria by offering financial incentives in exchange for intelligence on IDF activities. Operation Cash Cab 'At the start of the war in October, we received reports that the Golan File had begun to mobilize,' recalled one IDF intelligence officer. 'Prior to October, they had been preparing. That day, they received the order to act.' In those first hours of uncertainty, the IDF quickly recognized the gravity of the situation and began formulating plans to foil the terrorist plot. For months, they conducted close surveillance on suspects, culminating in a decisive operation in December. 'We identified a Syrian man suspected of collaborating with Hezbollah in Quneitra, southern Syria,' the officer recalled. 'When we learned Lebanese operatives were joining him at the Syrian front, we knew this was no innocent meeting and acted to thwart the threat.' IDF surveillance tracked the Syrian collaborator's yellow taxi, and once all four terrorists—three Lebanese operatives and one Syrian—were confirmed to be inside, the vehicle was struck from the air. The operation, which killed Abu Al-Julan, a Syrian operative, and three Lebanese operatives—Abu Tarab, Abbas and Jawad Daqduq, the son of the unit's commander—was dubbed Operation Cash Cab. Intelligence officials described the strike as 'the hardest blow to the Golan File since its inception.' According to sources, the message remains clear: any enemy threatening Israel’s security, whether in Lebanon, Syria or elsewhere, will be eliminated by the IDF.

Hezbollah fires 25 rockets toward Nahariya, man seriously injured	IDF reports dozens of rockets were seen crossing into the country in fresh salvo fired from Lebanon; Israeli seriously injured after being hit by interceptor shrapnel A 50-year-old Israeli man was seriously injured on Wednesday after an interceptor shrapnel hit his head in Nahariya, located in northern Israel. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit also reported that 25 rockets were launched toward the city, Golan Heights and Western Galilee regions from Lebanon. Sirens also sounded in Hadera, located further south. The military added two launches were located targeting Tiberias and Afula and were both intercepted with no injuries reported. Magen David Adom (MDA) paramedics who arrived at the scene provided the man with preliminary medical care before evacuating him to the Galilee Medical Center in the city. 'We saw the man lying on the edge of the pier, unconscious and suffering from a severe head injury,' Magen David Adom paramedic Nir Dayai recounted. 'A passerby had bandaged the injured man with the guidance of the MDA's hotline and managed to stop the significant bleeding from his head.' 'He told us that the injury was caused by shrapnel from the latest rocket barrage interception. We transferred him to the MDA intensive care unit while providing him with medical treatment and evacuated him to the hospital. His condition is serious but stable,' he added.

Hundreds of people were running in every direction, and every fe...	Nova music festival massacre survivor Danielle Gelbaum vividly recalls the terrifying moments as thousands desperately fled while rockets and gunfire rained down around them Of all the October 7 horrors, the massacre at the Nova music festival stands out in its scale, cruelty and its perpetrators’ inhumanity. That morning’s music festival site and its surrounding areas through which the partygoers tried to flee endured one of history’s most deadly terrorist attacks. Three hundred and eighty-three people were murdered, 44 were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip and hundreds were wounded. This is Nova survivor, 23-year-old Danielle Gelbaum’s story. 'I’d returned from my big trip to South America three weeks before Nova. I traveled to the festival with my elder sister Lior and friends. We started feeling tired at 5:30, so we went to where the tent was and my sister went to sleep in the tent. The music stopped at 6:29 and Red Alert sirens went off.' 'A few minutes later, we were all told to pack up and leave, so we got into the car and started driving toward the exit. We got onto Route 232 and were about to turn left to Kibbutz Be’eri. We had no idea there were terrorists around. After driving for a few minutes, we saw cars turning back but didn’t understand what was going on. We also turned around. 'A few minutes later, we saw cars just stopping in the middle of the road and people running out. When we got out of the car, I heard the first gunshots. My sister looked at me and asked, 'Dani, is that what gunfire sounds like?' 'We saw people running and we started running with them. Someone, presumably from the security detail, was standing on a mound shouting to everyone, 'Run east, run toward the sun.' This is one of the things that saved us. We saw a big black vehicle driving toward us, so we stopped it and asked to get in. It was two guys from the rave. I’ve no idea how they survived. We drove for a few minutes and again reached a dead end: the fields were all plowed up and cars just couldn't get through.' 'I clearly remember seeing a girl standing outside the truck signaling us to help her, and we just couldn’t. The gunfire wasn’t letting up and we knew that if we were to stop now, that would be the end for everyone in the truck. To this day, I don’t know what happened to her. I eat myself away inside over this. It will be with me forever.' 'When we got out of the car, I realized the scale of what was going on. Nearby, I saw hundreds of people running in every direction, and every few seconds, someone would fall. I looked the other way and saw a terrorist in a green shirt walking calmly and two meters in front of him, I saw someone in a black T-shirt run and fall to the ground. He managed to get up, took another couple of steps and then just collapsed to the ground again. I’ll never forget that scene. This was when we realized how close it was. We saw the terrorists with our own eyes. They were here.' 'In the distance, I saw a pickup truck driving toward us. It was the couple we’d come to the festival with. They saved our lives. There were around 16 of us there, lying on top of each other in the back of the pickup truck. We drove through an orchard with shots being fired behind us, and dozens of people were running into the orchard. I clearly remember seeing a girl standing outside the truck signaling us to help her, and we just couldn’t. The gunfire wasn’t letting up and we knew that if we were to stop now, that would be the end for everyone in the truck. To this day, I don’t know what happened to her. I eat myself away inside over this. It will be with me forever.' 'We got to the police station in Netivot where we stayed until nightfall. On our way home, I texted my officer and told her I was on my way back and that I needed to be in the army right now. Throughout my two months of reserve duty, I didn’t understand what I’d been through. I remember my first panic attack after reserve duty: I was in a traffic jam on my way back from Tel Aviv with two friends when my whole body started shaking. 'My heart was pounding. I thought about how this was how it started last time around, and that the massacre was happening again. It was very hard. I then started having nightmares about terrorists, and images started resurfacing along with survivor guilt. What could I have done differently? I realized I needed to start taking care of myself.' 'Yes, it’s been hard, but I’ve started dancing again. Every time I take to the dancefloor, I’m overcome by a range of emotions: Joy that I’m here, along with the pain for those who aren't. I get triggers at every rave. Each and every party means dealing with it again. By we won’t stop dancing. If we stop dancing, they'll have won. They’ve beaten us in so many ways and this isn’t going to be one of them.'

One bomb, one building: Inside IDF’s high-impact strategy in Beir...	After rocket fire targeting northern Israel, IDF strikes terror sites in Tyre and Lebanese capital's Dahieh where building seen leveled with single bomb; Israeli forces uncover Hezbollah weapons cache in southern Lebanon mosque Another day of intense fighting in northern Israel unfolded as rockets were fired from Lebanon, and the IDF responded with airstrikes on multiple targets, including villages along the border and sites in Beirut's Shia-majority Dahieh district and Tyre. The military reported that a building in Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold, was demolished using a single precision bomb after intelligence confirmed it housed terrorist infrastructure. Overnight, Israeli Air Force jets, guided by military intelligence, targeted weapons production and storage sites, as well as Hezbollah command centers hidden within civilian buildings in Dahieh. Following an IDF warning of imminent strikes in Tyre, Lebanese civil defense teams evacuated an entire neighborhood. Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar reported that Lebanese authorities closed roads leading to the city after receiving Israel’s warning. Reports later confirmed a drone strike in central Tyre, and additional targets were hit throughout southern Lebanon, including in the villages of Khiam, Wadi Barghaz, Taybeh, Siriane, Qasmiyeh, Qana, Baflay and Al-Jbour. On Tuesday, the IDF destroyed a building in Dahieh believed to contain Hezbollah terror infrastructure on all floors. Footage of the operation showed the building collapsing with no damage to neighboring structures or harm to bystanders. The strike was carried out using a single JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) bomb, following recent improvements made by the Air Force's performance analysis unit to optimize munitions use. As military operations against Hezbollah continue, the IDF appears to be adopting a scaled-down version of the 'Dahieh Doctrine' from the 2006 Lebanon War, using disproportionate air and artillery firepower against civilian infrastructure utilized by terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee posted on social media details about the alleged location of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's bunker beneath Al-Sahel Hospital, which the military claimed housed over $500 million. 'For Lebanese journalists struggling to find Nasrallah's hideout, the entrance is in the eastern of the two buildings north of the hospital, where half a billion dollars is reportedly stored,' Adraee said, claiming Hezbollah has been blocking access to conceal the money. Simultaneously, IDF ground forces continued operations in southern Lebanon. The 205th 'Iron Fist' Reserve Brigade reported destroying dozens of tunnels and other terror sites, eliminating dozens of terrorists and seizing large quantities of weapons. During their mission, soldiers uncovered a weapons cache hidden in a mosque in a civilian neighborhood, containing grenade launchers, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs, Kornet missiles and combat vests. All weapons were confiscated and destroyed.

Israel issues urgent travel warning for Sri Lanka amid terror thr...	National Security Council instructs Israelis to leave Arugam Bay area and other coastal regions or return home due to 'credible alert about terrorist cell already in motion' The National Security Council (NSC) issued an urgent travel advisory on Wednesday, urging Israeli nationals in Sri Lanka to immediately leave the Arugam Bay area and coastal regions in the south and west of the island. The warning follows incoming intelligence regarding a potential terrorist threat targeting tourist areas and beaches. In recent days, the NSC received intelligence about plans for an attack specifically aimed at Israelis, with Arugam Bay being a primary focus. According to officials, there is a 'credible alert about a terrorist cell already in motion.' This is reminiscent of similar threats against Israelis in Turkey in the summer of 2022, officials added. 'There may be more than one cell involved,' said a senior security official. 'We are dealing with an immediate threat, and the highest level of alert has been raised in the beach and tourist areas. There is ongoing intelligence and counterterrorism activity, with local authorities cooperating fully. Until the situation is neutralized, this remains a very hot issue.' The Mossad is leading the operation, warning of an 'escalating level of threats and intent to attack Israelis worldwide' since the outbreak of the war in October last year. The scope of the threats has required a vast global deployment of Mossad operatives. Sri Lankan police have acknowledged the risk to Israelis in the region, setting up roadblocks and conducting vehicle checks. The U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka also issued a travel advisory, citing 'credible information about an imminent attack targeting popular tourist areas in Arugam Bay.' Security officials estimate there are hundreds of Israelis currently on the island. 'We are not calling for an immediate airlift,' the senior official added. 'We are trying to reduce the threat by advising those on the beaches to relocate to Colombo or other cities, depending on availability, and to avoid staying near the beaches. Those who can book flights and conclude their vacations are encouraged to do so, but there is no airlift planned at the moment.' The NSC has called for Israelis to leave the Arugam Bay area and beaches in the south and west of Sri Lanka, including in Ahangama, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Weligama, immediately. The threat level has been raised to level 4 in these regions. 'Those leaving these areas should either exit the country or at least relocate to Colombo, where there is a stronger security presence,' the advisory said. In the rest of Sri Lanka, the threat level has been raised to level 3, with Israelis advised to postpone non-essential travel to the country. The NSC also urged Israelis in Sri Lanka to take precautions: avoid displaying Israeli identity markers in public, including wearing shirts with Hebrew or any symbols revealing nationality and religion, and to avoid gatherings of Israelis in unsecured public areas. In the event of suspicious activity, they are advised to contact local security forces.

North Gaza polio campaign postponed due to violence, says WHO	A polio vaccination campaign in north Gaza has been postponed due to Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. This final phase, that was due to begin on Wednesday, aimed to vaccinate more than 119,000 children in the Palestinian enclave under siege for over a year in response to militant group Hamas' attacks on Israel. 'The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure, continue to jeopardize people's safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate,' the U.N. agency said in a statement, reiterating its call for a cease-fire. The polio campaign began on Sept. 1 after the WHO confirmed in August that a baby was partially paralyzed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years. Delays in a second dose for children could jeopardise efforts to halt transmission.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1oqe8iljl	2024-10-23T03:49:56-07:00

The following morning, their lives were upended—they became the 101 hostages whose return the entire nation still longs for. Families of eight of the hostages shared with Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth the last moments they remember with their loved ones before the nightmare began. Idan Alexander One of the hostages is Idan Alexander, 20. His mother, Yael, flew in from the United States to visit him during Sukkot. 'When the kids were younger, we used to build a sukkah in the U.S.,' she recalled. 'Now that they’re older, we usually visit friends during the holiday.' At 18, Idan made the decision to move to Israel and enlist in the Golani Brigade. He had been home for Rosh Hashanah and part of Sukkot last year, but spent Yom Kippur on base, where he chose to fast despite being on guard duty. 'I arrived in Israel on the Saturday before the abduction, and Idan came to pick me up,' Yael recounted. 'On Sunday and Monday, we were at my parents’ sukkah in Tel Aviv. My mother invited the extended family, and she always hosts a big Bukharan meal in the sukkah on the roof. But Idan insisted on taking me to get the best burger in town, even though I told him we had a huge meal coming up in a few hours. He devoured that burger. 'On Tuesday morning, he left for the base. I was supposed to fly back to the U.S. on October 7, and he knew that. We talked about it on October 6. Of course, everything was canceled.' Idan was abducted from his base and taken to Gaza. He had managed to tell his mother that he’d been hit by shrapnel in his helmet but was safe and in a secure location. During his time in captivity, his family received several signs of life from him. Itay Chen The last full family gathering for the Chen family took place during Rosh Hashanah. Nineteen-year-old Itay Chen, a tank crew member, didn’t come home for Sukkot. Instead, he returned to his battalion's mission along the Gaza border, tasked with securing the area during the holiday. On the morning of October 7, Itay and his fellow tank crew fought to fend off waves of terrorists heading toward Israeli communities near Gaza. Itay was killed in the battle, and his body was taken by the terrorists. Since then, his family has had no peace, as time seems to have stood still. 'Our family has no holidays,' said his father, Ruby. 'Every holiday, we have an empty chair, and it’s unbearable. The last time we were a complete family was in that Rosh Hashanah photo, and since then, we haven’t been able to come together physically because we don’t have a grave for Itay. He’s still in Gaza, and we can’t find closure.' Liri Albag Liri Albag, 19, had just begun her service as a proud lookout soldier at the Nahal Oz base when she was home for the start of Sukkot. Though disappointed to be stationed on base for the second holiday, she resolved to make the most of it. On the morning of October 7, as rocket sirens blared, Liri managed to send a photo to her boyfriend from the shelter and briefly speak with her family. Shortly after, she and six other female soldiers were abducted from the Nahal Oz post. One, Ori Magidish, has since been rescued, and another, Noa Marciano, was killed in captivity, with her body later recovered. Liri remains in captivity, along with four others: Daniella Gilboa, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger and Naama Levy. Tal Chaimi In a Sukkot holiday photo, Tal Chaimi, 41, stands alongside his brother-in-law, Rani Oren Goldin, and their children in a sukkah at the home of Tal’s sister, Or, in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. 'We always had a family sukkah,' said Or. 'Tal stored the wood and netting for it, and every holiday we’d pull it out, pick a spot and set it up. We’d have meals and family gatherings, sometimes even sleep in it.' Before they could take down the sukkah, both Tal and Oren, members of the kibbutz’s emergency response team, were killed or abducted while defending its borders on October 7. Goldin’s body was recovered and buried in Israel in July, but Tal remains in Gaza. Seven months after the attack, Tal’s wife, Ella, gave birth to their fourth child, Lotan. Chaim Peri On the eve of Simchat Torah, the extended Peri family gathered at the home of their patriarch and matriarch, Chaim, 80, and Osnat, in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The family reunion came as Israel marked 50 years since the Yom Kippur War, where Chaim had fought in the Sinai. Chaim proudly shared his wartime memories with the entire family, presenting a well-prepared slideshow recounting his experiences. 'We were all sitting in the living room, and I couldn’t believe all the grandkids were paying attention with us,' said Chaim’s daughter, Ofri Peri. She recalled her five-and-a-half-year-old daughter asking, 'What would have happened to our people if the army hadn’t won?' Her sister Reut responded, 'That’s impossible—our army is the strongest in the world, and it always wins.' Ofri reflected, 'The next morning, I thought about how my daughter went to bed with those words. In hindsight, she asked very profound questions.' The following day, on October 7, Chaim was abducted from his home and taken to Gaza. He survived months in captivity before the IDF announced his death in June. In August, his body was recovered and returned to Israel for burial. 'There are still 101 hostages in Gaza with whom we have had no communication for over a year,' Ofri said, reflecting on the loss of her father and the ongoing uncertainty for many families. Guy Gilboa-Dalal Last Sukkot, Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 23, wasn’t able to help his father, Ilan, build their family’s sukkah as he did every year. Throughout the holiday, the family hosted friends and relatives in the sukkah each evening. Before leaving for the Nova music festival on October 6, Guy promised his father that he would help dismantle the sukkah upon his return. Tragically, Guy was abducted from the Nova festival alongside his friend Evyatar David. His older brother, Gal, managed to escape the attack, but two of his close friends, Ron Tzarfati and Idan Harmati, were killed. Omer Shem Tov On Friday, October 6, the family of Omer Shem Tov, 21, celebrated the birthday of his mother, Shelly. The family spent the holiday evening with friends in Even Yehuda. 'We had such a great day,' said Omer’s father, Malki. 'We were in Jerusalem in the morning and stopped for burgers in Tel Aviv on the way back after Omer convinced us. It was a holiday evening full of laughter. We got home around midnight, and then Omer went out.' Later that night, Omer attended the Nova music festival, where he met up with Itay and Maya Regev. The three were abducted together. Itay and Maya were returned in a deal nearly a year ago, but Omer remains in captivity. 'Holidays are a breaking point for us, as are Friday night dinners,' said Malki. 'There’s no motivation to celebrate anything. Omer asked us not to worry, but I hope he knows we’re moving heaven and earth for him. He’s not alone, and we’ll do everything to bring him back.' Tamir Adar For the past decade, Tamir Adar, 38, spent Rosh Hashanah with his wife’s family at the Sea of Galilee, and the second night of the holiday was always reserved for his mother, Yael. 'It was also my birthday, and everyone came—the kids, the grandkids, my father. No one was missing. It was the last time we were all togetherr like that,' Yael recalled. 'We had a barbecue, which Tamir loved to do. He even taught his son how to handle it all,' she added. 'A year has passed, and now 8-year-old Assaf proudly takes over the barbecue, just like his father taught him. I last saw Tamir on October 6. We chatted for a few minutes and planned to meet the next day, but we never did. Since then, another Rosh Hashanah has come and gone, and I turned 60, but we didn’t celebrate anything. Nothing feels festive, my throat tightens. We sit at the table mainly for the kids—they are our strength.' Tamir was wounded and abducted from Nir Oz and died from his injuries in Gaza on October 7. His grandmother, Yaffa Adar, was also abducted that day but was released in a hostage exchange in November.

Soldiers from the 205th Reserve Brigade located a weapons storage facility containing grenade launchers, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs, combat vests, Kornet missiles, and other weapons that were hidden in a mosque in the heart of a civilian neighborhood in southern Lebanon the IDF spokesperson's unit announced on Wednesday morning. All the weapons that were found were seized and dismantled. In recent days, the brigade's troops have located and dismantled dozens of tunnel shafts and terrorist infrastructure, eliminated dozens of terrorists, and located large quantities of weapons, according to the IDF. The brigade's soldiers were mobilized for combat in the northern arena after being mobilized several times over the past year for operations in the Gaza Strip and for defensive battles in the north.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy1fu4ieyg	2024-10-23T01:52:36-07:00

There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjxjevug1x	2024-10-23T01:34:44-07:00	
Steak, sushi and pizza: IDF steps up its food game for front line...	Culinary innovations meet military logistics as IDF troops in southern Lebanon enjoy gourmet meals like pulled asado and entrecôte steaks, boosting morale with upgraded, diverse and carefully prepared food options, far surpassing traditional combat rations As IDF soldiers engage in battles in southern Lebanon, their culinary experience has seen a significant upgrade. Commando Brigade fighters, along with paratroopers and tank crews, are now receiving far better meals than those provided in the past. Instead of the traditional rations of canned corn and tuna, soldiers were treated to pulled asado and entrecôte steaks from a smoker set up in the Galilee during the High Holy Days. 'Those fighting in Lebanese territory received these delicacies in special trays, with carefully prepared side dishes. Troops on the front lines enjoyed these gourmet meals packed in baguettes,' said logistics officers from the 98th Division’s elite Commando Brigade. Their philosophy is simple: every ammunition shipment should also include quality food for the troops, especially after the lessons learned from operations in Gaza. Combat rations have also been upgraded, now featuring protein bars, beef jerky and vacuum-sealed meat dishes in various sauces that can be heated in the field. Over the holidays, soldiers in enemy territory even received festive treats, including dates, pomegranates and olives. The experience of creating a supply network under the more difficult conditions of Gaza has been crucial. 'In Gaza, we reached a point where we had ice cream freezers powered by generators, pizzerias for the troops, mobile sushi bars, shawarma stations and more,' the logistics officers recounted. 'There’s no reason why soldiers in Lebanon shouldn’t enjoy good food as well. Our rule is that no soldier should receive the same meal two days in a row. We hold daily brainstorming sessions, learn from our experiences and constantly seek new ways to improve, paying attention to every detail.' Recently, the IDF has begun testing airborne supply drops in the northern sector, causing some alarm in the Upper Galilee earlier this month. However, the supply drops were primarily an operational test, similar to the equipment drops in Gaza earlier this year, and aimed at ensuring readiness for potential ground operations deep in Lebanon. Additionally, Commando Brigade troops have used special robots to transport food and equipment in recent weeks, minimizing risk to soldiers. These machines have successfully navigated Lebanon’s rugged terrain, though troops are also prepared for 'logistical independence,' remaining far from supply lines if necessary. While operations along the northern border are expected to conclude within weeks, soldiers have been fully equipped with winter gear, including thermal shirts and storm suits, as temperatures in the region continue to drop. Another logistical development has been the establishment of military police stations along the border to handle the large amounts of weapons seized from Hezbollah, ensuring proper evaluation before they are investigated or destroyed.

Indictment: Iran-linked cell planned to kill Israeli nuclear scie...	The Jerusalem District Court filed an indictment on Wednesday against seven young men, aged 19 to 23, from the Beit Safafa neighborhood in East Jerusalem, for serious security offenses, including aiding the enemy during wartime and providing intelligence to an enemy. The charges come after the group, allegedly directed by Iranian operatives, plotted to assassinate an Israeli nuclear scientist and his family. According to the indictment, the cell planned to murder the scientist, burn down his home, and had attempted to enter the Weizmann Institute of Science, a prestigious research university in Rehovot, where the scientist worked and lived. After being denied entry, two of the suspects photographed the entrance to the institute and later surveilled the scientist's home. The seven suspects—Rami Alyan, Abd al-Rahman Alyan, Muhammad Khatib, Mamdouh Khader, Omri Abu Hamida, Mahmoud Khader and Muhammad Taha—face multiple charges, including aiding the enemy during wartime, contact with a foreign agent, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act and arson.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyklh78gyg	2024-10-23T00:57:43-07:00	
Indictment: Iran-linked cell planned to kill Israeli nuclear scie...	7 East Jerusalem men, arrested last month for allegedly carrying out missions for payment, charged with attempting to assassinate nuclear scientist, directed by Iranian agent; one suspect purchased weapon but arrested before completing plot The Jerusalem District Court filed an indictment on Wednesday against seven young men, aged 19 to 23, from the Beit Safafa neighborhood in East Jerusalem, for serious security offenses, including aiding the enemy during wartime and providing intelligence to an enemy. The charges come after the group, allegedly directed by Iranian operatives, plotted to assassinate an Israeli nuclear scientist and his family. According to the indictment, the cell planned to murder the scientist, burn down his home, and had attempted to enter the Weizmann Institute of Science, a prestigious research university in Rehovot, where the scientist worked and lived. After being denied entry, two of the suspects photographed the entrance to the institute and later surveilled the scientist's home. The seven suspects—Rami Alyan, Abd al-Rahman Alyan, Muhammad Khatib, Mamdouh Khader, Omri Abu Hamida, Mahmoud Khader and Muhammad Taha—face multiple charges, including aiding the enemy during wartime, contact with a foreign agent, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act and arson. A joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem Police's Central Unit uncovered an Iranian intelligence network working to recruit and activate Israeli citizens for missions within Israel. The lead suspect, Rami Alyan, reportedly acted under the direction of an Iranian agent via the instant messaging app Telegram and recruited the other suspects to assist with various tasks. The group also attempted to procure firearms and explosives for the assassination. The group allegedly received payments for their activities, ranging from 500 shekels ($130) for photographing locations such as the Weizmann Institute, 1,500 shekels ($390) for surveillance of specific targets and 2,000 shekels ($520) for setting a vehicle on fire. They were also paid between 13,000 and 15,000 shekels ($3,380-$3,900) to procure weapons, including a handgun and potentially a Carlo submachine gun, though the transaction was not completed. The suspects were paid in cryptocurrency, which was later converted into approximately 26,000 shekels ($6,760) in cash. The arrests, which occurred last month in a central Israeli city, were made after an urgent tip-off to Shin Bet’s elite Tequila rapid intervention unit and the Israel Police's Yamam counterterrorism team, following long-term intelligence monitoring. Authorities acted quickly after receiving intelligence that the cell was on the verge of carrying out an assassination. In addition to the plot targeting the scientist, the suspects also allegedly planned to assassinate a central Israeli mayor and carried out other activities, including setting vehicles on fire in Jerusalem's Ein Kerem neighborhood, spraying anti-Israel graffiti, attempting to acquire weapons such as guns and grenades, and planning attacks on security forces. After some cell members were arrested, Alyan fled, destroyed his operational phone and discarded the pieces in an open field to avoid detection. Police searches of the suspects' homes uncovered 50,000 shekels ($13,000), a forged police license plate and numerous credit cards. This case is the fifth recent instance of Israeli citizens being exposed as operatives working for Iranian interests. Earlier this week, it was revealed that seven Israelis from northern Israel, originally from Azerbaijan, were arrested for spying on military bases on behalf of Iran, with plans to assassinate a senior Israeli official and his son. Israel has noted an increase in Iran’s efforts to recruit Israelis to gather intelligence, though these plots have not yet resulted in a major operational success. Iranian activity has shifted focus from targeting high-ranking officials to scientists and academics, posing an ongoing challenge for Israeli counterintelligence. A senior Border Police official emphasized the urgency of the operation, stating that the cell had reached an advanced stage of planning the assassination. Experts warn that while Israeli efforts have successfully thwarted these plots, Iran’s attempts should not be dismissed. 'It's like a goalkeeper during penalty shots—you’re bound to block many, but eventually, one will get through,' said one source. The Shin Bet’s counter-espionage division has increased its operations over the past two years, with financial gain emerging as a common motivation for the Israeli recruits, most of whom were aware they were working for Iran.
