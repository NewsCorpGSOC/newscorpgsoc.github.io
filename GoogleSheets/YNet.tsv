Amid concerns of terror attacks security forces on alert on major roads, city centers and around the Western Wall with special attention given to mixed Jewish-Arab cities; a dedicated phone app alerts observant Jews of rocket threat Synagogues in major cities and susceptible areas will be under armed guard on Yom Kippur amid concerns that terrorists will try to launch attacks on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Police deployment was already spread to major highways and city centers with special attention placed on mixed Jewish and Arab cities where tensions have traditionally been high during the holiday. Synagogues were asked to place an armed guard outside their door and leave a phone available to call for help if the need arises. Jerusalem police will be on high alert around the city and at the Western Wall, to bolster the sense of security for Jewish worshipers. Checkpoints will also be set up leading to the holy site for increased security and to prevent overcrowding. Access ahead of Yom Kippur will only be allowed to public transportation and the police will stop cars from the predominately Arab eastern sectors of the capital, from entering the western quarters. Access will only be allowed for humanitarian reasons. Observant Jews will be able to receive rocket alerts on a dedicated app on their phones and on dedicated radio channels. Security officials said Iran would attempt to ignite violence in and from the West Bank. They said that there are currently 60 specific threats of terror attacks, mostly originating from the West Bank.

Report details damage from over 1,600 rocket to northern Israel	over 103 incidents of direct hits and collateral property damage have been reported since the start of the war on October 7, , 61 incidents of damage to private and public infrastructure and property; Kiryat Shmona hit hardest The Defense Ministry's Northern Horizon Directorate published on Thursday a detailed report covering the damages done to areas in northern Israel amid Hezbollah's increasing fire toward the country and the IDF's entry into Lebanon. The ministerial body coordinates the activities of various ministry bodies and collaborates with other government agencies near the Lebanese border, covering 124 towns, cities, and regional councils located up to nine kilometers (5.5 miles) from the border. According to the directorate, over 103 incidents of direct hits and collateral property damage have been reported since the start of the war on October 7. In the 10 days preceding the IDF's ground operation, 61 incidents of damage to private and public infrastructure and property were reported. The data collected so far shows approximately 1,645 reports of damage, affecting private homes, apartment buildings, public facilities, businesses, agriculture, and more. Of these, 54% of the damage caused by Hezbollah's attacks targeted private residences, 11% impacted public buildings, 4% hit chicken coops or cowsheds, 3% affected infrastructure, 2% struck agricultural land, pastures or orchards and 2% damaged businesses. Another 19% have yet to be classified due to difficulties in accessing the impact area and risks to professional personnel. In terms of the source of the damage, 79% of the incidents were caused by Hezbollah fire while 21% resulted from IDF activity, mainly during the early stages of the war when large numbers of forces reached the front lines before the military established more organized control over the area. Brigadier General (Res.) David Suissa, head of the Defense Ministry's Rehabilitation Department, explained the data collection method treats each damage report as a single case, without adding the total number of affected assets. For example, an attack on a residential building that damages five apartments and five vehicles would be recorded as one incident. A minor event is defined as one where the damage can be locally repaired, while major incidents involve buildings that were either heavily damaged or are beyond repair. When dividing the incidents by local councils, municipalities and cities in the northern region, Kiryat Shemona experienced the highest number of incidents, with 218 reports of damage. Most of the damage, 117 cases, was classified as minor. At least 14 damage sites were identified in the city in the rocket barrages that took place on Wednesday alone. Kibbutz Manara sustained the highest number of severe impacts, with nine out of 73 incidents classified as very serious. Shetula in the Western Galilee saw 68 reports, 19 of which were considered severe.

US still believes Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon,...	The intelligence assessment could help explain U.S. opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for an Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel The United States still believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's recent strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two U.S. officials told Reuters. The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran's leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program. 'We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003,' said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The intelligence assessment could help explain U.S. opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week. U.S. President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program might only delay the country's efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran's resolve to do so. 'We're all watching this space very carefully,' the Biden administration official said. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program. Key Iran ally weakened In the past weeks, Israel's military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group's setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month. The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself. Beth Sanner, a former U.S deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is 'higher now than it has been' and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon. That would still take time, however. 'They can't get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months,' said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund. Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to 90% weapons-grade, at two sites, and in theory, it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. watchdog. The expansion in Iran's enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to 'a week or a little more,' according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president. Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate. Possible Israeli attack Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran's attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the U.S. military. The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran's energy infrastructure. Israel, however, views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat. The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel. Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, saying: 'That's the thing you wanna hit, right?' Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead. 'The Iranians have to recalculate what's next. I don't think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity,' he said. 'They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in.'

Satellite images show destruction of two S. Lebanese towns	New report releases photos showing Yaroun and Maroun al-Ras following a year into war against Hezbollah on the northern border The New York Times on Thursday published an article describing the destruction of two towns in southern Lebanon — Yaroun and Maroun al-Ras — via satellite imagery said to be confirmed by the American outlet. The footage shows massive destruction in villages that were heavily bombed and attacked for over 11 months of war even before the IDF’s ground operation in southern Lebanon. Satellite images provided by Planet Labs reveal tank tracks from the Israeli side of the border leading to Yaroun. IDF positions can be seen where the military prepared positions for tanks and other military vehicles. The paper reminded readers that Hezbollah joined the war initiated by Hamas on October 8, one day after the massacre on the Israeli-Gaza border and began launching rockets at Israel, which led to IDF bombings and airstrikes, forcing tens of thousands of residents to evacuate their homes on both sides of the border. Israel said that the goal of the ground operation was to destroy Hezbollah's military infrastructure deeply embedded in border villages to allow northern residents to return to their homes safely. The images from southern Lebanon, according to the Times, show IDF forces patrolling the streets of the villages and towns, setting up positions near homes and buildings. Lebanese officials told were quoted in the article saying that the residents of the two villages had abandoned them before IDF forces entered the area. An analysis of the images and footage reveals similar levels of destruction in Maroun al-Ras, including additional buildings that were recently flattened, with IDF military vehicles visible in the area. Another video featured in the extensive report shows what appears to be the controlled demolition of a mosque in Yaroun. 'This is the main mosque where daily prayers are held, and where religious holidays and occasions are celebrated,' the local mayor said.

Luxury villa once owned by Goebbels given away for free—but there...	Lakeside villa near Berlin, once used by Nazi chief propagandist for hosting Reich leaders and secret affairs, now at center of controversy; Germany plans to give it away for free, fearing far-right groups might turn it into shrine Wandlitz is a village in the state of Brandenburg, Germany, consisting of 25,000 inhabitants, and the kind of place that tourist guides would definitely call 'picturesque'. A half an hour's drive of just 22 miles north of Berlin, and you reach this marvelous place: green forests, pastoral silence and peaceful bike paths. 'Most people who live here were raised here and came back after they were through with education and career, wishing to grow old here; those who stayed in the East following German reunification, were either families who worked in Berlin but wanted a bit of quiet, or wealthy Berliners who needed a quiet place for the weekend or the summer,' says Catherine Brozovsky, owner of a real estate agency located on the main street of the village. These are exactly the reasons why Wandlitz has a dark past. Not far from here, for example, is the villa of Hermann Goering, one of the Nazi Party leaders, and nearby is the hunting lodge and bunker of Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany and the prime organizer of the building of the infamous Berlin Wall. But this is not why Wandlitz has made headlines in recent months. To find the reason one should drive for ten minutes, down the road that leads to the village, beside the Bogensee Lake. All of a sudden you will see an abandoned bus station, all covered in stickers and Nazi inscriptions in Gothic letters. Then you will encounter a large garage, where there used to be a fleet of black luxury cars, decorated with swastika flags, some of which were convertibles, so that he could wave to the crowds at the mass gatherings he organized. Right after, there is a building where his bodyguards were housed. And then it shows: a spacious villa, the finest architecture of the 1930s, extending over 17,000 sq ft. on one elongated level; walls that were once white, a tiled roof, and an entrance above which the inscription 'Bogensee', the German name of the nearby lake, is displayed. This is the summer Villa of Josef Goebbels, the Propaganda Minister of the Third Reich and one of Hitler's closest associates. Goebbels received the land as a gift from the state of Berlin in 1936, he had the villa built in 1939 and used it as a retreat for his personal needs. In 1943, after his home in Berlin was bombed by the Allied forces, he moved to live there with his wife Magda and their six children. They decided to move back to Berlin to Hitler's bunker in the final phase of the war. After Hitler and his new wife Eva Braun committed suicide, Goebbels managed to serve as Chancellor for one day. Then he and Magda poisoned their six children and committed suicide as well. Meanwhile, the villa moved from one dictatorship to another. The Soviets, who controlled the territory of Wandlitz after the war, built there four huge buildings on a total area of about 40 acres. The massive complex was used as an education center, dormitories and cultural center for East German youth, so they could learn the principles of communism. Since then, the Soviet dictatorship has also collapsed, and in the meantime, all the buildings - one Nazi villa and four Stalinist concrete monsters - have stood as monuments during almost six decades of totalitarian regimes. The ownership of the site returned to the state of Berlin. However, the city found no use for it. In the last 25 years, the entire complex has been abandoned and neglected. In the meantime, nature is taking its own course: the beech trees grow wild, the walls are overgrown with nettles, mold and rot. The roof was leaking and had to be replaced at a cost of four million euros. Everything is crumbling, and the maintenance and upkeep costs have been borne by the public. Last May, Berlin's new state finance minister, Stefan Evers, has had enough. Every year the state spends about a quarter of a million euros for the maintenance and security of the complex, mainly because it attracts groups of neo-Nazis. 'I offer to anyone who would like to take over the site, to take it over as a gift from the state of Berlin,' stated the minister. 'If we fail again, as in the past decades, Berlin has no other option but to carry out the demolition that we have already prepared for,' he added. Then the mess started. 30 rooms, 40 study rooms and one cinema hall It is seemingly a simple deal, offering a huge area of about 170 acres, isolated, in the middle of a green lung of trees and water, half an hour's drive from Berlin, and all for free. It should have been a gem for real estate agents. But the German authorities themselves don't really know what the purpose of this complex should be. There are those who claim that it should be obliterated, to completely erase the past, and construct a new project instead; in contrast, there are those who are convinced that this is a historical site that must be preserved. But if so, then why give it to an entrepreneur? After all, a museum is not profitable, and besides, the renovation of the place will cost millions. Above all, there is fear that the place could attract German far-right extremists, turning it into a pilgrimage site and a shrine, worshipping Goebbels. 'The history of the place is precisely the reason why Berlin would never hand this building over to private hands where there would be a risk that it could be misused,' Minister Evers warned when he announced the ultimatum. This fear is not unfounded. Berlin tried to sell the land in the past. 'The only serious inquiries were from a Russian oligarch, who wanted to establish a private education center but could not prove to the Germans the source of his money,' says Claudia Schmid-Rathjen, a Wandlitz-based historian. 'An earlier inquiry, from an extreme-right group called the Reichsbürger movement, seemed to embody the authorities’ worst fears. The group denies the legitimacy of the current German state; some of its members are on trial for a plot to overthrow the government. In Berlin, they don't know whether to repurpose or bulldoze the site to save maintenance costs. In contrast, there are historians and academics who oppose demolishing the buildings that hold German history. No one can agree what to do with a villa so tainted that no one is willing to buy, or even get for free.' But to understand how much this piece of land is charged with emotions and history, one should go back more than a century. Originally, this area belonged to a rich Jew named Friedland, from whom in 1913 the state of Berlin purchased the land. Schmid-Rathjen explains that there were two reasons involved, marking a vision of a hundred years ahead: the industrialized Berlin needed a green belt around it; Berlin's population growth will be such that it will have to find housing solutions outside the city.' But Germany sank into World War I, followed by hyperinflation and political instability. Then the Nazis rose to power. Goebbels was a high-ranking official in the Reich and played a major role in spreading Nazi propaganda using cultural and media platforms within Germany. The state of Berlin was very impressed by his achievements and decided in 1936 to gift him the estate by the lake Bogensee. There Goebbels decided to build his dream villa. When he was not in his apartment in Berlin with his new wife Magda (the two were married in 1931), Goebbels lived in a log cabin in the compound, where he spent time with his mistress, Czech actress Lída Baarová. Two years later, Magda found out about the affair and turned to Hitler demanding to divorce Goebbels. Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship with the actress and threatened Baarová using the Gestapo. It worked, but later Goebbels had several affairs, and so did Magda. Goebbels was very much involved in the construction of his villa. As he wanted to overshadow the villa of his neighbor Goering, Goebbels built a house with 30 rooms and 40 study rooms, clever day-room windows that fold away into the floor at the push of a button, 60 telephones, a cinema hall with 525 padded seats with preparation for headphones, wooden ceiling decorations and other architectural avant-garde and technological luxury that were popular at the time; of course, he also had a bunker. 'It's so comfortable here that you can think you're living in peacetime,' Goebbels said of the place in 1943. When completed, Goebbels used the villa to entertain Nazi leaders, artists and actors. But he would also work there. Today it is impossible to enter the villa, but I did manage to have a tour from the outside and peek inside through the boards blocking the windows to two rooms: one room with a large fireplace where Goebbels sat with Albert Schaefer in 1944 planning the renovation of German cities after the war. The second room, to the right, was Goebbels' study, overlooking the lake, where he wrote his diary and many of his speeches. Here, for example, Goebbels wrote the 'Total War' speech that he delivered in February 1943. 'The villa is not his at all. It was co-funded by the UFA film company', says Peter Longerich, a historian from Munich who wrote a biography of Goebbels. Goebbels loved abundance and luxury in his private life. He would use the villa mainly to entertain friends and Nazi elite leaders. They would come to advise him on the materials he reviewed on his weekly radio show, adds Longerich. But the luxurious life was about to end. In 1945, when it was already clear at the top of the Reich that Germany was going to lose the war, Goebbels and his neighbor chose two different paths. 'Göring ordered the killing of all the animals on his farm, so that there would be no food left for the Russians; he blew up his villa and then went to negotiate with the British,' says the historian Schmid-Rathjen. 'But Goebbels was an ideologist. He left the villa intact and went to Berlin, where he, his wife and their six children committed suicide in Hitler's bunker.' The villa was left intact and was used briefly as a military hospital. Very quickly it was nationalized by the East German Communist Party, becoming an education center for the party's youth organization. Here the young leaders of East Germany and the Communists in general were to be nurtured. In the mid-1950s, architect Hermann Henselmann, who designed the monstrous Karl Marx Avenue in Berlin, erected the four buildings of the school. When finished, the complex could host 800 young students from around the world, who were to get communist education there. 'I was a communist in West Germany and the organization sent me to study there between 1983-1984,' says Detlef Siegfried, Associate Professor of History at the University of Copenhagen, Department of Germanic Studies, who wrote a book about the compound. 'It was an amazing experience which involved studies, conversations, activities, parties and meetings with people from all over the world. I remember it as a very secluded place, in the middle of the forest. I was very surprised by how much East Germans admired Western brands like Coca-Cola, which we despised. We, Westerners, went there as revolutionists, we wanted to replace capitalism with socialism. The East Germans went there to learn how to organize frameworks.' Did you know anything about the villa there? 'We knew nothing about the villa and its history. Everyone I talked to from that time did not know either, although it was clear that it belonged to a different era. It was very strange in retrospect, because East Germans always pointed to the West as Nazis, and the villa could have been used as a propaganda tool for them, to show the difference. But they said nothing to us.' In the early 1990s, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, ownership of the site returned to the state of Berlin. In the four new buildings, dozens of listening devices are discovered, leading straight to the East German Ministry of the Interior. Various uses were made of the structures: Deutsche Bank settled in the complex; then there was a center for training social workers. The place was revived, a hotel and restaurants were opened. Nothing worked. The property was completely abandoned about 25 years ago, and since then it has only been crumbling and costing the German taxpayer money. Lots of money. Preserve or demolish? Real Estate agent Catherine Brozovsky estimates that currently, the value of the property is very low, at about 600 euros per square meter, because it is abandoned and neglected, with no infrastructure, no public transportation or internet. An investor who will renovate it, can receive a value that suites an estate by a lake, which is almost 8,000 euros per square meter. Even when disregarding the areas designated for conservation and afforestation purposes, the property's worth is estimated at hundreds of millions of euros.' Renovation and repurposing the property could also cost the future investor many millions of euros. Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association (EJA) has also issued an appeal to the state of Berlin with an interesting proposal to convert the mansion into a center for combatting antisemitism and hate propaganda, which are dangerous, causing even normal people to do terrible things. And who will finance it? 'Hopefully the government and organizations that deal with Holocaust commemoration and education against hate speech and antisemitism. We are busy trying to recruit Jewish donors to increase our chances vis-a-vis the state of Berlin.' This is not the first time that a Nazi site has been converted into a memorial site. Hitler's Austrian birthplace turned into a human rights training center after it became a pilgrimage site, used as a shrine for neo-Nazis. Also, the villa in Wannsee which hosted the famous conference where the 'Final Solution' was discussed, also became - after quite a few debates - one of the most famous and most visited memorials in Berlin. 'It's a big quandary for the Germans, whether to preserve or obliterate the edifices from Germany’s Nazi past and in this case also the communist regime, especially today when the extreme right in Germany is on the rise', says the historian Schmid-Rathjen. 'We need to think how many sites should be preserved, and how much we should be considerate of the municipalities' needs. Will the demolition mean the erasure of history, or are there other ways to remember the place? In Yad Vashem, there are no more victims, but they live on the internet. The truth and historical facts are already inscribed. So, I think it won't be a disaster if they obliterate the place.' Oliver Borchert, the mayor of Wandlitz, actually thinks that there should be no measures or decisions regarding demolition. 'We mustn't talk about the demolition,' he says, 'because extreme right-wing movements might take over it, the value of the property will decrease and will not do justice to its historical importance.' So, what else can be done? 'It needs transformation. You have to find a use that can stand against and reflect the shadows of the house and its history', says Borchert. There needs to be a place that will be used for education for democracy, a research center and a campus, and the rest of the area will be left for private use such as a hotel, rehabilitation and recovery center. It is a building of historical and architectural importance, and we need to learn how to get along with history, it is impossible and forbidden to destroy history, he added. The Berlin municipality is trying to cope with the fear that neo-Nazi organizations will take over the property; thus, it determined that the taker would have to submit an offer that would include a detailed plan for ten years, no matter what. 'So, the question is what happens after ten years,' says Schmid-Rathjen. 'Extreme right-wing organizations can prepare a wonderful plan, finance a shell company, and after ten years will use it for evil, turning it into an education center for extreme right-wing studies. That's why I think it's all bullshit. No one will destroy the only private house left, which is linked to the rise of the Nazis. Nothing will happen.' 'This is a place of propaganda, misanthropy, distortion of words, a crime scene,' says journalist Stefan Berkholz, who also wrote a biography on Goebbels. 'There must be a place with a concept here, with priority for an educational institution. Demolition would be a scandal, erasing the reminder for future generations. It would become a no-man's land that would always be occupied by memories, and then the question is - who tells the memories, who controls the narrative.' What do you suggest? 'We must turn this dark historical place into a bright future that will illuminate history and warn future generations. But it seems that Berlin only wants the wild weeds to grow and hide the place and its history. We must not forget what happened here: a mechanism of two paranoid regimes. We must not allow the wild weeds to hide it.' 'We can allow Elon Musk to build a Tesla University there,' says Mayor Borchert, 'but he will not be allowed to build a Tesla factory there, and we will not authorize any entrepreneur to build thousands of housing units there. Ideally, we would like to have an academy for democracy, a campus for sciences of resistance to dictatorships; and everything should be funded by the German government.' And the villa? Will it be demolished? 'As far as we are concerned, it will not be demolished. There are already many problems in the world that cover up the past, making it disappear over time with no ability to learn from it. And there is also the opposite scenario, in which the right-wing wins the elections and turns the place into an ideological education center.' Lost place We are sitting in an Italian cafe on the banks of the lake. 'The children of Goebbels traveled on this road to get to school, using a peasant carriage,' says Schmid-Rathjen, then pointing to a nearby shop. 'And here they would have an ice cream.' Also today, children eat ice cream here peacefully, families have bike rides around the lake, and the wind attracts dozens of windsurfers to the place. It is a hot summer day in the green belt around Berlin, and it seems that only a few care who lived here, in the adjacent villa. What about the villa? Schmid-Rathjen thinks that nothing will happen at the moment. 'No one has come for 25 years and there is no reason for anyone to come now. It will be a waste of time and energy. It's a lost place.' Do you have another idea? 'As a historian, I would say that this place should be given for free to Israelis who came to live in Berlin, as a sign of solidarity. Let them turn it into a culture club, have techno parties, alongside exhibitions that explain about the history of this place.'

Unmasking genocide accusations: Israel and the Palestinians	Accusations of genocide against Israel are widely debated, but they lack evidence and distract from real issues; Hamas, not Israel, causes Palestinian suffering through violence and oppressive governance, while Israel aims to protect civilians The notion that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians has been a contentious topic for nearly 40 years. This accusation diverts attention from the core issues and undermines the gravity of actual genocides. It is crucial to understand that Hamas, rather than Israel, has engaged in actions that could be seen as genocidal by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians with the intent of inflicting maximum harm. Conversely, Israel's actions are framed as necessary for the protection of Palestinians from their leadership, which manipulates their suffering for political leverage. Historical context and accusations The term 'genocide' began to be used against Israel particularly since the First Intifada in 1987, and more prominently during the Second Intifada (2000-2005). Accusations from Palestinian leaders and supporters often include claims of colonization, ethnic cleansing and genocide. Legal definition of genocide The 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, including killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions of life to bring about physical destruction, imposing measures to prevent births and forcibly transferring children. Evaluating Israel's actions Killing members of the group: From 1987 to 2023, around 10,000 Palestinians lost their lives in the conflict (All sources cannot be verified). Since the 2023 war, casualties have risen to about 40,000 if we accept the numbers of casualties being released by Hamas which are most likely higher than in reality. Comparatively, many other conflicts with much higher civilian death tolls have not been labeled as genocide, including the Second Congo War with 5.4 million deaths, or the Iraq War with up to 500,000 deaths. Serious bodily or mental harm: There are instances of harm due to the harsh reality of war, but no substantial evidence shows intent to destroy the Palestinian people as a group. Conditions of life: Living conditions for Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank have significantly improved with a 1000% rise in GDP per capita in the past 40 years, with increases in household income far outpacing neighboring countries. In Gaza, however, conditions have stagnated or worsened under Hamas' rule. Therefore it is Hamas who is responsible for the bad conditions that Palestinians in Gaza face, while Palestinians in the West Bank and Israel enjoy a much higher standard of life. Preventing births: The Palestinian population has grown significantly, from 1.9 in 1987 to nearly 5 million in 2023, countering claims of measures intended to prevent births. Forcibly transferring children: While there are reports of detained Palestinian children, international law permits the detention of enemy combatants for questioning if done humanely. Other than that, there is no credible evidence that Israel is forcibly transferring Palestinian children. The current war in Gaza The current war, initiated by Hamas on October 7, 2023, with barbaric attacks on Israeli civilians, has resulted in significant casualties. Hamas' strategy of embedding military operations within civilian infrastructure exacerbates the situation, forcing Israel to target these areas, which is legal under international law. Israel has taken extensive measures to minimize civilian harm, including warnings and humanitarian aid. The evidence does not support the claim that Israel is committing genocide. Accusations against Israel serve more as strategic narratives than substantiated facts. Recognizing the true nature of these accusations is essential for understanding and resolving the conflict, respecting the term 'genocide,' and addressing the real contributors to the suffering of Palestinians. If anything, Hamas should be accused of committing genocide against the Palestinians.

Iran's Quds force chief suspected of ties to Israel, collapses in...	Esmail Qaani reported to be under investigation in Tehran, suffers a heart attack during questioning; was rumored to have been killed in an IDF strike targeting Nasrallah's replacement as Hezbollah chief The commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, Esmail Qaani is under investigation for ties to Israel, according to media reports and had suffered a heart attack during interrogations. 'He was investigated for an intelligence brief, a source told Sky News Arabic. 'He was moved to a hospital and his bureau chief is suspected of connections with Israel.' Senior Iranian security officials said Qaani, who replaced Qasem Soleimani, the legendary commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds force killed by the U.S. in 2020, disappeared after an Israeli strike last week that targeted Hezbollah's deputy chief and head of internal security Hashem Sefieddine who was designated to replace the slain Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israeli strike on the Dahieh last month. Contact with Sefieddine was also lost after the attack and he is believed to have been killed, although Israel has not confirmed it. A source told the Reuters news agency that Qaani was in Dahieh when the IDF attacked but did not attend the meeting with Nasrallah's designated replacement. Another source said the Quds force commander had traveled to Beirut after the assassination of Hezbollah's chief and was last seen on Sunday of last week when he visited Hezbollah's offices in Tehran and photographed there with Sefieddine's brother Abdullah. The New York Times reported that Qaani traveled to Lebanon to help Hezbollah regroup after Nasrallah's killing. A source in the IRGC in Beirut told the paper that the commander's disappearance and the silence from officials in Tehran were causing panic in the ranks. Rumors about his fate spread quickly and varied between him having died to him being kept in isolation after the assassinations carried out by Israel on prominent Iranian leaders. According to a report published in the Saudi Al Hadath channel Qaani had recently met with Nasrallah and Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's operations chief who was also assassinated by Israel The channel said he backed out of his original plan to attend the high-level Hezbollah meeting that was then targeted by the IDF and that led to increased suspicion.

Israel targets senior Hezbollah member in Beirut strike	Wafiq Safa is under U.S. sanctions for exploiting Lebanese ports, border crossings to facilitate Hezbollah terrorists’ travel; known as Beirut Airport strongman overseeing weapons arrival from Iran that is stored in great amounts at the airport IDF carried out two airstrikes on central Beirut on Thursday, targeting areas outside Hezbollah's stronghold the Dahieh, for the third time in the war. According to some reports, the attacks were an attempt to assassinate Hezbollah's Liaison and Coordination Unit head Wafiq Safa, a close ally of slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah who was killed in an Israeli attack last month. Lebanese health officials said 18 people were killed and 92 injured in the strikes. Safa's fate was unknown, security sources told Sky News Arabic while other sources said he survived the attempt on his life. According to the U.S. Treasury Department's website, Safa exploits Lebanese ports and border crossings to facilitate Hezbollah terrorists’ travel. The site adds that, together with senior Hezbollah member Mohammad Raad, Safa was involved in attempting to secure foreign citizenships for 100 Hezbollah operatives who were to be sent on 'long missions' in Western or Arab countries. Safa is a well-known figure in Beirut and his position in Hezbollah gave him incredible power. He was known as the man who was actually in charge of Beirut's Rafic Al Hariri International Airport, the main gateway into Lebanon. An airport employee told the newspaper Safa maintained close ties with customs control. 'Wafiq Safa is always showing up at customs,' one whistleblower claimed, citing close relationships with the customs managers. 'I feel like if we don’t do what they say, our families will be in danger.' According to an investigative report in the UK's Telegraph newspaper last June, Hezbollah was hiding a significant weapons stockpile at the airport. Officials there said the terror group receives weapons on flights from Iran that are then stored. According to the same sources, Hezbollah stores huge amounts of Iranian weapons, missiles and explosives inside the civilian airport. 'This is extremely serious, mysterious large boxes arriving on direct flights from Iran are a sign that things got worse. When they started to come through the airport, my friends and I were scared because we knew that there was something strange going on,' one source at the airport said. The paper reported that a Lebanese official rejected the claims and Transport Minister Ali Hamie called the information incorrect. He has invited media and ambassadors to visit the airport to see for themselves. Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he would be suing the publication. As a member of Nasrallah's close circle, Safa was part of the negotiation committee Hezbollah established in 2000 during the kidnapping of three IDF soldiers on Mount Dov – Benyamin Avraham, Adi Avitan, and Omar Sawaid. The three bodies were returned to Israel in 2004 in a prisoner exchange deal. He also participated in negotiations for the return of soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, who were kidnapped by the terror group shortly before the Second Lebanon War in 2006.

IDF says three soldiers dead in Gaza explosion	Military says Major Netanel Hershkovitz, Master Sergeant Ori Moshe Borenstein and Master Sergeant Matityahu Marantz Tzvi were killed when their vehicle drove over an IED in Jabaliya The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Thursday that three IDF soldiers were killed in fighting in Gaza’s Jabaliya after their vehicle drove over a planted explosive in the area set by terrorists. They are: Major (res.) Netanel Hershkovitz, 37, from Jerusalem, a Deputy Company Commander in the Logistical Support Unit of the 5460th Unit, 460th Brigade, Master (res.) Sergeant Ori Moshe Borenstein, 32, from Moreshet, an Achzarit APC Commander in the Logistical Support Unit of the 5460th Unit, 460th Brigade and Master Sergeant (res.) Matityahu Marantz Tzvi, 32, from Bnei Adam, a Squad Commander in the Logistical Support Unit of the 5460th Unit, 460th Brigade. Tal Marantz, the wife of Matityahu Tzvi Marantz, shared a photo of her husband on her Instagram account, writing, 'My Tzvi, my heart, the man of my life has been killed.' Tzvi is survived by his wife, Tal, and their three children Omer, Ofir and Naia, who was born after her father had already been called for reserves and will celebrate her first birthday at the end of the month. Hershkovitz’s friend mourned his loss, saying, 'A few months ago, you teased me when you were the convoy commander leading me into Gaza. You joked, and rightfully so, because I delayed the convoy since I forgot my helmet at home. You led me and hundreds of convoys inside safely and now you’re no longer here. You leave behind a heartbroken family, community, friends, and fellow soldiers. May your memory be a blessing.' The Ma’oz pre-military academy in Lod, where Borenstein studied, paid tribute to him, writing, 'Uri sacrificed his life for the people of Israel and the State of Israel, for the nation’s victory. He was killed in sanctification of God's name on the eve of Yom Kippur, the day of purification for Israel, a day when all of Israel stands united as one.' Borenstein’s friends said he always made sure to bring joy to others and look after everyone, noting his rare generosity. 'He was loved by everyone,' they said. Uri Hananya, Borenstein’s close friend, described him as 'incredibly witty, funny and outgoing. He would dance for the bride and groom at every wedding, do breakdancing and bring them joy. He the salt of the earth. A talented guy. He was called for extended reserve duty since October 7 and it was very important to him to contribute and help.' 'The city of Lod mourns the death of reservist Ori Borenstein, may his memory be a blessing, a resident of the city who was killed today in Gaza,' Lod Mayor Yair Revivo said.

US concerned, Italy, France outraged over UNIFIL under IDF fire	UN forces positioned in southern Lebanon claim IDF tank fired at their position injuring at least two; US, European countries call incident 'war crime' The United States voiced deep concern about reports that Israeli forces fired on UN peacekeepers' positions in southern Lebanon and was pressing Israel for details, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said on Thursday. 'We understand Israel is conducting targeted operations near the Blue Line to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure that could be used to threaten Israeli citizens,' the spokesperson said. 'While they undertake these operations, it is critical that they not threaten UN peacekeeper' safety and security.' Italy lodged its protest after the report that shots were fired, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said. An emergency meeting will be held at the UN Security Council later on Thursday following the incident. Firing on UNIFIL bases was 'totally unacceptable' and clearly flouts international law, Crosetto added in a statement. Italy has summoned Israel's ambassador to the country, Jonathan Peled, to Rome following the incident. Israeli forces fired on two positions used by UN peacekeepers in Lebanon on Thursday and at a third one on Wednesday, the UN force said, injuring two of its peacekeepers. France also commented on the incident and said it was waiting for explanations from Israel after UN peacekeeping troops were targeted in Lebanon and that it was an obligation to ensure their safety. 'France expresses its deep concern following the Israeli shots that hit the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and condemns any attack on the security of UNIFIL,' the foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that none of its 700 troops in the mission had been wounded. Israel on its part is focused on fighting Hezbollah and recommends that the United Nations peacekeeping force (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon move north, Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon said on Thursday shortly after the incident was first reported. 'Our recommendation is that UNIFIL relocate 5 km (3 miles) north to avoid danger as fighting intensifies and while the situation along the Blue Line remains volatile as a result of Hezbollah's aggression,' Danon said in a statement. He said that 'Israel has no desire to be in Lebanon, but it will do what is necessary' to force Hezbollah away from its northern border so 70,000 residents can return to their homes in northern Israel. On Monday the IDF asked the UNIFIL forces to move out of the fighting area for their safety but was rejected. 'There is an obligation on Israel and Hezbollah to respect the role of UN peacekeepers and their mandate, and do nothing that would put peacekeepers and our troops in particular in harm’s way,' Irish President Michael Higgins, whose troops are part of the UNIFIL deployment, said.

Every house is a terror base, IDF says of South Lebanon village	Hezbollah's elite Radwar force planned an invasion of northern Israel carried out by thousands of terrorists breaching the border in six points to overrun bases and communities; terrorists embedded in villages, their equipment stored, waiting for the order to attack IDF troops operating in South Lebanon found Hezbollah's preparation for an invasion into Israel, the military spokesperson said on Thursday. Every house here was a base for terror, Daniel Hagari said in a video filmed inside a Shi'ite village near the Lebanon border with Israel. Hagari said Hezbollah's Radwan forces were embedded in the village, appearing as regular villagers while their military equipment, including rifles, grenades and more, were stored in the houses waiting for the order to be given to launch the assault. 'It would have been bigger than the one on October 7,' Hagari said. The forces are going from house to house and uncovering stores of rockets and other munitions. Hezbollah's elite Radwan force was to number 4,000 to 6,000 men in six brigades and 16 battalions that were to breach the border at the same time through six points, and overrun military bases and communities on the Israeli side. According to the military, the terrorists would arrive from elsewhere in Lebanon, mostly the Bekaa Valley, where Hezbollah has bases, to live in the villages where they walked in civilian clothes, pretending to be innocent residents, while they awaiting the order. According to their plan, named Conquering the Galilee, when the world was given, they were to emerge with their weapons and attack. The terrain around the villages which is dense with vegetation was full of dugouts and rocket and missile launchers, that would provide cover for the assaulting force. Israeli forces were working to clear the area that overlooks the Israeli border communities, from the Hezbollah terrorists and to destroy their capabilities to launch attacks, thereby enabling residents of Israel's north to return safely to their homes.

Jeremy Loffredo faces Israeli court after reporting Iranian missiles striking several Israeli air bases; U.S. fears possible diplomatic incident following reporter's actions Jeremy Loffredo, 28, an independent American journalist who also works with Fox News, was arrested by police on suspicion of endangering national security after reporting on where missiles landed in the attack launched by Iran earlier this month including in the IDF's Nevatim Air Base and an intelligence base in central Israel. In his report, Loffredo said that attacks on Gaza were launched from the Nevatim base and said that government's private jet used by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was located there. The charges against him include aiding the enemy during wartime and providing information to the enemy. His arrest has raised concerns of a potential diplomatic incident between Israel and the U.S. because of his status as a foreign journalist. Representatives from the U.S. Embassy attended the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court for a hearing on the request of the police to extend his detention. 'He published the information openly and fully, without attempting to hide anything. If this information constitutes aiding the enemy, many other journalists in Israel, including Israeli reporters, should also be arrested, said Attorney Leah Tsemel who is representing him in his defense. 'A spy would not have acted so publicly and transparently.'

Hamas tries to prevent civilians fleeing danger in northern Gaza	As troops urge Gazans to leave, many remain fearing travel through areas under IDF control and after threats from Hamas that seeks to use them as human shields while forces hunt them down The Hamas terror group has been preventing civilians from leaving areas under IDF attack and sheltering in humanitarian zones. The military has been urging civilians to leave ahead of an operation targeting Hamas terrorists. Some 200,000 people managed to leave, according to the military but many civilians remain. Troops began going door to door, interrogating the men and asking the women and children to leave for an UNRWA school where they would be safe. Some said they were afraid to move through areas under IDF control and others said Hamas terrorists were threatening them and demanding that they stay. The Hamas interior ministry also called on civilians to remain where they were, making them human shields for the terrorists. Hamas health officials said the IDF demanded that hospitals in the area, evacuate. They said the Kamal Adwan hospital was surrounded and that the forces were shooting at the administration offices. Hamas also claimed there was a siege on northern Gaza and that basic supplies were not allowed in. An Israeli security official said the Palestinians in northern Gaza are again experiencing fear of attack while Hamas attempts to assert its governing control of the area. On Thursday, the IDF said it destroyed a Hamas command center inside what had been a medical facility, killing 12 terrorists. the military identified three of the dead as terrorists who participated in the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7 last year.

Gulf states urge US to stop Israel from bombing Iran's oil sites	Countries fear Tehran's possible retaliation against them should the conflict escalate after Iran wans them against allowing Israeli aircraft or missiles in their airspace Gulf states are lobbying Washington to stop Israel from attacking Iran's oil sites because they are concerned their own oil facilities could come under fire from Tehran's proxies if the conflict escalates, three Gulf sources said. As part of their attempts to avoid being caught in the crossfire, Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are also refusing to let Israel fly over their airspace for any attack on Iran and have conveyed this to Washington, the three sources close to government circles said. Israel has promised Iran will pay for its missile attack last week while Tehran has said any retaliation would be met with vast destruction, raising fears of a wider war in the region that could suck in the United States. The moves by the Gulf states come after a diplomatic push by non-Arab Shi'ite Iran to persuade its Sunni Gulf neighbors to use their influence with Washington amid rising concerns Israel could target Iran's oil production facilities. During meetings this week, Iran warned Saudi Arabia it could not guarantee the safety of the Gulf kingdom's oil facilities if Israel were given any assistance in carrying out an attack, a senior Iranian official and an Iranian diplomat said. Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst close to the Saudi royal court, said: 'The Iranians have stated: 'If the Gulf states open up their airspace to Israel, that would be an act of war'.' The diplomat said Tehran had sent a clear message to Riyadh that its allies in countries such as Iraq or Yemen might respond if there was any regional support for Israel against Iran. A potential Israeli strike was the focus of talks on Wednesday between Saudi de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, who was on a Gulf tour to rally support, Gulf and Iranian sources said. The Iranian minister's visit, along with Saudi-American communications at the defense ministry level, are part of a coordinated effort to address the crisis, a Gulf source close to government circles said. A person in Washington familiar with the discussions confirmed that Gulf officials had been in touch with U.S. counterparts to express concern about the potential scope of Israel's expected retaliation. The White House declined to comment when asked whether Gulf governments had asked Washington to ensure Israel's response was measured. U.S. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Wednesday about the Israeli retaliation in a call both sides described as positive. Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy U.S. national intelligence officer on the Middle East and now at the Atlantic Council think-tank in Washington said: 'Gulf states' anxiety is likely to be a key talking point with Israeli counterparts in trying to convince Israel to undertake a carefully calibrated response.' Oil at risk? The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, which is de-facto led by Saudi Arabia, has enough spare oil capacity to make up for any loss of Iranian supply if an Israeli retaliation knocked out some of the country's facilities. But much of that spare capacity is in the Gulf region so if oil facilities in Saudi Arabia or the UAE, for example, were targeted too, the world could face an oil supply problem. Saudi Arabia has been wary of an Iranian strike on its oil plants since a 2019 attack on its Aramco oilfield shut down over 5% of global oil supply. Iran denied involvement. Riyadh has had a rapprochement with Tehran in recent years, but trust remains an issue. Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE all host U.S. military facilities or troops. Concerns over oil facilities and the potential for a wider regional conflict were also central to talks between Emirati officials and their U.S. counterparts, said another Gulf source. In 2022, the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen fired missiles and drones at oil refueling trucks near an oil refinery owned by UAE's state oil firm ADNOC and claimed the attack. 'The Gulf states aren't letting Israel use their airspace. They won't allow Israeli missiles to pass through, and there's also a hope that they won't strike the oil facilities,' the Gulf source said. The three Gulf sources emphasized that Israel could route strikes through Jordan or Iraq, but using Saudi, UAE, or Qatari airspace was off the table and strategically unnecessary. Analysts also pointed out that Israel has other options, including mid-air refueling capabilities that would enable its jets to fly down the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean, proceed to the Gulf and then fly back. 'Middle of a missile war' According to two senior Israeli officials, Israel is going to calibrate its response and, as of Wednesday, it had not yet decided whether it would strike Iran's oilfields. The option was one of a number presented by the defense establishment to Israeli leaders, according to the officials. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday: 'Our strike will be lethal, precise, and above all - surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened. They will see the results.' The three Gulf sources stated that Saudi Arabia, as a leading oil exporter along with oil-producing neighbors - the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain - had a keen interest in de-escalating the situation. 'We will be in the middle of a missile war. There is serious concern, especially if the Israeli strike targets Iran's oil installations,' a second Gulf source said. The three Gulf sources said an Israeli strike on Iran's oil infrastructure would have a global impact, particularly for China - Iran's top oil customer - as well as for Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election in which she is running against Donald Trump. 'If oil prices surge to $120 per barrel, it would harm both the U.S. economy and Harris' chances in the election. So they (Americans) won't allow the oil war to expand,' the first Gulf source said. Gulf sources said safeguarding all oil installations remained a challenge, despite having advanced missile and Patriot defense systems, so the primary approach remained diplomatic: signaling to Iran that Gulf states pose no threat. Bernard Haykel, professor of Near East Studies at Princeton University, noted that Riyadh was vulnerable 'because the Iranians can swarm those installations given the short distance from the mainland'.

Child hostage forced to watch violent murder, while captive	Eitan Yahalomi tells influential TikTok star about his captivity in Gaza: 'people on the streets beat me when I entered Gaza, now I don't sleep much, I've already been through the worst' 'When I got to Gaza, I saw many people. They were waiting for me, civilians also beat me,' said released hostage Eitan Yahalomi, 13, who was returned to Israel in November's hostage deal. His father Ohad is still held in captivity along with 100 others. In a discussion with the international TikTok star Montana Tucker, Yahalomi recalled the moments of terror he experienced on the morning of the October 7 massacre and in captivity. 'We started hearing gunshots and shouting in Arabic. I was a little scared. They (the terrorists) showed me videos in which they kill people. They were happy. I couldn't look away, because they didn't let me. I also saw things and it's in constantly in my mind.' Yahalomi said that he ate one pita and one cucumber daily. Even today, he still has trouble sleeping: 'Now I don't sleep much, as if I've been through the worst and that's it.' The film 'The Children of October 7' produced by Kastina Communications will echo the atrocities committed by Hamas and will be published in the next few weeks. While 13-year-old Eitan reminds us of the dire situation in captivity, some of the hostages' families express their frustration that the country has shifted its focus to the northern front. According to the Bibas family's relatives, the issue was pushed aside following the escalation in the northern front and the possible confrontation with Iran. In an interview with Ynet, Eilon Keshet, the cousin of Yarden Bibas', who celebrated his 35th birthday in captivity this week, becoming the first hostage to celebrate a second birthday in captivity in Gaza. 'Since Lebanon, the whole subject of the hostages has been pushed aside.' He said that 'it's easier to carry on in life. The hostages don't have time. They either died or were murdered in captivity.'

Humanitarian pauses have been agreed to allow a second round of polio vaccinations targeting 590,000 children under the age of 10 to start in the Gaza Strip on October 14, the head of the UN children's agency UNICEF said on Thursday. 'Area-specific humanitarian pauses have been agreed. It is critical that these pauses are respected by all parties. Without them, it is impossible to vaccinate the children,' UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjanrwryyl	2024-10-10T08:10:41-07:00	
UN inquiry accuses Israel of crime of 'extermination' in destruct...	International body's human rights says Israel commits war crimes, crimes against humanity and 3extermination; report to be submitted to the General Assembly at the end of October A United Nations inquiry said on Thursday it found that Israel carried out a concerted policy of destroying Gaza's healthcare system in the Gaza war, actions amounting to both war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination. A statement by ex-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay released ahead of a full report accused Israel of 'relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities' in the war, triggered by Hamas terrorists' deadly cross-border attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. 'Children in particular have borne the brunt of these attacks, suffering both directly and indirectly from the collapse of the health system,' said Pillay, whose report will be presented to the UN General Assembly on October 30. Israel says that Gaza's terrorists operate from the cover of built-up populated areas including private homes, schools and hospitals and that it will strike them wherever they emerge, while also trying to avoid harming civilians. Hamas denies hiding terrorists, weapons and command posts among civilians. The UN inquiry's statement also accused Israeli forces of deliberately killing and torturing medical personnel, targeting medical vehicles and restricting permits for patients to leave the Gaza Strip. As an example, it cited the death of a Palestinian girl, Hind Rajab, in February along with family members and two medics who came to rescue her from under Israeli fire. The World Health Organization says over 10,000 patients requiring urgent medical evacuation have been prevented from leaving Gaza since the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was shut in May. The Palestinian health ministry says nearly 1,000 medics have been killed in Gaza in the past year in what the WHO called 'an irreplaceable loss and a massive blow to the health system'. The statement said the treatment of both Palestinian detainees in Israel and hostages seized by Hamas terrorists in the October 7 attack had been investigated and it accused both sides of involvement in torture and sexual violence. The Commission of Inquiry has a broad mandate to collect evidence and identify suspected perpetrators of international crimes committed in Israel and the Palestinian territories. It bases its findings on a range of sources including interviews with victims and witnesses, submissions and satellite imagery. The COI has previously alleged that both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes in the early stages of the Gaza war, and that Israel's actions also constituted crimes against humanity because of the immense civilian losses. The term is reserved for the most serious international crimes knowingly committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against civilians. Israel has not cooperated with the inquiry, which it says has an anti-Israel bias. The COI has accused Israel of obstructing its work and preventing investigators from accessing both Israel and the Palestinian territories. Sometimes, the evidence gathered by such UN-mandated bodies has formed the basis for war crimes prosecutions and could be drawn on by the International Criminal Court.

Israel dropped the ball on messaging Hamas atrocities to the worl...	On a visit to Israel Elon Musk said would post a video of clips showing the atrocities committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 and collected by the IDF but no one bothered to deliver it to him, missing the opportunity to reach mass exposure while officials trade blame At the end of November, Elon Musk visited Israel. He toured the Kibbutz Kfar Aza with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and was deeply shaken by the testimonies describing the October 7 massacre. He was also shown a video of clips most from Hamas's own cameras, collected by the IDF. Netanyahu offered Musk the option to share a version of the video on his X account, which has over 200 million followers. Musk agreed but the film was never delivered to him. The matter 'fell through the cracks,' officials said, claiming judicial restrictions over the need for the approvals of the families of victims, and those were not obtained. Thus Israel missed an opportunity to share the video with a massive global audience—an effort that could have shifted the tide in Israel’s public diplomacy, which many feel has been lacking. A senior official involved in the campaign called Musk’s agreement a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' to share the harrowing footage with the world. 'However, legal and military officials prevented the video’s release, insisting that permission from all the victims' families was required, which was impossible to obtain,' the official said. Another official from one of the state's communication bodies stated: 'The IDF Spokesperson created an incredible product, a historic feat in public diplomacy. Yet fewer than 10,000 people worldwide have seen it. There was a strategy to create a sense of ‘FOMO,’ where only a select few would view it, prompting curiosity and conversation. On the other hand, everyone involved in national advocacy and the Foreign Ministry wanted to distribute it globally.' He added that legal limitations regarding the families of victims shown in the video blocked its dissemination, saying, 'It seemed like an odd excuse. We even suggested removing sensitive segments and shortening the video to 25 minutes from 47, but that wasn’t accepted either.' 'Many believe this was a huge missed opportunity,' the official continued. 'The video should have been screened in Times Square and broadcast on networks worldwide. Instead, it was said that legal officials were preventing its release. While nowadays they deny it, everyone knows lawyers behind the scenes blocked it. This is an incredibly powerful tool, and anyone who saw it was deeply disturbed.' The source also revealed that there were further attempts to release a shortened version of the video to international media, but outlets refused to broadcast it after learning it wasn’t the original IDF video, as they didn’t want to rely on leaked material—they insisted on the official version. 'Instead of a global screening week, it was handled like a Rolex launch' 'We were tearing our hair out in frustration. Everything moved at a snail’s pace. No one had the courage to take responsibility, and the issue kept being passed to lawyers, who vetoed it,' said another official involved in the behind-the-scenes efforts to distribute the video. 'The prime minister wanted the video distributed, but neither he nor his team followed through. Rather than securing 1,000 theaters worldwide for free screenings, they opted for small, exclusive events, as if it were a luxury item for collectors.' An Israeli citizen living in the U.S., who was active in Israel's advocacy efforts, expressed his frustration with the government's strategy. 'Israel’s biggest mistake was focusing on the stories of hostages instead of the atrocities of October 7. At any given time, there are 300 Americans held hostage worldwide, and as sad as it is to say, it doesn’t capture public interest.' He added that closed screenings of the video achieved nothing. 'There were internal power struggles between the Foreign Ministry and the IDF Spokesperson's Unit over who would be involved in the screenings. It was obvious that a 47-minute film couldn’t be broadcast internationally. They needed short, 30-second clips and to run them globally.' The same Israeli claimed that Israel’s Attorney General, Gali Baharav-Miara, blocked the video’s release. 'She and her team deny it, but they were responsible for halting the distribution. The main reason was their fear of dealing with the issue. Sadly, everyone involved wasn’t truly looking out for Israel’s interests—they just didn’t want to get in trouble.' Thanks to private donations, underground websites have since released videos containing much of the footage from the IDF video, with one clip reaching 20 million views. Officials working on the issue believe it’s not too late to release the full video. 'It’s still possible,' they said. 'Faces can be blurred for families that object. The country’s interest now is to distribute the video, even a year later.'

Thieves tied to polls in deserted Dahieh	Where was once a Hezbollah HQ, no desolate ruins where petty thieves try to loot homes; Hezbollah, aiming to assert themselves in the area, posted their picture on social media In Beirut's Dahieh district, once a Hezbollah stronghold, the Lebanese Shiite militant group displayed a formidable presence and tight control. It was here that Hezbollah concealed armaments and established key command centers, believing the area to be a safe haven. However, recent weeks have seen intensified Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) strikes, transforming Dahieh from a significant bastion into a battlefield. Initially, during the early months of the conflict, strikes on Dahieh were rare and typically reserved for high-profile targets. Yet, in the past month and a half, the IDF has launched almost daily attacks, often multiple times a day. IDF has long regarded Dahieh as a central hub of Hezbollah's terrorist activities. A military spokesperson said that 'this is where Hezbollah makes its decisions and produces and hides its strategic weapons—inside and beneath civilian structures in Dahieh.' Amid the extensive attacks and the residents' growing realization that the intensity would only increase, many are fleeing Dahieh, moving northward to areas not yet reached by IDF strikes. For some, this marks their second or even third displacement. Families who initially evacuated from border villages in southern Lebanon sought refuge in areas then deemed safer, such as Tyre, Sidon, Nabatieh, and Dahieh in Beirut. However, as the conflict progressed, these regions too became unsafe, prompting families to move northward again. The situation is even more complex for most of the displaced from Dahieh. The district's population is predominantly Shiite, and not all regions in Lebanon are willing to accept them because of the perceived risk associated with their support for Hezbollah. Recently, videos from Tripoli in northern Lebanon showed residents removing stickers with images of Nasrallah and Hezbollah activists from the cars of displaced people. The growing intensity of the strikes has led to the killing of high-ranking officials, bringing the 'Dahieh Doctrine' back into focus. In recent weeks, top Hezbollah leaders, including Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, have been targeted in Dahieh. Many were killed while hiding beneath civilian complexes. Israeli forces also destroyed large weapons caches, including advanced precision surface-to-sea missiles, also hidden in the area. It appears that if Hezbollah leaders had anticipated immediate danger, they would have fled promptly. However, the results of the strikes suggest that Hezbollah underestimated Israel's intelligence penetration into its ranks, unlike during the Second Lebanon War in 2006. The intensified strikes in Lebanon raise another issue first presented after the Second Lebanon War: Is this new phase of combat indicative of implementing the 'Dahieh Doctrine,' introduced in 2008 by then commander of the northern front and now lawmaker Gadi Eizenkot? This doctrine involves disproportionate use of aerial and artillery fire against civilian infrastructures used by terrorist organizations, primarily Hezbollah. 'Each of the Shiite villages is a military site. Dozens of rockets are stored in basements and attics. Dozens of local activists and fighters from outside are prepared for defense battles and missile fire toward Israel,' Eizenkot said at the time. 'We know Hezbollah will fire much more broadly than in the last war, and we will respond accordingly. Any village from which fire is directed at Israel will be subjected to disproportionate force, causing massive destruction.' And in recent days, 16 years after Eizenkot's remarks, it seems this is being implemented. Images and videos from southern Lebanon's villages in recent times, and occasionally even from specific areas in Dahieh, indicate unprecedented destruction in the streets. The villages, under fire for months, have emptied of residents, with those who didn't leave at the war's outset deciding to evacuate in recent weeks as the attacks intensified. That said, ever since the Second Lebanon War, IDF's intelligence and offensive capabilities have developed, allowing for much more focused operations. Even the attacks in Dahieh, though intense, are target-oriented and purposeful. 'In 2006, IDF essentially had no targets. Our capabilities against Hezbollah were relatively limited, and the fact is we didn't eliminate any of their commanders. Certainly not a leader or senior commander,' said Professor Eyal Zisser, an expert in the modern history of Lebanon and Syria and vice-rector at Tel Aviv University. 'The attacks were more about locations, assets, not something precise. We didn't know where their weapons were; it was very unfocused and imprecise. The result was also significant environmental destruction.' 'Today, first of all, after Gaza, we're more cautious, and secondly, we have good intelligence, so we're more focused,' he added. 'There's destruction, and people have fled, but I wouldn't compare the scale of the destruction. We also see that the IDF spokesperson's announcements are about very focused things. It's not about systematic and widespread destruction of Dahieh. There is destruction, but I wouldn't say it's like 2006. Maybe we'll get there. Israel is trying and can, thanks to quality intelligence, be more focused.' Professor Zisser noted that for Hezbollah, this isn't a different war from 2006. 'It's not a different war in the sense that they continue to fire. There are aspects of our ability to hit their assets and commanders, that's true, but essentially they are firing at Haifa like in 2006,' he said. A ghost town where thieves are brutally punished Orna Mizrahi, former Deputy Head of Israel's National Security Council and now a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, suggests that we may not fully understand the intentions for Dahieh until the war concludes. 'The current situation involves numerous targeted strikes, with reports of about seven attacks per day, each hitting multiple buildings and causing significant damage,' she explained. 'While it’s uncertain if Dahieh will face total destruction, similar circumstances might unfold. The IDF's operations today are very focused, often employing bunker-penetrating bombs,' Mizrahi said. 'Dahieh likely has an underground network, making comparisons to 2006 challenging. We are still in the early stages.' Contrary to the 'Dahieh Doctrine,' which involves 'using disproportionate force and causing massive destruction,' Mizrahi believes the current strikes aim not to obliterate the area. 'The strikes are currently precise, targeting assassinations, warehouses, ammunition stockpiles, and industrial facilities,' she explained. Commenting on the chaos in Dahieh, she added, 'Many residents have left. A Lebanese journalist described it as a ghost town. Previously, Hezbollah maintained strict control, deterring thieves and criminals, which provided a sense of security. Now, those returning to check on their property after evacuating have found they were robbed. It has become a lawless zone,' Mizrahi said. Recent images and videos from Dahieh show thieves caught looting abandoned homes. They were hanged or tied to poles, injured and bleeding. Social media posts claim Hezbollah is responsible for these severe punishments, highlighting the breakdown in governance and the prevailing chaos in Dahieh. One user who shared images of the thieves wrote, 'Soon, the same fate will come to the collaborators from within.' The strategic position in Dahieh - and why Hezbollah leaders stay Dahieh, once home to agricultural villages near Beirut, saw a population surge in the 1950s from southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley due to poverty and employment needs. These villages expanded into suburbs, becoming part of Beirut. 'Dahieh is a suburb that began as villages outside Beirut, which merged to become part of the city,' Mizrahi explained. 'Interestingly, Lebanon's main airport, Rafic Hariri Airport, is located in this neighborhood, adjacent to Dahieh, allowing Hezbollah to control what happens there.' Recently, there were proposals in Lebanon to establish another airport, but Hezbollah strongly opposed this. 'Hezbollah wanted everyone to continue using Rafic Hariri Airport to prevent it from being seen solely as a Hezbollah stronghold,' she explained. 'As long as all Lebanese use it because it’s the only airport, it remains general Lebanese infrastructure rather than a Hezbollah target.' Nasrallah was killed there, alongside other key figures like Saleh al-Arouri and Fuad Shukr. Reports indicate that senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine, marked as Nasrallah's successor, was also confirmed dead in Dahieh. Residents of the district reacted strongly to Nasrallah's assassination, with hundreds spontaneously protesting in Dahieh's streets. Reports from Al Arabi and Asharq Al-Awsat describe Lebanese citizens crying and collapsing, and a sense of confusion prevailing after the assassination. Despite these high-profile eliminations, none of the senior figures have fled Dahieh. The simple reason is they have nowhere else to go. Professor Zisser explained, 'They can't move to a Christian neighborhood as they would be reported immediately, so they stay with the Shiites. Their plans didn't work out well,' he added. 'They prepared for a different kind of war, expecting it to be more limited and less intense, thinking we wouldn't attack Dahieh and they wouldn't fire on Tel Aviv.' Mizrahi also believes that 'their options are likely limited.' She stated, 'The main issue is they haven't realized the extent of their exposure to Israeli intelligence. They don't understand how infiltrated they are, so they continue to believe they can hide. The fact they haven't convened to appoint Hashem Safi al-Din as secretary-general isn't coincidental. Perhaps they feared such a gathering.' 'In addition, it seems he feared that once appointed, he would become a target, but he didn’t realize that even as a candidate, he’s a target,' Mizrahi said. 'There are probably places they believe to be safe. It’s a vast area. They still need to hold meetings and gather somewhere. Besides, where else could they go besides leaving Lebanon? Dahieh is the center, the headquarters, everything.' Hezbollah is down, but not out The psychological blow to Hezbollah in recent weeks is substantial. The organization is confused, as seen in its recent activities, but it remains operational. 'There's no doubt they've suffered a setback, but they continue to function. They keep firing. It's a large organization. You've cut off the strategic head, but those firing at Kiryat Shmona continue,' said Professor Zisser. Mizrahi added, 'The current war has achieved remarkable gains. The intelligence penetration, developed over the years, combined with the Air Force's operational capability to conduct precision strikes with bunker-penetrating bombs, allows for much more accurate attacks.' She noted, 'Attention should also be paid to the relatively limited collateral damage. The major concern I recall from this war was about the extent of collateral damage. Overall, it is relatively limited because the strikes are precise.' Recently, the issue of Nasrallah's burial has also arisen, with a Hezbollah source claiming last week that he was secretly buried in a temporary location. However, according to Mizrahi, the reason no funeral has been held yet is that they are 'afraid to conduct it.' She added, 'There were discussions about whether he might be buried in Lebanon or not. There is also uncertainty about how he was killed, whether from the strike or gas at the site. It was also said he was temporarily buried, intending that when times change, he will be properly interred. There’s a lot of confusion around Nasrallah's burial, also out of fear that Israel could use it as an opportunity to attack.'

F-35A fighter jets and B-52 bombers will be among some 60 aircraft from 13 nations taking part in the Steadfast Noon exercise, hosted by Belgium and The Netherlands, NATO officials said. 'In an uncertain world it is vital that we test our defence and that we strengthen our defence so that our adversaries know that NATO is ready, and is able to respond to any threat,' Rutte said in London following meetings with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The exercise does not use any live weapons. But some 2,000 military personnel taking part in the drills will simulate missions in which warplanes carry U.S. nuclear warheads, officials said. Putin has repeatedly warned the West of potential nuclear consequences since Russia' s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. NATO officials stressed its exercise was not a response to any recent declarations from Moscow and that the drills had taken place annually for more than a decade. 'We don't â€¦ adjust constantly according to whatever is being said or not said on any given day,' said Angus Lapsley, NATOâ€™s assistant secretary general for defence policy and planning.

The spokesperson also reiterated Britain's view that Ukraine has the right, in certain circumstances, to strike targets inside Russian territory, but said that Britain's stance on the use of its long-range Storm Shadow missiles was unchanged. 'We obviously want to put Ukraine in the strongest position. But no war has ever been won by a single weapon. And on Storm Shadow specifically, there has been no change to the UK government's position on the use of long-range missiles,' the spokesperson said. Zelensky also met NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in London. Asked about long-range weapons, Rutte told reporters: 'We discussed it today, but in the end it is up to the individual allies.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hygylsryye	2024-10-10T04:52:39-07:00

South Korean author Han Kang won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature for 'her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life', the award-giving body said on Thursday. The prize is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million). 'She has a unique awareness of the connections between body and soul, the living and the dead, and in her poetic and experimental style has become an innovator in contemporary prose,' Anders Olsson, chairman of the academy's Nobel Committee, said in a statement. Han Kang is the first South Korean to win the literature prize. Born in 1970, she comes from a literary background, her father being a well-regarded novelist. Han Kang won the Man Booker International Prize for fiction for her novel 'The Vegetarian' in 2016, the first of her novels to be translated into English and regarded as her major international breakthrough.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylyjbsyjx	2024-10-10T04:48:53-07:00	
5 Arab-Israelis from Tayibe planned to blow up Azrieli tower in T...	The terror cell affiliated with ISIS planned to detonate a car bomb at the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv, an investigation found; During their interrogation, terror cell members revealed that they had watched videos of bombings in Syria and discussed the amount of explosives needed Five residents of the Arab-Israeli city of Tayibe were arrested on suspicion of forming a terror cell affiliated with ISIS, with plans that included bombing a car in the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv, police and the Shin Bet revealed Thursday. Indictments are expected to be filed against them in the coming days. Footage of their arrests was also released. The suspects were apprehended by the Gidonim Unit of Lahav 433, which handles serious national and international crimes, and various weapons were found in their possession. During interrogation, it was uncovered that they had watched online videos of bombings in Syria and discussed the amount of explosives needed to bring down the Azrieli Towers. The first arrests included the cell's leaders, Mahmoud Azzam and Ibrahim Sheikh Youssef. As the investigation progressed, it was revealed that they had connections with ISIS operatives and recruited three additional Tayibe residents – Sajed Masarwa, Abdullah Baransi, and Abed al-Karim Baransi – to advance their terror plans in Israel. Israel Police and Shin Bet officials emphasized that this was a particularly dangerous and unusual organization of Israeli citizens, who conspired to carry out severe security offenses against the State of Israel and its citizens in the name of ISIS ideology. The terror infrastructure was uncovered and thwarted in the early stages of its execution thanks to precise and effective intelligence work, according to the police and Shin Bet. 'This is a serious security case, and thanks to a coordinated and professional investigation by the police and Shin Bet, we prevented a major disaster and saved lives,' Central District Police Commander, Chief Superintendent Yair Hatzroni, said. 'We will continue to act within our legal authority to preemptively foil any intentions to harm the security of the State of Israel and its citizens.'

Police apprehended the suspected shooter targeted a Elbit Systems subsidiary branch in Sweden, no casualties reported in the incident Amid recurring terrorist activity against Israel and Jews in Sweden, Swedish police said on Thursday they were investigating a shooting near an Israeli target in the city of Gothenburg, which the national broadcaster said was a unit of Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems. There were no reports of injuries, police said in a statement. An underage suspect was apprehended at the scene and a preliminary investigation into suspected attempted murder and serious weapons crime has been initiated, police added. The police have also sent several patrols and a helicopter to the scene. In early June, police said they had found a 'suspected explosive object' outside the offices of the defense export firm, known for its unmanned aerial systems. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war in October 2023, there have been several incidents targeting Israeli assets and personnel in Sweden. In January, police found a grenade on the grounds of the Israeli embassy compound, which the ambassador said was an attempted attack. In mid-May, gunshots were fired outside the Israeli embassy, which prompted the country to boost security measures around Israeli interests and Jewish community institutions. Sweden’s intelligence agency said in late May that Iran was recruiting members of Swedish criminal gangs to commit 'acts of violence' against Israeli and other interests in Sweden, a claim Iran denied. In neighboring Norway, the authorities informed on Tuesday they are raising the terror warning from medium to high (one level before the highest level). Norway has experienced an increase in threats to Jewish and Israeli targets. The Norwegian security service's decision means that police officers across the country, who are mostly unarmed, will now carry guns.

IDF soldier in fake Hamas video says bullet whizzed past him	The Nahal Brigade soldier featured in the edited video released by the terror group meant to show him getting shot says 'It was frightening for a second, but I quickly pulled myself together. I ducked and reported it; We’ll take out this terrorist too. The incident won't stop me' 'I heard the bullet whizz past me –and realized it was a sniper,' a Nahal Brigade soldier recounted to his comrades about a video released by Hamas, in which the terror group falsely claimed to have shot and killed him, despite missing the target. 'The bullet struck nearby. I followed protocol, ducked down, and quickly alerted the commanders beside me so they could take cover and we could begin efforts to locate the terrorist.' The video, released earlier this week, purportedly shows a sniper from Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza shooting and hitting the soldier, who was unharmed. Hamas fabricated the footage, editing it to include visual effects that seemed to show a bullet hitting the soldier's abdomen. On a bag near the sniper Hamas operatives had written, 'One bullet, one officer, Al-Aqsa Flood' – the name Hamas has given to the current war. The sniper’s face was blurred in the video. 'It was a bit frightening for a second, but I quickly regained my composure,' the soldier added. 'We've gained significant operational experience here over the months, even against Hamas snipers – many of whom we've eliminated. This incident didn’t stop me from continuing to fight alongside my comrades in this week's operation. We won’t stop until we take out that sniper too.' The shot at the soldier was likely fired from an American-made Barrett sniper rifle in the hands of Hamas snipers. The sniper fired a .50-caliber bullet, which causes severe and deadly damage if it hits a person. However, the bullet narrowly missed the soldier's head. Realizing this, he quickly ducked behind a nearby dirt embankment where he and his commander had been standing. Following the incident, Israeli forces launched intelligence and aerial operations to track down and eliminate the sniper, but as of now he remains alive. In recent months, Hamas snipers have successfully targeted Israeli soldiers across the Gaza Strip, documenting the incidents and producing propaganda videos. The terror group has also used drones for reconnaissance and psychological warfare. On the other hand, as revealed by Ynet, the IDF has recently initiated a concentrated campaign to hunt down Hamas snipers in northern Gaza, successfully neutralizing several in past attempts.

Sex-segregated Yom Kippur prayer in Tel Aviv cancelled, despite c...	Chairman of outreach group Rosh Yehudi, Israel Zeira, had been determined to hold the planned prayer service in Meir Park; but he has made a complete reversal, saying that the service would instead take place in a synagogue on Bar Kochba Street over concern about plans to disrupt it A day after the Supreme Court ruled that gender-segregated prayer could be held in Tel Aviv’s Meir Park, the Rosh Yehudi organization announced Thursday that, due to concerns over potential provocations, the prayer service would be moved to a synagogue on Bar Kochba Street rather than taking place outdoors. The organization’s chairman, Israel Zeira, initially said that the prayer service would proceed as planned, but shortly afterward, he issued a statement reversing his decision. 'In times of war, when our soldiers are risking their lives in heroic battles, and the entire nation is praying for the safe return of our captives, the path to victory and the defeat of the enemy, as well as the return of our captives, lies in increasing holiness, unity and internal peace,' he wrote. 'Unfortunately, we have heard plans to disrupt this lawful prayer as well. We are choosing the responsible course of action, to be those who endure insults without retaliating, and we will hold Yom Kippur prayers in the synagogue.' Zeira sounded more defiant, arguing that gender-segregated prayer does not exclude women. 'Many women want to follow the traditions of our ancestors and pray in separation,' Zeira said. 'This is not an offense, it’s not exclusion, it’s not a slap in the face – it harms no one except those who choose to be offended by it. This is authentic Jewish tradition, and no one should be hurt by it. We're not forcing anyone – those who want to stand separately do so, just as they did two years ago. People have unfairly targeted us. We oppose coercion, whether in our prayers or in the lessons we teach. We educate with full intellectual freedom, without any imposition.' Tel Aviv Deputy Mayor Meital Lehavi criticized Zeira’s initiative. 'For 75 years in Tel Aviv, Jews, Arabs, secular, and religious people have lived together peacefully. The religious community here has all the space it needs, with more than 530 synagogues, and the city supports religious events just as it supports cultural events. We allocate substantial spaces for religious purposes. If we want to talk about discrimination and exclusion, I’d argue that it’s the Reform and Conservative institutions in Israel that face discrimination. They receive no support from the Religious Services Ministry or the local religious council. So, to claim that Orthodoxy is suffering when it receives so much funding and recognition, to the point that it has become the state’s official form of Judaism, while pluralistic Judaism is sidelined, is simply inaccurate.' On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that Rosh Yehudi could hold a gender-segregated prayer service in Tel Aviv’s public space for Yom Kippur, including the placement of a partition between men and women. However, the prayers would take place in Meir Park, a less central location than Dizengoff Square, as part of a compromise suggested by the judges. Tel Aviv-Jaffa Mayor Ron Huldai criticized the court’s decision: 'The Supreme Court has allowed the exclusion of women in public spaces, opening a slippery slope. I urge the residents of Tel Aviv-Jaffa to respect the ruling and allow the prayers to take place in Meir Park.' In a surprising turn, former Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef also called for the event to be moved back to a synagogue. Rabbi Yosef issued a public statement saying, 'Regarding Yom Kippur prayers in public spaces, it is clear from a halachic standpoint that prayers should be held in a synagogue. Public prayer should not be preferred over a synagogue.' Rabbi Yosef acknowledged the initiative to bring Yom Kippur prayers to a wider audience in recent years due to overcrowding in synagogues. 'However,' he added, 'a small group of those very distant from religion have sought to cancel public prayers on the grounds of opposing separation, and last year, they went so far as to disrupt the prayers with loud protests, necessitating security intervention, which resulted in the desecration of the holy day.' He concluded, 'While the court has legally permitted public prayers, the risk of confrontations and protests remains. Therefore, I request that the Deputy Mayor of Tel Aviv-Jaffa work to ensure that Yom Kippur prayers take place in synagogues, which is the most appropriate option according to halacha. If that is not possible, the prayers should be held in community centers or closed halls to prevent desecration of the holy day.'

Israeli arrested after entering Lebanon with journalists deported...	Joshua Tartakovsky, who had previously visited Beirut on multiple occasions, was detained by Lebanese authorities after discovering an Israeli passport in his belongings; After the United States intervened, he was deported Joshua (Shuki) Tartakovsky, a former ultra-Orthodox resident of Jerusalem, was deported from Lebanon to the United States following American intervention. Tartakovsky, who graduated from Brown University and the London School of Economics, was reportedly arrested in Beirut on Tuesday after entering Lebanon recently saying he is an investigative journalist. His behavior aroused suspicion among the Lebanese authorities, and when he was caught, they discovered he had an Israeli passport. This was not his first visit to Beirut, according to his social media accounts. Using a British passport to enter Lebanon, Tartakovsky also had his Israeli passport with him. The Al-Akhbar newspaper, associated with Hezbollah, reported that security forces arrested him in the Dahieh district, two weeks after his arrival in the Lebanese capital. He entered the country with other journalists, but his suspicious behavior led to his arrest. Al-Akhbar described Tartakovsky as a 42-year-old Israeli born in the United States who works for a weekly publication. Friends describe him as 'peculiar character.' One noted his frequent shifts in political stance, characterizing him as someone who could be far-right one day and far-left the next, often leaving others confused. His arrest in Lebanon didn't surprise those who knew him. Previously, he posted content supporting Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit or Jewish Power party, yet his friends label him as a leftist 'opposed to wars.' His friend Aharon Rose remarked, 'He earned his degree from a top American university, but he was always a bit strange. He had these confusing traits. The strangest thing was his Facebook. For six months, he was anti-Zionist, then for another six months, he was a Kahanist. He kept changing his Facebook profiles. He's too eccentric to be a spy.' Another friend noted, 'He wrote articles against drafting ultra-Orthodox into the army and against settlements, and suddenly he wrote in favor of drafting ultra-Orthodox.' One of the websites where he published articles even deleted them. Another acquaintance described him as 'an unstable person. He's certainly not a Mossad agent or an Israeli agent of any kind. He's an unstable but very intelligent guy. He's against the West and doesn't live in Israel; he travels the world. Each month he's in a different place—Greece, Brazil, Lebanon, Spain, Turkey, Pakistan. He's an adventurer. He studied international relations and went to experience the world. I'd be surprised if he has a journalist's credentials; he was writing blogs and giving interviews on TV in various countries. He's a polyglot.'

A Liberia-flagged tanker was struck by an unidentified projectile in the Red Sea causing minor damage, but no casualties, British maritime security agencies said on Thursday. The incident occurred about 73 nautical miles (135 kilometres) southwest of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, security firm Ambrey said. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency (UKMTO) said separately that it had received a report of an incident in the same area, adding authorities are investigating. The chemical/products tanker, en route from Saudi Arabia's Jeddah to Muscat in Oman was struck on its starboard side. The projectile hit the bridge causing minor damage, Ambrey said. Approximately four hours later, two additional projectiles reportedly detonated within 0.27 nautical miles of the vessel's port side. The master of the Liberia-flagged vessel reported the tanker was hit by four projectiles, sustaining damage, but no fires or casualties were reported, UKMTO said in a statement. The crew are reported safe and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call, the statement added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rypycmhkyg	2024-10-10T02:30:43-07:00

Cyprus arrests 8 on suspicion of terrorism funding, say police	Police in Cyprus on Thursday detained eight individuals for questioning on allegations they were involved in raising funds for a designated terrorist group in a third country, authorities said. The suspects, seven men and a woman, all from Syria, were arrested in morning raids by police in the towns of Limassol and Paphos. There was no indication the suspects were plotting attacks themselves and police declined to name the group or where it was based. 'There is absolutely no information these individuals were planning any terror attack in Cyprus. It's purely (related to) issues of financing a specific terrorist group based in a third country,' police spokesperson Christos Andreou told Cyprus's ANT1 TV channel. One issue under scrutiny was whether funds were raised from dealing in illicit narcotics and psychotropic substances, he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bksptfsj1l	2024-10-10T02:26:56-07:00	
Father of 6 dies of injuries sustained in Hadera stabbing attack	Doctors fought for the life of the man, 35, in hospital for a day before his death was declared; 5 others were injured in the attack by an Arab terrorist from the northern Israel city of Umm al-Fahm A man who was mortally wounded in the stabbing attack Wednesday in Hadera has died of his ijhuries. The death of the man, a 35-year-old father of 6 children, was determined Thursday at the city's Hillel Yaffe hospital, after doctors fought for his life for a day. In the stabbing spree carried out by an Arab-Israeli terrorist from Umm al-Fahm, five more people were injured, including one who is in a serious and stable condition, and others who are moderately and slightly injured. The victim was identified as Raphael Mordechai Fischhof, affiliated with the Knesset Yitzhak yeshiva in the city. 'The city of Hadera is in pain and shares in the heavy mourning,' Mayor Nir Ben Haim said in a statement. Fischhoff's family thanked the medical staff at the hospital for their dedicated care and support. According to the police, the terrorist stabbed the six wounded in four different places. He began his stabbing spree on Gitit Street, from there he continued to Botkovsky Street, and then stabbed people on Herzl Street. He was neutralized on Herbert Samuel Street, which is considered a central street in Hadera. At first it was civilians with drawn weapons who, according to footage from the scene, subdued him and tried to arrest him, ordering him to lie on the ground. The assailant, who was wearing a helmet, tried to escape. Municipality security guard, Adi Netaf, shot him in the leg. In additional documentation from the moments that the assailant was neutralized, citizens can be seen pushing the terrorist into an alley in the street, while one of them throws chairs at him, and others who join the scene with drawn-out cheers call on him to lie down on the ground. Police forces that arrived at the scene immediately afterward prevented citizens at the scene from hitting the terrorist. We rushed from site to site,' said local security officer Adi Nataf. 'At first, we thought there were two terrorists and then we heard a call to come to Herbert Samuel Street. I saw him wounded and then he stood up, with a coat on, we shouted 'lie down' so that he would not shoot at us, and a reservist fired two shots in the air. I shouted 'lie down' again and shot him in the leg.' Later, police forces also arrived at the scene. An ax and a knife handle were found near the terrorist. In field scans, the blade of the knife was found covered in blood. Police commissioner, Senior Superintendent Danny Levy, arrived at the scene as well. In a statement from the scene he said that 'I want to make it clear that the Israel Police is stretched from end to end, we are handling all the scenes of rocket falls in the entire State of Israel after the barrage on Haifa and the Krayot at the same time as the attack. My heart goes out to the wounded, but apparently this is what we are destined for in this period. We, the police deployed in all the arenas, will also be there to prevent these incidents. The public's sense of security is the most important thing today.' Fearing the presence of additional terrorists, the entrances and exits to the city were blocked Wednesday and Mayor Nir Ben Haim also ordered students not to be released from the schools and kindergartens. The security forces in the city joined the police searches in order close the incident and to allow a return to routine. After some time the restrictions were removed. Sarit Levy, a resident of the city who was near one of the scenes at the time of the attack, told Ynet Wednesday that 'it was scary. I was at the entrance to a stairwell in front of Gitit Street and then people shouted 'attack, attack, stab here.' Suddenly someone ran away quickly, I went up quickly and then I heard. There were other scenes later.' Even before the terrorist was neutralized, he exploded in the city. The owner, E., noticed a 'strange man', as he put it. 'He came in in a panic. He took a bottle of water and then I saw that he had blood and I asked him, 'What's going on?' He said to me 'Do you want me to kill you?' - Then I saw that he was trying to mess with something in his shirt, then I sprayed him with pepper spray and threw a chair at him. I miraculously survived, I realized that he was strange and then it turned out that he was the terrorist.'

The US plan to weaken Hezbollah and shift Lebanese politics; Qata...	The Biden administration believes Hezbollah is in disarray, providing an opportunity to alter Lebanese politics by encouraging Arab nations to support electing a new Lebanese president, a position vacant since 2022; However, Qatar and Egypt warn this move is unrealistic and dangerous, with a potential to ignite sectarian conflict and civil war In a strategic shift, some Western officials, while publicly advocating for calm in the north, are considering leveraging Israel's successful strikes against Hezbollah to diminish the group's political influence in Lebanon. This effort aims to break Hezbollah's stronghold on the country following the assassination of key leaders, primarily Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah. The Biden administration is encouraging Arab nations, such as Qatar, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to collaborate on this initiative, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. This move is intended to weaken Hezbollah's grip, as reported by American and Arab sources. Recently, Washington reached out to Cairo and Doha, which have been involved in cease-fire efforts in Gaza since the war's onset and are now also engaged in discreet talks for stability in the north. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in discussions with leaders from these countries, requested their support in getting a new president elected for Lebanon, which is facing a severe political crisis alongside Israel's conflict with Hezbollah. Biden's special envoy to the region, Amos Hochstein, conveyed to Arab officials that the weakening of Hezbollah should be seen as an opportunity to resolve Beirut's political deadlock. Lebanese parties have struggled to agree on a new president since Michel Aoun's term ended in 2022. This effort represents a quiet shift in the Biden administration's approach, following its recent calls for an immediate cease-fire. However, countries in the region are wary, fearing that pushing a presidential candidate could reignite internal conflict. Years of U.S.-backed reform efforts in Lebanon have only led to minor changes. Qatar and Egypt are not on board Lebanon's citizens suffer from sectarian and political divisions established during the French occupation after World War I, with elites from major groups – Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims, Christians and Druze –dividing government roles among themselves. Riyadh-based sources indicate that the American initiative currently enjoys Saudi support. The oil-rich Gulf state has played a significant role in shaping Lebanon's state and economic actions in recent years. Conversely, Qatar and Egypt warn that this is a risky gamble. Officials in Cairo and Doha told senior American officials that the proposed plan is 'unrealistic and even dangerous.' In conversations with these sources, they argued Israel would never succeed in destroying Hezbollah, and thus the terrorist organization must be part of any political settlement to the conflict. Egypt also expressed concern that attempting to intervene in Lebanese politics during an ongoing war could increase the risk of civil war in a country that has already suffered one in the past century. The U.S. initiative also depends on key Lebanese leaders, including Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Shiite leader considered a 'central conduit' in cease-fire negotiations with Hezbollah. If Washington succeeds in initiating a move, it will need to unify Lebanon's political factions to elect a new president. The president of Lebanon serves as the commander-in-chief of the Lebanese army and is seen as crucial in establishing a competent government capable of addressing the current crisis. Mikati and Berri expressed support for electing a new president last week but also praised Hezbollah's 'struggle against Israeli forces.' Hezbollah's acting leader, Nasrallah's deputy Naim Qassem, rejected calls for a new political settlement while the war with Israel continues. However, he did not rule out a cease-fire independent of the Gaza Strip's situation. Ynet analyst Ron Ben-Yishai notes that Qassem's statement agreeing to a cease-fire without preconditions was likely coordinated with Iran. Qassem, from Hezbollah's founding generation and a key spokesperson, is part of the jihad council. He is currently the highest-ranking member of Hezbollah's military-political leadership after Nasrallah's assassination and the attack on his intended successor, Hashem Safieddine. In Lebanon, the president is elected by the parliament, which has 128 members. Currently, no party has enough strength to elect a president alone and without Hezbollah and its allies' support, forming a political consensus within Lebanese politics remains challenging. Amid tensions in Lebanon, where hundreds of thousands have been displaced following the IDF's entry into southern Lebanon and massive air force strikes across the country, Israel also hopes to effect change. Evidence of this can be seen in a video released by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In his message to the Lebanese people, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged them to seize the opportunity to liberate Lebanon from Hezbollah's control to prevent the country from descending further into destruction and chaos. He reminded them of Lebanon's past as 'the pearl of the Middle East' and blamed Hezbollah and Iran for its current state of turmoil and war. Netanyahu claimed that Hezbollah's actions, including launching thousands of rockets at Israel, serve Iranian interests at Lebanon's expense. He emphasized Israel's right to defend itself and declared that Israel will prevail in the conflict. Netanyahu appealed to Lebanese citizens to reclaim their country and restore it to peace and prosperity, warning that failure to do so would allow Hezbollah to continue its futile war against Israel, causing further suffering for all Lebanese people. He encouraged Lebanese families to consider whether the ongoing conflict is worth the cost, emphasizing the potential for a better future sans Hezbollah's influence.

'It deeply pains the soul. I was at work when I received a video showing a direct hit. I looked and saw part of my parents' tombstone,' he told Ynet. During the barrage, approximately 40 rockets were launched from Lebanon, injuring seven people from lightly to serious and causing damage, including at the Tzur Shalom cemetery. Mayor Eli Dokorski urged residents not to visit the site. 'We will inform any family whose loved ones' graves were damaged. Do not come here; it is still dangerous. Security forces are working,' the mayor said. He joined Home Front Command forces and municipal workers to assess the damage. 'Two minutes later, I received a call from the cemetery manager. He told me that the tombstones of my brothers-in-law and father-in-law were also damaged,' Shalev said. He said that his father, Shalom Shtashvili, died 20 years ago, and his mother, Bat Sheva, six years later. 'Their grave was hit directly by a missile. Four rows behind them are my brothers-in-law, Yitzhak Peer and Tal Israel. Their tombstones were damaged by shrapnel and metal. Their father, Yaakov Petroschvili, my father-in-law, is buried next to them.' 'Hearing this was overwhelming. I had chills all over my body. I took some solace in the fact that the missile didn't penetrate the ground. It hit the gravestone and exploded, which is a small comfort in a difficult situation. I wanted to see the damage with my own eyes, so I went to the cemetery. I photographed everything to show the property tax authority. It's not just a crack; everything is shattered there. It's a very heavy feeling,' he said. 'I'm sure if my parents were here and I could ask their opinion, they would prefer their tombstone be damaged—as long as none of the family members or residents are harmed,' he concluded. The images and videos were shared on social media and in the news, with residents describing them as 'painful.' After watching one of the videos, a resident of Kiryat Ata said: 'Even the dead are not given peace here.' Following the barrage, the Kiryat Bialik municipality issued a notice to residents. 'Anyone whose loved one's grave was damaged will need to file a claim with the property tax authority, where the deceased is the claimant and the family member is the reporter,' according to the announcement. Another barrage targeted Kiryat Shmona: A couple walking their dogs were killed Shortly after the barrage on Haifa and surrounding communities, approximately 20 rockets were also launched toward Kiryat Shmona – most of its residents had been evacuated following the outbreak of the war. Dvir Sharvit, 43, and Revital Yehud, 45, a couple walking their dogs who did not manage to reach a shelter in time, were hit and pronounced dead shortly after at the scene. In addition, eight people were injured in the barrages in the north: seven in the barrage that also damaged the cemetery – including a 16-year-old boy who was evacuated in serious condition with a shrapnel wound to his head – and a 41-year-old man was injured by shrapnel in Shlomi. He was taken to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, where he underwent surgery. His condition is now classified as moderate. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byfm00ybj1l	2024-10-09T23:44:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/09/rke6AZN4Jye/rke6AZN4Jye_0_660_1536_865_0_small.jpg

The U.S. sees the Israeli strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon as an opportunity to end the terrorist organization's control of the country and to elect a new president, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources from U.S. and Arab countries with knowledge of the details. According to the report, U.S. official Amos Hochstein told senior officials from Arab countries that the weakening of Hezbollah should be seen as an opportunity for a breakthrough and an exit from the political crisis in Lebanon. Senior officials from Egypt and Qatar told the Americans that the plan was 'dangerous and unrealistic,' arguing that 'Israel will not succeed in destroying Hezbollah, and must be part of any political settlement to the conflict.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk62n1hyyg	2024-10-09T23:00:14-07:00	
Fatah and Hamas hold talks on 'day after' in Gaza	A senior official in the Palestinian Authority referred to the talks that Fatah held with Hamas regarding the management of the Gaza Strip the day after the war, and told Ynet that 'there will be no agreement regarding the Gaza Management Committee. Fatah supports the continuation of the current Prime Minister Muhammad Mustafa, appointed by PA President Mahmoud Abbas to reform the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas rejects his appointment.' According to the official, 'No new agreement is emerging from the talks currently in Cairo between the two movements. Hamas wants a national unity government to manage Gaza, and not a committee like Abbas proposed.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkw831ryyg	2024-10-09T22:56:51-07:00

In another strike, the IDF eliminated Mohammad Ali Hamdan, commander of Hezbollah’s anti-tank unit in the Meiss El Jabal area, who was responsible for extensive anti-tank missile attacks toward communities in northern Israel. On Wednesday and overnight, the IAF, with the precise intelligence direction of the IDF Intelligence Directorate, struck multiple weapons storage facilities in the Dahieh area of Beirut and weapons storage facilities and additional terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryaqs1hy1l	2024-10-09T22:55:06-07:00	
North Korea’s key role in supplying artillery to Russia revealed ...	North Korea is providing up to half of the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine; as military ties deepen, experts warn of growing cooperation, including potential transfers of advanced weapons systems North Korea has become a key supplier of artillery shells to Russia, providing substantial military support in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. According to Western intelligence cited by The Times of London, North Korean shipments make up approximately half of the 3 million artillery shells Russia uses each year, with an estimated 1.5 million shells originating from Pyongyang. Despite many of these shells being defective, their sheer quantity is crucial for maintaining Russian military operations on the front lines. Russia’s reliance on North Korean ammunition has grown significantly following Vladimir Putin’s visit to Pyongyang in June 2024. This meeting followed a high-profile visit by Kim Jong Un to Russia in September 2023, which marked a turning point in the countries’ military and diplomatic relationship. Regular shipments of North Korean ammunition have been reported since these meetings, solidifying Pyongyang’s role in supporting Moscow’s war efforts. While Russia and North Korea have long-standing historical ties, their relationship has deepened in response to Russia’s growing international isolation following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Putin’s recent visit to North Korea was his first in 24 years, underscoring the strategic importance of the new partnership. Growing military collaboration between Russia and North Korea raises serious concerns for global security, as both nations continue to violate international sanctions and deepen their strategic ties. Fyodor Tertitskiy, a leading researcher at Seoul’s Kookmin University, told The Media Line that Russia and North Korea have now formed a true alliance, solidified by a formal treaty. He highlights that North Korea’s involvement, particularly through supplying artillery shells, positions the country as a potential exporter to other nations with limited access to Western markets. 'Russia’s reliance on North Korean military supplies has become crucial, especially as reports suggest that Russia receives half of its artillery shells from North Korea. This is an enormous quantity, given that Russian military tactics focus heavily on shelling Ukrainian towns to the ground before advancing,' Tertitskiy told The Media Line. 'North Korea’s extensive artillery production is a result of its hyper-militarized state, where 45% of the population serves in the military, and the service term is an unprecedented seven to eight years. No other country comes even close to that,' he states, illustrating North Korea’s intense focus on military strength. He added that North Korea’s 'second economy' is dedicated solely to military production, particularly artillery. 'If you look at the structure in a Korean general’s staff, you’ll see how seriously overrepresented the artillery is there,' he said. Military expert Yan Matveev told The Media Line that while North Korean weaponry don’t likely make up half of all Russian artillery, they still play a significant role. 'Judging by the frequency with which North Korean ammunition appears in footage from the front lines, it’s unlikely that these supplies make up half of all artillery shells, as some reports suggest. However, they do represent a significant portion and are quite widespread. The complete absence of 122-mm shells for howitzers and multiple rocket launchers from North Korea would seriously weaken Russia’s firepower, though likely not critically. This would result in higher infantry losses during offensives, as there would be less artillery support,' he told The Media Line. Matveev shared that the quality of provided munitions is extremely poor. 'For example, the amount of gunpowder in the charges varies, making accurate shooting difficult. You cannot reliably adjust your fire when the shells fall either closer or farther away than expected. This leads to an increase in ammunition consumption. While this doesn’t significantly affect Russian tactics—since their fire support largely relies on massive, inaccurate bombardments—it does limit some of the artillery’s capabilities. Occasionally, these shells explode inside the barrel, though the same issue occurs with Russian-made shells as well,' he explained. According to Matveev, given the existing supply of military equipment and ammunition from North Korea, further deepening of military cooperation can be expected, potentially extending to the transfer of more advanced weapons systems. 'We are already seeing North Korean officers arriving at the front, likely in the role of instructors. Russia is also utilizing KN-23 tactical missiles. While the expansion of cooperation is limited by the modest capabilities of North Korea’s defense industry, they may very well view the war as a testing ground and send more of their missiles to Putin, and possibly other equipment—such as drones,' he said. 'However, mass supplies will likely focus on Soviet-caliber ammunition and possibly Soviet-era equipment,' noted Matveev. North Korea’s artillery is not just abundant but compatible with Russian systems, as both countries’ militaries are offshoots of the Soviet army. 'Everything sort of clicked,' he said, pointing to how this compatibility has made trade between the two countries smooth and beneficial for Russia’s war effort. For North Korea, he explained, this alliance has been a long-sought success. 'The dream since 1990 was to diversify their dependence on China because, if you look at the trade balance, it’s 90% plus trade with China. They don’t like it. They don’t like to be too dependent on Beijing. They don’t want to put all the eggs in one basket. Now, with Russia, they found another basket, and apart from that, just direct income. They’re getting food to feed their population. They’re getting more resources to do whatever the Supreme Leader thinks they should do,' Tertitskiy shared with The Media Line. Tertitskiy also speculated on the future of the alliance, particularly once the war in Ukraine ends. 'Even if Putin stays in power and everything politically is exactly the same, Russia would no longer have a need for North Korea like they haven’t had before.' Historically, the trade relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang was nearly nonexistent, and Tertitskiy suggested it might return to that state after the war. 'Everything now comes just as a supplement to the war trade.' He also noted China’s role in the relationship, suggesting that Beijing gave a 'green light' to North Korea’s involvement in the war with Ukraine, as they are 'quite happy that the Russians are feeding North Koreans and they’ve taken some of the economic burden.'

Brown University rejects demand to divest from companies with tie...	Ivy-league university's governing body votes against proposal by pro-Palestinian students ; vote held after agreement between university administration and students to evacuate protest camp established on campus after start of war in Gaza After months of protests and pressure, Brown University's governing body announced Wednesday that its governing body voted to reject a student proposal to disinvest from companies with ties to Israel. The vote is considered a defining event in the academic arena in the U.S. against the backdrop of pro-Palestinian campaigns that have spread on campuses throughout the country. Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, pro-Palestinian student movements have demanded that universities across the U.S. disinvest from Israel or financially disassociate themselves from entities that have ties to Israeli defense industries. These efforts have only rarely been successful, but the decision by the prestigious university in Rhode Island to even consider the proposal caused great concern in the U.S. Jewish community. Brown agreed to the move as part of an agreement to evacuate the protest camp set up by the students in April in the center of the campus. As part of the negotiations, the protesters promised to dismantle the encampment In exchange for a board of directors examination of the demand to stop investing in certain companies. The decision led to the publicized resignation of hedge fund manager and trustee Jewish billionaire Joseph Edelman. At the end of the vote that was held Wednesday night, university President Christina H. Paxson, and Chancellor Brian T. Moynihan, announced that the board rejected the proposal because 'Brown has no direct investments in any of the companies targeted for divestment and that any indirect exposure for Brown in these companies is so small that it could not be directly responsible for social harm.' Among the companies targeted in the proposal were Boeing, General Electric, Motorola, Volvo and Airbus. Brown’s mission doesn’t encompass resolving or adjudicating global conflict,' they wrote. 'Our greatest contribution to the cause of peace for which so many members of the community have advocated is to continue to educate future leaders and produce scholarship that informs and supports their work. A decision to divest would greatly jeopardize our ability to continue to make this contribution. If the Corporation were to divest, it would signal to our students and scholars that there are ‘approved’ points of view to which members of the community are expected to conform. This would be wholly inconsistent with the principles of academic freedom and free inquiry, and would undermine our mission of serving the community, the nation and the world.' Those around her justified the vote as an attempt to prevent the many conflicts recorded at other academic institutions, such as Columbia University and UCLA, where mass fights broke out between police and protesters, dozens of which were arrested. At Brown, on the other hand, one of the first pro-Palestinian protest centers in the U.S., relative quiet was maintained on campus. The student organization 'Brown Divest', which demanded the vote, described Wednesday night's decision as a moral failure of the university and said that the board 'chose to remain complicit in genocide.' 'It's a shame that the vote even took place' Unlike past protests, the proposal to diest did not deal with cultural or academic isolation of Israel, but with giving instructions to the university to stop investing in 10 companies linked to the 'Palestinian occupation.' Among the arguments put forward by the opponents of the proposal was that it is a double standard, and that these measures endanger freedom of expression on campus. Professor Hedy Wald,, a family medicine specialist at the Brown Faculty of Medicine, and one of the leaders of the fight against the vote, told Ynet that the board's decision is a victory for values ​​and justice. 'It's a shame that, due to the lack of a moral leadership example, this vote was even held in the first place,' she said. 'Kudos to the Students for Israel And to the Jewish Brown graduates for the great efforts they have invested during the last period. Calls to remove investments from military equipment manufacturers that contribute to Israel's ability to defend itself are antisemitic. In this spirit, there is no social harm in investing in companies related to Israel when it must defend itself against the annihilation intentions of terrorists.' Paxson and Moynihan called on the campus community to maintain respectful discourse even in times of disagreement, and emphasized that Brown continues to be an institution committed to academic freedom and freedom of opinion. Unlike Brown, there are several institutions that have agreed to protesters' demands. San Francisco State (SFSU) earlier this month removed investments from three defense companies - Lockheed Martin, Leonardo, and Planetary Technologies, as well as Caterpillar, which do business with the Israeli Ministry of Defense. According to the institution's statement, the university's investment portfolio, estimated at $163 million, was updated 'to conform to new human rights standards proposed by a working group of students and administrative staff.' Pro-Palestinian organizations saw the unprecedented decision as a great victory. The revised policy will have a final approved in December, but its implementation has already begun in practice. Before that, in May, the Columbia University Theological Seminary (UTS) announced the withdrawal of all its investments in Israel, in accordance with the demands of the pro-Palestinian demonstrators on campus.

There will be pubic segregated prayer for Yom Kippur in Tel Aviv,...	The Supreme Court responded to a petition by the Rosh Yehudi organization and ordered the Tel Aviv municipality to allow the outdoor, public service to be held in Meir Garden instead of the more central, secular Dizengoff Square, a compromise the city had rejected The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the Rosh Yehudi organization can hold a gender-segregated prayer in the public space in Tel Aviv for the upcoming Yom Kippur holiday, including placing a mechitza or partition, between men and women. The judges in a compromise proposal ordered the organization to set up its prayer service in Meir Garden, a less central location in the city, and not in Dizengoff Square where it had requested. The court said the municipality must enable Rosh Yehudi to hold the Kol Nidrei and Neilah prayers in the park, at the beginning and end of the holiday. A year ago, clashes erupted at Dizengoff Square on Yom Kippur Eve between hundreds of Tel Aviv residents and the organizers of the gender-segregated prayer service. The Tel Aviv District Court, which heard the organization's petition against the Tel Aviv Municipality, did not find it appropriate to intervene in the municipality's decision prohibiting the holding of gender-segregated prayers and events in the public space - and therefore the petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court. The appellants, Rosh Yehudi and residents of Tel Aviv who joined the petition, were represented by attorneys Uri Paz and Harel Arnon. At the opening of Wednesday's hearing, Judge David Mintz said: 'These are difficult days. In any case, the issue should not have come to court. Certainly not a topic of prayer on Yom Kippur. With good will, it can be resolved outside the court's walls.' Judge Grosskopf said during the hearing: 'I don't understand, a municipality can't allow prayer in the public space according to accepted customs?! You say: when the place is closed, in a synagogue, gender segregation is allowed - but under the open sky in the space, then it is not allowed? Who wants an Orthodox prayer He will go there and those who don't, shouldn't go. Why should a municipality prevent prayer?' The judges slammed the Tel Aviv municipality: 'What is emerging is that a municipality in the State of Israel seeks to discriminate against Orthodox worshippers.' The representative of the township said: 'We do not discriminate', and the judges replied: 'Certainly yes.' Grosskopf added: 'The Tel Aviv Municipality will determine which prayer is legitimate? The public will decide that for itself.'

A military intelligence unit is operating in southern Lebanon and...	Members of Unit 504 are embedded with battalions in the field gathering intelligence from the combat zone, and they are also skilled in on-site interrogations of enemy combatants, including critically injured ones; In recent years, they have successfully recruited agents against Hezbollah without setting foot on Lebanese soil Two soldiers from Unit 504, part of the Military Intelligence Directorate, were injured on Tuesday – one moderately, the other seriously – likely from an explosion during a clash with Hezbollah terrorists in the western sector of southern Lebanon. These are the first casualties from the unit in the ground operation against Hezbollah. As with the Gaza incursion, the IDF has deployed prisoner interrogators from Unit 504 alongside combat battalions operating in Lebanese territory. Their mission is to gather as much intelligence as possible from battle zones and military positions of Hezbollah's Radwan forces, to analyze enemy tactics in real-time, and, when possible, to interrogate captured Hezbollah terrorists or Lebanese civilians. So far, after nine days of ground operations, the IDF has not disclosed whether any Hezbollah terrorists have been captured. However, reports suggest that close encounters with Hezbollah have resulted in their deaths, contrasting with the capture and interrogation of thousands of Hamas terrorists in Gaza over the past year, which provided valuable intelligence, including on the issue of Israeli hostages. Although the IDF's ground operation in Lebanon is currently limited to Radwan’s border villages, Unit 504 is still working to extract human intelligence from the field in real time. The unit’s interrogators are trained in battlefield questioning, including extracting information from wounded Hezbollah terrorists on the verge of death, which could prove invaluable for ongoing operations. Unit 504 has not been as active in Gaza in recent years, where the Shin Bet and the Intelligence Directorate’s technological capabilities have led efforts against Hamas. However, the unit has maintained a presence in southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan, even after the IDF's withdrawal from the security zone in May 2000. Over the years, it has managed to recruit agents and informants against Hezbollah without setting foot on Lebanese soil, helping to build a comprehensive intelligence picture of the Shiite terror army. Meanwhile, Major Roy Ofir, commander of the 71st Armored Battalion Tactical Command Post, described the fighting in southern Lebanon. 'We just returned from one of the villages. We hit Hezbollah hard, destroyed their infrastructure, and neutralized several of their forces and enemy squads. We found a lot of weapons, some of which we've brought back for research in Israel. We crushed anyone who confronted us. We are here to protect our people,' he said. 'We're coming in with significant force,' Ofir added. 'Hezbollah can't even lift its head. They’re taking hit after hit. The IDF has prepared for this. Ask any soldier in the last few years, and they'll tell you – we’ve been preparing for Lebanon and Hezbollah.' Ofir, who began the war in the Gaza sector, continued: 'In the end, we are dismantling the stranglehold Iran has built around us, piece by piece. That is our mission – and we will be on the frontlines despite the difficulties. Those challenges pale in comparison to the larger purpose we’re fulfilling this year.'

Theives in Dahieh were tied to street poles or hanged	Exploiting the war and stealing from houses ' read social media posts showing how the thieves were punished In recent days, photos and videos have been circulated from Hezbollah's stronghold, Beirut's Dahieh, showing thieves who were caught after looting the property of residents who were displaced from their homes. The thieves were hanged or tied to street poles, wounded and bleeding. Passers-by photographed them, uploaded the pictures to social media networks. 'Exploiting the war and stealing from houses in the Al-Rabiri area in Dahieh,' read some of the posts. According to some of the social media messages, Hezbollah is responsible for the harsh punishments. The video footage and photos prove the damage to the governance and the chaos that now prevails in Dahieh. One person posted the thieves' photos and wrote: 'They stole property of civilians in Dahieh, after the displacement from the area as a result of the continued Israeli attacks. The collaborators will soon suffer the same fate.'

The delegation, invited by the Public Diplomacy Department of the Foreign Ministry, includes Golsa 'Goldie' Jamari, a Canadian politician; Nazanin Ansari, an Iranian-British journalist and activist; Hamid Jamalvashi Fard, an underground Iranian rapper; Houman Khalili, an Iranian-American filmmaker and DJ; Hamidi Saeidi, a Grammy-winning Iranian-American musician; and Mahtab Jamali, an Iranian-British businesswoman and fashion designer. The delegation wanted to express solidarity with Israel following the events of October 7. They visited the Gaza border community of Nir Oz and the Re'im parking lot, where the massacre at the Nova music festival took place. They participated in a memorial ceremony in Sderot attended by President Isaac Herzog, traveled north to meet with IDF representatives, and visited the Knesset alongside lawmaker Sharren Haskel. On Tuesday, they experienced air raid sirens for the first time during Hamas' rocket fire on Tel Aviv, and on Wednesday afternoon they ran to shelters during Hezbollah's barrage on Haifa. They were scheduled to meet later on Wednesday with families of hostages. 'Israel's war is with Khamenei and the Islamic Republic of Iran, not with the Iranian people,' Jamari said. 'Iranians love Israelis and stand with them against terror. They want Israel to strike Khamenei. By weakening the Islamic Republic, the Iranian people can overthrow the dictatorship. The people welcome an attack against the Republic that holds them hostage. When Iran is free, there can be peace again in the Middle East.' When Iran is free, there can be peace again in the Middle East Khalili, who lives in California, also expressed his support for Israel, and not just during this visit. 'Iran's attack on Israel is severe and has serious consequences. Israel has every right to defend itself and should respond decisively. It’s important to recognize that many people in Iran are pro-Israel,' he said. Khalili has visited Israel before, making 16 trips in the past two years. His art has become a symbol of support for human rights worldwide, and he aims to present murals in Israel that draw attention to the shared history of Israelis and Persians. Saeidi added that 'the people of Iran and Israel are not enemies but victims of regimes thriving on division. We yearn for peace and freedom. On the streets of Tel Aviv, like in Tehran, you can feel the heartbeat of humanity – full of hope. We share more than history and geography; we share the desire for a life without fear.' The Foreign Ministry noted that 'this visit highlights the connection between the Israeli people and the Iranian expatriate community. It reflects the shared struggle for freedom and human rights.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/r18lk84y1g	2024-10-09T14:04:25-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/09/ryI4RG4yke/ryI4RG4yke_0_183_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Ukraine's Zelensky to meet NATO's Rutte, UK's Starmer on Thursday	President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet NATO General Secretary Mark Rutte and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London on Thursday, a boost for Ukraine after a summit of its main backers was cancelled at a difficult moment in its fight against Russia. Zelensky and Starmer have both described the war with Russia as being at a critical point, and the Ukrainian leader is keen for the West to deliver long-range missiles and other support to try to change the balance on the battlefield. Starmer's spokesperson said Zelensky's arrival in London would coincide with a visit by Rutte. Zelensky was in Croatia on Wednesday and will meet Pope Francis on Friday.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkgmiwvkjl	2024-10-09T13:44:54-07:00	
Top UN envoy in Lebanon calls for truce, UN resolution enforcemen...	A call by the U.S. and France for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah 'is still on the table,' said the top U.N. official in Lebanon on Wednesday as she pushed for a way to enforce a U.N. Security Council resolution violated for years by both sides. A U.N. peacekeeping mission is mandated by Security Council resolution 1701, adopted in 2006, to help the Lebanese army keep its southern border area with Israel free of weapons or armed personnel other than those of the Lebanese state. That has sparked friction with Iran-backed Hezbollah, which effectively controls southern Lebanon. All parties are banned from crossing the Blue Line - a U.N.-mapped line separating Lebanon from Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. 'We need a realistic roadmap for the implementation, by both sides, of resolution 1701. And this must include clear implementation and enforcement mechanisms,' said U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert. Any changes would have to be made by the 15-member Security Council and agreed by both sides. U.N. peacekeepers have remained in place in southern Lebanon, despite Israel asking them to move as its troops crossed the border to target Hezbollah militants. Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday that Israel believed in the language of resolution 1701, but that 'we should think about how to enforce it.' 'We have no desire to stay in Lebanon, and I think the only troops that can do that will be the Lebanese military and UNIFIL, but they need to have the strength, the power and the ability to ensure that Hezbollah is not coming back to the same places,' Danon told reporters, referring to the peacekeeping mission - the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1q9qw4yjl	2024-10-09T13:43:19-07:00

IDF places hopes in new laser anti-rocket systems amid expanding ...	As Hezbollah continues to target northern and central Israel with rocket and missile barrages, security officials hope to expedite laser system allowing for faster and cheaper interceptions Fighting along Israel’s northern border is intensifying, with increased rocket fire aimed at the country. The IDF's operations in villages near the northern border focus on exposing and destroying Hezbollah infrastructure, supported by artillery and airstrikes. The Israeli Air Force continues its attacks on Hezbollah's weapon stockpiles and command centers across Lebanon, including in Beirut’s Dahieh quarter. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday visited the IDF Northern Command to assess the army's progress in southern Lebanon. However, shortly before Gallant detailed the IDF’s operational achievements in the north, Hezbollah launched a heavy barrage of over 100 rockets toward the Haifa Bay area and several towns in the Western Galilee, most of which were intercepted by Iron Dome batteries. Factories under fire Frequent rocket barrages from Lebanon have caused damage to several factories in northern Israel over the past few days. Roy Israeli, northen region manager at the Manufacturers' Association of Israel (MAI), told Ynet’s sister outlet Calcalist that production has continued as usual despite the damage, much of which was caused by rocket fragments. According to the association, the recent expansion of rocket fire and the increase in launch volume haven’t impacted worker attendance at the factories significantly. However, some northern industrialists, including those in factories located dozens of kilometers from the Lebanese border, reported receiving inquiries from overseas customers asking them to ensure future supply capabilities, even in scenarios of war escalation and increased rocket fire from Lebanon. MAI President Ron Tomer noted that producers are facing increased demand to boost production for stockpiling for up to six months. This comes in addition to expanding their procurement of large quantities of raw materials. Tomer warned that this issue could significantly increase financing costs for industrialists as they work hard to maintain their business relationships with global customers. Amid the escalation, the Economy Ministry has expanded its plan to establish shelters in factories in the north. The program's budget stands at NIS 10 million ($2.6 million) and includes distributing shelters to factories located within 40 km (25 miles) of the Lebanese border. These areas include towns in the Jezreel Valley and Haifa, which have been increasingly exposed to rocket fire from Lebanon in recent weeks. Accelerating deployment of laser defense systems While Hezbollah's heavy rocket barrage toward Israel’s coastal cities was largely intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system, security officials are placing high hopes on Rafael Advanced Defense Systems’ 'Iron Beam' laser defense system, which is expected to be operational in the coming months. The air defense system is expected to dramatically improve and reduce the cost of intercepting rockets and drones launched at Israel. There has been progress in innovative development programs over the past year, and Rafael intends to present its new Lite Beam system next week at a defense exhibition in the U.S. The system is based on laser technology and provides mobile defense for maneuvering forces against drones and UAVs. The system is mounted on a Plasan Stormer vehicle and carries the Samson 30mm gun in addition to its laser targeting system as a complementary interception solution if a laser can’t be used to target the threat. The larger Iron Beam system is designed to intercept targets at short range and will initially be integrated into the Iron Dome system. With the incorporation of the laser system into Iron Dome, interceptions will be carried out using either a high-powered laser beam or an interception missile, depending on the circumstances. This dual capability addresses the limitations of laser use under conditions such as cloud cover, fog or dust storms. A special U.S. grant of approximately $8.7 billion from President Joe Biden is set to allow Israel to expand its interceptor stockpiles and munitions inventory, including allocating budgets to accelerate the development of laser-based defense systems at Rafael. Elbit Systems is also involved in these programs, working on airborne laser products that would enable fighter jets and UAVs to intercept threats far from Israel's borders. The Israel Aerospace Industries has its own laser program, which has been significantly accelerated over the past year. In addition to the mobile laser system Rafael plans to unveil next week in Washington, it will also showcase enhanced capabilities in its Trophy active defense system for tanks and armored personnel carriers. The system is already operational in the IDF and installed on vehicles used in the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The system provides protection against anti-tank missiles and rockets fired at moving forces. According to Rafael, variations of the Trophy system have been adapted in recent years for numerous platforms used by armies worldwide, offering comprehensive protection for the crews operating them.

Watch: Hezbollah terrorists eliminated from the air by drones	IDF Spokesperson's Unit says troops from the specialized 636 drone strikes unit eliminated several Hezbollah terror cells, and killed armed terrorists including a platoon commander Troops from Unit 636, a specialized Israeli military unit skilled in drone strikes against enemy targets, operating under the command of the 36th Division, have eliminated several Hezbollah terror cells and destroyed significant terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon. According to The IDF Spokesperson's Unit, in recent days, the unit has directed drones to assist in operations, in coordination with the division’s artillery units, successfully killing armed terrorists, including a Hezbollah platoon commander. Over the past year, the unit has participated in operations in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and now in the ongoing fighting along Israel’s northern front. Overnight, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) carried out a series of precision strikes targeting a Hezbollah weapons production facility and an intelligence headquarters in Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut. To minimize civilian casualties, the IAF issued warnings to residents in the area before the strike. Hezbollah has long embedded its weapons storage sites beneath residential buildings, schools, mosques, and universities, putting civilians at risk. On Tuesday, the IAF conducted another intelligence-driven strike on Hezbollah's drone storage facilities, both above and below ground, along with ready-to-use launchers belonging to the group's aerial unit. The IDF says that it 'continues to operate with the aim of degrading and dismantling Hezbollah's military capabilities.'

JERUSALEM, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant appeared on Wednesday to say that retaliation against Iran for its missile attack will be 'lethal, precise and surprising,' in a video published on Israeli media on Wednesday. After describing Iran's Oct. 1 missile attack as a failure, Gallant said: 'Whoever attacks us will be hurt and will pay a price. Our attack will be deadly, precise and above all surprising, they will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqla4vkke	2024-10-09T10:34:31-07:00	
Netanyahu and Biden, joined by Harris, talk for 50 minutes	It's been six weeks since the president and PM last spoke; They discussed Israel's plans for a retaliatory attack against Iran; After conversation Defense Minister Yoav Gallant says that 'Our attack will be deadly, precise and, above all, surprising' U.S. President Joe Biden spoke Wednesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 50 minutes, a day after the prime minister's decision to postpone Defense Minister Yoav Galant's scheduled visit to Washington until he had a conversation with Biden. Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris also joined the conversation, according to the White House. According to officials in Jerusalem cited by Reuters, the conversation between the two leaders was intended, among other things, to discuss Israel's plans for a retaliatory attack against Iran, in response to the latest barrage it launched into Israel. Also present in Netanyahu's office during the conversation were the Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer; the prime minister's political advisor Ophir Falk; National Security Council Deputy Director Gil Reich, Head of the National Security Council Foreign Policy Division, Dr. Joseph Drazanin; and prime minister's military secretary, Maj. Roman Goffman. Shortly after the conversation, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant - who visited Unit 9900 of the Intelligence Division, which is used to collect visual intelligence - said that 'the Iranian attack was aggressive but inaccurate. Whoever attacks us will be hurt and will pay a price. Our attack will be deadly, precise and above all surprising, they will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results.' Gallant received a briefing from unit 9900 on the preparation for the latest attacks in Lebanon, and also for attacks that are expected in other arenas. 'Thanks to you, we see the entire Middle East - Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq and everywhere else,' he said. 'We see exactly and in a very, very focused way any place we want.' Gallant's flight to the U.S., now postponed until after a potential discussion between Biden and Netanyahu on Wednesday, was aimed at enhancing coordination between Jerusalem and Washington as the IDF prepares to respond to Iran's second ballistic missile attack within a year. Gallant, as noted, delayed his planned night flight partly because the government had not yet approved his trip. It is believed Netanyahu is actually wary of Gallant gaining more clout in the eyes of Biden and wants to demonstrate to his Likud base that he is preventing Gallant from coordinating with the U.S. The Americans were utterly shocked on Tuesday, as this has gone from being a conflict between Netanyahu and Gallant to one also between Netanyahu and the Biden administration. The Defense Minister was invited by the Americans, who see him as 'the war liaison,' and he coordinated his trip with the Prime Minister's office. Until Tuesday night, despite lacking travel approval, Gallant's associates were confident the trip would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, even before Netanyahu and Biden's conversation, the Prime Minister spoke with former U.S.; President Donald Trump, who is the Republican Party's current candidate for presidential elections next month. Netanyahu's office reported that Trump called the prime minister on his own initiative about a week ago, and congratulated him on the determined and powerful actions Israel took against Hezbollah. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham also participated in the conversation. An Israeli official told The Washington Post that Netanyahu had tried several times to reach Biden by phone but was unsuccessful. An American official denied these claims, calling them untrue. 'The administration consults with Israelis on a number of levels and we've always said the leaders will speak soon, following these consultations. That is what we agreed in recent weeks,' he said, adding that a call on Tuesday was not possible because Biden was traveling to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to address the hurricane response. According to The Wall Street Journal, Israel has refused to provide the Biden administration with details of its planned attack on Iran after Iran launched its missile strike on Israel earlier this month. Hours after news broke of Netanyahu delaying Gallant’s visit, U.S. officials told the Journal there was growing frustration in the administration over being repeatedly surprised by Israeli military operations in Lebanon and Gaza. Sources detailed a conversation between Gallant and his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, shortly after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a bombing of his bunker in Beirut last month. 'Sorry, what did you say?' Austin reportedly asked, according to officials with knowledge of the exchange. Austin also questioned whether Israel intended to defend itself on its own, given the lack of communication with the administration. Sources said Austin was frustrated because the U.S. had insufficient time to organize its forces to assist Israel or protect American troops in the Middle East. Washington officials expressed hope that in the future, they would have more advance notice of attacks that could lead to greater American involvement, as Israel continues to vow retaliation against Iran. American officials believe Israel will target Iranian military and intelligence assets. A conversation between Biden and Netanyahu, details of which were revealed on Tuesday in excerpts from a new book by journalist Bob Woodward, reportedly led to a tempered Israeli response to an Iranian attack in April. Biden is said to have told Netanyahu to 'take the win' after the Iranian attack failed, advising that no further action was necessary. Israel may be withholding information from the administration due to concerns over leaks. Shortly before the Israeli ground offensive in southern Lebanon began last week, U.S. officials leaked details of the IDF's operational plans to the media, likely in an effort to prevent any miscalculations by Iran, which has since launched over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. Meanwhile, on Tuesday conversations between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden were publicly revealed that resulted in Israel's moderate reaction in Iran. Biden asked Netanyahu to 'take the victory' of the failure of the Iranian attack, telling him, according to a book by journalist Bob Woodward: 'You should not take on step further. Don't do anything.' In the end, as mentioned, Israel reacted in a targeted and limited manner to Iran, when according to reports outside of Israel, it attacked the radar of an advanced air defense battery that protects the reactor in Natanz . It was revealed by Ynet on Tuesday night that this wasn't the first such incident between the two. Prior to the incident barring Gallant from traveling to the U.S. and imposing conditions, which included 'decisions on Israel's next actions,' the prime minister previously demanded amid wartime to talk with a leader of a nation maintaining diplomatic relations with Israel, to which Gallant had discreetly traveled. The conversation occurred, and negotiations with Netanyahu allowed the flight to proceed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhj7n41jx	2024-10-09T10:25:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/04/14/B1ebI4BtxR/B1ebI4BtxR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Erdogan: Israel is a Zionist terrorist state	Turkish president tells lawmakers from his ruling AK party that Hamas terrorists are 'freedom fighters who fight for the honor of the Muslim world' and warns Israel will turn against Turkey next Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called Israel a 'Zionist terrorist organization' in a speech to lawmakers from his ruling Justice and Development Party (AK) on Wednesday. Erdogan criticized the West, especially the United States, for its support to Israel and said Turkey will continue to expose the hypocrisy of the West. Since the start of the war, the Turkish leader has spoken fiercely against Israel including comparing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Hitler and Israel to the Nazis in his speech to the UN General Assembly last month. 'Just as Hitler was stopped by an alliance of humanity 70 years ago, Netanyahu and his murder network must be stopped by an alliance of humanity,' he said. 'The UN General Assembly’s authority to recommend the use of force should be considered.' The Turkish leader said the direct attacks exchanged between Israel and Iran demonstrate the danger of a regional conflict and said Israel's 'expansionist policies' will eventually be turned against Turkey, that 'can burst their bubble.' He also said Israel's illusion of a promised land will lead it to great disappointment and defeat. 'History will never forgive those who cheered for Netanyahu who has the blood of tens of thousands on his hands,' Erdogan said. He praised Hamas, calling the terror group 'freedom fighters who are fighting for the honor of the Muslim world,' adding that they are 'also fighting for Turkey.' Also on Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Hakan Fidan and National Defense Minister Yaşar Guler held a closed door meeting with lawmakers to brief them on Israel's 'aggressive policies' and how they may impact Turkey. The content of the meeting is to remain secret for 10 years. According to a report in Turkey's Hürriyet news paper the meeting was called by lawmakers of the opposition to Erdogan, including the leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) to learn if there is any danger to Turkey from Israel.

Gulf states must not allow use of airspace against Iran, Iranian ...	Iranian Foreign Minister Araqchi warns Gulf states against allowing use of their airspace for attacks, while those states have reassured him of their supposed neutrality, as Gulf oil producers raise output in case regional escalation Tehran has told Gulf Arab states it would be 'unacceptable' if they allowed use of their airspace or military bases against Iran and warned that any such move would draw a response, a senior Iranian official said. The official also said any action by Gulf states to balance oil markets should Iranian energy facilities be hit by Israel was not part of the discussions so far. The comments come amid growing concern over possible Israeli retaliation for last week's Iranian missile attack, as Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi visits Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states including Qatar for talks on Wednesday. They followed discussions between Iran and Gulf Arab capitals last week on the sidelines of an Asia conference in Qatar, when Gulf states sought to reassure Iran of their neutrality in any conflict between Tehran and Israel. 'Iran made it clear that any action by a Persian Gulf country against Tehran, whether through the use of airspace or military bases, will be regarded by Tehran as an action taken by the entire group, and Tehran will respond accordingly,' the senior Iranian official told Reuters. 'The message emphasized the need for regional unity against Israel and the importance of securing stability,' he said. 'It also made clear that any assistance to Israel, such as allowing the use of a regional country’s airspace for actions against Iran, is unacceptable.' U.S. President Joe Biden held a telephone call on Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that was said to include discussion of any plans to strike Iran, according to a person familiar with the matter. Washington hopes to weigh in on whether the response is appropriate, a separate person briefed on the discussions said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Biden said Friday he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields if he were in Israel's shoes. Last week he also said he would not support Israel striking Iranian nuclear sites. The Iranian official said Tehran did not discuss the issue of Gulf Arab oil producers raising output if Iranian production were disrupted during any escalation. U.S. news website Axios, citing Israeli officials, reported last week that Israel could target oil production facilities within Iran as retaliation. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, which is de-facto led by Saudi Arabia, has enough spare oil capacity to make up any loss of Iranian supply if an Israeli retaliation knocks out some of the country's facilities. Much of OPEC's spare capacity is in the Middle East Gulf region. Iran has not threatened to attack Gulf oil facilities but has previously warned that if 'Israel supporters' intervene directly their interests in the region would be targeted. Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia has had a political rapprochement with Tehran in recent years, which has helped ease regional tensions, but relations remain difficult. Saudi Arabia has been wary of an Iranian strike on its oil facilities since a 2019 attack on its key refinery at Abqaiq briefly shut down more than 5% of global oil supply. Iran denied involvement. A Western diplomat in the Gulf said that during Thursday's Gulf-Iran meeting in Doha, Iran made clear that Tehran had called for regional unity in the face of an Israeli attack and that it considered neutrality of Gulf states a bare minimum. The diplomat said Iran had made clear that Tehran would keep a close eye on how each Gulf country responded in the case of an Israeli attack, and also how U.S. bases housed in their countries were used. Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates all host U.S. military facilities or troops. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byaqugnkkx	2024-10-09T09:09:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2020/05/31/SyUNuXZhU/SyUNuXZhU_101_0_411_231_0_small.jpg

FBI returns Nazi-looted Monet pastel to Jewish owners' heir	In 1940, the Nazis seized a Claude Monet pastel and seven other works of art from Adalbert 'Bela' and Hilda Parlagi, a Jewish couple forced to flee their Vienna home after Austria was annexed into Adolf Hitler's Germany. After the war, Bela Parlagi searched for his art to no avail until his death in 1981. His son continued the search without success until he died in 2012. But on Wednesday, more than 80 years later, Parlagi's granddaughters Helen Lowe and Francoise Parlagi were reunited with the missing Monet after the FBI and a Britain-based nonprofit located it in the United States. The 7- by 11-inch (18- by 28-centimetre) pastel, called 'Bord de Mer,' dates back to 1865 and features a scene from France's Normandy shoreline. The FBI recovered the painting in 2023, after it appeared for sale at a Houston-based gallery. The FBI said the owners of the pastel - Bridget Vita and her late husband Kevin Schlamp, did not realize the Nazis had stolen the Monet and they voluntarily surrendered it.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcauqnjkx	2024-10-09T08:55:25-07:00

This is why Yoav Gallant's trip to Washington was scrapped by Net...	Inside sources speculate that the Israeli premier did not want to give Gallant more clout with Biden, which is why a phone call between the president and the PM was promptly scheduled; Netanyahu tells US Jewish organizations the struggle against Iran is one the whole western world shares Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was set to touch down in Washington at midday on Wednesday. However, this visit – prompted by an invitation from the Pentagon last week – was abruptly postponed on Tuesday night due to last minute stipulations from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Gallant is now sharing his perspective on the trip's delay, mere hours before his intended departure to the U.S. As per his office's statement, last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin extended an invitation to Gallant for a formal visit to the United States. Upon receiving this invitation, Gallant promptly informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to Gallant's office, 'both agreed that the minister would prepare to depart on Tuesday night, following security discussions.' Gallant says the trip was deferred 'at the Prime Minister's request,' pending a conversation between Netanyahu and President Joe Biden, as became apparent on Tuesday. The Defense Minister's office added, 'The Defense Minister represents the Israeli government and the prime minister, and any diplomatic travel will only proceed with official approval.' While awaiting a call from Biden, Netanyahu on Wednesday met with a delegation from the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, making a pointed remark directed at the Biden administration: 'There is only one force in the world confronting Iran – and that is Israel. However, this is not solely our fight – it is the struggle of the free world.' It was revealed by Ynet on Tuesday night that this wasn't the first such incident between the two. Prior to the incident barring Gallant from traveling to the U.S. and imposing conditions, which included 'decisions on Israel's next actions,' the prime minister previously demanded amid wartime to talk with a leader of a nation maintaining diplomatic relations with Israel, to which Gallant had discreetly traveled. The conversation occurred, and negotiations with Netanyahu allowed the flight to proceed. The Americans were stunned Gallant's flight to the U.S., now postponed until after a potential discussion between Biden and Netanyahu on Wednesday, was aimed at enhancing coordination between Jerusalem and Washington as the IDF prepares to respond to Iran's second ballistic missile attack within a year. Gallant, as noted, delayed his planned night flight partly because the government had not yet approved his trip. It is believed Netanyahu is actually wary of Gallant gaining more clout in the eyes of Biden and wants to demonstrate to his Likud base that he is preventing Gallant from coordinating with the U.S. The Americans were utterly shocked on Tuesday, as this has gone from being a conflict between Netanyahu and Gallant to one also between Netanyahu and the Biden administration. The Defense Minister was invited by the Americans, who see him as 'the war liaison,' and he coordinated his trip with the Prime Minister's office. Until Tuesday night, despite lacking travel approval, Gallant's associates were confident the trip would proceed as planned. Biden has long avoided a conversation with Netanyahu, while he spoke with President Isaac Herzog on the anniversary of the October 7 massacre the day before. The two are expected to speak Wednesday, in the wake of Netanyahu's ultimatum. However, U.S. sources denied an Israeli claim Wedenesday morning that Biden refused a direct request from Netanyahu for a conversation. Sources in Washington stated the conversation between the two leaders was not feasible on Tuesday because Biden was engaged in discussions on response efforts to Hurricane Helene that struck the United States, and there is no connection to tensions with Netanyahu. According to U.S. sources, who subtly criticized Netanyahu, 'a conversation between them was supposed to occur later this week, and Israel was aware of this.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rkmotbnyje	2024-10-09T08:16:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/18/rkWyiJr6Wa/rkWyiJr6Wa_0_0_1280_852_0_small.jpg

Hamas posts video falsely claiming its snipper shoots soldier	Terror group snipers target troops in Gaza; IDF working to identify, eliminate sniper Hamas falsely claimed that one of its snipers hit an IDF soldier, in a clip it posted on social media to its followers in which a sniper from Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip is seen shooting and apparently hitting an IDF soldier. The snipper did shoot but missed the soldier who was unhurt, however. The Hamas terrorist carried an American-made Barrett rifle and shot a 0.5 caliber bullet that can be fatal; but, the shot missed the soldier, who realized he was in danger and ducked behind a dirt embankment near by protecting him and his commanding officer. Other officers began working to pinpoint the sniper who has thus far escaped capture. In the images posted by Hamas, the sniper's face was blurred and a bag nearby bore the saying: 'one bullet, one officer.' Hamas snipers have succeeded in targeting troops in Gaza in recent months and to document their attacks in posts. The terrorists also filmed drones launched to gather intelligence about IDF troops. The IDF is concentrating efforts on locating and eliminating the threats posed by the snipers. The soldier that was a target of the sniper is part of the ultra-Orthodox IDF unit which has been fighting in Gaza for the past 10 months. The forces are also tasked with preventing far-right activists from entering the Strip in their efforts to force new Israeli settlements there.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydxcbeyjx	2024-10-09T07:21:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/09/HkV4002X1kg/HkV4002X1kg_155_83_651_366_0_small.jpg

Joshua Tartakovsky entered Lebanon using a British passport and presented himself as an investigative journalist, but after exhibiting erratic behavior he was detained by local police who found an Israeli passport among his belongings Joshua (Shuki) Tartakovsky, previously part of the ultra-Orthodox community in Jerusalem and an alumnus of Brown University and LSE, was detained in Beirut on Tuesday. He had recently entered Lebanon by presenting himself as an 'investigative journalist.' His conduct drew suspicion from the Lebanese authorities and, upon his detention by local police, an Israeli passport was discovered in his possession. Social media accounts suggest this wasn't his first visit to Beirut. Tartakovsky entered Lebanon using a British passport but also carried an Israeli one. Al-Akhbar, a Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper, reported security forces apprehended him in Dahieh, two weeks after his arrival in the Lebanese capital. Although he entered Lebanon with other journalists, his behavior raised enough suspicion to lead to his arrest. Al-Akhbar described Tartakovsky as a 42-year-old Israeli born in the United States. His acquaintances describe him as a 'peculiar character.' One noted his frequent shifts in political stance, characterizing him as someone who could be far-right one day and far-left the next, often leaving others confused. His arrest in Lebanon didn't surprise those who knew him. Previously, he posted content supporting Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit or Jewish Power party, yet his friends label him as a leftist 'opposed to wars.' 'He wrote articles against drafting ultra-Orthodox Jews and settlements, then suddenly supported drafting them,' according to an aquaintance. Articles he contributed to certain sites were even removed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywklz4kje	2024-10-09T07:05:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/09/B17KU11lVJ1e/B17KU11lVJ1e_0_138_1080_608_0_small.jpg

'Without waiting for instructions from the Iraqi authorities, Air France has decided to suspend overflight of the country's airspace by its aircraft from 5 p.m. GMT,' the airline said. 'An internal investigation has been launched into this event,' it added. Air France also said that another flight returned to Paris, while a third, from Singapore to Paris, made an additional stop in Delhi to get more fuel to take a longer route.

Netanyahu blocked Gallant's US trip after Biden refused call, rep...	White House denies POTUS snubbed PM, cites Hurricane Helene response; Austin reportedly caught off-guard by Nasrallah assassination amid growing US frustration with Israel’s lack of communication Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prevented Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's trip to Washington after U.S. President Joe Biden reportedly refused to take his call, The Washington Post reported on Wednesday. U.S. officials denied the report, claiming that the president's call with the prime minister was scheduled to take place this week and that they had not spoken earlier due to Biden’s need to address the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Sources close to Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Gallant was informed his trip was not approved prior to Netanyahu and Biden speaking. 'Gallant was invited to Washington and informed the Prime Minister's Office. He was told at the time that he could not travel until the prime minister spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden,' the sources said. 'The decision was not personal and was not an effort to flex muscles. There is a process that must take place so that Gallant travels armed with the Cabinet's decision.' This is not the first time Netanyahu has delayed a trip planned by the defense minister until he could personally speak to the leader of the country Gallant was scheduled to visit. Ultimately, the visit was allowed to proceed after Netanyahu had the conversation he was seeking. Netanyahu conditioned Gallant's visit to the U.S. on the Security Cabinet’s approval of the response to Iran's attack on Israel and on a conversation with Biden. The two leaders are scheduled to speak later on Wednesday, marking their first conversation since August 22. Following the Iranian missile strike, Biden said he would be speaking with the prime minister, but the call has not taken place in the nine days since. The president did, however, speak with President Isaac Herzog on October 7, marking a year since the Hamas massacre. An Israeli official told The Washington Post that Netanyahu had tried several times to reach Biden by phone but was unsuccessful. An American official denied these claims, calling them untrue. 'The administration consults with Israelis on a number of levels and we've always said the leaders will speak soon, following these consultations. That is what we agreed in recent weeks,' he said, adding that a call on Tuesday was not possible because Biden was traveling to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to address the hurricane response. According to The Wall Street Journal, Israel has refused to provide the Biden administration with details of its planned attack on Iran after Iran launched its missile strike on Israel earlier this month. Hours after news broke of Netanyahu delaying Gallant’s visit, U.S. officials told the Journal there was growing frustration in the administration over being repeatedly surprised by Israeli military operations in Lebanon and Gaza. Sources detailed a conversation between Gallant and his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, shortly after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a bombing of his bunker in Beirut last month. 'Sorry, what did you say?' Austin reportedly asked, according to officials with knowledge of the exchange. Austin also questioned whether Israel intended to defend itself on its own, given the lack of communication with the administration. Sources said Austin was frustrated because the U.S. had insufficient time to organize its forces to assist Israel or protect American troops in the Middle East. Washington officials expressed hope that in the future, they would have more advance notice of attacks that could lead to greater American involvement, as Israel continues to vow retaliation against Iran. American officials believe Israel will target Iranian military and intelligence assets. A conversation between Biden and Netanyahu, details of which were revealed on Tuesday in excerpts from a new book by journalist Bob Woodward, reportedly led to a tempered Israeli response to an Iranian attack in April. Biden is said to have told Netanyahu to 'take the win' after the Iranian attack failed, advising that no further action was necessary. Israel may be withholding information from the administration due to concerns over leaks. Shortly before the Israeli ground offensive in southern Lebanon began last week, U.S. officials leaked details of the IDF's operational plans to the media, likely in an effort to prevent any miscalculations by Iran, which has since launched over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel.

Hadera terrorist's rampage: 4 scenes, attempts motorcycle getaway	Assailant identified as 36-year-old Israeli-Arab from Umm al-Fahm; 'I shouted at him to lie down and shot him in the leg,' says security guard who helped subdue attacker The assailant behind Wednesday’s terror attack in Hadera, which left one victim critically injured, has been identified as a 36-year-old Israeli citizen from Umm al-Fahm. The attacker was shot and subdued by armed civilians on Herbert Samuel Street after attempting to flee. Initially treated as a criminal incident, police later confirmed it was a terror attack. Doctors are fighting to save the life of one victim, while another remains in serious condition, and four others sustained moderate injuries. The Arab municipality of Umm al-Fahm condemned the attack shortly after the assailant's identity was revealed. 'We rushed from site to site,' said local security officer Adi Nataf. 'At first, we thought there were two terrorists and then we heard a call to come to Herber Samuel Street. I saw him wounded and then he stood up, with a coat on, we shouted 'lie down' so that he would not shoot at us, and a reservist fired two shots in the air. I shouted 'lie down' again and shot him in the leg.' Police Commissioner Daniel Levy, who arrived at the scene, acknowledged the strain on police resources amid ongoing rocket fire and terror attacks. 'This is our fate at this time,' he said. Levy vowed to investigate anyone connected to the attack and criticized gaps in intelligence, noting the responsibility of the Shin Bet for preventing such incidents from the West Bank.

Two killed in Lebanon rocket barrage on Kiryat Shmona	First responders find couple critically injured from shrapnel after attack on northern city but had to declare their death shortly after; IDF says about 20 rockets launched in volley A man and a woman were killed in a rocket barrage on Kiryat Shmona, Magen David Adom (MDA) Director Eli Bin confirmed on Wednesday, describing the strike as 'unusual.' MDA had initially reported that the couple, both in their 40s, were critically injured from shrapnel but had to declare their death shortly after. According to IDF, about 20 rockets were launched from Lebanon toward Kiryat Shmona and the surrounding area. Sirens were also activated due to a false alert of a potential hostile aircraft. Fire and Rescue Services said several buildings caught fire after direct hits from the barrage. Five firefighting teams were deployed to contain the blazes and search for additional casualties. 'Fires are raging in multiple buildings that sustained direct hits, and firefighters are working to contain the spread while searching for victims,' said Incident Commander Chief Reshef Dror Buchnik. Police have cordoned off the impacted areas, with sappers working to neutralize remaining threats. Authorities urged the public to avoid the scene and not touch rocket debris, which could contain explosives, and to report any findings to emergency services. MDA emergency medic Aviad Hertz, who responded to the scene, said, 'Upon arrival, we found a man and a woman, both in their 40s, unconscious. Despite medical efforts, we had to pronounce them dead at the scene.' Earlier, six people were lightly and moderately wounded in the Haifa Bay area following a rocket barrage from Lebanon. Among the injured is a 16-year-old boy who sustained moderate head injuries from shrapnel. Four others, in their 40s and 50s, suffered light injuries from shrapnel. A 36-year-old motorcyclist was also lightly injured in an accident during the rocket sirens. The IDF reported that approximately 40 rockets were launched from Lebanon, with several rockets being intercepted by air defenses, while others crashed in various locations. Residents in Kiryat Bialik reported power outages following the attack after interception fragments crashed in the city's Zur Shalom cemetery.

IDF hoists Israeli flag over Lebanon's 'Iran Garden'	Troops take operational control over the Shi'ite village of Maroun al-Ras where Iran decided to commemorate its presence in a lavish viewpoint over Israeli border towns IDF footage released on Tuesday revealed forces destroyed southern Lebanon’s 'Iran Garden,' which included a model of the Dome of the Rock in Maroun al-Ras. The garden, located in the Shiite village overlooking the Israeli towns of Avivim and Yiron in the Upper Galilee, had an Israeli flag raised at the site. It was inaugurated in 2010 by former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and served as a vantage point for other Iranian officials to observe Israel and make various commitments regarding Tehran's support for Lebanon over the years. The park was established in a festive ceremony attended by Ahmadinejad who visited southern Lebanon at the time. The former Iranian president even considered throwing a stone toward Israel during that visit. The 'Iran Garden' was an Iranian historical center, but also a Lebanese one. Lebanese tourism sites described it as 'a place that commemorates Hezbollah's resilience against the Israeli invasion in 2006.' Over the years, it became a pilgrimage site for senior Iranian officials. The most recent visitor was former Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian who visited the Lebanese village in April 2023, observed Israel and declared, 'We’re here in Maroun al-Ras to loudly proclaim our support for the resistance against the occupation.' Three weeks earlier, during Passover, 34 rockets were fired from Lebanon toward towns in the Galilee — described as the heaviest barrage from Lebanon since the Second Lebanon War in 2006. This marked the beginning of a gradual escalation along the northern border, which intensified significantly in June 2023 when armed Hezbollah terrorists set up a post with two tents on the Israeli side of the border at Mount Dov, eventually reaching a head with the outbreak of war on the northern border following the October 7 massacre. The garden was well-maintained with tables for hosting visitors, a green plaza with seating areas, a cafeteria and an amphitheater overlooking Avivim. It also featured a playground for children, guard towers facing Israel, stone arches, a parking lot and a water well. Its centerpiece was a model of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount, and a cutout of the former Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, pointing toward Israel was also present at the site. 'Iran Garden welcomes you to the most beautiful spot in the south, with a unique view and many activities,' read an invitation to the park circulated online in 2019. In the video, one could notice the Iranian flag flying on Lebanese soil near the children's playground, in the same village where the Israeli flag was raised in recent days. The park was filled with Iranian symbols and signs in Persian. Stopping points in the complex were named after Iranian provinces, giving the impression of a small Iranian enclave in the Shiite village — from which Israel was clearly visible. Judging by its design, this was undoubtedly the goal. Golani Brigade soldiers reached Maroun al-Ras, which became a Shiite symbol during the Second Lebanon War, about a week ago. The IDF quickly gained operational control of the village, enabling relatively free movement in the hostile area. Some commanders can move back and forth to Israeli territory due to its proximity — only 2 aerial km (1.2 miles).

I'd love to go on one last hike with him': Talking with Israel's...	Over 780 children have been orphaned since the war began on October 7; four teenagers who loved their loved ones share their grief and hope Over 780 children have been orphaned since the war began on October 7. They lost their father or mother in the brutal terror attack or in the subsequent fighting in Gaza, the northern border and the West Bank. Some even lost both of their parents. Ynet spoke with four teenagers who lost their loved ones marking a year to the horrible massacre. Mika's father, Lieutenant Colonel Eli Ginsburg, fell on October 8 in the battle for Kibbutz Be'eri. He was the commander of the IDF’s Counter-Terrorism Unit and had already been on leave, preparing for his discharge. Mika, your father didn't have to go and fight. Does that weigh on you? Do you talk about it? 'Sometimes, but ultimately, this was the moment he was preparing for all those years in the army. So I understand his decision. I think everyone knew that he'd be the first to go if something like this happened.' Tell us a little about him. Beyond being a distinguished soldier, what did he love? What did you do together? 'He was the most amazing dad. He was present even when he wasn’t physically at home. He loved the sea and hiking across the country. He had a weird taste in music — really heavy rock.' Are there small things that have happened since October 7 that suddenly bring his presence back into your home? 'Everything. Walking around the house and suddenly remembering something or catching the scent of his cologne. Everything reminds me of him.' Lieutenant Colonel Alim Abdallah from Yanuh-Jat, Maia's father, was also nearing the end of his military service. He fell on the northern border during a battle with terrorists two days after the war started. Maia, the fighting in the north is intense for you. 'There's been a war in the north since October 7, but it seemed like no one cared. Only now, after many have fallen, people are starting to grasp that there's a war in the north.' Tell us a bit about your father. What did he love? What did you do together? 'My dad was my best friend. He was in the army, so he wasn’t always physically with us, but he was always present even at a distance. We talked every day via video calls and messages. I shared everything with him; he knew everything about me.' He served in the IDF for many years. Were you worried about him? 'Yes, I was always worried. Even on his last day, I was worried. My sister had a strong sense that something was happening that day.' Did you have plans for his retirement from the army? 'Yes. We planned to go on a trip together for his retirement.' Major (res.) Eitan Menachem Naaman, father of Evyatar and Avinoam, fell in battle near Sderot during the early days of the war. He was a doctor at Soroka Medical Center and died while serving in the reserves. Avinoam, tell us a bit about your dad. 'A central part of my dad's life was medicine. He started young, volunteering with Magen David Adom at age 15. He later studied medicine and became a doctor after finishing his studies. He was also a doctor in the reserves and volunteered with the Arad Rescue Team at the same time.' He dedicated his life to saving others. 'Yes. He always kept medical equipment at home in case one of us got injured. On Saturdays, people from the community would often come and ask for help with all sorts of injuries and illnesses.' How were you informed about the loss? 'They woke us up at 2 a.m. My sister said to me, 'Avinoam, get up.' I asked her, 'Why should I get up at this hour?' Then I saw soldiers in our house and thought, 'Please, let them just tell me he was injured,' but they said he was killed.' Following the loss, Evyatar, the younger brother, published a booklet aimed at helping other cope with the death of a friend or loved one. Evyatar, tell us how the booklet came about. 'My friend and I were studying a book by a rabbi that talks about challenges during the time of redemption and we noticed that there weren't really any books for youth that discuss death —so we decided to write a booklet together. 'I really believe in taking action, especially when dealing with grief. Action allows you to channel the pain of loss into something positive. Instead of just struggling, you can create and grow from it.' Where did you distribute the booklet? 'In various bookstores. We mainly tried to get it to bereaved families. We received a lot of responses. People told us they were really happy to read it and that it helped them a lot.' A question for all of you: What’s the one thing you miss most? Mika: 'There's not just one thing. I think I just miss the whole concept of 'dad.'' Maia: 'Right, there’s no one specific thing we miss. We really miss everything, even arguing with him.' You say everything triggers the longing, but how have your daily lives changed? Mika: 'Everywhere we go is accompanied by a storm of emotions — sadness, joy and longing. I think I’ve learned a lot about myself during this time.' What have you learned about yourself? 'That I’m capable, that I have strength.' Evyatar and Avinoam, what do you miss? Evyatar: 'I would love to go on one last hike with him. His love for the land of Israel and hiking were very central in his life and we hiked a lot as a family, especially in the Judean Desert.' Avinoam: 'I really miss having a doctor at home. It’s very convenient. When you get hurt, you don’t go to the ER — you just go to your dad, and he tells you, 'Oh, it’s nothing.' If you needed stitches, heaven forbid, he’d stitch you up. Whatever happened, you could just ask him for help.' Are there any stories about your dad you heard after he passed that surprised or made you happy? Mika: 'I was told that when I was born, my dad introduced himself to his soldiers with these words: 'I’m married to Malki, and I have a daughter named Mika. One day, she’ll grow up and join the unit, and God help anyone who tries to mess with her.'' A lot of crazy things happened in Israel this past year. If you had the chance to tell your dad one thing from your personal life or something happening in the country, what would it be? Evyatar: 'Maybe that I wrote the booklet.' Mika: 'I’d tell him about all the terrorists that were eliminated and I think I’d also tell him that I traveled solo a few times.' Maia: 'I’d tell him that war broke out in the north, that I finished 12th grade and that we’re moving forward. Life goes on.'

Waiting to photograph the return of the hostages,' veteran Ynet ...	After 35 years covering warzones, Ziv Koren says nothing prepared him for October 7; 'A photograph is proof that it happened,' he reflects, stressing importance of documenting tragedy Veteran photojournalist Ziv Koren says he can barely remember life before October 7, 2023, the day Hamas launched a brutal attack on Israel. Like many Israelis, Koren awoke to a new reality that day, but as a professional, he quickly headed south under fire to document the events as they unfolded. Since then, he has been working tirelessly. 'I've been working 19 hours a day, seven days a week, for a year straight, to try to produce that significant body of work, which for me is a historical document that should remain here for future generations,' he told Ynet during a special broadcast marking the one-year anniversary of the massacre. Koren believes the world is split into two groups: 'Half who don’t remember October 7, and the other half who don’t believe it really happened. In the end, the photograph is such a significant document. It’s proof that things really happened, and that’s why I try to echo October 7 around the world,' he said, noting his collaboration with Israel’s Foreign Ministry to ensure global awareness. The truth is hidden behind the cliché: one picture is worth a thousand words, no matter how many interviews and speeches will be everywhere, in the global media. This picture, this photograph, has much more meaning. 'True. And that's why, again, I'm trying to create an echo for this footage, so there is also an exhibition that has been on display for several months at the Peres Center, and at the same time, the Foreign Ministry has an exhibition that has already been shown in many countries around the world. There is work with magazines abroad that publish the story, to keep the issue of October 7 relevant, and not forget in any way the issue of the hostages. These are the goals.' You got in touch with some of the hostages who returned, in the sense that you also accompany them. We saw it with Mia there, for example. really. How did such a relationship come about? 'First of all, it's on a daily level. I mean, especially since the project we did for Yedioth and Ynet, that we bring back significant figures whose lives changed on the seventh of October to the place where it happened. I must say that it has almost become my daily life - the fact that I am in touch with hostages who have returned, with wounded people who are still in rehabilitation, with families I accompany.' It also affects the image, the photography. 'Yes, but it's a double-edged sword, because you stab and are stabbed with the same degree of intensity, and these are really people who entered my heart and became, I can say, even my friends. I think that every citizen in the State of Israel should get up every morning and think about what he can do To end this unimaginable saga, there are Israelis who were kidnapped from their beds and are under the ground in Gaza. We cannot afford to normalize this event. It is impossible, and there are great minds in the world Here in this country, which has to find some kind of solution, it is impossible to normalize this event.' What moment are you waiting to take a picture? 'The return of the hostages. There will not be a happier moment than this in the history of the State of Israel.'

Golani officer undergoes final surgery after October 7 wounds, ey...	Lieutenant Niv Baranes severely wounded defending Kibbutz Nir Am from terrorists, leaving his military future uncertain; after multiple surgeries, including one by fellow Golani veteran, Baranes determined to return to battlefield alongside his comrades One year after being critically wounded during the October 7 Hamas attacks, Lieutenant Niv Baranes, 22, of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, has undergone his final surgery. The procedure was performed by Dr. Oren Michaeli, a Jewish-American surgeon who traveled to Israel specifically for the operation. Dr. Michaeli, who served in the Golani Brigade like Baranes, was joined by Prof. Dana Egozi, head of Plastic Surgery at Kaplan Medical Center. Baranes was wounded while defending Kibbutz Nir Am, which was spared from being breached by terrorists. 'The siren sounded, and shortly after, a drone dropped a mortar on us. We began fighting at 6:30 a.m.,' Baranes recalled. 'We attacked four terrorists before they could cross the fence.' During the battle, Baranes was shot in both hands. Despite being critically injured, he fought on for three hours before being evacuated to Kaplan Medical Center, where he underwent 12 surgeries over five weeks. During the battle, Sergeant Matan Abergil was killed after throwing himself on a grenade to save his comrades. 'I was in the field for three hours with a tourniquet, without reinforcements or anything,' Baranes said. 'Around 10:00 a.m., I was evacuated to Nir Am and arrived at Kaplan Medical Center by 1:30 p.m. I was hospitalized there for five weeks, undergoing 12 surgeries in a month. The bullets shattered my left arm. Last week, they stitched my nerves. 'I know all the guys who fell. It's not easy, but we have to keep moving forward. It will always be with me. Nir Am was not breached, partly thanks to my unit and my soldiers. We managed to protect the kibbutz. Now, either I'll return to the army, or I'll start real life.' Dr. Amir Oron, a senior orthopedic and hand surgeon at Kaplan, explained that hypersensitivity in Baranes' radial nerve required the expertise of Dr. Michaeli, who volunteered for the procedure. 'Niv dreams of returning to combat service, and I hope we can make that possible,' Oron said.

Sinwar 'revived the practice of suicide bombings', report says	Article details how Hamas' leader instructed terror group officials to reinstate attacks it avoided since the end of the Second Intifada days before a failed bombing in Tel Aviv The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar ordered to reimplement suicide bombing attacks against Israelis during the summer amid the war in Gaza shortly before a terrorist attempted to carry out an attack of that nature in Tel Aviv. 'the attack sent an unmistakable message,' the Wall Street Journal wrote. 'Now is the time to revive suicide bombings,' Sinwar said in a directive to a senior Hamas official according to an Arab intelligence source talking to the outlet. 'What a blessing it is that my bones become shrapnel that blow apart the usurping Zionist Jews,' Hamas terrorist Ja’far Sa’d Saeed Muna, who carried out the planned attack, said in a video later published by the Gazan terror group. According to the outlet, such attacks were largely discontinued by Hamas in the last two decades, and some of its officials feared renewing them would turn the terror group into a 'political paraiah.' However, 'Despite misgivings within Hamas, no one was willing to speak out against the practice once Sinwar was at the helm of the group,' the Arab intelligence source told the outlet. According to the Wall Street Journal, internal disagreements within Hamas have been present for years between some seeking the ultimate destruction of Israel via terror and those wishing to use these methods to acquire a legitimate political position for the ultimate goal of establishing a Palestinian state. 'Under Sinwar, Hamas can be expected to be a much clearer-cut, hard-line fundamentalist organization,' Matthew Levitt, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute think tank, told the Wall Street Journal. The American outlet continued to detail the mounting differences between Sinwar and Hamas' previous politburo head Ismail Haniyeh who was eliminated by Israel back in July. According to the Wall Street Journal, the two bolstered the terror group's ties with Iran, but Haniyeh believed Sinwar failed to understand Hamas' need to portray a legitimate political image for the Palestinian people on the international stage. The outlet added that while Haniyeh — who was present in Qatar alongside the rest of the group's politburo on October 7 — was aware of the planned massacre but was taken by surprise at its timing. 'Hamas officials in Doha, while publicly praising the October 7 attack, began privately criticizing Sinwar as a 'megalomaniac,'' Arab and Hamas officials told the Wall Street Journal. According to the report, Hamas’s political leadership started meeting with other 'Palestinian factions in early December to discuss reconciliation and a postwar plan without consulting Sinwar,' and added Haniyeh was open to an option of demilitarization of the terror group and a cease-fire agreement in Gaza, which Sinwar criticized as a 'shameful and outrageous,' move.

Tunnel rescue attempt, remote training and the 'Jewish Schindler'...	Nearly 10 years after 11-year-old Fawzia Amin Sido was kidnapped and taken to Gaza, she managed to send a message to her family through TikTok; They contacted Steve Maman, a Canadian-Moroccan Jew who had previously helped rescue more than 100 other Yazidi girls Months of negotiations, successes and setbacks culminated in the rescue of Fawzia Amin Sido, a 21-year-old Yazidi woman who was sold to a Hamas terrorist affiliated with ISIS in 2014, and freed last week from Gaza. The man behind the operation was Steve Maman, a Canadian-Moroccan Jewish businessman, known as the 'Jewish Schindler,' for his efforts in rescuing more than 100 Yazidi girls from ISIS. Fawzia's story raises questions about the potential for rescuing Israeli hostages who have been held in Gaza for more than a year. Like them, Fawzia was under the control of terror groups in Gaza. She managed to survive alone for nearly a year before sending a sign of life from the enclave. When Yazidis in Iraq face trouble, they know to call Maman – the man who has helped free many Yazidi captives. In an interview with Ynet, Maman explained that he is one of the few Jews the Yazidis know, and given his long history with their community they believed he was the right person to help with Gaza. Maman described the intense months leading up to the successful rescue, involving high-level political and military contacts in Israel and the U.S., even reaching out to former President Donald Trump to pass information to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'It all started in November 2023,' Maman said. 'Fawzia managed to upload a TikTok video, and her family realized she was still alive.' From that moment, the family knew they had to contact Maman because of his experience with the Yazidis. In a 2015 interview, Maman said Oscar Schindler, who saved about 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust, had been a major inspiration. 'He’s a hero not just to me but to everyone,' Maman said at the time, and since then he has continued his work. Growing up in Morocco, Maman learned about coexistence and heard stories about King Mohammed V, who is regarded as a hero among Moroccan Jews for protecting Jews during World War II. 'I'm the only Jew the Yazidis know who is connected to them,' Maman explained. 'Their logic was that because I’m Jewish I could get her out of Gaza. I wish it had been that easy. It was the hardest rescue operation I’ve ever done. The geopolitical challenges between Iraq and Israel, two countries that don’t communicate, made it so difficult. I eventually had to divide the tasks and work with each side separately. I needed Israel to open the door for her.' Maman said they trained Fawzia for months, teaching her to familiarize herself with the area in Gaza and approach Israeli forces. 'We trained her to make contact with the IDF, identify fences, and spot potential crossings,' he said. Meanwhile, constant negotiations were underway with various parties to solve the complex mission. In May, Maman visited Israel after one rescue attempt had already failed and shared Fawzia’s story during a Knesset meeting. One of the initial plans was to smuggle Fawzia into Egypt. 'Israel was focused on the war. I told my team we might be able to get her through the tunnels. I also had a team on the Egyptian side ready to pick her up.' Maman explained that external intermediaries indirectly offered to pay Hamas terrorists $5,000 to allow her passage through the tunnels. 'That was the price at the time to move her through the tunnels. Just as we were close to executing the plan, Egypt tightened its border control with Gaza, making it very difficult to cross. The fighting intensified, and Israel moved into the area.' At that point, Maman realized the Egypt plan had failed, and he shifted his focus to Israel. 'I said, there’s an option. I’m here now. There’s a Yazidi girl in Gaza. Let’s try to solve this diplomatically.' One of the biggest challenges was obtaining a passport or travel documents for her. 'With the help of Iraq and Jordan, I managed to get her a passport using a photo from a WhatsApp video call,' Maman said. The passport was essentially a one-way travel document through the Allenby Bridge border crossing between Israel and Jordan, which is how Fawzia ultimately left Gaza. Fawzia endured a harrowing ordeal in Gaza, with days spent wandering the streets and experiences too painful to put into words. Eventually, the gates to Israel opened for her, and from there she made her way to Iraq. 'Israel participated in the rescue,' Maman emphasized. 'This story shows that the Palestinians don’t just have a problem with Jews. They have a problem with every other non-Jew, or someone who is not Muslim.. This is the proof – a Yazidi woman held hostage.' Fawzia is now with her family in Iraq, leaving behind years of hardship in Gaza but also precious things close to her heart. Her recovery is complex, and she has been forbidden from discussing her ordeal or the details of her rescue for now. However, an official statement is expected to be released on her behalf soon.

Netanyahu blocks Gallant's trip to US, after setting conditions f...	Prime minister prevents defense minister from traveling to Washington to coordinate retaliation against Iran with Pentagon unless he can speak with Biden and Cabinet first approves next steps in war; Gallant was to meet with counterpart to ask for assistance in case of further Iranian assaults Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was set to leave Israel for Washington Tuesday night for a visit expected to tighten coordination between Israel and the U.S. amid preparations for an Israeli retaliation for the Iranian ballistic missile attack. However, as of late Tuesday night the flight was not yet approved, the trip is in danger of being canceled and U.S. officials are reportedly shocked over the issue. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set two conditions before approving Gallant's flight: a conversation to be held between the prime minister and U.S. President Joe Biden, after weeks of no communication between the two leaders, and a Security Cabinet approval of Israel's next steps. The government had not approved Gallant’s trip as of very late Tuesday night, leading to the announcement that it had being postponed. The Pentagon announced that Gallant would not be arriving in the U.S. as scheduled. 'We were just informed that Minister Gallant will be postponing his trip to Washington,' Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told a news briefing, referring questions about why Gallant canceled to Israel's government. Biden has avoided speaking with Netanyahu for several weeks, though he has had conversations with President Isaac Herzog, including this week for the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack. Netanyahu reportedly fears giving Gallant more clout with Biden and wants to show his Likud voter base that he’s preventing Gallant from coordinating with the Americans. U.S. officials are reportedly stunned – as this has gone from being a conflict between Netanyahu and Gallant to one also between Netanyahu and the Biden administration. The Americans were the ones who invited the defense minister, who is seen as their 'point of contact for the war,' and Gallant had coordinated his trip with the Prime Minister's Office beforehand. Up until hours before the scheduled departure, those close to Gallant were confident the trip would proceed as planned. 'Ultimately, decisions about cabinet members' trips to Washington are up to the Israeli government,' U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on the issue in a briefing. Gallant’s main goal in his trip was to project a show of power from Washington in a play to deter possible Iranian attacks against Jerusalem following a possible retaliation. NBC reported on Tuesday, citing two U.S. officials, that Israel hadn’t provided the U.S. with details regarding its response to the Iranian missile attack even after senior U.S. military officials publicly discussed the possibility of supporting an Israeli response. According to the officials, Gallant and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin discussed potential response options, but Israel’s final decision wasn’t shared. American officials believe that Israel has yet to make a definitive decision on how to act. The potential targets for the attack, according to the sources, include military and intelligence complexes, air defense systems and energy infrastructure. 'Gallant and Austin did not discuss nuclear facilities as possible targets,' NBC reported. Gallant and Israeli defense officials have been advocating for a strike on Iran and have presented plans to lawmakers, although no decision appears to have been made yet. Gallant was expected to meet with Austin to discuss the matter. In addition to Austin, Gallant was also scheduled to meet with President Biden’s advisors amid a severe crisis of trust between Netanyahu and Biden. Gallant was set to arrive in Washington with a clear message for the U.S. administration: Israel needs to strike Iran, but it should be done in the most effective way with maximum coordination with the U.S. Gallant believes the U.S. must project its strength in the region, from sending aircraft carriers to the region to displaying the joint cooperation between Israel and the U.S. While Israel doesn’t expect the U.S. to join in any strike, it looks for American support if and when Iran responds with another missile attack, as part of the international coalition formed during the war. 'We have the ability to cause significant damage to Iran, but the working assumption is that Iran will retaliate, which is why coordination with the U.S. is crucial. Iran is left without Hamas or Hezbollah as effective forces, but that doesn’t mean Israel shouldn’t prepare for a direct Iranian attack.' American officials visiting Israel said on Tuesday. 'It’s important Tehran understands the U.S. is with us in such a case.' Gallant also planned to ask Austin during his visit for aid in the form of various types of weaponry, particularly additional missile defense batteries against Iranian missiles and systems that can support Israel’s Arrow batteries both at sea and on land. Israel also intends to ask for heavy munitions, whose shipment has been delayed for months due to the ongoing war in Gaza. At present, Israel doesn’t face a shortage of munitions, but defense officials wish to prepare for future gaps that could arise in the event of a broader, all-out war. Bibi-Biden relationship revealed in Bob Woodward's new book Also on Tuesday, excerpts of veteran journalist Bob Woodward's new books were released that shed light on Biden's relationships with other world leaders, including Netanyahu. 'That son of a bitch, Bibi Netanyahu, he’s a bad guy. He’s a bad f***ing guy!' Biden said privately about the Netanyahu to one of his associates in the spring of 2024 against the backdrop of the Gaza war, Woodward writes. Following Israel’s entry into Rafah, Biden reportedly called Netanyahu a 'f***ing liar.' Adter the Israeli airstrike on Beirut in July that killed Fuad Shukr, Biden said, according to the book, 'Bibi, what the hell?' and adding 'You know, the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor.'

Loaded launcher and dugout for hiding: This is what a Hezbollah f...	IDF commander showcasing Hezbollah rocket launchers says it was used to fire daily at northern Israeli communities over the past year The IDF released a video on Tuesday showing Capt. N, a company commander in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade, unveiling a rocket-launching site that was discovered during ground operations. Capt. N displayed a loaded launcher concealed beneath a tree in an olive grove, connected by an electric cable to a more distant position from which Hezbollah terrorists could remotely fire the rockets. 'This is the launcher. As you can see, it’s aimed south, toward Israel. Right now, it’s armed with four warheads,' he explained while crouching beside the launcher. 'This launcher fired daily at northern Israeli communities over the past year – but not anymore.' The video then cut to a nearby position, where the commander showed a hidden dugout used by the rocket operator to retreat to safety after launching, protecting himself from IDF counterattacks. 'He hides here until the airstrikes are over, then he can return to his operational hideout,' Capt. N explained. The commander also pointed out boxes of Kalashnikov ammunition and the electrical mechanism that allowed the rockets to be launched from a distance. He showed a cable connecting the rocket-launching position to the launcher and another cable leading to what he described as an 'advanced weapons cache' containing rockets ready for firing. The video later shifted to a civilian structure where the commander showed explosives and launchers found in the home’s kitchen, with an ammunition crate hidden under the stove. In another video, a different soldier revealed a large weapons cache discovered in a house in one of the southern Lebanese villages where Golani troops had been operating. The soldier explained that the cache contained 'numerous anti-tank warheads,' enough for four Hezbollah ambushes. 'All of this weaponry was intended for northern Israeli civilians. It was within immediate reach and is very new, meaning the previous stock had already been used. We’ve disrupted a Hezbollah operation here,' he said, emphasizing, 'We’re here to protect the people of Israel and bring them back to the north.' According to an IDF statement, the Golani Brigade's combat team discovered a site in the area overlooking northern Israeli communities near the border, and it also uncovered underground infrastructure, hiding spots, and staging areas used by Hezbollah terrorists. Inside the residential building, the IDF discovered and destroyed a weapons cache, including rocket launchers in the kitchen, weapons, anti-tank missiles, camouflage nets, and combat vests. The IDF noted that they also found and eliminated weapons intended for planned ambushes against Israeli forces and northern Israeli towns.

Up at 4:45 a.m. to make the perfect lunchbox': Israel’s growing ...	Shaped bread, vegetable skewers and colorful stickers: more Israeli moms are replacing standard school sandwiches with creative lunchboxes; we spoke to three mothers about the trend’s benefits, costs, time commitment and the kids’ reactions When Maayan Hafuta from Nahariya goes to bed, she sets her alarm for 4:45 a.m. But it’s not for a long commute, an early workout or to watch the sunrise. Maayan has a passion for creating elaborate and beautifully designed lunchboxes for her three children – Noam, 9, Liam, 7, and Ilai, 5. 'I admit, I’m a little obsessed,' Maayan says. 'It takes me about two hours each morning, depending on how creative I decide to get. I don’t prepare anything the night before because I want it all to be fresh. I started when my eldest began preschool, and every year I get more into it. I spend hours on AliExpress looking for accessories to bring my ideas to life. I work in HR, mostly from home, but even when I used to commute, I still made the lunchboxes. If it means waking up 30 minutes earlier, I’ll do it.' How early can you wake up? 'I know it sounds crazy, but when you love something, it’s not that hard. This time in the kitchen with the lunchboxes is my 'me time.' It's more than just food for the kids – it's how I express myself. Even recently, when our routine was disrupted because of the fighting in the north and the schools were closed, I still got up and made the boxes. The kids love it, and that makes it all worth it.' Are they picky eaters? 'They’re not too fussy, but I’m very particular about making sure they eat well. We eat with our eyes first – when food looks good, you want to eat it, even if you’re not very hungry. I get so excited when the boxes come back empty.' What do you put in the lunchboxes? 'I wouldn’t call them 'healthy,' but I try to keep a balance. I do sneak in some sweets. My kids aren’t big fans of fruits and veggies, but I always include them. No tomatoes, because I know they won’t touch them, but I’ll cut cucumbers or carrots into fun shapes. I also use an edible marker to draw on sandwiches, which might have cottage cheese, an omelet, cheese or sometimes chocolate spread. 'There are always a few options in the box. If I bake muffins or pancakes, I try to make them healthier with ingredients like soy milk and spelt flour – things they usually wouldn’t eat, but they don’t mind when it’s presented this way. I also make extra food so they can share with other kids. Of course, I follow all the allergy guidelines set by the school.' 'I also include little notes with good morning wishes or riddles, and I stick on motivational stickers like ‘Mom loves you’ or ‘From the heart,’ just to add more meaning to the box and show them I’m thinking of them.' Do you go all out for meals at home too? 'Actually, yes. I don’t cut food into shapes, but I’m still particular about presentation. If I’m making burgers, I’ll add a toothpick and wrap the fries in paper to make the meal feel special. The kids love it –they think they’re eating at a restaurant.' What does your husband think? (Laughs) 'He thinks I’m certifiably crazy. Every night, I write out a menu for the next day and plan how I’ll arrange the lunchboxes. Sometimes he texts me things like, ‘I married a crazy lady – love you, go to bed!’ But in the end, he goes along with it. After all, I’m doing it for his kids, too.' How do others react? 'Some people ask if I don’t have anything better to do and suggest I sleep more, but those who know me understand. My sister says there’s no way she’d wake up that early to make lunchboxes. But I love it. When I started sharing my lunchboxes online, I got so much positive feedback and questions from people. Sure, there are always going to be those who think it’s a waste of time, but I hear less of that now.' How much do you spend on this hobby? 'I’d rather not say – so my husband doesn’t find out!' (Laughs) 'Of course, it adds up, but most of the items I buy aren’t disposable. I invest in good quality containers that last a long time, but yes, I’m always looking for new things, and that costs money. 'I make sure the lunchboxes are high-quality and completely sealed, so they last for years. I decorate them with stickers, but if the box is lower quality, it’s a nightmare to peel them off. At the beginning of each school year, I buy three high-quality lunchboxes, and each one costs around 170 shekels ($45). I know it sounds excessive, but normal people can use the same box for several years – I'm just a bit more obsessed!' Belgian waffle-shaped casserole For several years now, the lunchbox craze has been thriving in Israel, drawing inspiration from Japan’s bento culture. A bento is a takeout meal packed in a compact box, designed to maximize space and feature visually appealing, neatly arranged food. In stores, you'll find dozens of accessories for decorating food, from cutters in various shapes to colorful skewers. On TikTok, there are thousands of videos teaching how to make a green apple look cool, Instagram is filled with perfectly styled lunchbox photos, and on Facebook, groups connect thousands of mothers who want to give their kids more than just a plain sandwich. One such group, Kids' Lunchboxes, has 37,000 members, mostly mothers, who share their creations, gather inspiration, and swap recipes. The group’s administrator, Shirel Kaniznikov from Kiryat Malachi, is a mother of two – ages 12 and 7 – who enjoy special lunchboxes every morning. 'My daughter is a very picky eater,' Shirel shares. 'When she was 3 and in preschool, she’d bring her lunchboxes back full. That’s how I discovered bento culture, but it didn’t help much – she still ate mostly cucumbers and cheese. 'When my son started kindergarten, I noticed he wasn’t eating what I packed either, even though he’s not picky. I realized he needed more stimulation, so I started using the accessories I’d bought for my daughter. One day, I cut his toast into a puzzle shape, another time I put the vegetables on a skewer. Suddenly, the boxes came back empty.' So you started putting in more effort. 'My mom used to give my older sister 20 shekels and send us to the corner store for bread and cheese. My sister would say, ‘Let’s buy a chocolate bar and a bun – Mom won’t know,’ and that was my breakfast for years. I didn’t grow up with balanced meals and only learned to eat fruits and vegetables as an adult. My mom, bless her, didn’t put much effort into it. 'I’m not judging her, but even as a kid, I told myself I’d do things differently when I became a mom. Now, when my mom sees the lunchboxes I make, she asks, ‘Where do you get the energy? How do you have the patience?’ But honestly, when I see my kids eating and enjoying their food, I know I’ve done my part. Yesterday, I made a casserole in the shape of a Belgian waffle, and my son ate the whole thing.' How long does it take? 'Since I don’t pack huge portions and I prepare some things ahead of time, it takes me about 20 minutes. Of course, if I’m making something special like a casserole, it might take an hour. But generally, the kids eat things that are pretty easy to prepare. How long does it take to cut two cucumbers? I love the kitchen – I’m quick.' What’s inside the lunchbox? 'At home, I’m a pretty laid-back mom, but when it comes to school, I want them to eat well. There’s always a protein like cheese, tuna or hummus, some bread, two kinds of veggies or a veggie and a fruit, and a little snack on the side. Today, for example, I added pretzels.' What kind of accessories do you buy, and where from? 'Mostly from AliExpress – tiny forks, skewers, cutters, baking papers, stickers… it’s a whole world. It’s become a hobby for me. You’d be shocked if you saw my storage unit at home.' How much do all these accessories cost? 'I’ve spent a lot, I’ll admit – I went a little overboard. But the kids give great feedback; they appreciate it. One time, I made my son a dinosaur-shaped casserole. He came home and told me excitedly how all the kids crowded around his table to see his lunchbox. I was on cloud nine. I love feeding people, and I love hearing compliments.' Andy Dorfman Graitzer, 42, from Kibbutz Geva near Afula, prepares a carefully crafted lunchbox every morning for her 8-year-old daughter, Alma. After Alma was diagnosed with celiac disease a few months before starting first grade, Andy wanted to make sure her daughter’s meals were enjoyable and safe. 'She didn’t always want to eat, and there wasn’t always food available for her. I wanted to give her something fun and tasty, so I started preparing a specially designed lunchbox every morning. It takes me about 20 minutes. Sometimes I use cutters to create fun shapes in the bread, or I make fruit skewers,' she explains. 'We work closely with a nutritionist, and I make sure that Alma’s lunch has a little of everything: hummus, omelets and cheese. Many parents in the celiac community struggle with preparing meals because gluten-free food, unfortunately, isn’t the same. For example, gluten-free bread hardens like a rock when it cools. In these groups, we help each other with new ideas for what to pack, and that helps me keep things varied.' What should go into a child’s lunchbox? Nutritionist Yael Yoslevitz from Maccabi Healthcare Services in northern Israel stresses the importance of a balanced breakfast or mid-morning meal. 'Breakfast, or break-fast, is the meal that breaks the overnight fast. It’s essential for maintaining focus, balanced moods and optimal learning and functioning abilities. A lunchbox should include foods from all food groups.' Recommendations for a balanced lunchbox: Whole grains and complex carbohydrates: Carbs are a key source of energy. Choose complex carbohydrates, which help regulate blood sugar and provide lasting fullness. Look for breads that contain at least 50% whole grains. Proteins from both animal and plant sources: Proteins are vital for building body tissues, like building blocks for growth. Sources include dairy, eggs, meats and legumes such as lentils, beans and chickpeas. Fruits and vegetables: These are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, essential for overall health. Aim for at least five servings of colorful fruits and vegetables daily, with an emphasis on vegetables. Healthy fats: Fats are necessary for absorbing vitamins, hormone production and storing energy. Include sources like olive oil, avocados, tahini and natural nut butters. It's also crucial to pack the lunch in a way that maintains freshness and appeals visually to children. Andy highlights the importance of variety: 'We wouldn’t want to eat the same thing every day, so why should kids? Let them choose from a range of options – like cold pasta with vegetables and tuna or last night’s casserole with cut-up veggies.' Packaging also plays a significant role. Choose a lunchbox together with your child to make the experience more enjoyable. Additionally, always send your kid to school with a large water bottle, ensuring they stay hydrated throughout the day. Adding fresh or frozen fruit, mint or lemon can make water more appealing to kids.

Iran warns Gulf states against allowing airspace use for attacks	Tehran has told Gulf states it would be 'unacceptable' if they allowed their airspace to be used against Iran and any such move would draw a response, a senior Iranian official said on Tuesday, amid concerns about possible Israeli retaliation for last week's Iranian missile attack. The official was speaking as Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi headed to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states for talks. The comments also followed discussions between Iran and Gulf Arab capitals last week on the sidelines of an Asia conference in Qatar, when Gulf states sought to reassure Iran of their neutrality in any conflict between Tehran and Israel. 'Iran made it clear that any action by a Persian Gulf country against Tehran, whether through the use of airspace or military bases, will be regarded by Tehran as an action taken by the entire group, and Tehran will respond accordingly,' the senior Iranian official told Reuters. 'The message emphasised the need for regional unity against Israel and the importance of securing stability. It also made clear that any assistance to Israel, such as allowing the use of a regional countryâ€™s airspace for actions against Iran, is unacceptable,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syqk411qk1g	2024-10-08T12:12:32-07:00

Watch: IDF uncovers Hezbollah tunnel crossing into Israel	The 20-meter-long underground tunnel with no exit on the Israeli side, was discovered near Zar'it in southern Lebanon’s western sector and has been under Israeli control for months; IDF also continues with targeted airstrikes against dozens of Hezbollah underground command centers, killing more than 50 field commanders The IDF located and dismantled a Hezbollah tunnel that crossed about 10 meters (33 feet) from Lebanon’s Marwahin area into Israeli territory near the community of Zar'it, the military reported on Tuesday. The tunnel, found several months ago, was blocked at the border and had no exit into Israeli territory. Its discovery was part of the IDF's efforts to dismantle Hezbollah’s terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon. IDF troops, including special units, searched the tunnel and found weapons, explosive devices, and anti-tank missiles. The tunnel was under IDF control to prevent its use for terrorist activities. The IDF has not identified any other tunnels crossing from Lebanon into Israel. The tunnel extended about 20 meters in total and was likely dug over the past two years, according to military estimates. 'It’s a purely tactical route with no immediate impact,' the military said. Meanwhile, the IDF continues its search after detecting launch tunnels on the Lebanese side near Maroun al-Ras in the eastern sector and after uncovering Hezbollah’s underground infrastructure in villages across the region. Dozens of underground Hezbollah command posts were hit in airstrikes on Monday night, killing more than 50 tactical commanders. The IDF had been targeting them for months. Commandos from the 98th Division, operating in southern Lebanon’s eastern sector as part of the ground offensive that began last week, reported encountering heavily fortified Hezbollah positions. These positions were concealed and built of tough stone, making them difficult to dismantle. 'We’re halfway through, and there’s still work ahead in southern Lebanon,' the military said. The IDF noted that its forces have successfully isolated and neutralized Hezbollah ambushes. Over the past week, the commandos killed about 200 Hezbollah fighters, many of whom had been sent to reinforce the group. Every depot destroyed contained hundreds of weapons. Troops also used deceptive tactics to expose the terrorists. The scale of Hezbollah’s infrastructure forced the commandos to use around 100 tons of explosives in the first days of the operation to destroy Radwan Force’s weapons bunkers, which had been prepared for an invasion into Israel’s Galilee. The tunnels were also sealed with concrete. Addressing the ongoing threat of mortars and rockets, including the heavy Burkan rockets still present in Shia towns like Taybeh and Bint Jbeil, the IDF said: 'We’re achieving cumulative gains. We’re not only fighting on the ground but also conducting extensive airstrikes. The overall success of our operations will bring residents back to their homes.' The IDF stated that its forces destroyed underground routes and dozens of combat sites, uncovering and eliminating hundreds of weapons. Some of these weapons, including rockets, were seized from a Hezbollah depot by soldiers from the 890th Paratroopers Battalion. Lt. Col. Yoni, the battalion commander, said hours before the depot’s destruction, 'We found seven crates full of rockets that were intended to target Israel – new and fully operational. Nothing will remain here.' The military continues limited, targeted ground raids and airstrikes in southern Lebanon, based on precise intelligence, with the goal of neutralizing Hezbollah's capabilities and safely returning northern residents to their homes. On Monday, the IAF conducted a series of strikes in southern Lebanon on underground command centers of Hezbollah’s units in southern Lebanon: Nasser Unit, Bader Unit, Aziz Unit, and the Radwan Forces in the area. According to IDF assessments, In the 24 hours since Monday, 50 targets of the Aziz Unit, 30 targets of the Nasser Unit, and 5 targets of the Bader Unit were struck. Additionally, around 10 targets of the Radwan Forces and Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters, as well as approximately 30 targets of the medium-range rocket unit in southern Lebanon, were targeted. IDF announced Tuesday that it eliminated least 50 terrorists, including six senior commanders from Hezbollah's Southern Front and the Radwan Forces. The senior terrorists that were eliminated were identified as: Ahmad Hassan Nazal, head of the attack sector in Bint Jbeil for the Radwan Forces; Hussein Talal Kamal, head of the Ghajar sector; Musa Diab Barakat, outgoing head of the Ghajar sector; Mahmoud Mus Karnib, operations chief for the Ghajar sector; Ali Ahmad Ismail, artillery commander for the Bint Jbeil sector; Abdullah Ali Dakik, artillery commander for the Ghajar sector Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy7lnx71kl	2024-10-08T12:00:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/12/16/H1xm5IgKqY/H1xm5IgKqY_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
US says cease-fire call shows Hezbollah on back foot	Hezbollah's call for a cease-fire on Tuesday shows the terrorist group is on the back foot, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a regular briefing on Tuesday. Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem said in a televised address on Tuesday the Iran-backed group's capabilities were intact and its fighters were pushing back Israeli ground incursions, despite the 'painful blows' inflicted by Israel in recent weeks. Qassem also said the group supported the efforts of Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally, to secure a cease-fire, without providing further details on any conditions demanded by Hezbollah.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byrgsem11x	2024-10-08T11:44:33-07:00

Netanyahu confirms Israel eliminated 'Nasrallah’s replacement'	In televised message to Lebanon's residents, prime minister says IDF eliminated former terror group leader's heir apparent Hashem Safieddine as well as his successor Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday that Hashem Safieddine, former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's heir apparent, was eliminated in Lebanon. 'We took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah’s replacement, and the replacement of his replacement,' Netanyahu said. Safieddine was targeted during a meeting of Hezbollah officials in Beirut's Dahieh quarter last Thursday. He served as the head of Hezbollah's executive committee and was Nasrallah's cousin. The identity of Al-Din's replacement, which Netanyahu referred to, remains unclear at this time. 'This is a message to the people of Lebanon: Do you remember when your country was called the pearl of the Middle East? I do. So, what happened to Lebanon? A gang of tyrants and terrorists destroyed it. That's what happened. Lebanon was once known for its tolerance, for its beauty. Today, it's a place of chaos, a place of war,' Netanyahu said at the start of his message, broadcast in English. 'Israel withdrew from Lebanon 25 years ago. But the country that actually conquered Lebanon is not Israel. It's Iran. Iran, which finances and arms Hezbollah to serve Iran's interests at Lebanon's expense. Hezbollah has turned Lebanon into a stockpile of ammunition weapons and a forward Iranian military base. 'Israel has decided to put an end to this. We've decided to do whatever is necessary to return our people safely to their homes. Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel also has a right to win! And Israel will win! We have degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities; We took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah’s replacement, and the replacement of his replacement,' the prime minister continued. 'Today, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years. Now you, the Lebanese people, you stand at a significant crossroads. It is your choice. You can now take back your country. You can return it to a path of peace and prosperity. If you don’t, Hezbollah will continue to try to fight Israel from densely populated areas at your expense. 'It doesn't care if Lebanon is dragged into a wider war. Christians, Druze, Muslims – Sunnis and Shiites – all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah's futile war against Israel. Today I ask every mother and every father in Lebanon a simple question: Is it worth it? Because, it doesn't have to be that way,' Netanyahu said. 'I know you want a better future for your children. So I am speaking to all of you today. There is a better way. A better way for your children, for your cities, for your villages, for your country. You deserve to restore Lebanon to its days of tranquility; you deserve a Lebanon that is different. One Country – One Flag – One People. 'Don't let these terrorists destroy your future any more than they've already done. Stand up and take your country back. You have an opportunity that hasn't existed in decades. An opportunity to take care of the future of your children and grandchildren. You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza. It doesn't have to be that way. 'Each of you can take a step for your future. Even a small step. You can make a difference. I say to you, the people of Lebanon: Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end. Free your country from Hezbollah so that your country can prosper again, so that future generations of Lebanese and Israeli children will know neither war nor bloodshed, but will finally live together in peace,' Netanyahu concluded.

Jewish rep in Iran's parliament complains officials in Tehran com...	Dr. Homayoun Sameh attacked Israel as usual, but this time he also criticized regime officials in Tehran; 'Some officials of our country mistakenly use the word 'Jew' instead of 'Zionist' in their statements, which casts a shadow over the Jewish community in Iran' As Israel plans to possibly attack Iran in response to it launching 181 missiles at Israel last week, the representative of the Jewish community in the Iranian parliament, Dr. Homayoun Sameh, criticized regime officials in Tehran. In an interview with the media in Iran, he stated that 'all the Jews of the world should not be blamed for the crimes of the Zionist regime.' 'If a Jewish person commits a crime and tarnishes the name of Jews throughout the world, it is like ISIS, Taliban and Al-Qaida carrying out attacks all Muslims being blamed.' He added: 'They committed a huge massacre in the world, and Islam did not, so we should not blame all Jews when a person who considers himself a Jew commits a crime.' Sameh also attacked Israel. 'The actions taken by the Zionist regime are political, and its actions have nothing to do with the teachings of Moses, peace be upon him, and many Jews in the world have condemned the actions of the Zionists,' he said. Later in the interview, the Jewish representative criticized a number of regime officials. 'Unfortunately, some officials of our country mistakenly use the word 'Jew' instead of 'Zionist' in their statements, which casts a shadow over the Jewish community in Iran. Sameh, who serves as a member of the Health and Medical Committee of the Iranian Parliament, said that condemnations against Israel were published not only in Iran, but also in Western countries 'by Jewish associations such as American Jews.' According to him, the condemnations 'teach that they are angry about the crimes of the Zionists and consider them inhumane and against human rights.' He noted that 'the presence of the Zionist regime in the region strengthens the interests of the Western countries. 'They increase the sale of weapons for profit.' He added that 'all the countries of the world, whether they are Islamic or not, should coordinate to act against the Zionist regime, and resist in a practical way so that the crimes of this regime will stop.'

Families of hostages met with Qatari representatives, Israel's UN...	Danny Danon said that mediators are eager to reach a deal, adding: 'Every day the hostages remain in the tunnels, their chances of returning alive diminishes' Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, addressed ongoing negotiations for the release of hostages on Tuesday. 'There was an important meeting between the families of the hostages and the Qatari ambassador,' he said. While Danon didn't attend the meeting, his comments followed a report from the Saudi network Al Arabiya that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar had recently contacted Qatar after a prolonged period of silence, during which his status was uncertain. Danon noted that 'mediators, including Qatar, Egypt and especially the U.S., are working to advance the process. I hope this will gain momentum. We believe it will; we want negotiations and progress on a new deal. But military pressure is also important – the combination of both is crucial.' When asked about the meeting’s content, Danon didn’t share specifics. 'I will just say that the mediators are eager to see some progress and are using their influence and capabilities. We should welcome that,' he said. 'As much as we despise Hamas and are determined to destroy it, we know that every day the hostages remain in the tunnels, their chances of survival diminish. That’s why we must act as quickly as possible on all fronts.' Danon also discussed a UN ceremony marking the anniversary of October 7, which was attended by hundreds of ambassadors, diplomats and Jewish leaders. He emphasized its significance. 'At the UN, people constantly speak against Israel, forgetting October 7 and focusing only on the suffering of the Gazans and Lebanese. Even ambassadors who aren’t particularly supportive of us, when faced with a bereaved mother speaking about her two daughters murdered at the Nova music festival, or Rabbi Doron Peretz recounting how his son Daniel’s body is being held by Hamas, it’s hard to remain indifferent. That’s why the event was so important.' Danon also addressed the absence of UN Secretary-General António Guterres from the event, explaining, 'We have a very complex relationship. I’ve known him for many years—he used to come to my house for Shabbat dinners. But something changed in him. Since October 7 he has become extremely antagonistic. I proposed a dialogue to de-escalate tensions, but it hasn’t happened. In my opinion, the secretary-general needs to be far more objective.'

UK, Netherlands fear rise in terror when Israel retaliates agains...	UK's MI5 chief says UK experienced worrying rise in external terror threats coming from Tehran, Moscow and radical Islamic terror groups including ISIS The UK's MI5 intelligence agency Director General Ken McCallum warned Tuesday of threats to the UK coming from Russia, Iran and Islamist terrorist groups including the Islamic State (ISIS). McCallum made his remarks during the annual update on the threats facing the UK and his comments are considered unusual. According to the MI5 head, the UK is dealing with a 'staggering rise' in assassination attempts by Russia and Iran on its soil. He said that both of the UK's adversaries are hiring criminals 'to do their dirty work.' McCallum noted that MI5 and the police have foiled 20 Iranian plots over the past two years and warned that Tehran might expand its targets in the UK if Israel launches a strong retaliatory strike in response to last week’s missile attacks. McCallum said the war in the Middle East and Israel’s fighting with Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen could lead to terror attacks in the UK. Talking about Iran, he mentioned that the escalation in the Middle East increases the likelihood of 'an increase in — or broadening of -– Iranian state aggression in the UK' The number of MI5 investigations aimed at thwarting threats to national security has increased by 48% over the past year. McCallum explained that most of the threats have come from Iran, Russia and China. He added that Russia’s military intelligence agency is trying to sow chaos in the UK and other European countries, partly through sabotage and arson. In his statement, McCallum noted that over 750 Russian diplomats have been ousted from European countries since the invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, and said that 'the vast majority' of them were spies. The MI5 chief added that 75% of the counterterrorism cases the UK is dealing with are related to radical Islam, while the rest involve far-right terrorism. Meanwhile, Norway has raised its terrorism threat assessment to the second-highest level due to an increased risk of attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets, the national police directorate said on Tuesday. Last week police in neighboring Denmark charged two men suspected of detonating hand grenades near Israel's Copenhagen embassy, while police in Sweden are investigating a suspected shooting near the Israeli diplomatic mission in Stockholm. 'PST raises the terror threat level in Norway from moderate to high as a result of the ongoing escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. It is primarily the threat to Jewish and Israeli targets that has been further intensified,' local police said in a statement.

She enlisted in IDF to honor her fallen brother; now she serves a...	Driven by the memory of her brother, fallen IDF soldier Avichai, and the desire to honor his legacy, Shira Emuna Amsalem enlisted at age 35 to lift the morale of soldiers, creating inspiring content that reinforces their historical and cultural significance 'We lost an exceptional soldier, we lost Amsalem,' said Avichai's commander after he died. I thought to myself, there's no way Hamas wins and there's no soldier Amsalem; there was a soldier Amsalem, and now there isn't? I am a soldier Amsalem,' shares Shira Emuna Amsalem, sister of the late Master Sergeant (Res.) Avichai Amsalem, who fell in battle in the south a year ago. Despite dealing with a chronic lung disease, Shira Emuna chose to enlist in the IDF following her younger brother's death. She joined the Military Rabbinate at the age of 35. Avichai Amsalem was called up for reserve duty on October 8 and fell the next day, October 9, during an encounter with terrorists who had infiltrated and planned an attack. His father, Col. Gabi Amsalem, also joined the reserves in the Military Rabbinate at the start of the war. During the conflict, he was promoted from lieutenant colonel to colonel by the IDF Chief of Staff. Shira Emuna serves in the Military Rabbinate in the Jewish Consciousness Values department located near Lod, in central Israel – the military base where many bodies from the October 7 massacre were taken. 'This year was complex,' she reflects. 'I think the first year of mourning brings various challenges, experiencing everything for the first time: his birthday, every holiday without him. We threw ourselves into many commemorations, and everyone started to find their place. It was a year of waves, with many ups and downs.' Gabi Amsalem knows the military from the inside, but this year was different for him due to the war's scale and the personal loss: 'There is life before October 7 and life after October 7. Life changes, perspectives shift. The military activity helps me keep my head above water in this situation imposed on us.' A year of longing for a brother and son turned into action for them. The family says this is how Avichai would have wanted them to act after his death. 'Avichai was a very principled person. He left behind many values I lecture and discuss – values of kindness, integrity, excellence – at home, in studies, work and the army,' says his father. 'He always aspired to achieve more. He reached a special unit and excelled there, yet remained humble and modest. He never flaunted his achievements, and he had quite a few. In his work at Elbit, in his studies, and he never boasted about it.' After Avichai's death, his older sister sought to follow in his footsteps and eventually enlisted for reserve service as a content writer. Her enlistment was part of the 'Stage B' program, which allows those who served in civilian or national service outside the military to undergo a short basic training and join the reserve force. 'After 12th grade, I did national service, and I think it complements,' she says. 'When you're directed to help the people of Israel, you need to know your strengths. At 18, I knew what I could offer the people of Israel and what strengths I had. I was the coordinator of the Oz children's movement in the north and spent a year as an emmisary in the United States. Avichai's death caught me between jobs. My profession is writing and editing content, and there was a need here for a content writer in the unit, so I came to do what I could.' Strengthening the spirit Initially, the IDF was hesitant to place her in a role, but Shira Emuna was determined to enlist. 'When she enlisted, I felt the excitement of a father taking his child to first grade for the first time. The truth is, when she started first grade, I was the principal of her school,' says the emotional father, whose daughter serves close to his office. 'I helped her find a uniform, and we sent the photos to friends. Shira is known in the family for achieving the goals she sets for herself. They didn't want to enlist her, they showed her the door, she came through the window, they closed the window and she found another way in.' 'All the kids in the neighborhood asked me where the rifle was, and I had to explain that my role is to encourage those in uniform,' she shares. 'I remember when my dad saw me in uniform for the first time, he was very emotional. For me, it’s significant because I hadn’t worn a uniform until now. I always admired soldiers I saw on the street, and now I’m in uniform. A hundred years ago, we dreamed of a Jewish army. The fact that initially they didn’t want to enlist me and I fought for it makes it even more emotional.' Why didn't you say 'We lost Avichai, we paid a heavy price, now we are focusing on mourning and our recovery' Gabi says that 'Avichai would have told Shira Emuna and me – continue to do for the people of Israel. He wouldn’t have said, 'I did, I gave, I finished my inventory.' We are there contributing to the people of Israel. On a personal level, I feel I receive much more than I give. The very fact that I do a lot, am busy a lot, allows me to cope with the pain and feel the camaraderie of the people of Israel.' 'I feel I managed to channel my pain into action for the greater good,' says Shira Emuna. 'The evil acts of October 7 were also done to weaken our spirit, and I took on a role whose essence is to strengthen the spirit for myself and for religious female soldiers who sometimes feel a bit isolated in the places where they serve and need this reinforcement.' A reminder of the historical significance: Both have embraced the role of uplifting the spirit – supporting soldiers, boosting morale and providing talks and materials on the importance each soldier holds in history. 'Beyond everything the Military Rabbinate does, including handling casualties, there's a whole branch dedicated to the fighting spirit,' Gabi explains. 'When we lift the spirits of the troops, it enhances our ability to cope in tough times, and with this strength, we will also reach Simchat Torah. Our main focus this past year has been nurturing the fighting spirit. Shira Emuna creates content for female soldiers, there are multimedia products, and we bring lecturers, artists and actors to the units to help elevate the soldiers' morale.' 'The goal is to reach every soldier with our content,' Gabi says. 'We are focused on strengthening morale. You wouldn't believe how many soldiers desire and need this. We come during their limited free time and find the right moments for them, which is of tremendous importance.' 'When soldiers are overwhelmed with continuous tasks, at some point it becomes exhausting,' Shira Emuna says. 'It's tiring. The sleeping conditions aren't always five-star hotel quality. When someone arrives and gives you a pamphlet, a page or even a file via WhatsApp, suddenly you are reminded that you're part of a historical process spanning thousands of years, known as the people of Israel. Everything you do gains perspective, especially for a religious female soldier who sometimes enlists alone, sometimes in combat roles where there aren't many others like her. I create content for them to give them the spirit they need.' She continues: 'My writing draws inspiration from Jewish women throughout history. For Hanukkah, we wrote about Hannah and her seven sons, and for Purim about Esther. These are stories of heroism that were often behind the scenes until they succeeded. The writing can speak to a religious girl who may be alone on base.' 'When I'm in the field,' Gabi adds, 'I also see non-religious female soldiers who engage with Shira Emuna's content, and it resonates with them, and they connect to it.' They are now preparing for the anniversary of Avichai's death, carrying mixed emotions from the past year. 'My message is that we need to strengthen unity and togetherness within the people of Israel,' Gabi states. 'In the army, we create unity among soldiers, and it's important that we also connect all types of populations in the nation. Connection, embraces and closeness are crucial, and we hope it reaches all of Israel. There are disagreements, but they will diminish, and unity will prevail.' 'I believe everyone has a responsibility for connection and unity in the nation,' Shira Emuna says. 'The home front and the frontlines are two sides of the same coin. A strong home front empowers the frontlines.' The holiday season brings significant difficulty and complexity. 'The annual memorial for Avichai will be two days after Simchat Torah. On that holiday, he was called up from home, leaving behind a pregnant wife and two daughters,' Gabi recalls. 'On Simchat Torah, we'll feel it was the day he left home. Will I dance with a Torah scroll in the synagogue, or will I lack the strength? I don't know.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjpbtugy1l	2024-10-08T09:25:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/07/SJhlaEW1ye/SJhlaEW1ye_0_613_1200_676_0_small.jpg
Sinwar 'didn't make contact' with mediators, Israeli officials sa...	Following long period in which contact was lost with Hamas' leader, officials say Arab media report claiming he's alive is incorrect and his fate remains uncertain Israeli officials on Tuesday said recent reports claiming Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar made contact with Qatar are incorrect, amid uncertainty about his fate following a prolonged period in which contact with him was lost. 'It's not true, Sinwar didn't make contact with mediating countries,' the officials said. Israel has been investigating whether Sinwar was injured or killed in one of the IDF strikes in Gaza since September after contact with him was lost, according to the terror group. Last week, during a meeting attended by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, a question mark was placed on his picture in a briefing held there. According to a report released on Monday, it seemed that Sinwar was still alive, but it seems now that the issue remains uncertain. A New York Times report published over the weekend noted that U.S. officials believe the mastermind of the October 7 massacre is still alive and making 'critical decisions,' even a year after October 7. Washington believes Sinwar is determined to see Israel embroiled in a full-scale war across the Middle East, especially with the IDF's entry into southern Lebanon for the first time since 2006. As a result, he has no intention of negotiating a hostage deal.

'If we don't do anything, then Lebanon tomorrow could resemble what Syria has become,' Jean-Noel Barrot told lawmakers in parliament. '(That is), a hub of instability for smuggling, terrorism and a point of departure for a large migration of civilians seeking refuge in Europe.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1stwrfjjl	2024-10-08T08:37:05-07:00	
You told me you couldn’t breathe': Former hostages write to thei...	Aviva Siegel and Sapir Cohen, who experienced horror in Hamas captivity and were released in hostage deal recall ordeal in letters and ask for their loved ones not to lose hope Aviva Siegel was kidnapped on October 7 alongside her husband Keith from Kibbutz Kfar Aza and was released in the first hostage deal without him. Sapir Cohen was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz with her partner Sasha Trufanov, who is still being held in Gaza, along with Eitan Horn, who was with her in captivity. In letters they wrote, both women recount the difficult moments they experienced in captivity, along with those still left behind who are enduring the same hardships every day. Sapir Cohen was held in Gaza for 55 days before being released in the first hostage deal. She was kidnapped along with her partner, Sasha Trufanov, from his family's home in Nir Oz. In a letter she wrote to Eitan Horn, with whom she was held in captivity, Cohen shared: 'I remember the early days of captivity when you lay on the mattress without moving, eyes closed, trying to imagine you weren't part of this reality. Occasionally, there were whispers I couldn't understand because you were debating which language to speak in, wondering what would be safer.' 'After several days of hunger, one of the captors came by and handed out small chocolates. Each of us took one without hesitation, but you chose not to. I was surprised and wondered why and then you explained you simply couldn’t eat. Thoughts about what would happen tomorrow, and whether we’d even make it to that day, about the moment your parents were told you and your brother had been kidnapped, they paralyzed you,' she added. 'I remember the songs you sang to us, even the terrorists hummed along. When you didn’t have an appetite, you told me, 'Don’t worry Sapir, at least I’ll come back to Israel skinny and fit, ready to find a bride.'' 'We tried to encourage you to talk and open up over time. I remember you telling me that the Eitan in captivity wasn’t the same Eitan, that the difference was so vast. Eitan is a person full of joy and humor, always thinking of how to help others before himself, a gifted poet and not a bad singer at all. With time you decided to make a change, to set the fear aside and try to be the Eitan you were before you 'got lost,' and you truly made significant progress,' she wrote. 'I remember the day you said you saw the number 10 suddenly appear on the wall. You were convinced we would be released in 10 days. You were right; I was released, but you stayed behind along with other men who dreamed of their own moment of freedom. You all came to hug me, to say goodbye. I remember the tears. As usual, I was optimistic and said: 'Guys, no need to get emotional, we’ll see each other back in Israel in two days,'' she also recalled. 'You were half optimistic, half scared, wondering what would happen if something went wrong, if you'd be forgotten or if you weren't important enough. I want you to know that we’re fighting for you at every day and every moment. We will continue to say your names and won't stop this difficult, dark journey until you’re free. I remember the songs you sang to us, even the terrorists hummed along. When you didn’t have an appetite, you told me, 'Don’t worry Sapir, at least I’ll come back to Israel skinny and fit, ready to find a bride.'' Aviva Siegel to her husband Keith: ‘I can't understand how you're still in there.’ Aviva and Keith Siegel moved to Kibbutz Kfar Aza when they made aliyah from the U.S. 40 years ago. They were abducted from the kibbutz on October 7, and Aviva was released after 51 days as part of the hostage deal. Her husband is still being held by Hamas. In her letter, Aviva wrote: 'When I landed in the helicopter at Wolfson Children's Hospital and met our sweet children, I couldn’t believe I was there without you. I was in shock for at least a few weeks before I could even grasp that we were separated and that I’m here without you.' 'Do you remember the tunnel they took us to and left us alone there? Do you remember how hard it was to breathe? I remember looking at you, barely able to speak, and you told me you couldn’t breathe.' 'I remember we were there in that small room in Gaza and I came to tell you that they said I needed to leave. I looked at you and saw the fear in your eyes; you couldn't say a word. I looked at you and told you that I would be strong for you, and you would be strong for me, and I swear to you Keith, that’s the only thing that goes through my mind all day and all night. 'I’m staying strong for you so that you can stay strong for me and for the children and grandchildren. I truly hope you're managing to hold on there. Do you remember the tunnel they took us to and left us alone there? Do you remember how hard it was to breathe? I remember looking at you, barely able to speak, and you told me you couldn’t breathe,' she recalls, 'I looked at you and told you that everything was okay, that it just seemed that way. Deep inside, I believed those were our last moments; I saw your chest barely able to rise and I just prayed that you wouldn’t die, that I wouldn’t be left there alone with you dead next to me. Do you remember how hungry we were? How we begged them to fill our little water bottle that had been empty for an entire day?' 'I can't understand how you're still in there. I can't understand how the world is silent. I can't understand how people hear the terrible stories I tell of what we went through and what you're still going through, and the sun keeps rising and setting, while you're stuck in this nightmare,' Aviva continued. 'Keith, I beg you to believe that you'll come home. I ask you not to lose hope. I ask you not to stop imagining the moment when you’ll exit the helicopter and land in Israel with us. We’re all waiting for you so much. I can’t wait to make you the food you love, I can’t wait to tell you that Shay survived everything that happened in Kfar Aza and he’s okay, he’s crossing his fingers for you, hoping you're okay too,' she wrote. 'We're all dreaming and imagining the moment when we can hug you. And it will come, and it will be perfect, and we’ll slowly be able to start our new lives together.'

US senators in Jerusalem say no Saudi normalization is 'victory' ...	Sens. Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal hold news conference in Jerusalem during state visit and stress importance of Saudi normalization with Israel and action against Tehran Prominent U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Saudi Arabia and Israel on Tuesday to establish diplomatic ties by the end of the year, warning that the next U.S. administration is unlikely to be able to secure enough votes to support the deal. 'If by Christmas we do not have a normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran will have a strategic victory,' Graham said in a press conference from Jerusalem alongside Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. The Biden administration is seeking to broker a normalization accord between the two countries that would include U.S. security guarantees for Gulf state Saudi Arabia, among other bilateral deals between Washington and Riyadh. 'We can get you a treaty through the Senate between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a defense agreement like you have in Japan and Australia, if you do it on President Biden's watch,' Graham, who is seen as close to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, told reporters. 'It has been a constant policy of the U.S. to try to avoid a nuclear-armed Iran… but attacking a nuclear facility right now is, perhaps, not the wisest course to take,' Blumenthal said, adding that further escalation of the war may not be in the best interests of Israel and the U.S. interests. 'I don’t know what targets Israel will pick, but I know it will respond,' Graham said. 'Missile defense worked very well, but eventually one will get through and kill Israelis. It’s just a matter of time, and that would trigger a massive response.' Democrat Joe Biden's term as president will end on Jan. 20. Graham, a longtime senator, is a key Republican in Congress with influence on foreign policy and national security matters. Graham, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, said he would travel to Saudi Arabia to meet de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and to the United Arab Emirates for talks with President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The UAE established relations with Israel in 2020 as part of the so-called Abraham Accords. Saudi officials, including Prince Mohammed, have discussed potentially establishing ties with Israel but over the past year insisted that it include at least the pathway to a Palestinian state, a markedly steeper challenge since the Gaza war erupted. Israeli-Saudi normalization could open the door to many other Arab and Muslim-majority nations forging ties with Israel and thus bolstering regional stability, given Riyadh's sway in the Muslim world as home to Islam's two holiest sites in Mecca and Media. Two-state solution 'dead' But even before the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Gaza's ruling Hamas terrorists that triggered the war, Netanyahu's right-wing government had rejected a 'two-state solution' to the conflict with the Palestinians. Graham said the two-state solution - an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel - had been 'dead' ever since the cross-border assault by Hamas gunmen, who killed about 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage a year ago. 'The Israeli public will not accept a Palestinian state as a result of this barbaric terrorist attack, because it's rewarding terrorism. I get that,' Graham said, but he added Israel could work with Riyadh, along with the UAE, on the Palestinian file. Riyadh has repeatedly called for an end to the war and said the two-state solution and regional stability are interdependent. Netanyahu has said that establishing diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia would lead to a 'historic reconciliation' between Arab states and Israel, and between Islam and Judaism and vowed to pursue an accord. Israel has diplomatic ties with a few Arab or Muslim-majority states including the UAE, Egypt, Jordan and Morocco.

Bandages and missing fingers: Iranian footage shows injured Hezbo...	Video of Hezbollah terrorists injured in pager attack shows them visiting a tomb in the city of Mashhad, with their hands and eyes bandaged after receiving medical treatment in Iran The Iranian news agency Mehr released footage of Hezbollah terrorists injured in pager and walkie talkie explosions across Lebanon last month. The video made public on Tuesday shows terrorists from the group with bandaged hands and eyes, likely from blast injuries. Some are even seen in wheelchairs. According to the agency, these Hezbollah terrorists are now in Iran receiving medical treatment. In the footage, they are shown visiting the tomb of Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha in the city of Mashhad. After the first pager explosion on September 18, Iranian media reported that the Iranian Red Crescent had transported 95 injured individuals from Lebanon to Iran for further treatment. 'Most of the injured suffered hand and eye wounds. Upon arrival in Iran, they were transferred to hospitals for continued care,' according to the head of the Red Crescent. The latest Mehr video highlights these hand injuries. Lebanese network MTV reported on September 18 that Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, who was also injured in the pager explosion, was flown from Beirut to Tehran to complete his treatment. Around 90 other injured individuals, along with their families, were on the same flight. In the days following his injury, Amani said: 'My injury is an honor, as I stood with the Lebanese people during this war crime.' While receiving treatment in Tehran, he was visited by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.

Italian TV crew attacked by man while filming in southern Lebanon	A man attacked and followed the crew of Italy's Tg3 public broadcaster as they filmed in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, trying to break the video camera.

World unites in commemoration of October 7 and calls for release ...	Commemorations around world over marked first anniversary of Hamas attack, with events from the US to Europe honoring the victims; 'We are showing the world that despite the loud anti-Israel minority, the majority supports Israel' On Monday, commemorations were held around the world to mark the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas massacre, as communities honored the victims and raised awareness about the hostages still held in Gaza. In the United States, students from elementary to college levels participated in the 'Yellow Shirt Initiative,' organized by Club Z, a Jewish advocacy group. Students wore yellow to remember the victims of the attack and to call attention to the 101 hostages still in captivity, including seven American citizens and a baby, Kfir Bibas, kidnapped at nine months old. 'By wearing yellow, we are sending a clear message that none of us are alone,' said Masha Merkulova, founder of Club Z. 'We are showing the world that despite the loud anti-Israel minority, the majority supports Israel and the release of hostages.' 'Many students have encountered Jew hatred in their schools after October 7. They often feel alone and isolated. By fellow students, teachers, and strangers all wearing yellow to remember the horrors of October 7 and the hostages still in captivity, we are sending a clear and strong message that none of us are alone,' said Masha Merkulova, founder of Club Z. 'The families of the hostages will see that they are not forgotten. Club Z empowers us to have a voice and to learn how to lead change for good. I am proud of this student-led initiative. Together, we are showing the world that despite the loud anti-Israel minority, the majority supports Israel, supports the release of hostages from the hands of a terror organization and stands with humanity,' The yellow ribbon has been a popular emblem of support during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis (when 52 Americans were held in captivity in Tehran for 444 days), for military families during Operation Desert Storm and a symbol of a loved one who is missing or has been abducted (for example, Fiona Cameron wore yellow ribbons after her daughter Sasha was abducted in 1999). 'The yellow symbolizes awareness and support, it sends a message that we are all together, especially for those far from home,' explained Club Z teen Eli Fooksman, 'you don’t need to be Israeli or Jewish to mourn the loss of so many innocent lives on October 7 or to call for the unconditional release of children, women and men. It’s not an Israeli issue. It is a humanitarian issue.' In the Netherlands, around 2,000 people gathered in the town of Barneveld in a memorial event organized by Christians for Israel. The event featured prayers, speeches and a performance of the song Am Yisrael Chai led by Dutch Chief Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs. 'Anti-Zionism is antisemitism,' Rabbi Jacobs told the crowd, a message that resonated as attendees expressed solidarity with Israel. 'These 2,000 people here today are just a small part of the more than 60,000 members we have across the Netherlands,' said Frank van Oordt, CEO of Christians for Israel. 'We are here not only to mourn but to express hope—hope that even in the most difficult of times, love and solidarity can overcome hatred and violence.' 'Our love and support for Israel are boundless. We stood together today as a testament to the power of friendship and faith, and we will continue to do so in the days to come,' van Oordt said in his closing remarks. 'We stood here today, as we have stood for years, united in our belief that Israel deserves our support not just in words but in action,' said Christians for Israel Chairman Rev. Frank Heikoop, emphasizing the movement’s unwavering commitment to supporting Israel. 'This gathering shows the deep bond that exists between our nations.' In Vienna, the 104-year-old Wunderwerk Wien church hosted an event standing against rising antisemitism. Pastor Birgit Berchtold, who leads the Pentecostal-charismatic congregation, emphasized the church’s historical support for Israel, saying, 'As Christians, our faith compels us to stand with Israel not only in words but in action. We believe that by supporting Israel, we are living out our calling to love, honor and protect those who are persecuted.' Sweden also hosted a memorial service, with hundreds gathering at Kristet Center in Örebro to stand with Israel and honor the victims of the attack. Pastor Per-Åke Eliasson of Kristet Center affirmed his congregation’s support for Israel, saying, 'We refuse to be silent in the face of such evil. Our support for Israel is rooted in love, in faith, and in the belief that we must stand up against hatred wherever it exists.' He emphasized that their support goes beyond times of celebration. 'We stand with Israel not just in times of joy, but especially in times of suffering. Our voices will rise against injustice, and our prayers will strengthen those who fight for freedom and peace.' These commemorations, held in different parts of the world, underscored the global solidarity with Israel and the ongoing calls for the release of hostages and peace in the region.

Prominent U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Saudi Arabia and Israel on Tuesday to establish diplomatic ties by the end of the year, warning that the next U.S. administration is unlikely to be able to secure enough votes to support the deal. The Biden administration is seeking to broker a normalization accord between the two countries that would include U.S. security guarantees for Gulf state Saudi Arabia, among other bilateral deals between Washington and Riyadh. 'We can get you a treaty through the Senate between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a defense agreement like you have in Japan and Australia, if you do it on President Biden's watch,' Graham, who is seen as close to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, told reporters in Jerusalem. 'The next president will have a very difficult time getting 67 votes,' he said in reference to the two-thirds majority needed in the U.S. Senate to approve a defense treaty. Democrat Joe Biden's term as president will end on Jan. 20. Graham, a longtime senator, is a key Republican in Congress with influence on foreign policy and national security matters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1s4fjfkjg	2024-10-08T05:45:29-07:00	
I want to go back': Heroic October 7 survivor Rachel Edri reject...	A year after holding off Hamas terrorists with tea and cookies during 17-hour hostage ordeal, Edri plans to return to her southern Israel home; despite trauma, she insists, 'I want to live and die in that house. It’s my home' Rachel Edri, who survived a harrowing 17-hour hostage situation during Hamas' October 7 attack, has vowed to return to her home in Ofakim, where she and her husband, David, were held captive by five Hamas terrorists. Edri, 66, managed to deceive the terrorists, keeping them at bay with conversation and even offering them tea and cookies. After a complex rescue operation involving her son Evyatar, a police officer, both she and her husband were freed. David passed away four months after the ordeal, never fully recovering from the trauma. Edri's story has since become a symbol of resilience in Israel. Her likeness has been featured on the popular prime-time sketch show Eretz Nehederet (often dubbed 'the Israeli Saturday Night Live') and starred in a web comedy series. Her image has appeared in countless, online memes, murals and even tattoos. She has also been the subject of a documentary about her life which is set to air soon by public broadcaster Kan 11. Along with her son Evyatar, Edri has toured internationally, sharing her experience with Jewish communities. 'Over the past year, my mom and I lectured in London, Berlin and various places in the U.S., mainly for Jewish organizations like the Gush Etzion Foundation or Friends of Israel,' Evyatar said. 'It really helps me, and every time I share what we went through, it eases me emotionally,' Rachel added. However, Edri still struggles to cope with the loss of her beloved husband. 'David wasn’t just my husband, he was my best friend,' she said. 'We were together for 43 years and my best years were with him. When the terrorists put a gun to David’s head, they told him, 'You won’t be alive by morning.' David was in shock from that moment on. 'Even after we were rescued, he never returned to his past self. From that day, he withered before my eyes. I’m telling you this now and I can't stop crying. It got to the point where he couldn’t do anything on his own. For four months, I bathed him, dressed him and fed him. I took care of him all the time, praying to God, 'Don’t take away him from me.' 'He could barely speak anymore. I would ask him, 'David, tell me what hurts,' but he would stay silent. I’m not myself since he died. I have no days or nights without him. Every day when it gets dark, I curse it. It’s just another night of sleeping without him,' she recounted. Are you receiving psychological treatment? How do you spend your day? 'I receive close support from a wonderful social worker and I participate in support groups in Ofakim for senior women affected by October 7. As part of the groups, I attend classes and special events.' Where do you currently live? 'In a house in Ofakim with the rent paid by the government. The day after my first interview we were moved to a hotel, but I asked to return to Ofakim less than a month later. I wanted my peace, my spot and my kitchen.' Evyatar: 'Mom is living with my younger brother now. It's going to get even more complicated because she’s decided she wants to return to her previous home in Ofakim — despite everything that happened there and even though there’s now a memorial for the fallen near the house.' 'At first, we tried to dissuade her, saying, 'Why would you want these flashbacks and nightmares?' Ofakim’s mayor also approached us and offered to buy the house and turn it into a museum. But Mom refused. She said, 'I want to go back. I want to live and die in that house. It’s my home.' To me, her words are a victory. The house is currently under renovation, and she'll move in five months from now,' he added. Rachel, won't it be hard for you to return to live in the house with all those difficult memories? 'I’m sure it’ll be very hard to return to the place where this trauma took place. But I want to show the terrorists that I’m not afraid. I’m going back to the house where my children grew up and where my husband lived and I’m not planning to leave it until the day I die.'

40% of US Muslims deny October 7 atrocities, survey finds	Less than third of US Muslims believe terrorists engaged in acts of murder and rape during massacre; Harris put in tough position, balancing pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian voters to win critical swing state of Michigan and presidency Almost 4 in 10 U.S. Muslims (39%) believe that Hamas did not engage in acts of murder and rape during the October 7 attack on Israel, while only 31% acknowledge that Hamas terrorists did commit such acts, according to a new survey conducted by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, revealing significant divisions in how American Muslims view the terrorist group's actions that day. The survey, conducted by J.L. Partners, also found that 59% of American Muslims see the attack as an effort 'to advance the Palestinian cause,' compared to just 14% who, like 51% of the general American public, view it as motivated by a desire 'to kill Jews and seek the destruction of Israel.' The poll surveyed 1,000 respondents from the general public, with an additional 500 Muslim respondents. The findings underscore the complexity facing Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as she seeks to balance support from Jewish and Arab voters. Harris, a staunch supporter of Israel’s right to self-defense, has also expressed concern over civilian casualties in Gaza, drawing criticism from both sides. In Michigan, a key swing state with a significant Arab and Muslim population, Harris met with community leaders last week to hear their concerns, aware that losing their support could jeopardize her campaign. The survey shows that 49% of Muslims in the U.S. believe Harris is too pro-Israel, while 29% consider her position balanced. Only 7% feel she is overly supportive of Palestinians. These tensions are playing out as Harris faces tight races in several battleground states, with polls showing her lead within the margin of error in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan—states that are critical to her electoral strategy. The survey also highlights a key contrast in voting priorities. While 34% of Muslims in the U.S. identify the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the most important issue in the upcoming November 5 elections, only 4% of the general public shares this view, with most Americans prioritizing inflation and economic concerns.

Dozens of interceptions seen over northern Israel following Hezbo...	Rocket sirens blare in Haifa, Acre and other regions in northern Israel in two separate volleys shortly following Hezbollah deputy chief's speech; IDF says 85 rockets fired in first salvo from sector where IDF operations began overnight Dozens of rocket interceptions in two separate volleys were observed Monday afternoon in the skies over northern Israel, including Haifa, Acre and the surrounding areas, following a series of rocket sirens. Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency services said there were no immediate reports of injuries after conducting sweeps of the areas where alarms were triggered. The first barrage occurred shortly after a speech by Hezbollah Deputy Secretary-General Naim Qassem, following the assassination of the terrorist group's leader Hassan Nasrallah, by Israeli forces in Beirut. 'Attempts to pressure and intimidate us will fail. We are inspired by Nasrallah's strength, and we are his sons. He left behind a legacy of strong resistance across a wide front,' Qassem said, with a second rocket salvo fired about 30 minutes later. 'Israel aimed to eliminate the resistance and destroy the Palestinian people, but the Palestinian people cannot be defeated.' Qassem also remarked on Lebanon’s role, saying that 'the Lebanese front has exhausted the enemy' and indicated that Hezbollah would only consider a cease-fire if efforts by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri for a 21-day truce were successful. 'We support the political process led by Berri for a cease-fire. Until then, there will be no discussion,' Qassem said. The IDF reported that 'approximately 85 rockets were launched from Lebanon, and interception attempts were made. The details are under investigation.' The army added that Israeli forces struck Hezbollah terror targets in the Dahieh district of Beirut. The heavy rocket barrage on Haifa originated from a sector where IDF operations began Monday night. Earlier in the day, rocket sirens were also triggered in Tiberias and several nearby communities, including Mitzpeh, Kfar Hittim and Lavi. The IDF reported that 25 rockets had been fired from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted, while others landed in open areas. The Tiberias municipality confirmed that three rockets exploded in open fields, and no injuries were reported. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s official news agency reported that three people were killed in an airstrike in Suhmur, in the western Bekaa Valley. Earlier reports indicated airstrikes in several locations in southern Lebanon, including Sarfa, Arzoun, Alma al-Shaab and other areas near the Israeli border.

According to him, 'we draw inspiration from Nasrallah's strength. We are his sons. He left a legacy of steadfast resistance across a wide front. The Al-Aqsa Flood is an unusual event, which is the beginning of the change of the Middle East.' Qassem added that 'Israel's goal was to eliminate the resistance and destroy the Palestinian people.

Like unleashed lions': Inside high-stakes IDF operation in Hezbo...	On October 7, Golani's 13th Battalion fought in Nahal Oz with equipment soaked in their comrades’ blood; after months of frustration on northern border, they're now eliminating Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon, using tactics honed in Gaza Thick clouds of dust rise along the road leading to Maroun al-Ras, a key hilltop village in southern Lebanon overlooking the Israeli communities of Avivim and Yir’on. Israeli D9 bulldozers and tanks, operating under the command of the Golani Brigade, now move freely in the area. Just over a week ago, however, Golani soldiers approached the village by foot, navigating through boulders and rugged terrain in the dead of night, just before the first autumn rains would transform the dry landscape into a dense thicket. The IDF has gained rapid operational control over the area, enabling freer movement within this hostile village, which played a symbolic role in the 2006 Lebanon War. Maroun al-Ras sits on a ridge extending toward the nearby town of Bint Jbeil, and Israeli commanders now travel back and forth across the border with relative ease—just over a mile away. In the midday sun, IDF bulldozers shine as they clear new routes and demolish structures that Hezbollah forces once used as launching points for their elite Radwan Force. Nearby, Golani support troops assist their comrades on the front lines. Just days ago, the unit’s drone operators halted the advance of two Israeli Namer armored personnel carriers after detecting six massive, linked explosives planted by Hezbollah fighters. The support company continues to fulfill its mission with advanced observation and attack capabilities. Their drones, precision mortar fire, snipers and logistical operations, including ammunition and equipment transport, play a critical role in assisting the troops stationed at the front. These soldiers, who traversed significant distances on foot deep within Israeli territory, have been preparing for this operation in recent months, despite limited training time due to the ongoing 'defensive battle' in the region. Eight months frustrating months of waiting For months, Israeli soldiers stationed along a security buffer zone within Israeli territory faced uncertainty and frustration. While their comrades from the Givati and Nahal brigades fought in Gaza, these troops remained long-term on outposts with no clear end date. 'Now, they’re like lions unleashed from a cage,' said company commander Capt. Rotem Mizrahi. 'We endured eight challenging months, filled with uncertainty, despite the defensive gains we made. One day we were told we might go back to Gaza, the next, we were preparing for Lebanon. Fighting in Gaza was seen as more 'glamorous,' but this time, everything went as planned.' These soldiers, now engaged in combat in southern Lebanon, have been targeting Hezbollah positions with the precision of a simulator, using the large stockpile of weapons they discovered. Despite their youth, some barely 20 years old, signs of stress shown in the white streaks in their hair as they take a break among the yellowing foliage of their makeshift home for the past six months. Many of these young fighters, who were still high school seniors on October 7 last year, now carry M4 rifles, having moved on from the Israeli-made Tavor rifles previously associated with Israel's infantry over the past two decades. Others bear the marks of the past year more visibly, with wrinkles and a mature, hardened demeanor. 'These soldiers have grown so much that I feel like I’m talking to 30- or 40-year-olds,' Mizrahi noted. 'They’ve gained a lifetime of experience, not just in combat but in life itself.' His deputy, Lt. Ziv Braymok, recounted preparing for a dawn assembly at 5:30 a.m. on the day the war broke out, while stationed in Nahal Oz. 'It started with a heavy barrage of mortars,' he said. 'We quickly gathered 20 soldiers and took out the snipers' rifles. Just 20 of us faced hordes of Hamas terrorists, and we managed to kill 70 of them.' 'Equipment soaked in the blood of fallen comrades was repurposed for the battle. Since then, I’ve been going at full speed. I’ll finish my role and then get out.' That morning, Lt. Braymok saw some of his soldiers fall, some dying in his arms. Before leading his troops to reclaim the Nahal Oz outpost, he received a call from his commanding officer, Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg, who later fell in battle. 'He told me, 'No, go to Kibbutz Kfar Aza. There are many enemies there,'' Braymok recalled. The difficult decision, made at 7:30 a.m. that day — choosing where to fight and whom to save — still resonates deeply with these soldiers. 'Civilians first,' they say, as the weight of that morning lingers in their hearts. 'The soldiers remember more than we do as commanders. In hindsight, we see things from a different perspective,' Lt. Braymok said. 'I don’t remember faces. While searching from house to house in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, I saw dead bodies on one of the beds. A mother and daughter shot in their beds, but I can’t recall their faces or details like their clothes or hair color—it’s gone. My focus was purely on the mission: kill terrorists, save as many civilians as possible and evacuate the wounded.' Braymok described how they reached the height of the fighting and set up defenses near Kibbutz Saad’s carrot packing house to prevent further incursions by terrorists. Equipment soaked in the blood of fallen comrades was repurposed for the battle. 'Since then, I’ve been going at full speed. I’ll finish my role and then get out,' he added. The psychological toll on his unit has been steep—many soldiers struggled to continue and left the unit due to mental health issues, leading to the disbandment of an entire platoon. Yet, new recruits brought fresh energy to Golani. Braymok’s unit went on to lead successful assaults in the narrow allies of Gaza’s Shijaiyah neighborhood, the Zeitoun hills and the high-rise towers of the upscale al-Rimal neighborhood. Reflecting on the aftermath of October 7, Braymok recalled an incident when he and his medic shouted at an unarmed civilian trying to join their fight in Kfar Aza. Hours later, they realized the man was Brig. Gen. (res.) Yisrael Shomer, commander of the 146th Division. 'We didn’t understand why he was calling for reinforcements on the Lebanese border until his wife asked him to evacuate the wounded to their home and put on his uniform. He returned to us in IDF uniform, with the rank of brigadier general,' Braymok said. After their deployment in Gaza ended, Braymok’s unit was sent straight to the northern front, defending the volatile Lebanese border. Now, as part of a long-delayed ground offensive, his soldiers are capturing key Hezbollah villages that they had observed for eight months, intended to be used as launch pads for the terrorist group’s elite Radwan Forces to carry out its plan to invade and conquer the Galilee. The non-stop airstrikes have weakened Hezbollah significantly, forcing thousands of Radwan terrorists north of the Litani River. Many of their tactical commanders have been killed in Operation Northern Arrows. But most importantly, the newest war objective now flows in their veins: Returning northern residents home safely. But for Braymok, the mission is personal. 'Every day, we wake up surrounded by abandoned toys in the kindergarten where we’ve been sleeping for months. The pictures of the kids stare back at us. This is their kindergarten, but they haven’t been here for a year,' he said. 'We’ve come to know the residents from a distance, and their emergency responders have become like second fathers to us. I’ve gotten to know entire families from the kibbutzim. We’ve grown used to seeing the empty kibbutz, but we’re determined to push the threat back and bring them home ourselves.' Close air support is key Drawing on experience gained in Gaza, Israeli support troops in Lebanon demonstrated sharp thinking and quick reactions when they spotted a glint from the window of a three-story building. Despite being hit by a missile the day before, suspicions arose that Hezbollah fighters were inside. Company commander Capt. Mizrahi warned his soldiers, positioned about 300 yards away, of a possible anti-tank squad in the orange-roofed building, which had not yet been cleared. Lt. Ron, a young platoon commander, directed an Apache helicopter to fire a Hellfire missile at the building, maintaining direct communication with the pilot. A drone, continuously surveying the area, streamed the strike live on screen. The soldiers, anticipating Hezbollah fighters may flee or reappear from nearby buildings disguised as firefighters or medics, remained alert. 'They often move like that,' explained Capt. Mizrahi. When the missile struck, the explosion echoed through the makeshift command post. Forces on the ground, aided by a drone and a sniffer dog, prepared to sweep the building. The scale of the operation is large, with an entire brigade assigned to each village, though Capt. Mizrahi noted, 'It's a powerful force, but not on the battalion scale seen in Maroun al-Ras during the Second Lebanon War. I studied that battle closely and passed it on to my soldiers, most of whom were just born at the time.' Time, however, is limited. Unlike in Gaza, the troops are working against the clock, with more villages to secure. Though the operation is smaller in scope, some believe Hezbollah has deliberately abandoned these villages, anticipating Israel’s focus on them in this ground campaign. Outside the command post, Corporal Yayo Tesfa, smiling despite the circumstances, stood out. His three younger brothers remain stranded in Gondar, Ethiopia, waiting for permission to immigrate to Israel. A fourth brother, Yehuda, was born just a week ago in Haifa, but Tesfa has yet to meet him. 'I’m a spotter and a sharpshooter, that’s my job,' said Tesfa, his optimism shining through. 'Honestly, Lebanon is tougher than Gaza, but we’re doing great. We’re Golani.'

Hamas leader-in-exile Khaled Meshaal said on Tuesday the Palestinian terrorist group would rise 'like a phoenix' from the ashes despite heavy losses during a year of war with Israel, and that it continues to recruit fighters and manufacture weapons. One year after the Hamas attack that triggered the war, Meshaal framed the war with Israel as part of a broader narrative spanning 76 years, dating back to what Palestinians call the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe,' when many were displaced during the 1948 war that accompanied the creation of Israel. 'Palestinian history is made of cycles,' Meshaal, 68, a senior Hamas figure under overall leader Yahya Sinwar, told Reuters in an interview. 'We go through phases where we lose martyrs (victims) and we lose part of our military capabilities, but then the Palestinian spirit rises again, like the phoenix, thanks to God.' Meshaal, who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997 after he was injected with poison and was overall Hamas leader from 1996-2017, said the Islamist terrorist group was still able to mount ambushes against Israeli troops. 'We lost part of our ammunition and weapons, but Hamas is still recruiting young men and continues to manufacture a significant portion of its ammunition and weapons,' said Meshaal, without providing details.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syhohumkyx	2024-10-08T00:19:10-07:00

IDF general promises swift return to evacuated north, local leade...	Amid intense airstrikes in Lebanon and rocket fire on central Israel, Northern Command chief Ori Gordin tells frontline leaders residents could start returning home in weeks; 'We aren't returning until there's full security,' Kiryat Shmona mayor insists Northern Command head Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin told local leaders Monday evening that residents of frontline communities near the Lebanese border could begin returning to their homes in phases within a month, sparking backlash from participants who called the timeline unrealistic. The meeting, which lasted about 90 minutes, was held amid escalating military operations. Earlier that day, the Israeli Air Force conducted a major strike on over 120 targets in southern Lebanon in just one hour. Additional airstrikes targeted Hezbollah positions in Beirut’s Dahieh district, with about 200 targets hit in total by day’s end. Explosions from southern Lebanon were visible from the northern Israeli city of Nahariya and echoed as far as the Greater Haifa region. A few hours after the meeting, long-range rockets were fired from Lebanon toward central Israel, marking the fourth such attack on central Israel since the start of the war, which began on October 7. The IDF also issued new restrictions on southern Lebanon, prohibiting vessel movement south of the Awali River and warning of potential naval operations against Hezbollah. Shlomi and other border communities in the Western Galilee were declared closed military zones. Local leaders expressed frustration after the meeting, particularly regarding Gordin’s comments on returning residents. 'He talked about short timelines, suggesting it could happen within weeks to a month, but only for communities not right along the border,' one participant said. 'It sounded overly optimistic.' Kiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern, who did not attend the meeting, dismissed the notion of an imminent return. 'No one is coming home until the threat is fully eliminated,' Stern said, urging the military to focus on winning the war and leaving decisions about the return of residents to political and municipal leaders. 'We are not returning until there is full security in Kiryat Shmona and a plan for the city's reconstruction is approved.' David Azulay, head of the Metula Council, attended the meeting and said that while the IDF presented significant military achievements, the timeline for residents' return seemed unrealistic. 'In my opinion, it is still far off, especially for my community,' he said. Municipal leaders also voiced concerns about confidentiality breaches. Moti Hatiel, head of the Rosh Pina Council, expressed disappointment that details from the meeting were leaked, calling it 'irresponsible' and damaging to trust between military and civilian officials. Meanwhile, the Fighting for the North movement, representing hundreds of displaced families, sharply criticized Gordin's focus on a return timeline. 'We will not accept anything less than a complete security overhaul, including reaching the Litani River and establishing a buffer zone,' the group said in a statement, warning against halting military operations prematurely. The IDF, in response, said it is working to ensure the safe return of northern residents according to directives from the political leadership. The military emphasized that while Gordin mentioned preparations for the possibility of residents returning, no specific timeline was promised.

Suheil Hussein Husseini played key role in coordinating arms transfers between Iran and Hezbollah, oversaw unit involved in production of precision-guided missiles The IDF confirmed Tuesday morning the targeted killing of Suhail Hussein Husseini, the head of Hezbollah’s logistics network, in an airstrike in Beirut the day before. The strike was carried out by Israeli fighter jets with precise intelligence guidance. According to the IDF, Israeli Air Force fighter jets carried out the operation using precise intelligence guidance provided by the military’s Intelligence Directorate. Husseini led Hezbollah’s logistics unit, which manages the group's budget and organizes its various operational systems, the IDF said. He played a key role in facilitating arms transfers between Iran and Hezbollah, overseeing the distribution of smuggled weapons to different units within the terrorist group, and managing transportation and resource allocation. Husseini was also a member of Hezbollah's Jihad Council, its senior military forum. The logistics unit under Husseini's command also included Hezbollah’s research and development division, which is involved in the production of precision-guided missiles and the storage and transportation of weapons within Lebanon. As part of his responsibilities, Husseini was in charge of funding and logistics for some of Hezbollah's most sensitive projects, including operational plans for war and other special programs, such as launching attacks against Israel from Lebanon and Syria. Husseini's assassination is the latest in a series of targeted killings in Beirut and Hezbollah’s stronghold in the southern suburbs, known as the Dahieh. These strikes have reportedly eliminated key figures, including the group's leader Hassan Nasrallah and his prospective successor, Hashem Safieddine, as well as the leadership of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force and several senior figures referred to within the group as 'great jihad commanders.'

Trump makes surprise visit to Lubavitcher Rebbe's grave in New Yo...	Under tight security, former US president makes unannounced visit to late spiritual leader's grave on October 7 massacre anniversary, placing prayer note and holding up photo of Israeli American hostage Idan Alexander Former U.S. President Donald Trump made a surprise visit Monday to the gravesite of the Lubavitcher Rebbe in New York City, in a gesture of solidarity with Israel and the U.S. Jewish community. The visit coincided with the commemoration of the October 7 attack's anniversary, which has deep significance for both communities. At the Ohel, the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s resting place in Queens, Trump was photographed wearing a black kippah and placing a handwritten note at the grave. The former president, who is seeking to return to the White House in November, was also seen alongside conservative commentator Ben Shapiro holding up a photo of hostage Idan Alexander, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen. Karoline Leavitt, the national press secretary for Trump’s campaign, said the former president would deliver a speech later at a memorial event for the victims of the October 7 attack in Florida. She claimed that the horrors of October 7 would never have happened if Trump were still in the White House, an assertion that has been a frequent talking point in the Republican's campaign rallies. Levitt added that Trump’s re-election is 'essential for both Americans and Israelis' to end the violence caused by a 'more powerful, energized and wealthier Iranian regime' that she attributed to the 'weak policies of the Biden-Harris administration.' Trump was accompanied during the visit by Holocaust survivors, relatives of hostages currently held in Gaza and students from various U.S. campuses. The former president had kept the visit private, allowing no media coverage, but reportedly chose October 7 for the visit to express solidarity with Israel and Jewish communities worldwide. Security at the site was tight, with Secret Service agents reportedly securing the area days in advance. The visit was organized by former U.S. ambassador to Israel David Friedman who has maintained a close relationship with Trump since leaving office. Trump's visit comes just over two weeks after Argentine President Javier Milei and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama also visited the Rebbe’s gravesite. Milei, known for his close ties to the Jewish community, credited his election victory to a prayer he made at the site shortly beforehand. Sara Netanyahu, wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also recently visited the grave, accompanied by the families of hostages. The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, is a revered figure whose gravesite has become a pilgrimage destination for both Jews and non-Jews alike. 'The Rebbe welcomed people from all walks of life, Jews and non-Jews, left and right, and his gravesite continues to draw people from around the world,' said Rabbi Mendy Kotlarsky, a senior official in Chabad’s global outreach network.

Katz threatens no cooperation on Lebanon if France pushes Palesti...	After Macron’s call for arms embargo to Israel, FM meets French counterpart, saying, ‘Friends don’t call for an embargo; they help in times of hardship; Katz stresses no cease-fire in Lebanon without enforcing UN resolutions Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned on Monday that if France takes unilateral actions regarding the Palestinian issue, Israel would be unable to cooperate with France on the Lebanese front. The warning, issued to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot during a solidarity visit to Israel marking the one-year anniversary of the October 7 massacre, came just days after French President Emmanuel Macron called for an arms embargo on weapons used by Israel in its war in Gaza, a move that Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, heavily criticized. 'Friends don’t call for an embargo; they help in times of hardship,' Katz told his French counterpart according to a statement issued by his office after the meeting. He added that if Israel withdrew from the West Bank, it would leave Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas vulnerable to a swift takeover by Hamas and Iran, just as occurred in Gaza in 2007. 'There will be no cease-fire that doesn’t serve Israeli and French interests,' Katz added. 'A cease-fire will only be possible when northern Israeli residents can safely return to their homes and only after Hezbollah withdraws north of the Litani River and disarms.' Katz also highlighted the need for effective enforcement of UN Security Council Resolutions 1701 and 1559 in Lebanon, warning that if such mechanisms aren't established, Israel would act independently to enforce them. He stressed that Israel's actions are solely focused on securing its citizens and are not intended to interfere in Lebanon’s internal affairs. Responding to a question from Barrot, Katz clarified that Israel does not intend to evacuate Beirut residents but will target Hezbollah’s terror hubs within the city. He also called on France to leverage Hezbollah’s recent setbacks and push for the election of a new president in Lebanon, seeing an opportunity to shift the balance of power in the country. On the Iranian front, Katz vowed that Israel would respond forcefully to last week's Iranian ballistic missile attack, noting that Hezbollah, Iran's primary proxy in the region, has suffered significant blows. He urged the international community to seize the moment to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions and support for terrorism. Katz’s comments follow Macron’s call for a halt to arms deliveries to Israel, a move that Prime Minister Netanyahu also criticized during a phone call with the French leader on Sunday. Netanyahu's office reiterated that Israel 'expects its friends to stand behind it and not impose restrictions that will only strengthen the Iranian axis of evil.' Government officials were not surprised by Macron's words, which are a direct continuation of the French line, which already supported the non-binding resolution initiated by the Palestinians at the UN General Assembly on September 18, which called for the imposition of an arms embargo on Israel. However, French defense exports to Israel have been minimal in comparison to its global defense sales, amounting to just 20 million euros annually over the past decade.

One year later, 'Lady in Red' from Nova massacre still grappling ...	Vlada Patapov, dubbed 'Lady in Red' by the Daily Mail, fled the party just before Hamas terrorists arrived; she reflects on surviving with deep regret and trauma, wishing she could have warned others and feeling the weight of those less fortunate A year after the October 7 Hamas attack, the image of Vlada Patapov, draped in a red shawl as she fled the Nova music festival, has become iconic. Captured in a parking lot near Kibbutz Re'im, her escape from the terror was broadcast globally. For weeks, her fate was unknown until she shared her story with Ynet and the Daily Mail, which named her 'Lady in Red.' Reflecting on the anniversary of the attack, the Ashdod-based wedding planner expressed deep regret. 'If I had one wish, it would be to have told everyone at the festival one hour before Hamas attacked that something was going to happen then everyone could have got away,' she told the Mail. Diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, Patapov, like many survivors, continues to grapple with survivor's guilt and trauma. 'I've been having therapy and counseling like many of the others who were there and I find speaking to people helps me cope with what happened that day. But then sometimes I think who can help me when all this is still going on around us and the fear is still here and it's still real,' she said. The anniversary of the massacre and the ongoing conflict have only compounded her trauma. She says that during the massacre, her sole focus was surviving for her three-year-old daughter, Romi. 'When I think back to that day a year ago it all seems so fresh and the only thing that I could think of at the time was staying alive for my daughter Romi and I give thanks for that every day. She will be four soon and for a quarter of her life, she has known only war. It is terrible for us but many countries don't seem to accept or understand what we are going through,' she told the Daily Mail. Patapov decided to attend the festival in southern Israel at the last minute with her partner, Matan, and a friend named Mai. At one point, she found herself alone, witnessing Hamas terrorists murdering her friends. It took nearly 24 hours before she could finally reunite with Romi at home. Patapov spoke of maintaining courage and strength, not only for those inside Israel, but for captives in Gaza as well. 'We can't let the terrorists win. We can't be weak - we must remain strong for Israel and for the hostages who are still in Gaza, but at the same time it's so scary here at the moment for us, we have rockets from Gaza, rockets from Lebanon and now rockets from Iran, it seems as if it will never stop.' On a more somber note, she says, 'The situation is terrifying for us now. it's so scary here at the moment for us, we have rockets from Gaza, rockets from Lebanon and now rockets from Iran, it seems as if it will never stop. These people who attack Israel should imagine what it's like for us here having rockets and sirens and living in fear of a terrorist attack, I could walk out my front door to go to the shops and someone could attack me.' 'I thought it would take a few weeks' In the surprise attack at the Nova music festival, 393 people were killed. Seventeen more were murdered at smaller parties held simultaneously in the south. Among the 101 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, 22 attended the Nova party. 'What I feel most deeply is for the hostages and their families. Who would have thought we'd still be in this situation a year later? I thought it would be a few weeks, maybe a couple of months but it's been a year now and it looks with the Lebanon situation as if things will only get worse,' Patapov reflects. Regarding connections with other festival-goers, Patapov shared, 'There are events going on to remember what happened at the festival but I won't be going because for me the most important thing is to be with Romi and Matan. When Romi hears the sirens she is so scared, she starts crying and with the anniversary I just don't feel like letting her go to nursery so I will keep her at home, only because you just don't know if they will try something again.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1cnsw11yje	2024-10-07T14:07:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/12/07/BkM11Wqy8a/BkM11Wqy8a_0_53_634_357_0_small.jpg
Lebanon rocket barrage jolts central Israel as sirens wail	IDF says 5 rockets launched from Lebanon, with some intercepted by air defenses and others landing in unpopulated areas; no immediate reports of injuries Rocket sirens sounded Monday in several central Israeli cities, including Herzliya, Ramat Hasharon, Tel Aviv (Yarkon), Glilot, Petah Tikva, Hod Hasharon, Kfar Saba, Kfar Qassem, Rosh HaAyin and Ra'anana, with explosions heard across the Sharon region. The IDF confirmed that five rockets were launched from Lebanon, with some intercepted by air defenses and others landing in unpopulated areas. The army added that there were no changes to Home Front Command guidelines. The Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service said there were no immediate reports of injuries. Emergency teams were dispatched to inspect areas where rocket debris was reported and responded to several individuals injured while heading to shelters, as well as those suffering from shock.

Sinwar resurfaces after weeks of silence, report says	Hamas leader reportedly made contact with Qatar in recent days after a prolonged period of silence, confirming that he is alive After weeks of uncertainty regarding his fate, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has resurfaced, making contact with Qatar in recent days after a prolonged period of silence, confirming that he is alive, Saudi network Al Arabiya reported Monday. Since last month, Israeli intelligence had been investigating whether Sinwar had been injured or killed in one of the IDF's strikes in Gaza, after he was once again going incommunicado. Last week, in a high-level meeting attended by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, a question mark was placed over Sinwar's photo, reflecting uncertainty about his status. The New York Times reported over the weekend that U.S. officials believe that Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre, is still alive and making 'critical decisions,' even a year after the attack. Washington officials assess that Sinwar is determined to draw Israel into a regional war, especially after the IDF had entered southern Lebanon for the first time since 2006, and has no intention of negotiating a hostage deal. The report also suggests that Sinwar is likely encouraged by the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, amid expectations that Israel will soon respond to last week's barrage of ballistic missiles. However, the report notes that Sinwar is frustrated by the lack of sufficient support from Hezbollah and Iran. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjlpy3zjyg	2024-10-07T13:35:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/05/25/HkNtiz9t00/HkNtiz9t00_0_0_3000_1985_0_small.jpg

On October 7 anniversary, Netanyahu pushes to rename war	After a moment of silence in a special Cabinet session, PM proposes renaming 'Swords of Iron to 'War of Revival'; ministers viewed graphic video of October 7 atrocities, sparking criticism over its lack of global circulation The Israeli government held a special memorial session Monday to mark one year since the October 7 massacre during which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed renaming the subsequent conflict from 'Swords of Iron' to 'War of Revival.' After Netanyahu's suggestion, ministers Gideon Sa'ar and Amichai Chikli argued the name was too similar to 'War of Independence' and demanded an alternative. Other ministers noted that Netanyahu wasn't fully committed to the name 'War of Resurrection.' During the session, ministers watched a video of the atrocities produced by the IDF Spokesperson for the first time. Some questioned why this video wasn't being shared internationally and were told the Justice Ministry hadn't approved its release due to legal constraints. Ministers expressed frustration, saying this hindered public relations efforts. Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who typically doesn't attend government meetings, stated she was unaware of this directive and left the meeting to investigate. At the end of the special session, ministers were called for a consultation with Netanyahu. The name 'Iron Swords' was initially given to the war at its start, and by December, Prime Minister Netanyahu sought a different name to underscore the war's significance. In December, IDF representatives suggested the name 'The October 7 War' in closed discussions, asking the political echelon to advance the proposal. The government considered other options, including 'The Simchat Torah War,' with Netanyahu expressing support for 'The Genesis War.' IDF Spokesperson stated: 'Following the government meeting, the 'video of horrors' has been regularly screened worldwide for public officials, ambassadors, media personnel, decision-makers, and influencers. An IDF Spokesperson representative screened the video at today's government meeting under the instruction of the political echelon. Comments were taken out of context, and there is no legal directive prohibiting the publication of the video, which is indeed shown worldwide.' The Attorney General's office stated: 'During the government meeting, a false claim was made that the legal advisory to the government supposedly prevented the worldwide publication of the October 7 atrocities documentation. The claim is false.' At the start of the government meeting, Netanyahu lit a memorial candle in remembrance of those murdered and fallen on October 7, and the government members stood for a moment of silence. The deputy cabinet secretary then read a chapter of Psalms, and the cabinet secretary recited the 'Mi Sheberach' prayer for IDF soldiers and hostages. Netanyahu recalled his statements shortly after the surprise attack by Hamas terrorists, including: 'We are at war. Not an operation, not rounds—a war. We will retaliate with a force the enemy has never known and exact a price they cannot comprehend. We are at war, and we will win.' The Prime Minister further stated: 'Since that dark day, we have been fighting. This is our existential war—'The War of Resurrection.' This is what I wish to officially name the war. Since that dark day, we have been on the offensive on seven fronts. Our counterattack on our enemies that are part of Iran's axis of evil, is essential for securing our future and ensuring our security. 'We will end the war when we achieve all our set goals: dismantling Hamas's regime of evil, bringing all our captives home—both dead and alive, neutralizing any future threat from Gaza to Israel, and safely returning our residents in the south and north to their homes. On this day, we bow our heads in memory of our brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters, our parents and elders, who were slaughtered by Hamas terrorists. Children murdered in cold blood, women and men slaughtered, entire families obliterated.' 'Determined to finish the task' In his continued remarks, Netanyahu acknowledged the bereaved families 'whose lives were changed in an instant' and the families of the hostages 'who endure endless agony and worry over the fate of their loved ones.' He added: 'We remember our heroes who fell in battle in Gaza, Lebanon, and other arenas. Thanks to them, we repelled the enemy, destroyed most of its capabilities, freed many of our captives, and we are determined to finish the task.' The hostage families' headquarters responded to the Prime Minister's request to rename the war 'The War of Resurrection': 'We wish to remind the Prime Minister that there is and will be no resurrection without the return of all the hostages—the living for rehabilitation and the dead for proper burial in their homeland.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byimgkbykg	2024-10-07T12:55:34-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/07/SJ57ASbkJg/SJ57ASbkJg_0_86_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Unannounced airdrops near Lebanese border spark panic in northern...	On October 7 anniversary, Upper Galilee residents panic after seeing parachutes, fearing Hezbollah infiltration; IDF clarifies they were supply drops; police criticize unannounced drill, saying it heightened tensions and disrupted safety Several northern Israeli communities issued shelter-in-place advisories Monday evening after residents spotted two parachutes in the skies over the Lebanese border, evoking memories of the October 7 massacre, when Hamas terrorists famously paraglided into Israeli territory during the attack. Locals' fears were compounded by Saudi media reports of Hezbollah operatives allegedly attempting to infiltrate Israel from Lebanon amid heightened tensions on the one-year anniversary of the massacre. The IDF clairified shortly later that the parachutes were part of a resupply mission for the 91st Division, the third division deployed into southern Lebanon, and there was no security threat. Local police and municipal leaders expressed anger over what they called an 'unnecessary incident' on such a tense day, especially since they had not received prior notice. After receiving reports of parachute sightings, Northern District police mobilized all available forces toward the Ramim Ridge on the border. 'Everything we trained for over the past year, we carried out as if this were a real event we were prepared for,' a Northern District officer said. 'Officers were immediately deployed to their posts, special forces units were dispatched to potential landing sites, and senior commanders rushed to the scene. It was one of the most stressful situations we've faced, implementing everything we had prepared for. It’s unfortunate this happened without coordination at such a sensitive time, but it was certainly the strongest drill possible.' Residents in Upper Galilee communities described how some armed themselves in response to the sighting. 'People were locking and loading, stepping outside to protect their families while their children played in the park,' said David, who lives in a moshav near the Lebanon border. 'How could they not pick a different day for this without informing anyone? Tens of thousands of us here on the border were thrown into panic. I hope they learn from this—it’s no joke.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byff55zjkg	2024-10-07T12:27:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/07/HyO36Ob1Jg/HyO36Ob1Jg_0_235_480_271_0_small.jpg

Lawmakers push for specialized genocide court to prosecute Octobe...	Knesset members Simcha Rothman and Yulia Malinovsky to table bill to prosecute planners and perpetrators of October 7 massacre; previous attempts stalled due to concerns over hostage negotiations and challenges in identifying individual culprits Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee Chairman MK Simcha Rothman (the Religious Zionist Party) and MK Yulia Malinovsky (Yisrael Beytenu) are set to introduce a bill after the High Holidays to enable the prosecution of those responsible for the October 7, 2023 massacre in the Gaza border communities, Ynet learned on Monday. Despite efforts over the past year to push the government toward legal action via Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, progress has been stalled. The Security Cabinet has reportedly delayed prosecutions, citing concerns that legal action could hinder ongoing negotiations for the return of hostages held by Hamas and impact their treatment. Additionally, the Cabinet is evaluating the possibility that some captured terrorists may be released in a future prisoner exchange, complicating the legal process. There are also legal challenges in securing enough evidence to tie specific perpetrators to individual crimes in the level of detail required by criminal courts. Rothman and Malinovsky, from both sides of the political aisle, have been working through the Constitution Committee to address these issues since the massacre, with Rothman forming a secretive subcommittee last December to explore legal pathways. This subcommittee, which included Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Attorney General Baharav-Miara, debated the establishment of a specialized tribunal versus utilizing the district court system. Under the proposed law, a 'specialized court for genocide' would be created to focus specifically on the events of October 7, which will be classified as 'genocide acts initiated by Hamas.' The court will have the authority to prosecute those involved in the planning, incitement, or execution of the massacre. The bill would also establish an administrative tribunal to determine terrorist participation in the massacre based on administrative evidence, allowing for the designation of perpetrators as unlawful combatants. A prosecution committee, including representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Defense, and Foreign Affairs, would oversee who among the group will face genocide charges under the Genocide Convention. 'The government had a whole year to prepare for prosecuting those involved, but failed to make it a priority,' MK Malinovsky said, stressing the moral duty to the victims and their families. Rothman added that the new court would provide the legal framework needed to deliver justice for the unprecedented October 7 massacre. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkzy9yz1yl	2024-10-07T11:53:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/03/H10EohEh0/H10EohEh0_0_50_1417_798_0_small.jpg

One year after the October 7 massacre: The remarkable rehabilitat...	Facing immeasurable hardships and obstacles following their injuries in Hamas' attack, three heroes overcame the trauma and pain to rebuild their lives On October 7, 2023, Israel woke up to a morning of pain and terror – a Saturday morning that turned into a massive assault and terrorist invasion, marking one of the darkest events in the country's history. As we mark a year since that devastating day, this story centers around three soldiers – Yael Gottlieb, Reuven Ben Frech and Maya Desiatnik – who were wounded both physically and emotionally and have since embarked on a remarkable journey of healing and recovery. The Invasion of October 7 – a moment of reckoning That Saturday morning, Hamas launched a coordinated invasion from different directions – by sea, air and land. Soldiers, fighters, and civilians found themselves battling terrorists who exploited vulnerabilities in Israel's defense. The attack was meticulously planned, but it encountered warriors who fought with everything they had, even when the situation seemed impossible. Yael's journey – courage amid the chaos It was 6:30 a.m. on October 7 when Yael Gottlieb began what she thought would be a routine Saturday shift at the Ashkelon police station, her final shift in the army. She never imagined that this day would mark the beginning of one of the most challenging battles of her life. The sirens began to wail, and rockets rained down, signaling a terrifying and unprecedented attack. In minutes, reports of missile impacts poured in, and Yael, along with her partner, immediately geared up with helmets and vests, rushing to the scene of the first impact. Arriving at the site, they witnessed a house completely destroyed, with terrified civilians scattered outside. But before they could take it all in, the situation escalated. The radio crackled with an urgent announcement: 'Pelesh Pleshet,' a code signaling an enemy infiltration by air, land, or sea. That morning, the enemy infiltrated on all fronts. Yael and her partner quickly left the scene and drove towards Zikim, where they armed themselves with rifles, gathering as much ammunition as they could find. They took cover behind a sign, anxiously awaiting what they feared would be an encounter with the enemy. Minutes later, they heard cries for help over the radio – terrorists had entered Sderot, and shots were being fired at the local police station. The terror in the voices over the radio was palpable, echoing the bursts of gunfire in the background. Yael and her partner jumped into their patrol car and sped toward Sderot, only to be greeted by chaos – abandoned cars lined the sides of the roads, and panicked people scrambled to reach shelters. As they approached the station, Yael instructed her partner to circle around to the back, hoping to surprise the terrorists from behind. But suddenly, without warning, a barrage of bullets erupted. Yael was hit in the face, her vision going black as pain overwhelmed her senses. Barely able to see, she felt the car slow to a halt about 100 meters away. Her partner exited the car to check if they were still being pursued. Meanwhile, Yael, struggling with her injuries, realized that her hand had also been shot, rendering her unable to lift her weapon. She managed to crawl out of the patrol car and stumbled toward a nearby shelter. Despite the intense pain and disorientation, she refused to surrender. She checked the shelter, scanning it with the weapon she could barely hold, to ensure no terrorists were hiding inside. For a few agonizing minutes, she was alone until a city inspector found her. The inspector called for an ambulance, but they were told that none could reach her location. The inspector tied her shirt around Yael's arm to stem the bleeding, and soon after, a paramedic arrived to treat her injuries. After an hour and a half of waiting, police officers finally arrived and transported Yael to the hospital. As she looked out the window of the patrol car, Yael saw the devastation – burned-out vehicles, lifeless bodies strewn across the streets of Sderot, and plumes of smoke rising from the chaos. The sights were haunting. While hospitalized, Yael first encountered Belev Echad. They stood by her side, and even after her discharge, they invited her to their home. During her visit, she received a tour and learned about the treatments and care they provide. Today, Yael attends therapy at Belev Echad three times a week. She feels like she’s part of a family, a place where she’s understood and supported by those who know her pain. Yael summed it up best, saying, 'This place gave me new life, moments of joy within all the pain and darkness. Every time I come to Belev Echad, I feel at home. They didn’t just provide me with physical treatments – they gave me hope, an anchor to hold onto. I’m not alone on my journey, and I feel that I have a real support system holding me up.' Reuven's story – courage on the scorching road On that fateful morning, Reuven Ben Frech received an emergency call from his unit in Netivot. Rockets were already raining down on Israel, and he hurried from his parents’ home in Ashkelon, grabbing his pistol and rushing to meet his unit. As he drove along the familiar roads, he began to hear scattered reports of infiltrating terrorists, but he had no idea of the sheer scale of the attack. Entering the town of Sderot, Reuven saw civilians lying lifeless on the streets. He loaded his pistol and continued driving cautiously. When he reached the Sha'ar HaNegev junction, he suddenly encountered over ten terrorists on the road. With no way to escape, he stopped his car and opened fire. He managed to shoot one, but the others quickly retaliated, firing at him from all directions. In the chaos, Reuven was struck six times – once in the leg, twice in the arm, and three times in the back. Despite his severe injuries, he managed to press down on the accelerator, driving away while terrorists continued to shoot at him from just 10 meters away. With all his strength, he reached the Yakhini settlement, where he encountered Border Police officers. Recognizing that he could no longer fight, he handed his pistol to one of the female officers and collapsed. However, the terrorists had not given up. They had pursued him to the settlement, and as Reuven tried to exit his car, he knew he needed to escape again. Forcing himself back behind the wheel, he managed to drive a few more kilometers to the Yeshiba settlement near Netivot, where he finally came to a stop, losing consciousness from blood loss. At Soroka Medical Center, Reuven fought for his life. It was there that Belev Echad entered his journey, providing a lifeline during his darkest hours. They became his second family, offering him a safe place to heal, both physically and emotionally. Reuven describes what the organization gave him: 'I never thought I’d find myself smiling again after everything I went through. Belev Echad became my family when I felt everything was broken. They restored my faith in myself, made me believe there was someone who cared, who understood what I was going through. Thanks to them, I managed to keep going, to find the strength to rise again.' The journey of Maya Desiatnik: from the Nahal Oz base to Belev Echad 'My name is Maya Desiatnik, and I am a former lookout soldier from the Nachal Oz base, located near the Israel-Gaza border. I will never forget that fateful day in October when terrorists broke into our base – the day that changed my life forever. I was on duty in the command center when the infiltration was announced. Through the cameras, I witnessed the horrors, seeing how the terrorists crossed the border effortlessly, advancing into our base and taking control. I was with my fellow lookout soldiers in the command center while the battle raged outside, and the terrorists tried to break in. After hours of fighting, they set fire to the command center, and in that blaze, I lost close friends. Out of all the lookout soldiers who were with me in that room, I was the only one who survived. All that remains are the memories and pain, which have become invisible wounds. In the period that followed, I suffered from smoke inhalation and was hospitalized in critical condition. But beyond the physical injuries, I had to face the mental trauma of that horrible day. I suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, uncontrollable fears, and nightmares that took over my nights. For a long time, I couldn’t be alone, I was afraid to leave the house, and every simple action required immense effort. Then, the light entered my life – the Belev Echad organization. At the end of October, while I was deep in pain and loneliness, I found this organization thanks to a fellow survivor from that day at the base. From the moment I arrived, I realized I wasn’t alone. Belev Echad became a home for me. They offered alternative treatments, emotional support, and, most importantly, a sense of belonging and acceptance just as I am. I started participating in MMA training through the organization, which restored the sense of security I had lost. Suddenly, I felt strong again, capable of facing challenges, and not helpless. At the same time, I had the chance to meet others who were also dealing with PTSD, just like me. Together, we became a strong, supportive, and caring community, always there for one another. Belev Echad didn’t just provide me with therapy and tools to cope with the pain; they also helped me regain my belief that I could live a full and meaningful life. Thanks to the organization, I am continuing my journey – a journey of healing, returning to life, and finding hope. I share my story because I know there are others silently battling their inner wounds. I want them to know that there is a way, that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and that you can find the strength to keep moving forward. Today, thanks to Belev Echad, I know I am not alone – and I want you to know that you aren’t alone either.' The embrace of compassion – healing and rebuilding for our heroes The stories of Yael, Reuven, and Maya converge into a narrative of pain, courage, and hope. Thanks to the support network around them, these three heroes found the guidance, encouragement, and family they so desperately needed. They learned to fight together, to accept help, and to understand they are not alone on their road to recovery. Rabbi Uriel Vigler, one of the founders of Belev Echad, shares: 'We established this with the understanding that one cannot face pain alone. Soldiers wounded in battle need not just medical treatments but also a comforting hand, a hug, and a shoulder to lean on. For us, these soldiers are not just warriors – they are brothers and sisters who need help to keep moving forward.' Shavy Vigler, the co-founder, adds: 'Every soldier who enters our community is a symbol of courage, strength, and determination. Our mission is to remind them they are not alone, that we’re here to hold their hand, to give them the strength to continue and move forward. We believe that a big heart beats inside each of them, and we’re here to help them discover their inner strength.' Together, as one heart – this story is the story of all of us.

Eli Turjeman worked tirelessly after the October 7 massacre, helping identify around 1,200 bodies; despite a decade of experience with disaster scenes, he was deeply affected by the scale and brutality, especially the state of the bodies Around 200 volunteers of the ZAKA emergency organization worked at the Shura IDF camp in Ramla, where approximately 1,200 bodies were transferred in the days following October 7 for identification. Eli Turjeman, 39, a father of five, was among them. He arrived at Shura on the night of October 7 and later continued working at the National Center of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. A decade-long ZAKA volunteer, Turjeman had witnessed horrific scenes before, including the 2021 Lag BaOmer stampede on Mount Meron which claimed 45 lives, but October 7 was different. 'Sadly, I've been at numerous events, including the Meron disaster, where I handled all 45 bodies. I've seen my share of death. I’ve been part of teams that handled every imaginable kind of natural and unnatural death—crime scenes, car accidents, terror attacks. I’ve dealt with dozens if not hundreds of children. But nothing compares to what I saw after the massacre. 'We’d never seen anything like it, neither in scale nor brutality. What struck me most was the degradation—the state of the bodies. Bound, burned, dismembered, children. We were the first to open the body bags and witness the devastation. Seeing such mass cruelty broke us. 'I was at the camp extensively during the first week, then went south for two days to collect bodies, and later worked at the Center of Forensic Medicine, where the hardest cases, bodies that couldn’t be identified, were sent. It’s indescribable. I would occasionally return to Shura to help. I’d finish at the center around 9 p.m., drive to Shura, stay until 2 or 3 a.m., and return to the center by 7 a.m. 'The real gut punch was that first morning when we left the camp and saw the families—crowds of hysterical, screaming families. It was difficult, but it pushed us to keep going, to give them answers and allow them to bury their loved ones. We knew the number of hostages wouldn’t be clear until our work was done, so we worked quickly, pulling double and triple shifts. 'There was a rabbinical ruling allowing us to continue working on weekends and violate Shabbat, which, as a Haredi Jew, was very hard for me. We worked around the clock, coming home at night, boiling bloodstained clothes, sleeping for a few hours, and going back. The smell was unbearable, and I’ll never forget it. 'There are soldiers on the battlefield, doctors in hospitals, and then there’s us. Everyone does their part. Not everyone can handle this.' 'You can’t handle so many bodies and remain the same person. People hear names, but we see faces. It stays with us; it never ends. We’re still there, reliving it over and over. I still see the faces and smell the stench. I always tell my fellow ZAKA volunteers—anyone who says they’re unaffected is lying. You can’t face such brutality and not be affected. And it's especially hard because we’re still at war. Every mention of hostages or another fallen soldier brings us back to October 7. 'I continue volunteering at the Forensic Center. How do I find the strength? This is my country. It's what I can give. When someone else is ready to take my place, I’ll gladly step aside. But until then, we’ll keep doing this. There are soldiers on the battlefield, doctors in hospitals, and then there’s us. Everyone does their part. Not everyone can handle this, but God gave me the strength to do it, and this is my mission.'

'You can’t handle so many bodies and remain the same person. People hear names, but we see faces. It stays with us; it never ends. We’re still there, reliving it over and over. I still see the faces and smell the stench. I always tell my fellow ZAKA volunteers—anyone who says they’re unaffected is lying. You can’t face such brutality and not be affected. And it's especially hard because we’re still at war. Every mention of hostages or another fallen soldier brings us back to October 7. 'I continue volunteering at the Forensic Center. How do I find the strength? This is my country. It's what I can give. When someone else is ready to take my place, I’ll gladly step aside. But until then, we’ll keep doing this. There are soldiers on the battlefield, doctors in hospitals, and then there’s us. Everyone does their part. Not everyone can handle this, but God gave me the strength to do it, and this is my mission.'

Remembering the October 7 massacre on social media	In today’s digital world, many of us find that the best way to express ourselves, mourn and remember what we’ve been through is through videos and posts; As we mark one year since the worst massacre in Israel’s history, there are those reminding the world that we Israelis are still living that day, there are still hostages who need to come home, and our grief is far from over Exactly one year ago, Israel experienced one of the most horrific and shocking days in its history. In the early morning hours of October 7, the terror organization Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israeli communities near the Gaza border, carrying out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. To this day, 101 hostages remain in captivity. Since the attack, Israel has faced a significant challenge in the battle of public opinion on social media, a challenge that grew as the fighting continued and images from Gaza flooded the internet. The country has put considerable effort into sharing accurate information and exposing the atrocities of terrorism to the international community. Prominent citizens and public figures from Israel and around the world have joined these efforts. On Monday, as the nation marks one year since the tragic events, social media has been flooded with posts commemorating that most awful day. These posts highlight the stories of the fallen, the murdered, and the hostages, alongside harrowing testimonies from survivors and shocking footage from the attack sites – all aimed at reminding the global community of the horrors that unfolded.

Britain withdraws family members of embassy staff from Israel	Britain has withdrawn the families of its embassy staff working in Israel due to the escalation in fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and the risk of a wider regional conflict. 'As a precautionary measure following escalation in the region, family members of British Embassy staff have been temporarily withdrawn,' the Foreign Office travel advice web page for Israel read. 'Our staff members remain.' Britain advises citizens against all travel to the area close to the border with Gaza and 'all but essential travel' to other parts of Israel and the West Bank due to the yearlong conflict between Israel and Hamas. But British citizens living in Israel are not being told to leave. Instead, they are being advised that consular assistance is 'severely limited.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byovwuzj1e	2024-10-07T05:18:26-07:00

Israel should bomb Iran's oil facilities,' Opposition Leader Yai...	Lapid issued rare warning two weeks before October 7 massacre, but when the war broke out, he set conditions for joining the emergency government; A year later, he explains what really happened in his talks with Netanyahu, what it's like being in the opposition during wartime, and how Israel should respond to Iran’s missile attack A year after the October 7 massacre, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid gave an interview on Monday in Ynet’s special broadcast. He discussed what Israel should do after Iran's brutal attack, why he didn’t immediately join the government when the war began, and why he issued an unusual warning on the eve of Yom Kippur in 2023. Nearly a week after Tehran’s ballistic missile strike, Lapid said Israel must target Iran’s oil fields. 'That’s Iran’s Achilles’ heel. There’s a complex discussion with the Americans about this, and I understand why they don’t want a spike in oil prices just before the U.S. elections. But that doesn’t change the fact that Israel has its own interests and perspectives,' he said. Why the oil fields? Why not the nuclear facilities? 'I believe we need to build a broader coalition to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. This should be done in coordination with the Americans. But right now, Israel must respond to two attacks, not just one. We didn’t respond strongly enough to the first attack. Iran’s Achilles’ heel is its economy. It’s a country on the brink of economic collapse, and you always strike where your enemy is weakest.' About two weeks before Hamas' surprise attack on October 7 of last year, Lapid delivered what is now called his 'warning speech,' cautioning Israelis about a 'violent, multi-front conflict.' Today, he explained that his message was based on intelligence and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was actually the one who 'pushed' for the warning to be shared with the public. 'I was in an opposition security briefing with the prime minister, and the information I heard was terrifying. When you have the kind of intel a prime minister sees, you know where to look. I then went to the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee three or four times to review the intelligence material. Everything was there – all the warnings.' Despite the intelligence being available to Netanyahu as well, Lapid said, 'he didn’t seem alarmed by it at all. The system was complacent. They heard the warnings and chose to ignore them. The entire system was so caught up in the idea that nothing would come from Gaza, and that Hamas should be strengthened.' Lapid argued that Hamas’ surprise attack happened because the terror group saw an opportunity. 'The government was focused on other things. The intelligence and military failures are beyond belief, and everyone involved should step down. But above all, Hamas felt there would never be a weaker government, one that was so unconcerned with security,' he said. Regarding the claim that protests against the judicial overhaul, including calls for reservists to refuse duty, contributed to the attack, Lapid dismissed it as 'dangerous nonsense.' He added: 'In a functioning state, the government is responsible for its citizens’ security – that’s the contract. Citizens have the right to protest in a democracy. I’ve always opposed refusal to serve, but from day one – since October 8 –they’ve tried to shift the blame from themselves.' The call for unity and staying out of the cabinet On October 7, Lapid called on Netanyahu to form an emergency government but without ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. As a result, he chose not to join the government alongside Benny Gantz. 'I was proven right,' Lapid said today. 'Gantz and Eisenkot’s decision to join was a mistake in my eyes, and after a few months they had to leave because no one listened to them. If you leave Netanyahu with the majority, it’s not a unity government. It’s just another Netanyahu government, where the rest are extras and he doesn’t have to listen to anyone.' He says that Ben-Gvir and Smotrich are undermining the war effort. 'They weaken Israel. They’re uncontrollable and drag us to the most extreme places. A big part of the reason why Israel, after suffering the worst blow in its history, is being attacked globally is because of their actions, their statements and the destruction they’re causing.' Lapid emphasized that Israel should pause the war to secure the release of all hostages. 'We need to kill Sinwar. He’s a dead man walking, and we will get him. But if we need to pause the war, even temporarily, to bring the hostages home, we should do it. That’s something Netanyahu wasn’t willing to consider,' he concluded.

‘We stormed the house and neutralized 3 terrorists, but the resid...	Capt. A. was called on October 7 from leave to Kibbutz Be'eri, where he saw smoke and heard gunfire; inside, he found civilian casualties, including women and children; amid the chaos, between battling terrorists, he met a girl he couldn't forget Kibbutz Be’eri is one of the symbols of the October 7 massacre and of the military’s failure to protect its citizens. A dark cloud of questions regarding how the fighting was conducted amidst all the chaos, still hovers over the events of that morning. One hundred and one community members were murdered and 31 were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip. In the battles within the kibbutz, 19 IDF soldiers were killed, along with eight Israeli police officers. This is the story of Capt. A., 444 Mobility Unit commander: 'On the morning of October 7, we were at the end of a week-long leave following a very intensive period in the army. I was woken by a phone call from my unit commander telling me there was a complex incident in the south, and that I needed to call up my company and get myself to the unit’s assembly point at Ze’elim. It was very early, and we didn’t yet understand what was going on.' 'I was on my way to the unit by 6:45, picking up soldiers along the way. We weren’t armed as our guns are stored when we’re on leave. So, we set out with kitchen knives. Our unit is in the Gaza border sector where mortars were falling, damaging our equipment and readiness for battle. In an effort to take control of the fire, I gathered a few soldiers, took two Sandcat Tigris armored vehicles, and set off. 'We used our instincts to get to Be’eri. We saw smoke from the kibbutz itself and heard a lot of automatic gunfire. In the afternoon, we were met with heavy fire when we tried getting in through the gate. So, we decided to go around the kibbutz and approach it from the south. But when we got there, our force encountered precision sniper fire. We spread ourselves out and returned fire. Two of our soldiers were wounded. We went in through the main gate anyway, as we knew that was the only point that somehow, the terrorists weren’t optimally prepared.' 'We advanced adjacent to the kibbutz’s surrounding northern fence and saw a vehicle go up in flames with a few bodies inside. I now know that was the security personnel who’d shown up at the kibbutz to provide a response. We then reached a junction and, for the first time, clearly saw the bodies of civilians. Bodies of women and children were lying there. We then started getting fired at from one of the houses on our right. We stormed the house where there were three terrorists whom we managed to neutralize. Sadly, the residents of that house were no longer alive.' 'The fighting that whole night was very intensive. At some stage, two Shaldag soldiers and I went to a relatively new neighborhood on the kibbutz, to a building on fire on its right-hand side. We started searching for survivors. We took cover behind a burnt-out vehicle and noticed a terrorist running toward us. We neutralized him and started walking in a kind of corridor between the wall and the house. We saw that they’d broken into the house through the saferoom window using gunfire and a powerful explosive device placed there. We broke down the window and the front door and got into the safe room where we found a woman’s body, with her family and a boy, who sadly had also been killed. Beside them was the wounded father writhing in pain, along with a girl who was also wounded.' 'We began providing medical response. We checked to see if the mother and boy could be saved, but their breathing and injuries were extremely severe. We put tourniquets on the girl and the two soldiers with me checked the father’s bleeding. He’d been hit twice by gunfire on the back. We took a chair. I’ll never forget that chair. It a was turquoise chair from the balcony. We lifted the girl and took her to the vehicle. She was a young girl with an enormous spirit. Her family had died before her eyes, her father was screaming in pain, and she was sitting there in silence, holding onto my hand. I told her, ‘Everything’s okay, everything’s okay. We’re getting you out now.’ She answered, ‘I know everything’s okay. Just take care of my father’. What a brave girl.' 'We put her in the vehicle and ran with the stretcher to bring out the father. Let’s just say, we had to stop for a while after that. There was a moment when everyone took a moment for themselves, to take it all in. We then rushed back, bringing out one family after the other.' 'During the course of that day, Capt. A. and his company evacuated 130 members of Kibbutz Be’eri and 30 fallen IDF soldiers that they brought out of the inferno using BALNAM 444 (Operational Driving School) Unit armored vehicles. He was only replaced on Sunday afternoon. He then went to the unit to organize a company for continued activity. 'It wasn’t until I got there, that I noticed I was covered in blood. and that my equipment was ruined. By early evening, we’d done a quick equipment inventory, checked the machines and vehicles, and set out for the outpost sectors. We took part in activity cleansing the fence sector of terrorists who were still alive.' 'We were there at the fence sector for a week and a half, along with special forces. By then, we understood that there were hostages, and we started collecting evidence and testimonies. We cleared fallen IDF soldiers and the bodies of terrorists. That week was very intense. I think that was the hardest part for the soldiers. They were walking around with medical masks on their faces, collecting body parts in efforts to bring the soldiers and civilians back for burial in Israel.' 'We later went into Gaza and took part in the IDF ground operation. This was the first time the Eitan AFV had taken part in combat operations – and in enemy territory. With the Eitans, we evacuated 364 wounded during the fighting, sadly, along with the fallen. We’re still operating in Gaza. 'I was hard on myself at the start. I’m not routinely part of the defense array in the Gaza sector. And yet, I was very critical and tough on myself. Why wasn’t I there? How didn’t I know before? Could I have done anything better to save lives? With time, I have come to understand that I couldn’t have done anything differently, but that was with me all along the way, even in battle. That’s a commander’s job. At least that’s what I believe – interrogating yourself and always understanding what you can do better. Being better and providing better response.'

We stopped for a moment and then rushed back.' Capt. A. A Mobility Unit officer was called up from leave and sent to Kibbutz Be’eri. From outside the kibbutz, he could hear gunfire and saw the billowing smoke, and inside the kibbutz he saw bodies of women and children, civilians who needed to be brought out.

Nova survivor: 'I later found out I broke several bones, but the ...	Itamar Or Luz vividly recalls the terror he faced at the music festival, narrowly escaping as terrorists ambushed and killed many around him, including friends; haunted by the violence and loss, he continues to struggle with the trauma, carrying the memories of that day with him constantly It was one of the deadliest terror attacks in history, but for hours, security forces failed to comprehend the full scale of the horror unfolding at the Nova music festival in Kibbutz Re’im. A total of 393 people were murdered, 44 were abducted to Gaza and hundreds were injured. Itamar Or Luz, 25, still struggles a year later to reconcile the joy he felt just minutes before 6:29 a.m. with the terror that followed. 'Anyone familiar with outdoor parties knows that at 6 a.m., the dance floor is packed. It’s when the best DJ comes on stage, and you want to be there, excited, as the sun rises. It’s indescribable. We were smiling from ear to ear, hugging, dancing and enjoying ourselves. We had been waiting for this party, and it was the last time we were all together. Seven friends went, and six returned. Ten other friends who came in separate cars didn’t come back, and one—Omer Wenkert—is still held captive in Gaza. 'When the first siren went off, we lay on the ground, hands over our heads. Fifteen minutes later, the security officer told everyone to evacuate. We packed up nonchalantly and helped others leave. When we saw our close friends getting into their cars, we figured we could go too. 'I got to the car with two friends, tried to head toward Route 232, and realized all the roads were blocked. A policeman we encountered told us that terrorists had infiltrated the sector. I served in the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, and my two friends were in the Egoz unit, so we understood the situation was different from what we thought, but we were sure it was just four or five terrorists, and the army would take care of it. We parked by the side of the road and waited near the festival entrance. 'Later, I found out I tore ligaments in my ankle and broke several bones, but the adrenaline kept me going. I felt nothing and continued running.' 'Someone suggested we lie next to a three-foot-high concrete barrier. Moments later, a missile hit behind us, and the barrier shattered into pieces. We lifted our heads, realized we were still alive and ran toward the road. A few feet before reaching the road, four pickup trucks stopped in front of us—ten terrorists in each. They aimed their weapons at us and began shooting. It was the first time I came face to face with terrorists. 'At that point, your mind switches. You don’t think, don’t feel—you just act. I veered right, away from everyone, knowing it was my only chance to survive. Meanwhile, I see people around me getting shot and collapsing on top of each other. Stopping was not an option. As I crawled toward the road, as I’d learned in the army, I saw people being shot and collapsing on top of each other. I couldn’t stop. I crawled to the road, and as soon as I lifted my head, two pickup trucks arrived with twenty terrorists, firing in all directions. The bullets missed me by inches. I reached a 20-foot pit and jumped. 'Later, I found out I tore ligaments in my ankle and broke several bones, but the adrenaline kept me going. I felt nothing and continued running. Suddenly, I saw three pickups with people dressed in IDF uniforms. I approached them, and they opened fire with submachine guns. I realized they were terrorists and jumped into the bushes. 'They knew people were hiding in the bushes and sprayed the area with gunfire before driving off. When they returned, they began shouting, 'IDF, IDF, we’re here, come out.' I saw this one girl come out, and the next thing I heard was screaming and gunfire. She just collapsed. They went from bush to bush, dragging people out, shooting them and loading others into trucks. I sat quietly, trying to blend into the bushes. I took off my shirt and tied it around my mouth, thinking that if I got shot, I wouldn’t scream. 'A few minutes later, they set up a command post about 20 or 25 feet from me. All the vehicles and motorcycles gathered there, and they sent out trucks to capture people. I witnessed kidnappings right before my eyes, but I didn’t grasp what was happening at the moment. I didn’t consider they were taking people to Gaza. I lay there from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., listening to them laugh, talk in Arabic and enjoy what they were doing. There was real excitement. 'Around 1:30 p.m., I began to hear IDF forces approaching, and the terrorists' laughter turned to fear. They knew they had no chance if the IDF arrived and began fleeing. By 2:20 p.m., there was total silence. I came out of the bushes and walked through bodies, trying to find just one person alive, but I couldn’t. I moved from body to body, burned-out car to burned-out car. I essentially retraced my steps back to the party. 'I saw hell. I saw the open shipping container full of bodies, blood covering the floor. I took another step toward the tents and saw people who had stayed behind and been murdered. Another step, and I reached the bar, where I saw people lying on the ground, bleeding, missing limbs, heads, hands. I realized no one had survived. Then I started asking myself, where are my friends? Where is everyone? 'A policeman put me in a car, and we drove along Route 232. There were no living people—just bodies, overturned vehicles and burned people. My dad waited for me on Highway 6 near Beit Kama, and we went to the hospital. It wasn’t until nighttime that I learned my friend, Ido Edri, had been killed. That’s when I broke down. He was like a brother to me. 'I never left Nova. My innocence, my soul—something was left there, at that party in October, in that forest. It stays with me every single day. Aside from the grief, the sleepless nights, the sudden bursts of tears when I hear a song in the car—there are the voices of the people who didn’t survive. The screams, the crying. I don’t have to relive it; it’s all in my mind. The ringing in my ears from the gunfire, from the trauma, the immense pain—it all follows me.'

Fifteen minutes later, the security officer told everyone to evacuate. We packed up nonchalantly and helped others leave. When we saw our close friends getting into their cars, we figured we could go too. 'I got to the car with two friends, tried to head toward Route 232, and realized all the roads were blocked. A policeman we encountered told us that terrorists had infiltrated the sector. I served in the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, and my two friends were in the Egoz unit, so we understood the situation was different from what we thought, but we were sure it was just four or five terrorists, and the army would take care of it. We parked by the side of the road and waited near the festival entrance. 'Later, I found out I tore ligaments in my ankle and broke several bones, but the adrenaline kept me going. I felt nothing and continued running.' 'Someone suggested we lie next to a three-foot-high concrete barrier. Moments later, a missile hit behind us, and the barrier shattered into pieces. We lifted our heads, realized we were still alive and ran toward the road. A few feet before reaching the road, four pickup trucks stopped in front of us—ten terrorists in each. They aimed their weapons at us and began shooting. It was the first time I came face to face with terrorists. 'At that point, your mind switches. You don’t think, don’t feel—you just act. I veered right, away from everyone, knowing it was my only chance to survive. Meanwhile, I see people around me getting shot and collapsing on top of each other. Stopping was not an option. As I crawled toward the road, as I’d learned in the army, I saw people being shot and collapsing on top of each other. I couldn’t stop. I crawled to the road, and as soon as I lifted my head, two pickup trucks arrived with twenty terrorists, firing in all directions. The bullets missed me by inches. I reached a 20-foot pit and jumped. 'Later, I found out I tore ligaments in my ankle and broke several bones, but the adrenaline kept me going. I felt nothing and continued running. Suddenly, I saw three pickups with people dressed in IDF uniforms. I approached them, and they opened fire with submachine guns. I realized they were terrorists and jumped into the bushes. 'They knew people were hiding in the bushes and sprayed the area with gunfire before driving off. When they returned, they began shouting, 'IDF, IDF, we’re here, come out.' I saw this one girl come out, and the next thing I heard was screaming and gunfire. She just collapsed. They went from bush to bush, dragging people out, shooting them and loading others into trucks. I sat quietly, trying to blend into the bushes. I took off my shirt and tied it around my mouth, thinking that if I got shot, I wouldn’t scream. 'A few minutes later, they set up a command post about 20 or 25 feet from me. All the vehicles and motorcycles gathered there, and they sent out trucks to capture people. I witnessed kidnappings right before my eyes, but I didn’t grasp what was happening at the moment. I didn’t consider they were taking people to Gaza. I lay there from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., listening to them laugh, talk in Arabic and enjoy what they were doing. There was real excitement. 'Around 1:30 p.m., I began to hear IDF forces approaching, and the terrorists' laughter turned to fear. They knew they had no chance if the IDF arrived and began fleeing. By 2:20 p.m., there was total silence. I came out of the bushes and walked through bodies, trying to find just one person alive, but I couldn’t. I moved from body to body, burned-out car to burned-out car. I essentially retraced my steps back to the party. 'I saw hell. I saw the open shipping container full of bodies, blood covering the floor. I took another step toward the tents and saw people who had stayed behind and been murdered. Another step, and I reached the bar, where I saw people lying on the ground, bleeding, missing limbs, heads, hands. I realized no one had survived. Then I started asking myself, where are my friends? Where is everyone? 'A policeman put me in a car, and we drove along Route 232. There were no living people—just bodies, overturned vehicles and burned people. My dad waited for me on Highway 6 near Beit Kama, and we went to the hospital. It wasn’t until nighttime that I learned my friend, Ido Edri, had been killed. That’s when I broke down. He was like a brother to me. 'I never left Nova. My innocence, my soul—something was left there, at that party in October, in that forest. It stays with me every single day. Aside from the grief, the sleepless nights, the sudden bursts of tears when I hear a song in the car—there are the voices of the people who didn’t survive. The screams, the crying. I don’t have to relive it; it’s all in my mind. The ringing in my ears from the gunfire, from the trauma, the immense pain—it all follows me.'

The operation was in response to intelligence indicating intentions to start riots in facilities across the country, one year to the day, after the Hamas atrocities. The coordinated operation began in the pre-dawn hours, with forces using stun grenades and entering cell compounds from all directions. After inmates were taken to an external location, forces conducted searches and found makeshift knives among other materials. Intelligence gathered by the Prison Authorities revealed that some of the prisoners planned to use electrical wires hidden in the walls, to kill guards. Some of the materials confiscated in the searches and the condition of the electric sockets in some of the cells, confirmed those reports Prison Authority chief Chief warrant officer Kobi Yaakovi said the authority prepared in advance to respond to any attempted riot or violence. 'The Prison Authority remains vigilant and shows zero tolerance for any acts of terror,' he said.

Explosion heard near Israeli embassy in Copenhagen	Explosion overnight Monday comes five days after a grenade attack on the building and on the anniversary of the October 7 massacre; Israeli embassy in Stockholm targeted by gunfire An explosion was heard overnight some 500 meters from the Israeli embassy in Denmark, Copenhagen police said Monday, five days after an attack on the diplomatic building. 'We are of course looking into whether there could be a link to the incident at the Israeli embassy,' Copenhagen police inspector Trine Møller told reporters. 'There is no indication that this is the case,' she added, however, specifying that the explosion was probably caused by gunfire. Local press footage shows traces of the explosion in front of a residential building some 500 meters as the crow flies from the Israeli embassy. On the night of October 1-2, explosions occurred very close to the same embassy, ​​probably caused by grenades thrown, in the context of tensions in the Middle East. According to the prosecution, two young Swedes, aged 16 and 19, are suspected of having transported five grenades and throwing two that landed on a terrace about a hundred meters from the diplomatic building. They were placed in custody by a judge on Thursday for 27 days. Two days later, the police indicated that the charges against them had been extended to offenses under the legislation on terrorism, without giving further details. In Sweden, the Israeli embassy in Stockholm was targeted by gunfire, which did not cause any injuries, on Tuesday. The Swedish intelligence services have not ruled out the involvement of Iran in these two incidents.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1mc8xwkje	2024-10-07T02:25:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/07/S100t00Qb1Jl/S100t00Qb1Jl_673_108_2328_1310_0_small.jpg
UNIFIL rejects IDF demand to move north of fighting	Military urges peacekeepers to move 5 kilometers north to avoid the fighting; Irish president says Israeli demand is 'outrageous' after his soldiers make up a considerable portion of the UNIFIL deployment UNIFIL forces in South Lebanon refused an Israeli request to move five kilometers to the north to avoid the fighting and allow the troops to complete clearing villages along the border of Hezbollah fighters so that the residents of the north can return safely to their homes. UNIFIL claimed the IDF was endangering their troops after Israeli tanks took up positions near the peacekeeping force. Ireland, which has 347 of its soldiers deployed among the UN force's 10,000-strong presence in Lebanon, refused the IDF's request, even though 30 Irish soldiers were deployed close to the fighting. The government in Dublin officially told Israel that it refuses to move the UNIFIL force, resulting in an exchange of blame between the Israeli embassy there and Irish President Michael Higgins, a known critic of Israel. 'It is outrageous that the Israel Defense Forces have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending,' Higgins said earlier this week adding that Israel is in violation of UN resolution 1701. 'There is an obligation on Israel and Hezbollah to respect the role of UN peacekeepers and their mandate, and do nothing that would put peacekeepers and our troops in particular in harm’s way,' he said. The Israeli embassy in Dublin said in a statement that the accusation that Israeli troops threatened peacekeepers was false and that the IDF asked UNIFIL to move north for their own safety. 'Let's be clear, the peacekeeping forces have great importance in Israel. The attempt to describe their actions as a threat to UNIFIL is another baseless and defamatory charge, the likes of which we have observed in recent months,' the embassy said in a statement. UNIFIL Spokesperson Andrea Teneti said the peacekeeping force will continue to carry out its duties. 'UN continues to be in contact with the relevant actors on both sides of the Blue Line to de-escalate the situation,' he said.

728 fallen troops, over 25,000 rockets fired at Israel in year of...	IDF reports over 14,000 eliminated terrorists in Gaza, 800 in Lebanon; 347 soldiers and one female soldier have fallen since the Gaza ground operation, while 10 soldiers have fallen in Lebanon; and 4,576 soldiers have been wounded On the anniversary of the October 7 massacre, the deadliest event in Israel’s history, the IDF released a comprehensive report on Monday detailing the toll since the beginning of the war. The report includes data on casualties, the wounded –both physically and mentally – and missile launches that have disrupted daily life in Israel, along with operational successes and the inspiring mobilization of reservists. Since the war began, 728 IDF soldiers have fallen, and of these 347 fighters and one female soldier were killed since the start of the ground maneuver in Gaza, while 10 soldiers have been killed in southern Lebanon since Israel launched Operation Northern Arrows. Additionally, 56 soldiers have died in operational accidents, including 28 from friendly fire incidents and 20 from accidents such as vehicular mishaps and mishandling of ordnance. Other causes include shooting accidents, hazardous materials and air incidents. A total of 4,576 soldiers have been wounded since the war started, 2,299 of them since the ground incursion in Gaza began. Of the total, 1,037 were injured in operational accidents, including weapon malfunctions, hazardous materials exposure and friendly fire. Some 29 soldiers remain hospitalized in serious condition, 151 in moderate condition, and 16 are lightly injured. Since the start of the war, approximately 4,100 soldiers have been evacuated via helicopters and vehicles. Additionally, around 15,000 soldiers have been treated for trauma-related symptoms, with 82% returning to active combat. The response to the 'emergency call-up' orders, known as Tzav 8, has been described as 'inspiring' by the IDF. Around 300,000 reservists have been mobilized since the war began, 20% of them women. The majority, or 46.5%, are aged 20-29. Nearly 5% of the reservists are men aged 50-59, with more than 1% from the 60-69 age group. Reservists have received approximately 7.6 billion shekels in grants as of last month. Throughout the war, tens of thousands of rockets have been launched at Israel. By October 2, 2024, approximately 13,200 rockets had been fired from Gaza, 12,400 from Lebanon, around 400 from Iran, 180 from Yemen, and 60 from Syria. Due to the volume of attacks, Israeli citizens have heavily relied on the Home Front Command’s online portal, which recorded 180.3 million visits and 750,000 emergency hotline calls as of last month. The IDF has reported significant operational achievements. Since the start of the war, around 14,000 terrorists were killed in Gaza, with an additional 3,000 likely neutralized by the end of last month. This includes eight high-ranking commanders, 30 battalion leaders, and around 165 company commanders. In northern Israel, over 800 terrorists have been killed, including 90 commanders. In the Central Command, over 690 terrorists have been eliminated. Meanwhile, IDF Unit 504 has conducted approximately 7,000 interrogations since the war began. In the past year of fighting, Israel has struck countless targets. More than 40,000 airstrikes have been carried out in Gaza, and around 4,700 tunnels have been discovered. In the north, nearly 5,000 airstrikes and around 6,000 ground targets have been hit. While the main theaters of war are in the north and south, military operations have also been ongoing in the Central Command. More than 10,000 raids have been carried out, and over 5,000 suspects have been arrested in the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. About 30 homes belonging to terrorists have been demolished, and around 1,000 weapons have been seized. During the war, the IDF has distributed vast quantities of logistical supplies, including around 70,000 personal weapons, 94,000 ceramic vests, 95,000 combat vests, and over 30,000 helmets. Additionally, 1.2 million uniforms, 138,000 sleeping bags, 185,000 protective goggles, and around 225,000 mattresses have been handed out. To sustain the troops, approximately 4 million tons of combat rations, 28 tons of fruits and vegetables, and 920,000 tons of protein bars, cookies, candy, and gum have been supplied. The IDF has also highlighted the generous food donations from civilians for the soldiers on the frontlines.

Demonstration in Berlin for October 7 calls to 'liberate Haifa, J...	Two marches were held in Berlin to mark the anniversary of October 7: One in memory of the victims in which the members of the Jewish community marched in silence from the Brandenburg Gate, and the other in Kreuzberg, which was saturated with expressions of hatred; 'You Jews have not learned the lessons of the Holocaust,' said a kippah-clad protester The world is commemorating the October 7 Hamas massacre on Monday) in thousands of events including in rallies and marches, in ceremonies in Jewish communities and synagogues, in special events and discussion groups - but there are also those who prefer, even now a year later, to focus on hatred and blame Israel for all its troubles and the most terrible killing spree in its history. On Sunday evening in the Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, organizers of a pro-Palestinian demonstration and the leading truck with the announcer and the speakers waited and waited, but the general rehearsal for the big demonstration on October 7 did not quite live up to expectations. 'We have a force of 500 or 600 policemen here,' a policeman who was standing in Kottbusser-Tor, the square from where the procession started toward the immigrant neighborhood of Neukalen, and where only a little over a thousand protesters had gathered, told me. 'We thought we would have a police officer for every eight to 10 protesters. It's a bit surprising. But it's less work for us.' The official reason for the demonstration was to express solidarity with the residents of Gaza and Lebanon, and alongside it there were quite a few expressions of joy on the anniversary of the October 7 massacre in the Gaza border communities. There were two separate camps at the demonstration: Germans and Anglo-Saxons from the German left, and Muslim immigrants; Flags of Palestine, Lebanon and Ireland waved wildly; Drummers loudly beat drums; The famous keffiyeh officially announced the year in which it climbed to the top of the fashion icons in the Western world in black and white, blue and white, yellow and black, red and khaki. There were all the usual signs with the same old sayings, such as: 'A thief cannot own what he stole' and 'Occupying Palestine since 1948.' And there were also Israeli demonstrators with signs against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hate is in the air. The announcer chanted against the 'brutal police' and reminded the protesters not to give them any reason to disperse the demonstration. And instead of chanting 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,' they shouted: 'We will not stop until we liberate Haifa, Jaffa, Acre, Safed and Tel Aviv,' and the announcer added: 'From the sea to the sea, this is the only real way to say it and no German white policeman or God will not stop me from saying that.' He also called 'Netanyahu and Scholz you will see, Palestine will be free,' and congratulated their 'brothers' in the resistance movement in 'Gaza, Nablus, Tulkarm and Daheih'. The last place, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut, is the name that evoked the loudest applause. And of course: 'Germany finances, Israel bombs' and 'Five, six, seven, eight, end of Zionism.' I asked Maya, a German student in a fashionable hoodie, if it wasn't strange for her to stand in the middle of Berlin and not sympathize with even one word or act against the biggest murder of Jews since the Holocaust. She pointed to the banner that was hanging on the side of the announcement truck: 'It started long before October 7,' it says, a slogan that has become commonplace among Israel haters. 'I pay taxes to the German government, and I cannot and do not want to be complicit in the genocide and child murder that Israel commits with this money,' she said, adding: 'to stand aside and look at the other side, is to wash our hands of a crime that I am complicit in. I think this is the lesson we learned from the Third Reich. It seems that, according to their behavior, the Jews in Israel did not learn the right lesson.' A young British man passed by us with a sign that compared the pro-Palestinian protest to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. The procession started fashionably late, but it didn't really get going. The ratio was one policeman for every three protesters. 'The hate demonstration is a direct continuation of the terror celebrations in Neukalen on October 7 - the distribution of sweets for the murder of Jews,' Israel's ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, said. 'When talking about 3,200 antisemitic crimes in Germany, this is what it looks like. This is the face of Islamist antisemitism that thrives under the cover of freedom of expression.' At a distance of about four kilometers away, a quieter and calmer procession took place, in which hundreds of Jews and Germans who came to sympathize with the victims of the massacre and the hostages who remain in captivity. Several people held in their hands the headline of the important Berlin newspaper Tagsspiegel, which, like other newspapers, printed the faces of the hostages on its cover. They walked in silence from the Brandenburg Gate to the Bebelplatz public square, silent, as if they couldn't believe that a year had already passed since their world had been shaken on a Saturday in early autumn last year. Events marking October 7 to be held in New York In the meantime, more than 400 commemorative events will be held Monday in the U.S. to commemorate the massacre, including exhibitions, shows and interactive activities. Many of the organizers are deliberately obfuscating the location and date of the events for fear of anti-Israel protests, but the Jewish Federations of North America has launched a dedicated website detailing the events. In New York, there will be a major central ceremony led by Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon, where singer Eden Golan will perform 'October Rain,' the song rejected by Eurovision as too political. The 'Last Embrace' exhibition by the artist Yifat Pe’er, dedicated to the victims of October 7, will also be launched at UN headquarters. In the evening, a rally will be held in Central Park, at the initiative of the JNFA, with performances by Eden Golan, David Broza, and student choirs, as well as a candle lighting ceremony in memory of the victims with the participation of families of hostages. In addition, the Chabad community will lead a huge march in Manhattan in memory of the victims, Emanu El synagogue will become a night club in solidarity with the survivors of the Nova music festival, and synagogues and Jewish community centers will hold their own events. Several states in the US lowered their flags to half-mast to mark the massacre, and central buildings in New York state were lit up yellow at the order of Governor Kathy Hochul. At the same time as these events, huge pro-Palestinian demonstrations are expected, especially on campuses. At Columbia University there will be a large protest, and at the University of Maryland, following an unusual court ruling, the university was forced to allow a demonstration.

US envoy says Israel must be more secure after war but must rely ...	U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew said Israel must emerge from the war more secure, not only through its military might but also its diplomatic agreements. He said there must be consideration of the day after the war in Gaza that would not be perceived by countries in the region as an occupation of the Strip. Lew said the ultimate goal is to find a way to reduce Israeli-Palestinian tension so that terror groups like Hamas would not be the preferred option for Palestinians.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1caaw11j1l	2024-10-07T00:34:25-07:00

Until hostages are free, mission continues with force, IDF comman...	Military says it struck Hamas rocket launchers after a strike on the Gaza border area at the exact time the massacre began a year ago and while ceremonies commemorating the victims were taking place; Commander says the troops' eyes are focused on their mission and their spirit is high The IDF said on Monday that its forces fired at Hamas launchers in Gaza after rockets were fired at border communities. Hamas launched the rockets at 6.30 AM the exact hour that the massacre began a year ago and as ceremonies commemorating the victims of the atrocities were taking place in communities and at the site of the Nova music festival. The military said targets in central Gaza were also hit while troops were operating there. Forces entered Jabaliya on Sunday. Palestinian media reported widespread strikes in the Jabaliya area, while the IDF announced a targeted airstrike on a Hamas complex in the city. According to the military, air force jets struck Hamas terrorists operating from a command and control center previously used as a UNRWA facility. Captain Nadav Sarlin said that as long as hostages are being held in Gaza, there can be no defeat of Hamas. ' The soldiers don't ask questions and are just keen to carry out their mission and bring more achievements,' he told Ynet. 'Like the many tunnels we uncovered in recent weeks, near the Philadelphi Corridor and the weapons we destroyed in Rafah. It is clear there that there are more targets to go after.' Sarlin said he lost two men in the fighting but the motivation of his troops remained high. 'They've never lost sight of their missions and objectives and their spirits are sky high.' Senior IDF commanders hope that with the Lebanon front taking center stage, Israel will be able to cut the link between the northern and southern fronts, Between Hezbollah and Hamas, which would change the tied in the war and begin to bring it to an end. Israel's deterrence has also returned after the targeted killing of Hezbollah's leadership and the assaults on its assets and they hope the offensive there would be completed within a couple of weeks. They also hoped that the West Bank would not ignite and become another prominent front in the war. But the commanders understand that there will be a need to launch attacks on Hamas in Gaza in the coming year, especially since the government continues to avoid alternative rule over the Strip's two million residents.

Ground operation expands in Lebanon	A week after the IDF's entry into Lebanon, 3 reserve brigades begin 'targeted and limited' ground operation; These are fighters who also fought in the Gaza Strip. Commander of 91st division: 'It is time to change the security situation in the north, for the sake of returning the residents to their homes' The ground operation in southern Lebanon is expanding, about a week after the IDF's entry into Lebanon. The IDF spokesman reported Monday morning that three reserve brigades have begun a 'localized and targeted operational activity' in southern Lebanon. The addition of the brigades signifies the expansion of the ground operation that began in southern Lebanon last week. These solders have fought in the Gaza Strip and the northern sector throughout the last year, and in the last two weeks were re-mobilized. The commander of the division, Lt. Col. Shai Klapper, told the soldiers upon their entry into South Lebanon: 'Soldiers of the 91st Division, my brothers in arms in the regular and in the reserves. For many months you have sacrificed yourselves and worked with endless dedication to form the northern protective wall of our country. Today, the eve of October 7, a year after the enemy's attack on all fronts, a year in which we significantly damaged the enemy and returned the war, the Galilee formation is marching forward.' In a message to the soldiers, he discussed entering Lebanon: 'You, the reserve men, who were the first to show up on the northern front, are going to attack the enemy on his territory. This is our time to change the security reality in the north, for the sake of returning the residents to their homes.' On Monday morning, before the IDF spokesman's announcement of additional brigades joining the fighting, it released the name of a soldier killed in battle on the Lebanese border: Master sergeant (res.) Etay Azulay, 25, from Oranit. In the incident in which Azulay fell, two other soldiers were seriously injured. Since the ground operation in Lebanon began, about a week ago, 10 IDF soldiers have been killed in battles in the northern arena. During the operation in southern Lebanon, the IDF soldiers located many weapons, some of them in underground tunnel systems intended to be used by Hezbollah terrorists to stay and launch an attack near the northern settlements. An underground munitions warehouse was found in one of the houses, containing dozens of anti-tank missiles, weapons, cartridges, Radwan force uniforms, vests and helmets. The warehouse was destroyed and the munitions were confiscated.

Family learns one year later that hostage Idan Shtivi was murdere...	A year after he was abducted from the Nova party while trying to help a couple he met for the first time escape, the family of hostage Idan Shtivi was informed that he was murdered on the morning of the massacre; 'We all prayed that he was alive, unfortunately the bitter news shatters that hope' Hostage Idan Shtivi was murdered one year ago on October 7 by Hamas terrorists, his family was informed on Monday. His body was kidnapped and is being held in Gaza. Until Monday, Idan was believed to be alive. 'We all prayed that Idan ben Haim would live and return to his family. Unfortunately, the bitter news shatters this hope,' said the Petah Tikva municipality, where he lived, in a statement. Idan, 28, loved nature, photography and animals. He was very attached to dogs and other animals and was about to start his second year studying sustainability at Reichmann University. On October 7 he arrived at the Nova music festival to film his friends playing and giving workshops. When the attack began, Idan helped a young couple he met for the first time at the festival to escape, a choice that eventually led to his kidnapping. Idan is survived by his parents Eli and Dalit, three brothers and his partner, Stav. Some 101 hostages, alive and dead, are still being held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip one year after the attack. For 90 days after the surprise attack by Hamas, Shtivi's relatives and friends waited for information about his fate. On January 5, the IDF spokesman informed his family that he was identified as a hostage in the Gaza Strip. 'Hold on, my man. A little more. When you come back the house is waiting for you, with all your things and your equipment. I won't give up on you, and I won't stop believing,' his partner wrote last week, ahead of the start of the school year. Three days ago, Eli Shtivi , Idan's father, wrote on his Facebook account: 'Idan Shtivi is my beloved child. Come back, come back already ❤️🙏🙏', alongside videos of his son.

Australians hold vigils on anniversary of Oct. 7 Hamas massacre	Australians gathered for vigils on Monday to mark the first anniversary of Hamas' deadly attack on Israel, but the events were muted after authorities warned of tougher security measures. At Sydney's famed Bondi Beach, participants holding Israeli and Australian flags listened in silence to a reading of the names of Israel's 101 hostages still held by Hamas. Some pro-Palestinian events planned in Australia to coincide with the anniversary were brought forward a day after talks with authorities, but pro-Israel groups went ahead with the events, from Bondi to Parliament House in Canberra, the capital. At Parliament House, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott told an event organized by Christian group Never Again Is Now that he lamented civilian Palestinian deaths but admired 'the way Israel has been so incredibly fastidious in trying to avoid them'. In a statement on Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he condemned the Hamas assault a year earlier but added, 'As we mourn and reflect, we also re-affirm a fundamental principle of our shared humanity: every innocent life matters.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1fgwx11kyl	2024-10-06T22:27:51-07:00

In one year of war, Israel strikes 40,000 Hamas targets in Gaza	In the past year in the Gaza Strip, Israel has bombed more than 40,000 targets, found 4,700 tunnel shafts and destroyed 1,000 rocket launcher sites, the military said on Monday, the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas massacre. Some 726 Israeli soldiers had been killed since Oct. 7, 2023. Of those, 380 died in the Oct. 7 attacks and 346 in Gaza combat starting Oct. 27, 2023. Injured troops numbered 4,576 since that date.

They Looked Death in Eye. We Mustn’t Forget Them: Maya Desiatnik,...	Each and every story is a whole life; together, however, they make up a puzzle. Many stories have not yet come to light: These are testimonies of soldiers and survivors of the 7/10 massacre, gathered from those who may still not have found the words 'I couldn’t believe they’d hurt them in their pajamas.' Maya Desiatnik, lookout and death war room survivor. The Nahal Oz sector was finally quiet on 6/10. When the sirens kicked off, Maya suddenly noticed terrorists running toward the fence. She recalls the battle, how she lost contact with her friends in the shelter unit, and how she fled the war room that had been set on fire. 'I forced myself to open my eyes.' She’s been rehabilitating and yearning ever since. 'What I Saw There,' a series of chilling testimonies from the day everything changed. Fifty-two male and female soldiers, including 15 lookout soldiers, died at Nahal Oz on the morning of October 7 in one of the first and harshest battles fought that day. The lookouts saw everything and reported everything. They warned and courageously directed forces. Reinforcements showed up only after several, long hours and there was no one to rescue them. Seven were kidnapped by terrorists to Gaza and one has been murdered in captivity. Only two survived the inferno. This is the story of Maya Desiatnik, the only lookout to survive that inferno. 'On October 6, a few hours before the massacre, we were having a discharge party for the late Staff Sgt. Shahaf Nissani. She called the party 'The Last Disco' and hung up of decorations around the sign reading 'Nahal Oz is Home.' It’s so sad to think about it. At the time, there were lots of disturbances in the sector, and that weekend in particular was quiet. We ate together, laughed and sang. We didn’t want the evening to end.' I got up at 3:30 for a war room shift. The rockets started at around 6:30. The siren in the war room was incessant and we saw people running to the fence, a huge pickup truck crossing the fence. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. We declared an infiltration, and we gradually started saying invasion. It was scary just saying it out loud.' 'We’d never drilled directing the soldiers in a scenario on this scale. There was just one force in the field and one on base. In my sector, there were already several infiltration points. My friend, the late Sgt. Yael Leibushor, who was sitting next to me, saw dozens of terrorists on their way to us and to Kibbutz Nahal Oz. The commanders started huddling around her counting the terrorists on their way to the outpost. They saw them turn and go it and saw the battle at the outpost gate. I didn’t watch. I couldn’t.' 'We were scared, but we knew the only thing we could do was function. I didn’t think of myself at that moment. I told myself that I was serving in a position.' 'About a quarter of an hour to 15 minutes later, the terrorists got past the gate and got into the outpost and we watched them go to the war room. We were told to hide in our officer, the late Capt. Shir Eilat’s office. We sat there one on top of the other. There was no space. One girl would straighten her legs, then one would crouch down. We managed to stay in contact with our friends in the shelter, until around 7:30 when they stopped responding. At the time, we thought reception was down.' 'The siren in the war room was incessant and we saw people running to the fence and a huge pickup truck crossing the fence. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. We declared an infiltration, and we gradually started saying ‘invasion’, It’s scary just saying that out loud.' Maya and her friends hid out for six hours straight in the office in the war room, as the heroic battle was raging around them, fighting to the last bullet. Fifty-two male and female soldiers fell at Nahal Oz that morning. 'I remember at some stage, the language changed from ‘We need reinforcement’ to ‘We need rescuing’. We could hear terrorists talking, going up to the war room roof, shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’. They shot at the war room from outside and threw grenades in. When they realized they couldn’t get in, they set it on fire, with all of us inside.' 'Smoke came in and it was hard to breathe. We tried blocking the office entrance to stop the smoke from coming in, but it didn’t help. We started coughing and choking and everyone left. I remember trying, and being unable, to talk. I’d open my mouth, and I’d get smoke in my mouth.' 'I knew I had to carry on walking, I heard one of the officers shouting, ‘Get out through the bathroom window’. I fell several times on the way. My eyes were burning up and I told myself I had to force myself to open them to find the bathroom. When made it there, the sink had been broken by whoever had used it before me to get out. I just legged up and jumped from the window.' 'I got out, sat down and waited. One of the male soldiers came out of the other window. He had been severely affected by the smoke. My throat was burning up too. There was gunfire, sirens and no one around. Where were the girls?' 'We moved 40 minutes later to hide somewhere else – between the bushes and the concrete barricade blocks. We spent almost two hours there, until the paratroopers came to rescue us.' Seven people were rescued from the burning war room. Maya was the only lookout. At the Nahal Oz outpost, 15 lookouts were murdered on October 7, and seven were kidnapped. The late lookout, Noa Marciano, was murdered in Hamas captivity and Ori Magadish was rescued from Gaza by IDF forces. Five lookouts are still in captivity: Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev. 'I do think why me, and whether it could have ended differently. When I got out of there, I still held onto the hope that they might have somehow escaped, and that I hadn’t seen them. As for the girls in the shelter, I just couldn’t believe they’d hurt them like that in their pajamas, with no guns. Whenever I’d hear about another girl, my hope would burst a little more. On the day they told me about the late Sgt. Ronni Eshel, my hope completely shattered. Ronni was the last one listed as missing. ' 'I’m beginning to rehabilitate, but it’s hard. I had plans. After my discharge in August, I was going to go to Sinai or Eilat with the girls – whatever we’d decide. But there’s no way I’m going without them. I try finding some kind of routine, but it’s hard. It’s especially hard when they’re still there. I know that in the meantime, I can recover 75-80% tops, but I can only make up those last points when they come back, only when they all come back.'

God save the Tsar!': Putin receives first wishes for 72nd birthda...	God save the Tsar!' was one of the first public birthday wishes for President Vladimir Putin who turns 72 on Monday and who has been Russia's paramount leader for nearly quarter of a century. The greeting came from ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin on his Telegram messaging channel minutes after midnight. Dugin, 62, has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories in a vast new Russian empire, which he wants to include Ukraine. Putin, who ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in 2022, won a record post-Soviet landslide in a March election. His new six-year term, if completed, would make him Russia's longest-serving leader for more than 200 years when tsars and empresses ruled the country.

IDF names fallen soldier in north as Hamas fires rockets at borde...	The terror group attacks Gaza border communities at the exact hour the massacre began one year ago and while a moment of silence was observed in memory of the victims; Master Sergeant Etay Azulay killed on Lebanon border, two others injured The IDF said on Monday that Master Sergeant Etay Azulay, aged 25, from Oranit, a soldier in Unit 5515, fell during combat on the Lebanese border. Two other soldiers were wounded and taken to hospital. Since the start of the war one year ago today, 728 men and women in service have fallen. Gaza rockets targeted the border area communities at 6:30 am, the exact time the Hamas massacre began last year and when residents in the south and families of those massacred, marked a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the atrocities. The rocket fire came after the military said it was attacking Hamas rocket launchers and terror targets in the Strip. Moments of silence were observed elsewhere in Israel as the day of commemoration of those who were slaughtered began. Earlier in the early morning hours, the military said it intercepted two hostile aircraft heading to central Israel from the east. Sirens blared in Rishon Lezion, south of Tel Aviv as the drones were nearing Israeli airspace. No injuries were reported. Overnight the IDF struck Beirut's Dahieh quarter while Haifa, Tiberias and surrounding areas came under attack. One man suffered serious injuries from shrapnel and a number of others were also hurt.

Florida braces for Hurricane Milton on the heels of Helene	Florida prepared on Sunday for its largest evacuation since 2017 as Hurricane Milton intensified in the Gulf of Mexico on its path toward the U.S. state's western coast, coming on the heels of the devastating Hurricane Helene. Milton, which strengthened from a tropical storm to hurricane on Sunday, was projected to make landfall on Wednesday morning, most likely hitting near the heavily populated Tampa Bay area, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The new hurricane has the potential to affect areas already hit hard by Helene, which made landfall further north on the coast on Sept. 26. Kevin Guthrie, director of Florida's emergency management division, urged people to prepare for the 'largest evacuation that we have seen most likely since 2017 Hurricane Irma.' Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned of a potentially higher storm surge and more power outages from Milton compared to Helene, and said destruction from Helene could be compounded. Mexico issued a hurricane watch for the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, the center added. In the United States, North Carolina, Florida and much of the South were still recovering from the massive destruction caused by Helene, which killed more than 200 people across six states.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1dlafx11e	2024-10-06T15:20:55-07:00

Netanyahu holds hostage deal meeting on eve of October 7	For first time in a month, PM convenes security discussion on 'new ideas' to break deadlock in hostage negotiations; sources privy to details say Sinwar not responding; intelligence reports suggest half of 101 hostages alive but in critical conditions On Sunday evening, on the eve of the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas massacre, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened an unusual meeting to address the stalemate in negotiations for the release of hostages held in Gaza for a full year. The Prime Minister's Office reported that the meeting included security chiefs, hostages and missing persons coordinator Gal Hirsch, and several government ministers. During the meeting, security officials presented an intelligence assessment previously disclosed by Netanyahu, indicating that about half of the 101 hostages held by Hamas are alive, but their condition is dire. 'The captors have made their conditions much worse. There are clear instructions for the captors that if they sense danger and that the IDF is approaching, they are to execute the hostages, as happened in Tel Sultan (in Rafah) with the six hostages who were murdered.' Officials in the meeting claimed: 'As time passes, there is less and less intelligence on the hostages, which is very concerning.' Sources familiar with the details added that no discussion on the hostages had taken place for an entire month, and Sunday evening's meeting was the first held in the last month. They suggested Netanyahu convened the meeting on the eve of the October 7 massacre anniversary 'to fulfill an obligation' and to avoid accusations of neglect. According to them, mediators are distancing themselves from the Israeli position, and Qatar is leaning more toward Hamas. 'The U.S. just wants to avoid escalation and lives in a fantasy that everything can be settled with Iran, the north and Gaza by resolving everything together,' a mediator said. Negotiations for a deal are at an impasse. There is no progress. Sinwar is entrenched. Knowledgeable sources also stated that the Israeli-American argument that they do not know the whereabouts of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, and thus cannot make a deal, is inaccurate, as discussions can still occur with senior Hamas figures abroad. 'There is an impression that no one is dealing with this, not even the mediators, and everyone has given up. The feeling is that it is no longer a priority, overshadowed by the fear of regional war,' a source said. Despite the significant pessimism from these sources, Israel has been considering new ideas regarding the deal in recent weeks, and mediators are also exploring different ideas with Hamas, but everything remains stalled, and Sinwar has not responded. Meanwhile, there are questions about whether Sinwar is even alive or if he is out of contact for another reason. 'Negotiations for a deal are at an impasse. There is no progress. Sinwar is entrenched,' a source familiar with the details said Sunday evening. 'We are waiting for the impact from the north and, in the meantime, we are considering ideas about what can be done,' a source added, referring to the current battles in the ground operation in southern Lebanon. Netanyahu himself has publicly assessed that a severe blow to Hezbollah would also help increase pressure on Sinwar to reach a deal. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant met with hostage families at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, ahead of the Salon Otef event marking the anniversary of their loved ones' abductions. 'The families expressed to the minister the deep pain they are experiencing in these difficult days and asked him to remind all Cabinet ministers and the government that the war's ultimate goal is the return of the 101 hostages,' the Hostages and Missing Families Forum reported. However, Gallant noted the Cabinet has not discussed the hostage issue for two weeks. 'In addition, the families expressed grave concern over the IDF's return to fighting in the northern Gaza Strip as, unfortunately, we have seen that military pressure kills hostages. The Defense Minister stated that the issue of the hostages' presence in the area is a top priority for the IDF, and the entire security system is committed to returning all the hostages home,' the headquarters reported. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syi1xdgj1g	2024-10-06T15:09:37-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/20/BkGH2oOQC/BkGH2oOQC_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Hezbollah says fired Fadi 1 rockets at Carmel base south of Haifa	Hezbollah claims responsibility for 'firing a barrage of Fadi 1 rockets at the Carmel base south of Haifa.' It said that the shooting was carried out 'in support of the Palestinian people in Gaza, in support of the resistance, in defense of Lebanon and the Lebanese people, as part of a series of 'Khibar' operations, in response to the damage caused by Israel on citizens and the killing of Nasrallah.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rj37lfejkg	2024-10-06T14:52:59-07:00

Iran's Quds Force chief out of contact since strikes on Beirut su...	Senior Iranian officials have confirmed that contact with Esmail Qaani, the general who replaced former Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, has disappeared since the IDF's Beirut attack targeting Nasrallah's successor; Senior official in Hezbollah said that the terrorist organization is also 'trying to check what the truth is' Iran's Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani, who travelled to Lebanon after the killing last month of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike, has not been heard from since strikes on Beirut late last week, two senior Iranian security officials told Reuters. One of the officials said Qaani was in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as Dahieh, during a strike that was reported to have targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine, but the official said he was not meeting Safieddine. A Hezbollah official said Israel was not allowing a search for Safieddine to progress after it bombed Beirut's southern suburbs on Thursday. The officials said the group would only announce Safieddine's fate when the search concluded. Safieddine is seen as a likely successor to Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike on Dahieh on September 27. The Iranian official said Iran and Hezbollah had not been able to contact Qaani, named by Tehran as the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas military-intelligence service, or Quds Force, after the United States assassinated his predecessor Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020. Israel has been hitting multiple targets in Dahieh as it pursues a campaign against Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. The second Iranian official also said Qaani had travelled to Lebanon after the killing of Nasrallah and the Iranian authorities had not been able to contact him since the strike against Safieddine, who was widely expected to be the next Hezbollah chief. Asked about reports that Qaani may have been killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut, Israeli military spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said the results of the strikes were still being assessed. He said that Israel had conducted an attack late last week against Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut. 'When we have more specific results from that strike, we will share it. There's a lot of questions about who was there and who was not,' he told a briefing with reporters. The Quds Force, the overseas arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, oversees dealings with militias allied with Tehran across the Middle East, such as Hezbollah. A senior Hezbollah official who was interviewed by an Iraqi media channel Sunday evening was asked about Qaani's disappearance, and replied: 'I have no information, we are also looking for the truth in this issue.' Iran International, an opposition channel to the Ayatollah regime that broadcasts in Persian from London, reported Sunday that Qaani's family members confirmed that they have no details about his condition or his whereabouts - and that they are worried about his fate. Earlier Sunday, the New York Times also reported on the disappearance of Qaani and it was claimed that the purpose of his trip to Beirut was to help Hezbollah officials recover from the wave of attacks in Lebanon. A member of the Revolutionary Guards stationed in Beirut said that the silence of the officials in Iran around Qaani has caused panic among the junior members of the Revolutionary Guards.

Terrorist shoots down IDF drone, civilian medic seen in battle: N...	On the eve of the anniversary of the Hamas massacre, the IDF has released exclusive footage from the heroic battles at Kibbutz Re’im and the Sderot police station The IDF Spokesperson's Unit on Sunday released new footage from the battles on October 7, marking the anniversary of the massacre and the outbreak of the war. In footage from Kibbutz Re'im, forces from the 888 Multidimensional Unit are seen fighting terrorists, alongside Border Police forces who joined the battle in the kibbutz. In the dramatic footage, a civilian is shown tending to a soldier during the fighting, while a terrorist can be seen shooting at an IDF drone. The video also captures soldiers taking cover behind houses, engaging with terrorists even as a grenade is thrown at them, and the Border Police forces linking up with IDF soldiers at the kibbutz. Additional footage released by the IDF shows a tank crew from the 401st Brigade of the 162nd Division engaged in the fierce 20-hour battle at the Sderot police station. On October 7, forces from the 162nd Division fought in several areas in southern Israel, including Sderot. One of the toughest battles occurred at the police station, where reservists from the 188th Brigade, engineers from the Southern Command, and officers from the 401st Brigade, led by then-Brigadier General Beni Aharon, fought as a tank team alongside other security forces in a grueling battle against terrorists who had taken over the station. The station was only fully liberated at 3 a.m. after intense exchanges of fire. Southern District Commander Amir Cohen had earlier ordered that the situation be resolved at all costs, even if it meant destroying the station. Around 10 p.m. on October 7, a bulldozer began demolishing part of the station. The following day, bulldozers finished destroying the remainder of the station. IDF Chief of Staff's letter for October 7: 'We will persist in this war – and we will win' On the eve of the war's anniversary, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi sent a letter to IDF soldiers and commanders, stating: 'We are fighting! For a year now, we have been in the midst of a complex, multi-front war, with many significant and extensive achievements. Many challenges still lie ahead. IDF soldiers are deployed and fighting with strength on all fronts without stopping. 'This is a long war, measured not only by capabilities but also by the willpower and perseverance over time. For our enemies – every month, every week, and every day is worse than the one before. Even after the campaign ends, we will need to maintain our achievements, and our enemies will know, beyond any doubt, there will be no revival for those who seek to destroy us. 'A year has passed since October 7th, the day we failed in our mission to protect the citizens of the State of Israel. We are now in the Ten Days of Repentance. October 7th is not only a day of remembrance, but also a call for deep introspection. A recognition of our failures and a commitment to learning from them, while assessing the challenges, both those we have faced and those that still await us. 'We began this year from a difficult and painful point, but we regained our composure, advanced forward to fight, and grew stronger – from this combat, a generation of warriors and commanders has emerged – with unparalleled combat experience and unwavering courage, leading the IDF in one of the most complex wars we have known. People are the key to fulfilling these difficult missions. Alongside us are the reservists, fighting with unparalleled dedication, over a long and challenging period. Each and every one of you is part of this campaign, of our just war. Today, I want to say to you – your commitment, courage, and steadfast spirit demonstrated over the past year are a source of deep pride for every citizen of Israel and for me as your commander. 'A year has passed, and we have defeated the military wing of Hamas, and we continue to fight against the organization’s terrorist capabilities; We have dealt a severe blow to Hezbollah, which has lost all of its senior leadership. We are not stopping – we fight, debrief, learn, and improve. We are taking an offensive, tactical, and proactive approach on all fronts, adapting our defensive strategies on all borders, and understanding that the IDF must be a greater army that takes good care of its people. We are destroying our enemies’ capabilities, and we will ensure that these capabilities are not rebuilt, so that October 7th is never repeated. 'Many challenges still lie ahead in achieving the war’s objectives – defeating the enemy, returning the hostages – an urgent mission of the highest moral value – and returning the civilians to their homes. Let us remember the words of the author of Ecclesiastes: 'Whatever it is in your power to do, do with all your might.' It is in our power, in your power, to take action and to succeed. Remember those who sacrificed their lives for the homeland – the fallen, their families, and the wounded, in both spirit and body, who face the consequences of their heroism every day – thanks to them, we are here. We will continue to walk with them and in their light. 'At the start of the new year, let us remember and remind ourselves and our enemies – this is a war for our right to be a free people in our land, as well as for our values, beliefs, and the righteousness of our path. We will persevere, and we will win. 'Continue with this strength, the eyes of the entire nation are upon us. 'I am with you at every step.'

This is where our daughters met hell': Parents of fallen IDF loo...	The ruined structures, burned fields and memorial established at the base's observation point piece together a puzzle of the horror soldiers went through in the Hamas attack; Fathers and mothers continue to question IDF for its failures a year later An abandoned empty room stands at the entrance to the lookout soldiers’ barracks at the Nahal Oz base. Until almost a year ago it was known as the 'old timers’ room,' where the longer serving lookout soldiers whose IDF release date was imminent lived. The last women to live there before the Hamas attack were the late Staff Sgt. Shahaf Nissani and the late Staff Sgt. Noa Price. The empty space between its walls serves as a reminder that, on the morning of October 7, it was from there that they left for hell. 'Shahaf’s discharge date was due a few days following that Shabbat, after which Noa would have been the most veteran serving soldier, i.e., the next in line for discharge,' says her mother, Sigal Price. 'She’d already started making preparations and had bought the girls goodbye presents.' 'Nahal Oz is home' reads the bold inscription at the entrance. 'In the beginning, we’d come here to feel closer to her' Price continues. 'We were mainly focused on the shelter where her life ended. It was a desperate attempt to feel closer to her and those awful moments of horrific agony she endured. But as time went by, I wanted to feel closer to the living side of her and the girls. 'I know how important this place was for her, how proud she was of her role but, most importantly, I know how special her friendships with the other girls were. It was her and their second home. It’s important that this place should continue to exist not because they died here, but rather because these special, talented young women lived here.' Fifty-two male and female soldiers, including 15 lookout soldiers, died at Nahal Oz on the morning of October 7 in one of the first and harshest battles fought that day. Seven lookout soldiers were kidnapped from the shelter after hours of being forced to watch their dead friends lie beside them. The late Cpl. Noa Marciano was murdered in Hamas captivity and Ori Megidish was rescued from Gaza by Israeli forces at the end of October. Five lookout soldiers, Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, and Naama Levy have been in captivity for nearly a year. 'What are we doing here?' asks Mira, the late Sgt. Aviv Hajaj’s mother, at the entrance to the mobile shelter. 'Almost a year has gone by, and we can’t take in what happened here. It’s just incomprehensible that this place, the safest for my daughter, became such a horrific place. Aviv served close to 10 months at the outpost and I was never afraid when she was here, and neither was she.' 'Her fear was for the soldiers. That feeling that if anything were to happen to a single solder, it would be on their conscience for the rest of their days. That’s what she said and that’s what the girls felt. That was their worst nightmare – that something would happen on their watch.' At 6:29 a.m., they ran in their pajamas from the barracks to the shelter – a few breachable concrete walls designed to protect them from rockets and mortars. With no guns, the female soldiers had no way of defending themselves. Through the gaps in the ceiling, they could see terrorists paragliding and landing in Israeli territory. For over an hour, they heard the fighting around them and the terrorists drawing closer, and then drawing further away. Some managed to send their families farewell messages. Seven were killed in this shelter safe room: Sgt. Shai Ashram, Sgt. Aviv Hajaj, Cpl. Hadar Miriam Cohan, Cpl. Noa Abramovitch, Cpl. Shirat-Yam Amar, Staff Sgt. Shahaf Nissani and Staff Sgt Noa Price. Also killed were Capt. Eden Nimri and Staff Sgt Sivan Asraf. No IDF investigation of the outpost battle has yet been published, but the parents have done it themselves. They spent months cross-referencing every morsel of information gathered from soldiers who survived, with video clips uploaded to social media and messages the girls were able to send. On their own, they put together the puzzle of Nahal Oz on October 7. 'They believed they'd be rescued' 'According the video clip we got from 6:45 a.m., Noa was standing with a group of girls,' says Sigal Price pointing at a shelter wall. 'Here were Daniella, Aviv, Shahaf and Shai sitting all together. They passed Shahaf’s phone from one to the next, and each contacted her parents. They started getting messages, apparently from the war room, that there had been an infiltration. Noa wrote that there was a lot of shooting and everyone was frightened. At around 7:30 a.m., she wrote to us that there were terrorists inside the outpost, and that it was very scary. She said there were two female soldiers with guns. She parted from us saying she didn’t know what would happen. I didn’t manage to contact her after that. She wasn’t answering.' Price points at one of the shelter entrances and says: 'This is where the first grenade was thrown from. A female soldier was standing here and she shot the terrorist who was trying to enter. They then threw another grenade, went in and shot the girls.' Mira Hajaj, Aviv’s mother, says: 'We got the last message from her at 7:38 a.m. She wrote: 'Mommy, it’ll be ok, please God. Recite Psalms.' Footage of the lookouts' abduction from Nahal Oz base — viewer discretion advised: Yigal Cohen, Hadar Miriam’s father points to another spot in the shelter. 'She sat here with Ori Megidish and they screamed together. When we went to visit Ori, she told us that Hadar’s last words, a minute before the hell started, were, 'May God protect our soldiers.' Until then, they could hear gunfire, screaming and shouting ‘Allahu Akbar.' But they were still optimistic about being rescued. 'They didn’t believe the terrorists would get in here. She was concerned for the male soldiers. These were her last words. Then the terrorists got in, threw in hand grenades that exploded right there. That’s what killed her. They then confirmed their kills.' A video of the kidnapping from Hamas terrorist’s bodycams filmed in the shelter was released last May. It’s hard to watch. The girls are wounded, cuffed and terrified. 'The girls were kidnapped from this wall,' says Cohen. 'They sat here for hours watching their friends drenched in blood. In the video, as they are led outside, you suddenly hear gunfire break the silence. That’s their confirmed kills. It’s the worst sound we could possibly hear.' Haggai, father of Yael Leibushor, who was killed in the war room says: 'The kidnapped girls were their friends and I’m sure that, if they were here, the most important thing for them now would be to do everything to get them back. So, we’re doing that bigtime. We want them here as quickly as possible.' Dror Ashram, Shai’s father says: 'If I’d have known what was going on here, I’d have been here in five minutes. I keep thinking about her last thoughts. I want to know what she thought. She sent a good friend of hers two messages: ‘You should know that I love you, and that you’re my best friend’ and ‘Take care of my father and mother.' That’s the end of the conversation.' Lookout soldiers’ families appealed to the Supreme Court last month against the IDF, demanding the voice communications and log of their daughter’s final shifts. 'Why am I demanding the recordings? To hear her voice,' says Ashram. 'I have SMS messages on the phone, but I don’t have her voice. I didn’t record my last conversation with her. I want to hear these things. For us, it’s more than just knowing what happened that day.' The soot and scents remain At the shelter entrance, the words, written in pink, 'Look how calmly she walks, as if Gaza isn’t next to her,' now seem like a kick in the stomach. This sentence, that appears in the videos from that morning, came about when the girls saw a woman by the kibbutz fence, a few hundred meters from the border. 'It became their slogan,' Cohen explains. 'It well describes the relationship between the girls and the kibbutzim. They saw everything – what was going on here, and what was going on in Gaza. Their aim was to allow the residents to have lives as normal and peaceful as possible as danger lurked across the fence. They saw the dangers. And yet there was life going on there, and life going on here,' according to Cohen. A few dozen meters from there is the war room building that was supposed to be the safest at the outpost – in which 15 soldiers were killed, including 15 lookout soldiers, Capt. Shir Eilat, Sgt. Leibushor, Sgt. Ronni Eshel, Sgt. Shirl Mor, Sgt. Shira Shohat, Staff Sgt. Yam Glass, Staff Sgt. Adi Landman and CPL Mia Vialovo Polo. Two operations officers, Staff Sgt. Shirel Haim Pour and Sgt. Osher Simha Barzilay were also murdered. Adi was in the shelter at about 6:40 a.m. and went across to the war room,' says her father, Barak Landman. 'She came in here in her pajamas. I wrote her that morning asking if everything was okay.' This is his first visit to the outpost since October 7. Adi was assigned to Nahal Oz the month preceding the massacre after completing commander training and Barak visited her there shortly after that. 'I haven’t been able to come back her since what happened. I didn’t have the strength,' he explains. 'I’ve seen the pictures and the videos, and had a general idea of what it looks like, but seeing the state of the burnt-out war room, all this blackness, the smell, just feeling it – it’s all so distressing.' He's right. You can’t go into the war room without feeling a sense of dread. There’s still a stench in the air, and the total darkness illustrates what the soldiers went through in their final moments. This room that, until that Shabbat, served as the State of Israel’s eyes on the North Gaza, with its smashed screens that were constantly watched by lookout soldiers, has been entirely destroyed. Smoke. Heat. Darkness. There was a six-hour battle between the terrorists who had broken in and the IDF soldiers on site before reinforcements showed up. Four of these soldiers fought to the last bullet from inside the war room. 'They tried breaking down this door to get in,' explains Eyal Eshel, the late Ronni’s father. 'The battle was conducted from here. It’s important to remember the names of the four soldiers who fought and fell here: Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba, Staff Sgt. Daniel Rashed, Lt. Yochai Duchan and Staff Sgt. Itai Ron. We can say which lookout soldier was positioned at which station. They could see everything through the cameras from the early hours of that morning. They reported and directed the forces. The war room operated here until the very last minutes.' At some stage, the terrorists set the war room on fire and the lookout soldiers hid in officer Shir Eilat’s office. 'They were here for a few hours, until everything filled up with smoke,' says Haggai Leibushor. 'At a certain stage, they decided they had to get out because of the heat and the smoke. The electricity went out and there was total darkness. They couldn’t see anything and simply felt around what was familiar to them.' He points at a narrow corridor leading to a tiny window. 'They tried getting out of here toward the bathrooms. Only seven made it. The others choked on the smoke and fell along the way,' he said. 'One of the very worst and most painful parts of this story is that here, behind, there’s a communications room that isn’t burnt-out, with all the servers and computers, but they didn’t have the key to this room,' according to Eshel. 'Just think what would have happened if they had been briefed as to how to get in there in case of emergency. Had that happened, I think we’d be in a very different place right now. One of the soldiers who was here told me that they could hear the girls crying and that their voices then went silent.' Every Saturday at 6:30 a.m. The lookout soldiers’ parents walking around the outpost now have answers to almost every question about what happened during those hours, as well as during the following 11 months. They can’t comprehend, however, how for so many hours no one came to rescue their daughters. 'I think they had faith until the very last moment that, just as they perform their duties, there would be a plan of action, and that they would be rescued any minute,' says Mira Hajaj. 'But no one came.' Sharon Eshel, Ronni’s mother says: 'Coming to the outpost is hell. That’s what they went through that day. That’s what they felt. We’re dealing with endless pain and sadness. Actual physical pain. It’s a longing you can’t deal with. It’s not natural for a parent to lose their child, and the cliché about time healing all wounds is wrong. As time goes by, it gets harder and hurts more. You can’t fight something like this. It will be with us for the rest of our lives. A part of hearts has been torn out.' The parents have set up a memorial to the soldiers a few minutes’ drive from the outpost at a lookout point from which you can see the sector they watched. 'Where we’re now sitting, there were terrorists. Right here,' says Shirat-Yam’s father, Moshe Amar. 'They took our flowers from us.' Shirat-Yam arrived at Nahal Oz two days before October 7. 'Everything we know about the warnings the girls gave, about how they were ignored, we only heard afterward from the parents of girls who’d been there longer. She hadn’t even gotten into her role. If I’d have known one-tenth of what I know today, she wouldn’t have been here at all. I’d have come here physically and taken her away.' Dror Ashram says: 'We, all the families together, set up the memorial. Neither the state nor the army helped us with anything. We chose this spot because of the lookout. This is the right place.' Shahaf Nissani’s mother and sister, Ilana and Sapir, decided not to go to the outpost itself, but rather to meet the others at the memorial. They had visited the outpost on October 6, bringing the girls food for Shahaf’s discharge party that night. 'I haven’t been at the outpost, and I’ll never go in there' says Ilana. 'I want to remember the place and the girls as they were on October 6 – a sunny day with a blue sky and white clouds, and the girls laughing, happy and as alive as can be. I don’t want to remember the place as it is today, like an extermination camp. We’re a year on and it’s still very hard for me. It’s hardest on Shabbat mornings 6:30 a.m.–8:00 a.m. It doesn’t get any easier. Every little thing reminds me of her. I miss her so much it drives me crazy.' 'Dad, get ready. There’s going to be a war’ It's been a year since the October 7 attack and no commission of inquiry has yet been set up to investigate the circumstances, events and failures that led to the disaster. In recent months, the families of the lookout murdered soldiers murdered at Nahal Oz have been fighting for a state commission of inquiry. 'The lookout soldiers knew. Their commanders knew. Everyone knew and warned,' says Noa Marciano’s father, Avi. 'They saw them training, saw a sign reading ‘We’re on our way to you, Nahal Oz.' During Sukkot, over dinner, Noa said to me, ‘Dad, get ready. After the holidays, there’s going to be a war.' And that’s what happened. On the last day of the holidays, the war began.' 'With the few exceptions of those who’ve resigned, the leaders, both military and political, of October 6 are those leading us today. The more time elapses, the more details fall away, evidence disappears, people forget things. As time passes, the harder it is to investigate the truth. There’s a sense that there’s a hot potato going around here. 'Everyone’s passing the buck onto someone else and, in the end, it all dissolves and no one takes responsibility for what happened there. The fact that a state commission of inquiry hasn’t been set up yet burns every day anew. I spend a lot of time at the cemetery. And I talk to Noa each time. I first tell her that I’m sorry. I’m sorry that those who brought about your death, still haven’t started being brought to justice.'

IDF troops operating in Jabaliya area of Gaza	IDF troops on Sunday continued operational activity in the Jabaliya area, eliminating dozens of terrorists, the IDF said. Prior to and during the operational activity, dozens of targets were struck by the Israeli Air Force, including Nukhba terrorists, numerous underground terrorist infrastructure sites and more. Over the past day, the troops located numerous weapons in the area, including grenades, munitions, and explosive devices, and engaged in several close-quarter encounters with terrorists. During one of the incidents, the troops encountered two terrorists in a structure, and after exchanges of fire, both terrorists were eliminated by tank fire. Additionally, earlier on Sunday, the IAF struck the site from which rockets were fired toward the area of Ashkelon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqudpg1kl	2024-10-06T12:45:19-07:00

Defense Minister will hold one-day visit in Washington, where he will meet with senior officials in the Pentagon and advisers to the president at the White House Against the backdrop of preparations for an attack on Iran and amid ongoing tensions in the Middle East, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant will go on a one-day visit to the U.S. Gallant will meet with senior officials in the Pentagon and with advisers to the president at the White House . The stated goal is to strengthen cooperation on the 'issues at hand' and to continue the dialogue with the U.S. and its security forces. Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder announced on the X network that Gallant will make an official visit on Wednesday 'to discuss ongoing Middle East security developments' and said that U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin 'looks forward to welcoming the Minister back to Washington DC.' The visit will take place amid severe tensions in the region in anticipation of an Israeli attack against Iran. The IDF promised 'significant action' in response to the extensive ballistic missile attack launched by the Islamic Republic last week. According to reports, Israel has already threatened to 'directly' hit oil or nuclear facilities in Iran if attacked, but the U.S. is exerting pressure to moderate the response - and so far is is not clear how it will look. Meanwhile, the Iranian news agency Mehr reported citing an official in the country that 'all flights have been canceled at Iran's airports from until Monday at 6:00 a.m.' Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkttc8gjye	2024-10-06T12:11:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/25/Syz9TbddLA/Syz9TbddLA_0_132_1280_720_0_small.jpg

Prominent Israel haters among 2024 Nobel Peace Prize contenders	As the Nobel Prize announcements begin, attention in Jerusalem is drawn to Friday's Peace Prize announcement, which could stir controversy; Top contenders, including UNRWA, the ICC, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres, have sparked tension with Israel For ardent enthusiasts of Nobel Prize announcements, this week is a thrilling time, particularly with the buzz surrounding Friday's revelation in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate. This announcement holds special significance, coinciding with the anniversary of October 7. This year, speculation swirls around several high-profile nominees, some of which will most definitively raise some Israeli eyebrows. Among these are the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which Israel criticizes and accuses of complicity in the October 7 violence; the International Criminal Court, which is pursuing cases against Israel; and UN Secretary-General António Guterres, recently declared unwelcome by Israel for not strongly condemning Iran's attack and for saying that October 7 'did not happen in a vacuum.' The Nobel Peace Prize committee, known for its unpredictability, might surprise us yet again this year. Historically, the prize has been withheld 19 times, the last time in 1972. Dan Smith, a peace researcher from Stockholm, suggests that perhaps this year the committee might opt not to award the prize to anyone, highlighting the global climate of conflict. With 286 candidates vying for recognition, this year's roster includes prominent figures including Pope Francis and David Attenborough. Speculation also surrounds figures like the late Alexei Navalny and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, though geopolitical complexities make their wins unlikely. Julian Assange, Elon Musk, and former U.S. President Donald Trump are also reportedly in the mix, with the latter recognized for his role in the Abraham Accords. Experts suggest that, given the tumultuous events of 2024 – from the Middle East's ongoing conflicts to the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the humanitarian crisis in Sudan – the prize might go to humanitarian activists aiding those in war-torn regions. UNRWA emerges as a potential candidate for its efforts to assist Palestinians amid the Gaza conflict, although such a choice could be contentious due to allegations of involvement in violence. Meanwhile, the committee might also focus on reinforcing the post-WWII global order, hinting at potential recognition for Guterres or the International Criminal Court. Other nominees reportedly include organizations like EcoPeace and Women Wage Peace, lauded for promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Palestinian and Israeli groups documenting human rights issues also feature among the contenders. Despite the possibility of no award being given, as noted by Dan Smith due to rising military investments worldwide, others argue that the prize remains crucial for advocating peace. Nobel announcements begin on Monday with the prize for medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, and literature throughout the week, culminating with the prize for economics next Monday. The Peace Prize, unique in its Oslo announcement, remains the highlight for many Nobel enthusiasts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjcqpexkyg	2024-10-06T11:16:35-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2022/06/09/HkZm4NkYc/HkZm4NkYc_0_155_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

At the same time, UNIFIL made a decision to leave its forces in its positions along the 'blue line' near the Lebanese border despite the IDF's requests to clear the area, according to the organization's spokesman, who said that consultations were held with countries that sent forces to the area and the step was decided, despite the requests.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj800rhejjl	2024-10-06T10:54:56-07:00

Arms shipments will not bring you security, France's Macron tells...	A day after France 's president called for a halt to arms deliveries to Israel the prime minister and Macron speak on the telephone; Elysee Palace reports Macron demanded an immediate cease-fire and expressed opposition to the 'expansion of the war to Lebanon', Netanyahu's office: 'Israel's friends expected to support it, and not impose restrictions that will only strengthen the Iranian axis of evil' A day after French President Emmanuel Macron called for a halt to arms deliveries to Israel on weapons being used in the war in the Gaza Strip , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with him on the phone on Sunday. The Prime Minister's Office reported that Netanyahu 'reiterated Israel's position that given Iran's support for all parts of its axis of terrorism, Israel expects its friends to stand behind it and not impose restrictions that will only strengthen the Iranian axis of evil.' It was also reported that 'Israel's actions against Hezbollah are creating an opportunity to change the reality in Lebanon in favor of stability, security and peace in the entire region.' The two leaders agreed to advance dialogue on the issue during the visit of the French Foreign Minister, who is scheduled to come to Israel, according to the PMO statement. Later, the Elysee Palace also published a statement about the telephone conversation between the two leaders, and it was described by Paris as an 'honest' conversation. Macron, it was reported, told Netanyahu that 'arms shipments, extending the war in Gaza and extending it to Lebanon' will not provide Israel with the security it desires. Macro also told Netanyahu that it was necessary to reach a cease-fire immediately. 'We must immediately take decisive action that will allow us to advance the political solutions that are necessary for the security of Israel and everyone in the Middle East,' Macron reportedly said. The conversation between Netanyahu and Macron comes after the public exchange between the two men Saturday night . Netanyahu, who was enraged at Macron's call for an arms embargo, published a videotaped statement in which he said his 'shame will continue long after the war is won.' In the video, Netanyahu said in comments directed at Macron that Israel is fighting on seven fronts against the enemies of civilization, and 'yet President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them. Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together. But countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace! Israel will win with or without their support.' An official at the Elysee Palace responded Saturday night to Netanyahu's words and said: 'Macron is committed to Israel's security and demonstrates it. France mobilized its military resources in the face of the Iranian attack on October 1, as it had already done in April. The French president personally told the Iranian president about his attachment to Israel's security. He reiterated that France will not allow Iran or any of its representatives to attack Israel.' According to him, Macron 'believes that an immediate cease-fire is necessary in Gaza as in Lebanon, in order to curb the increase in violence, release the hostages, protect the populations and find political solutions necessary for the security of Israel and everyone in the Middle East. In this context, the president calls for an end to the export of weapons intended for use in Gaza. We must return to diplomatic solutions. France is an unwavering friend of Israel. Netanyahu's words are exaggerated and not related to friendship between France and Israel.' Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot is on a four-day trip to the Middle East. Paris is seeking to play a role in reviving diplomatic efforts as the Gaza war has widened to Lebanon. Government officials were not surprised by Macron's words, which are a direct continuation of the French line, which already supported the non-binding resolution initiated by the Palestinians at the UN General Assembly on September 18, which called for the imposition of an arms embargo on Israel. France has not supplied weapons or military systems to Israel since the beginning of the war, and the weapons it provided in the past were also marginal and insignificant to the Israeli fighting effort. In the last decade, France annually exported military equipment to Israel amounting to 20 million euros. This is a drop in the ocean, considering the fact that France is in second place in the world in defense exports after the U.S. and its defense exports were estimated at 27 billion euros in 2022. Most of the things sold before the war were electronic components such as infrared sights and thermal sensors. About 700 defense licenses were granted for export to Israel per year.

Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Washington will continue to pressure Israel and other players in the Middle East to reach a cease-fire deal in Gaza even as advocates say that the United States has not thus far used its leverage over its ally. In an interview with CBS news show '60 Minutes,' Harris said that diplomatic work with Israel is 'an ongoing pursuit,' according to a clip released on Sunday. Harris sidestepped a question in the interview on whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a 'real close ally.' 'I think with all due respect the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people and the answer to that question is yes,' Harris said. Harris reiterated Washington's position to support Israel's right to self defense against Iran and Iran-backed terror groups like Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skzacexk1x	2024-10-06T09:30:50-07:00	
UNICEF chief warns Gaza kids face 'post-generational challenges'	After a year of military operations between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, the head of UNICEF warned that children there will face 'post-generational challenges' due to the conflict. 'If you look at Gaza really through the eyes of a child, it is a hellscape,' UNICEF's executive director Catherine Russell told CBS News' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, noting the toll of family deaths and displacements, as well as ongoing lack of food and clean water. 'They are so traumatized by what's happening,' Russell said of the kids. 'Even if we can get more supplies in there, the trauma that these children are suffering is going to have lifetime and even post-generational challenges for them.' Russell said it remains 'very dangerous' to move humanitarian aid in Gaza. However, she credited her organization with a 'success story' of vaccinating thousands of children for polio in the area. On the latest Israeli military operations in Lebanon targeting Iran-backed group Hezbollah, the UNICEF director said 'the speed and intensity is shocking' and that 'it makes it challenging for us' to reach the approximately 1 million displaced people there.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/synzc4gy1x	2024-10-06T09:28:26-07:00	
Iran: We have a counter-response ready if Israel attacks	In response to potential Israeli action, Tehran has prepared its defensive strategy, promising a swift counterattack while Israel considers direct strikes on Iranian facilities as Biden administration pleads for moderation In response to potential Israeli military actions within Iran's borders, Tehran has reportedly finalized a counter-response strategy, as revealed by Iranian media on Sunday, citing a military source. The source informed the Tasnim News Agency that 'the necessary response plan for any possible Zionist action is fully prepared. If Israel acts, the Iranian counterattack will be executed.' The Israel Defense Forces have vowed a 'significant response' to the extensive ballistic missile attack launched by the Islamic Republic last week. Reports suggest Israel has threatened to directly target Iranian oil or nuclear facilities if provoked, although the United States is applying pressure to temper the response, leaving the specifics of the Israeli action unclear. The military source speaking to the Iranian news agency claimed that'Tehran has a list of numerous Israeli targets,' and highlighted that 'the operation demonstrates our capability to destroy any point we choose.' Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday visited the Nevatim Air Force Base, which sustained damage during the attack. His office reported that he received a briefing from the base commander, Brigadier General Yotam Sigler, regarding squadron operations in combat zones, and emphasized the need to bolster preparedness for potential offensive operations in additional theaters. 'The actions of the Air Force, both in defense and offense, are vital to the safety of Israeli citizens,' Gallant stated in discussions with pilots, air crews and ground teams. 'The Iranians have not even scratched the capabilities of the Air Force; no squadron has been harmed, no aircraft damaged, no runway rendered unusable, and there is no disruption to our operational continuity. Anyone believing that attempting to harm Israel will deter us from responding should observe developments in Gaza and Beirut.' Gallant subtly referenced an Israeli response to the missile attack, stating: 'We are strong in both defense and offense, and we will manifest this strength in the manner we choose, at the time we choose, and in the place we choose. This is not merely a statement or a direction for us, but an actionable plan. You know what to do, we know what to do and, ultimately, we will ensure victory in this conflict, secure the return of hostages, and bring Northern residents back to their homes with significant deterrence in place, as clearly demonstrated over the past month.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy00u6ge1jx	2024-10-06T09:21:46-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/06/S1kGmyeJyg/S1kGmyeJyg_1_87_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Tamar's son fell in Lebanon; her husband was killed in a terror a...	Thousands paid their final respects to Captain Harel Ettinger of Eli, who fell while fighting in the Egoz unit; 'Your dedication and unwavering sense of purpose were the magic you shared with Dad, I'm sure you're catching up now,' his sister said in her eulogy Thousands, including friends and family, gathered Sunday at the Eli cemetery for the funeral of Captain Harel Ettinger, a commander in the Egoz unit of the IDF Commando Brigade, who fell on the eve of Rosh Hashana during a heroic battle fought by his unit in southern Lebanon. His sister, Efrat, said in her eulogy: 'How can you condense a life into a single page? How can you write anything about you? My soul is bound to yours. To me, you are coming back in a week or two. I’m waiting for you. Every time you called from some remote outpost with your soldiers and said, 'Send me recipes,' and you’d share a picture of some matbucha you’d made, I was amazed. When we were kids, you listened to songs about this land and the heroes who fought for it. We teased you, but it was in your heart. Whenever I wanted to set you up on a date with someone, you would say: 'I’m married to the army.'' Captain Ettinger's father, Rabbi Achiad Ettinger was killed in a terrorist attack at the Ariel junction in the West Bank in March 2019. The rabbi fired at the terrorist after stopping his car and getting out, saving many civilians at the junction. 'Your dedication and determination were the source of both your and Dad's strength,' Efrat said. 'What pride you must have up there – Dad must be beaming with joy, and now you’re catching up. You’re telling him all about our family and how we grew up.' 'Harel, my beloved child, pure, humble and brave. God chose both your father and you, and He chose us, too, because He knows we have the strength, Harel’s mother, Tamar said. 'He gave, gives and will continue to give us strength, joy and life. I am returning to You the pure soul You entrusted to Achiad and me 23 years ago. I’m returning the child You placed in my hands,' she said. 'I did my best to raise him with love and joy as much as I knew how, but I ask You, Master of the Universe, for redemption, mercy and kindness – that we may see Your compassion.' Lieutenant Colonel A., commander of the Egoz unit, addressed the Ettinger family: 'We stand here today, stunned, struggling to come to terms with this tremendous loss. Harel fought a heroic battle in southern Lebanon, protecting his homeland, his soldiers, and his comrades with his own body. Harel, you’ve joined your father, who also rushed to confront terrorists five and a half years ago, not far from here.' Regarding the heroic battle, Lt. Col. A. recounted: 'When you heard there was fighting on the radio, you charged toward the conflict, leading your men. When you realized your comrades were in danger, you came to me and said, ‘I’m going to outflank them, take out the terrorists, and save my friends.’ You didn’t hesitate for a moment. You fought like a hero, risking your life out of true camaraderie and commitment to defending the homeland. In that flanking maneuver, you broke the terrorists’ position and prevented further casualties and losses. We will carry on your legacy, which will continue to inspire us all.' Ido, one of Captain Ettinger’s team members, also paid tribute: 'My dear brother, from the moment we first met, I knew I was standing before someone special. For the first time in my life, I understood how it’s possible to be the best and still be humble and modest.

A year into war, the shocking civilian toll since October 7 revea...	On eve of Hamas massacre's first anniversary, National Insurance Institute data shows 885 civilians, including 53 minors and 72 foreign nationals, killed, 70,000 wounded and 1,000 orphaned; of 101 hostages in Gaza, 73 are civilians, 52 believed to be alive One year after the October 7 massacre and the onset of war, Israel’s National Insurance Institute reported Sunday that 885 civilians were killed in terror attacks over the past year. These figures exclude security forces, who are handled by the Defense Ministry. Of the 885 victims, 581 were men, 304 were women, 72 were foreign nationals and 53 were under the age of 18. The report revealed that during the war year, four infants and toddlers aged 0-3 were killed, as well as two children aged 3-5, three children aged 5-8, nine children aged 8-12, eight adolescents aged 12-14 and 27 teenagers aged 14-18. The war left 921 people orphaned, including 291 minors, and 226 individuals widowed, with 47 men and 179 women losing their spouses. Additionally, 1,078 parents became bereaved, including 581 mothers and 498 fathers. Among them, 120 have lost all their children. A total of 1,880 civilians lost siblings, including 998 men and 882 women. Twelve families experienced multiple losses (not including families that have been wiped out completely). Following the October 7 massacre, 217 civilians were kidnapped to Gaza (not including security forces), with 143 civilians returned so far. Among them, 116 were released alive (92 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals), while 27 were returned as deceased. Currently, 74 civilians remain held hostage, including 52 believed to be alive and 22 presumed dead. In total, 101 hostages are in Gaza, including those from the security forces, as well as Russian Israeli researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov who has been held in Iraq by pro-Iranian militias since March 2023. The National Insurance Institute also reported that over 70,000 civilians have been treated as victims of terrorism since the war began. Of the total victims this year, 647 were foreign nationals affected by the October 7 attack in southern Israel. More than 12,700 have applied for permanent disability benefits, with 11,760 cases based on psychological trauma. Over the past year, the institute paid more than NIS 2.4 billion ($630 million) in compensation and support for bereaved families and terror victims. The government has also distributed financial aid to residents in northern and southern Israel affected by the conflict, totaling NIS 3.5 billion ($920 million). 'We mourn the lives cruelly taken by a merciless enemy, and we will continue to support the victims of terror. We will not rest until all hostages are returned home,' Labor Minister Yoav Ben-Tzur said on the tragic passing year. 'Our staff works tirelessly to assist bereaved families, terror victims, hostages and the displaced, while continuing our regular services such as nursing care, unemployment benefits and elderly pensions. We see this work as a public mission of the highest order,' said National Insurance Institute Acting Director Zvika Cohen.

Biden's statement Israel shouldn't bomb Iran's oil and nuclear f...	Speaking to Ynet, Mike Evans, one of the world's prominent Evangelical leaders and Trump advisor, pans US president for lack of 'moral clarity' as 'Israel is facing an existential threat' Mike Evans, one of the world's prominent Evangelical leaders and a staunch supporter of Israel, said in a recent interview with Ynet that 'Israel is facing an existential threat. President Biden's statement to Israel that it shouldn't bomb Iran's oil and nuclear facilities is disgraceful.' His remarks came ahead of a solidarity event marking one year since the October 7 attack, which will take place on Sunday at the Friends of Zion Museum in Jerusalem and will be broadcast to millions of viewers on social media. Evangelical leaders, representing a quarter of a billion Evangelicals worldwide, including 70 million in the U.S., will participate in the event in Jerusalem. 'This is the largest solidarity event in the history of the State of Israel,' Evans said. Among the participants will be leaders from the two largest Evangelical denominations: the Southern Baptist Convention and the Assemblies of God. Evans, considered to be an advisor to former U.S. president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Evangelical matters, said, 'Evangelicals stand behind the State of Israel. Never in Israel's history has there been a time when a quarter of a billion Evangelicals are united behind it.' 'Evangelicals believe in the Ten Commandments, not the Ten Suggestions. In other words, they believe in moral clarity and in good versus evil—they believe Israel represents good and Iran represents evil. It's a battle between light and darkness,' he stressed. Evans also addressed U.S. President Joe Biden’s words, saying, 'It's truly disgraceful. It's like George Bush sending a message to Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks that America shouldn't attack him in certain areas. It's completely wrong.' 'Friends of Zion around the world are committed to fighting these battles alongside Israel. The vast majority of Zionists in the world aren't Jewish, yet they stand united, unconditionally, with the Jewish people in Israel,' Evans added. On Friday, Biden addressed Israel's expected response to the Iranian missile attack saying, 'If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.' Trump later said he believed Israel should strike Iran's nuclear facilities. 'I think he's [Biden] got that wrong, isn't that the one you're supposed to hit? It's the biggest risk we have, nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons. When they asked him that question the answer should have been, 'Hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.''

UN chief in letter to Netanyahu: UNRWA is in danger	Antonio Guterres in urgent appeal to prime minister asks to repel proposed bill that would remove immunity and benefits organization receives in Israel UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sent an urgent letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during Rosh Hashana expressing his deep concern about legislation in the Knesset targeting UNRWA. He warned that if the legislation passes, UNRWA will be unable to continue operating and would then need to raise the issue at the UN General Assembly. The bill, which severs Israel's ties with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), is expected to be approved on Sunday by the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. According to the proposed law, all government representatives would be prohibited from engaging with UNRWA. This means that the foreign and interior ministries would not be able to issue entry visas for UNRWA staff and customs officials won’t process goods imported by the agency. Tax benefits granted to the organization would be revoked. The Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee is now discussing the proposed law and representatives from the National Security Council (NSC) have requested that the details be classified. Some Knesset members, however, oppose the proposed bill. The bill stipulates that ties with UNRWA will officially cease starting on Monday, and the agency will lose its diplomatic status and immunity, which it has enjoyed since 1967. Another clause in the bill specifies that UNRWA employees involved in Hamas’ October 7 attack won’t enjoy diplomatic immunity under Israeli law, meaning they could be prosecuted for their crimes. In his letter to Netanyahu, Guterres wrote, 'It’s deeply concerning that legislation is being considered in a member state of the United Nations that would fundamentally contradict the principles of the UN Charter.' 'The draft legislation currently under discussion in the Knesset, if passed, could prevent UNRWA from continuing its operations in the occupied Palestinian territories, thereby denying Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank the essential aid and protection that UNRWA has provided them since 1949,' he said. 'UNRWA operates in nearly 400 schools and more than 65 health clinics in the occupied Palestinian territories, providing education to more than 350,000 children and over 5 million medical consultations annually. UNRWA also provides vital assistance to the poor and social services,' Guterres wrote. 'Amid the current crisis in Gaza, UNRWA is the backbone of the UN’s humanitarian organization, offering lifesaving aid, shelter and support to the vast majority of Gaza’s nearly 2.3 million residents, all of whom are affected by the conflict.' 'Given the gravity of the matter, I will need to bring it to the attention of the General Assembly if the draft legislation is adopted,' Guterres explained. 'This would be a deeply concerning development in the UN's history, where a member state passes legislation requiring no contact between its authorities and a United Nations entity, in this case, UNRWA. It’s impossible to separate UNRWA from the UN. It is an integral part of it.' In his letter, Guterres emphasized that UNRWA's privileges and immunities would continue to apply to its staff, regardless of the legislation passed by the Knesset. 'I hope it will be possible for your government to take the necessary steps to avoid the adoption of this legislation,' he concluded. In response to the letter, Israel's Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said, 'The State of Israel has provided the UN with information on over 100 UNRWA employees who participated in the October 7 massacre. The UN’s own internal investigation determined that some UNRWA employees are Hamas terrorists.' 'UNRWA has failed both professionally — in building educational and economic infrastructure — and morally, by allowing free access for Hamas terrorists to use its resources to carry out a barbaric and brutal massacre. The UN would do better to focus its efforts on severing UNRWA’s ties with Hamas, rather than worrying about visas and tax benefits for terrorists. UNRWA has become a part of Hamas and it’s time the UN recognizes that,' he added.

Under massive fire: IDF’s tactical play in Jabaliya	Numerous terrorists eliminated in surprise overnight northern Gaza operation, as forces reinforced in anticipation of potential attacks on troops in Gaza or rocket fire, possibly reaching central Israel, on October 7 anniversary The IDF launched an intense overnight raid on Jabaliya in northern Gaza, striking from two directions and inflicting heavy casualties on terrorist, the IDF reported on Sunday. The operation, led by the 162nd Division, began late Saturday after troops redeployed from the Philadelphi Corridor on the Egyptian border to northern Gaza, with the military indicating it would last for several days. 'The operation will continue as long as necessary to systematically destroy terrorist infrastructure,' the IDF said, adding that it has drawn and implemented lessons learned from the execution of six hostages in Rafah by Hamas terrorists after Israeli forces approached their location. In Rafah, where the 162nd Division handed control to Gaza Division forces, operations to locate and destroy terror tunnels continue. Meanwhile, the Netzarim Corridor has been expanded toward Wadi Gaza to the south and the southern neighborhoods of Gaza City to the north. 'We are in a strong position to act against Hezbollah with forces we have shifted from the south while simultaneously striking in Gaza,' the IDF said. 'Decisions will need to be made regarding an alternative to Hamas governance, as Hamas' civilian authority is weakened and its control capabilities are elsewhere.' Ahead of the anniversary of the October 7 attack, Southern Command has bolstered its forces to reinforce security amid concerns of possible terror attacks. The military warned of potential rocket fire or assaults from Gaza-based terrorist groups. 'Our forces are operating in the north, south and center of Gaza, conducting numerous strikes and eliminating terrorists,' Southern Command head Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman said. 'Southern Command is on high alert for the coming days.' Palestinian media reported widespread strikes in the Jabaliya area, while the IDF announced a targeted airstrike on a Hamas complex in the city. According to the military, air force jets struck Hamas terrorists operating from a command and control center previously used as a UNRWA facility. 'The command center was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute attacks against IDF forces and Israel,' the IDF said, noting that precautions were taken to minimize civilian harm, including the use of precision munitions and aerial surveillance. The IDF confirmed that the 162nd Division's troops encircled Jabaliya and are actively engaging in operations to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. Prior to and during the raid, the Air Force conducted multiple strikes on military targets, including weapons depots, underground facilities and terrorist cells. Meanwhile, Hamas' Interior Ministry urged residents of northern Gaza to stay in their homes, defying Israeli warnings to evacuate to the south.

Trojan horse inside Hezbollah: New details on Lebanon pager attac...	New report sheds light on explosions of thousands of communications devices held by Hezbollah which detonated in an operation attributed to Israel's Mossad The Washington Post published a report Sunday overnight providing more details into the pager attack in Lebanon against Hezbollah which is attributed to Israel. 'Also invisible was Mossad’s remote access to the devices. An electronic signal from the intelligence service could trigger the explosion of thousands of the devices at once,' the report read. The new details of the operation attributed to the Mossad were gathered from interviews conducted by the outlet with Israeli, American and Arab security officials, politicians and diplomats briefed on the events and official Lebanese sources and individuals close to Hezbollah. According to one source, Hezbollah’s terrorists needed to press two buttons simultaneously to read the encrypted message. 'In practice,' the source noted, 'this meant using both hands.' He added that in the explosion triggered by reading the message, the pager holders would almost certainly 'wound both their hands,' and thus 'would be incapable to fight.' The sources described a years-long plan conceived at Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, ultimately involving a team of agents and operational partners from various countries, many of whom were unaware of the larger mission. According to the outlet, the operation sparked a debate between Israel's security officials. A political source summarized the anxiety over the operation with a sarcastic remark during a meeting with Mossad officials: 'We cannot make a strategic decision such as an escalation in Lebanon while counting on a toy,' referring to the pagers. Reportedly, Israeli decision-makers weren’t aware of the plan until September 12, five days before it was carried out. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then convened a meeting with intelligence officials, who revealed the preparations. Other attendees were concerned about approving the Mossad’s plan, fearing it could lead to full-scale war. Some noted that 'there were some risks,' but intelligence officers warned that Hezbollah, in light of the rising tensions, might take additional precautions and discover the explosives. The Mossad saw the chance to carry out 'something more intense,' according to The Washington Post. The devices were designed by the Mossad and assembled in Israel. The Israeli agency had worked to infiltrate Hezbollah using electronic surveillance and human informants for years, the Washington Post reported. Over time, Hezbollah leaders became concerned about their vulnerability to Israeli surveillance and cyberattacks, fearing even ordinary phones could be used for eavesdropping and monitoring under Israeli control. As a result, the idea emerged in Israel to create a type of communication device that would serve as a 'Trojan horse,' a political source told the outlet. Hezbollah sought a cyberattack-resistant electronic network, and the Mossad devised two plans that would lead the terror organization to acquire communication devices that seemed perfect for the job — equipment designed by the intelligence agency and assembled in Israel. As part of the operation’s first phase, the booby-trapped communication devices began arriving in Lebanon via the Mossad nearly a decade ago, in 2015. These portable two-way radios contained relatively large battery packs, hidden explosives and a transmission system that gave Israel full access to Hezbollah's communications. Sources interviewed by the newspaper said Israel was content with eavesdropping on Hezbollah for nine years, while maintaining the ability to turn the radios into bombs in a future crisis. But then a new opportunity arose with a new product: a small pager equipped with powerful explosives. Since the terror organization’s leaders were cautious about the possibility of sabotage in the radios they purchased, the pagers couldn't be manufactured in Israel, the U.S., or any of Jerusalem's allies. In 2023, Hezbollah began receiving offers to purchase large quantities of communication devices from Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company known for its trademark and global product line which had no ties to Israeli or Jewish interests. According to the sources, the Taiwanese company was unaware of the plan. The offer came through a sales representative with ties to Gold Apollo, who was trusted by Hezbollah. This sales representative, whose identity and country of origin officials refused to disclose, was a former sales representative for the Taiwanese company in the Middle East. She later started her own company and received a license to sell pagers under the Apollo brand. At some point in 2023, she offered Hezbollah a deal on one of her company’s products, the reliable AR-924 device. 'She was the one in touch with Hezbollah, and explained to them why the bigger pager with the larger battery was better than the original model,' an Israeli official briefed on the operation's details told the outlet. According to him, one of the key selling points of the AR-924 was that it was 'possible to charge with a cable. And the batteries were longer lasting.'

Green, 33, a homeless man, named among victims killed by gunmen who opened fire on passengers aboard light rail and then targeted pedestrians Victor Shimshon Green, 33, was identified on Sunday as the seventh victim of last week’s terrorist attack in Tel Aviv’s Jaffa neighborhood. Green was homeless and stayed at the Gagon shelter in Jaffa. No photo of him has been released. Two Hamas gunmen opened fire on a light rail train last Tuesday and then targeted a group of pedestrians.

My ray of light in the darkness': Freed hostage says expecting a...	Doron Katz Asher shares joyful news on Instagram, calling it her 'triumph'; former Hamas captive, freed after 48 days with her daughters, previously joked that since her return, her partner has agreed to everything, including having more children Doron Katz Asher, who was taken hostage by Hamas with her daughters during the October 7 massacre and later released as part of a hostage-prisoner exchange in November, announced she is expecting a baby, calling it her 'true triumph' in a heartfelt Instagram post. Katz Asher, who was released after 48 days in captivity, shared the emotional news, writing, 'Bringing new life, a year after nearly losing my own, is the greatest gift for the new year. It’s my ray of light in the darkness.' The 34-year-old accountant from central Israel was visiting her mother at Kibbutz Nir Oz with her daughters, Raz, 5, and Aviv, 3, when the attack began. Her mother was killed, likely by friendly fire, while her brother was murdered by terrorists, and his body was taken to Gaza. Her mother's partner, Gadi Moses, was also taken hostage and remains in Hamas captivity. Reflecting on her return, Katz Asher previously shared in a social media post, 'What is it like to come back from captivity with two little girls, you ask? It means Yoni [her partner] agrees to everything I ask,' she joked, adding that he had agreed to have more children, 'as many as I want.'

Military reports two divisions redeployed to Gazan city following intelligence indicating terror group attempting to rearm there; heavy airstrikes reported as part of renewed assault The IDF announced Sunday that Israeli forces stationed at the Philadelphi Corridor in the southern Gaza Strip have redeployed to Jabaliya, following intelligence that Hamas terrorists are attempting to rearm and reorganize in the Palestinian enclave's north. 'Following prior IDF intelligence, an ongoing situational assessment, and IDF activity in the field that all indicated the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip, as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area, the 162nd Division began operating in the Jabaliya area Sunday overnight,' the military said in a statement. 'The troops of the 401st Brigade and the 460th Brigade have successfully encircled the area and are currently continuing to operate in the area,' it added. The military added that during the operation 'the IAF struck dozens of military targets in order to assist IDF ground troops. Among the targets struck were weapons storage facilities, underground infrastructure sites, terrorist cells, and additional military infrastructure sites. 'This operation to systematically dismantle terrorist infrastructure in the area will continue as long as required in order to achieve its objectives.'

France says Netanyahu overreacts to Marcon on arms embargo	Netanyahu calls Macron's call for a halt to arms sales a disgrace and says countries that should stand by Israel and do not should be ashamed as Israel is protecting them as well Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's response to a French arms embargo on Israel is excessive, the Elysee Palace said late on Saturday. Netanyahu called the call to halt arms sales a 'disgrace,' after French President Emmanuel Macron advocated for the move. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,' Macron told broadcaster France Inter. In a message to Macron, Netanyahu said all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel in its fight against Iran and its proxies. 'Shame on you,' he said. Netanyahu said with or without the help of these countries, Israel will win the battle against terrorists, for its sake and the sake of the world. A French official said Macron was committed to Israel's security and has shown that. He said France used its military assets to thwart Iran's attack on Israel last week as it had done when Iran struck Israel in April, adding the French president personally told Iran's president that his country would not allow Iran or its proxies to attack Israel. The official said Macron believes that for the sake of Israel's security and that of everyone in the Middle East there must be an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon, a release of the hostages held by Hamas and protection for civilians. France is an unwavering friend to Israel and Netanyahu's comments are excessive and disconnected from the friendship between the two nations, he added. Macron's comments have no real-world significance because France has not supplied arms to Israel since the war began and past weapons sales have been minimal to the war effort. France's military exports to Israel totaled some 20 million euros over the past decade, a drop in the ocean compared to the U.S. military aid, which is estimated to have been 27 billion euros in 2022. French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu said in March that French military exports to Israel only include mechanical components including to the Iron Dome missile defense system, through third-party vendors while pro-Palestinian groups in France claimed optic components for drones were also delivered. Officials involved in Israeli-France relations said Macron's comments came amid political turmoil in Paris after the last elections increased the parliamentary power of the far-left which launched an effort to oust Macron from office. Macron wants to be seen as an advocate for the Palestinian struggle and does not want far-left politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon to be the only one representing it. Sources in Jerusalem said France wants to be a central player in Lebanon and is joining the growing anti-Israel sentiment. As the only European permanent member of the UN Security Council, it believes it has a role to play in the European Union and the West. It recognizes the current American weakness, ahead of the presidential elections next month, and believes it is time to show initiative. After his statement, Macron will find it hard to gain Israel's trust, although no none in Jerusalem will say so officially.

Countdown to retaliation: Key Iranian targets in Israel’s crossha...	New report outlines potential targets Jerusalem may strike in Iran, focusing on country's military capabilities, economic infrastructure and nuclear program As war rages in Israel against Hamas and Hezbollah, global attention has shifted to Jerusalem's potential retaliation against Iran after the country's largest-ever ballistic missile strike on Israeli territory. But which possible targets is Israel likely to target in the event of such an attack? According to NBC, the Israeli Air Force's technological superiority, combined with Iran's relatively weak air defense, could enable Israel to strike a broad array of sites across the Islamic Republic. Military targets Potential targets range from military bases and intelligence facilities to oil refineries and even nuclear sites. NBC also assessed that Israel could receive U.S. intelligence support, leveraging satellite data and other sources to enhance precision. 'There are so many things they can hit, and they’re going to be able to hit all those with great effectiveness. Iran’s not going to be able to stop them,' a former senior U.S. military source familiar with the region told the network. However, the report stressed that Israel would need to consider potential Iranian retaliation, which could include attacks on nearby U.S. military bases across the region. The most probable targets, NBC suggested, are those linked to Iran's missile strike on Israel, such as command centers, missile launch sites and key military figures involved in Iran's ballistic missile program. The report also suggested Israeli strikes could extend to intelligence centers, often located in military bases, in response to Iran's stated attempt to strike the Mossad headquarters. Israeli strikes could also extend to air defense bases and drone facilities to safeguard Israeli fighter jets during any operation. Energy production facilities In addition to military targets, energy production facilities are also in Israel's potential crosshairs. A primary target could be the Persian Gulf Star oil refinery in Bandar Abbas, which supplies 40% of Iran's oil consumption. Striking this refinery could severely cripple Iran's economy, already burdened by U.S. sanctions. Other targets might include petrochemical plants, power stations and key oil export terminals, such as the Kharg Island terminal, through which 90% of Iran’s oil exports pass. Estimates suggest Iran can export up to 7 million barrels of oil daily through Kharg, though official reports from Iran claim lower numbers. Tehran's recent decision to move some of the oil tankers there suggests it is likely preparing for a potential attack on its oil infrastructure. A senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that Israeli energy infrastructure would be a primary target in response. Nuclear facilities Despite U.S. President Joe Biden’s opposition to an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, speculation remains about whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may opt to target these key sites. The Fordow and Natanz uranium enrichment facilities, both heavily fortified underground, and other nuclear-related sites, such as the Isfahan centrifuge factory and a reactor in Khondab, could be on Israel’s radar. Mossad has been linked to several sabotage actions in Iran in recent years, such as the powerful explosion in the Natanz facility in 2021. Still, executing a large-scale attack on these sites would be far more challenging and complex. Iran has several other sites related to its nuclear program, including a large facility outside Isfahan responsible for various activities, such as producing centrifuge parts and uranium metal — a material that could be used to build the core of a nuclear bomb. Additional potential targets include a partially built heavy water reactor plant in Khondab and research centers in Tehran.

IDF thwarts drone strike off coast	Military says two drones coming from the north are shot down by a naval vessel and one by the Air Force; IDF also says it struck Hezbollah targets in Beirut's Dahieh sector overnight hitting weapons storage facilities after warning civilians to leave The IDF said on Sunday that the Navy intercepted two UAVs launched from the north, in the northern Mediterranean. 'In addition, a UAV launched from the East was intercepted by the IAF off the coast of the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.' The military said no sirens were activated and no injuries were reported. Earlier a barrage of some 40 rockets targeted the northern city of Kiryat Shmona while the IDF was reported to launch strikes on Beirut's Dahieh quarter, the Hezbollah stronghold in the city. The military said its Air Force conducted numerous targeted strikes against Hezbollah weapons storage facilities and terror infrastructure after steps were taken to prevent civilian casualties, including calls to evacuate.

International investigation: Iran used criminals and drug dealers...	Joint investigation reveals how Iran operated terror cells on European soil using figures from the criminal underworld to try and orchestrate massive attacks Late last year, Roey – an Israeli citizen who lives and works in France – received a terrifying message from local security officials: An Iranian-directed terror cell plans to kill you. The French authorities received the warning from what they referred to as 'a foreign intelligence service' and, according to a subsequent report in the German media, it was none other than the Israeli Mossad that had alerted a number of intelligence agencies across Europe. The Mossad itself declined to confirm the report, responding to Shomrim’s request for comment by saying that 'intelligence agencies are constantly engaged in dialogue and cooperation to deal with threats.' In the months that followed, Roey received several more such alerts and French authorities even suggested that he leave the country. He took these warnings with the utmost seriousness. He and his wife spent much of the next few months in Israel and, during the short periods when they had to be in France, they moved between no fewer than six different apartments. Even though they took extraordinary precautions to remain safe, the stress was intense. In April this year, therefore, Roey’s wife contacted the DGSI – France’s internal security agency and the equivalent of Israel’s Shin Bet – to report an untoward incident. She told the French authorities that someone claiming to be a courier rang at the intercom of the family apartment. Since she was not expecting a delivery, she did not open the door – but she did manage to capture images of the individual on the intercom camera. The DGSI looked into the incident and concluded that the individual in question was probably a courier after all. A few days later, members of the terror cell were arrested by French authorities. Documents and testimony regarding the cell’s operations, which are being revealed here for the first time, provide a rare glimpse into the workings of Iranian terrors cell in Europe which use figures from the criminal underworld: low- and high-ranking members of the local criminal class, gangs, drug smugglers, former convicts and others. This is not a 'symbolic' modus operandi which takes advantage of frustrated and disenfranchised immigrants. Rather, these cells are planning and carrying out attacks and assassinations on a large scale. The cell that was arrested in France also planned to kill three other Israelis who work alongside Roey and three senior members of the Jewish community in Germany, in addition to being dispatched to set fire to buildings in the south of France belonging to Israeli-owned companies. In order to maintain a degree of separation from the terror cells it operates in Europe and to ensure plausible deniability, there is no direct contact between Tehran and members of the cells. In the case of the recently detained French cell, instructions on where and when to carry out attacks were relayed via international networks of criminals and drug smugglers. The investigation is based on documents from various European intelligence agencies obtained by independent French investigative online newspaper Mediapart, which were then analyzed by the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) organization and journalists from nine outlets, including Mediapart, Der Spiegel in Germany, Spanish outlet Infolibre and organizations from the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Belgium. Shomrim’s Daniel Dolev was the Israeli partner in the project. According to an internal document, the French security establishment believes that, after they took measures to ensure the safety of Roey and his family, the cell decided to move on and focus on its next targets. Roey – whose real name, like those of the cell’s other targets, is not being published for security reasons – has not responded to requests for comment sent to him via several channels. The owner of the company that employed Roey, a former member of the security services, told Shomrim that he had not been contacted by any officials on the matter. 'I have no idea what you are talking about,' he said. 'If someone were to tell me that it’s real, it would be very scary – but apart from that I don’t feel that way.' A decade of collaboration with the underworld Iran’s use of members of the criminal underworld and drug deals to carry out acts of terror is nothing new. In May, the Mossad revealed that a terror cell had been operating in Europe under the leadership of Rawa Majid, known as 'the Kurdish Fox,' who also spearheaded a Swedish organized crime ring called Foxtrot. According to various reports in Israel, which cited Mossad officials, Majid fled from Turkey to Iran, where he was recruited after being arrested by Iranian police. Israeli security officials told Shomrim that the Swedish cell and the French cell were activated separately and that there was no communication between them. The first evidence that Iran was using criminals in Europe emerged a decade ago. The main goal of the Islamic Republic was to assassinate members of the exiled Iranian opposition, as well as Jewish and/or Israeli targets. Since 2015, around 20 such attempts have been uncovered (see map). One of the first successful assassination came in December 2015, when Mohammad-Reza Kolahi Samadi, an activist in the People’s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) who was convicted of planting a bomb at the Tehran headquarters of the Islamic Republican Party that killed more than 70 officials in 1981 – and had been in living in the Netherlands under an assumed identity ever since. He was murdered by local criminals, aided by Dutch and Belgian drug-smuggling gangs. 'When it comes to exiled opposition figures, the Iranians have been running amok – unhindered and for years,' says Yoram Schweitzer, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies and the director of its Research Program: Terrorism and Low-Intensity Conflict. 'When it comes to Israelis, there are periods when there is more intense activity. We are currently in just such a period and have been for several years.' The Iranian modus operandi began to change around 2018, when a senior Iranian official diplomat called Assadollah Assadi was arrested and convicted of plotting to bomb a big rally organized by an Iranian exile opposition group in France. Assadi, who lived in Europe on the pretext that he was a diplomat working at the Iranian Embassy in Vienna, was sentenced to 20 years in prison – but subsequently released as part of a prisoner-exchange deal. Even though the Iranians had used criminal organizations to carry out terror attacks before this, they decided in the aftermath of the Assadi affair to make this a key part of their strategy. 'There has been a very noticeable uptick in the use of criminal elements to carry out terrorist attacks,' Schweitzer adds. 'The guiding principle for countries that support and orchestrate terror attacks is maintaining plausible deniability. 'Because, notwithstanding all of its violations, it still operates within a set of international norms and wants to maintain a façade of decency. So, the most important part of the process is to maintain that deniability and using the criminal element adds another degree of separation. Another layer of protection. That allows Iran to claim that these assassinations are criminal in nature, not political.' Former Mossad agents, who agreed to talk to Shomrim on condition of anonymity, also commented on the connection between Iranian terror and the criminal underworld. They also pointed out that the international trade in narcotics is a significant source of income for the Islamic Republic – as it is for Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'Our surveillance of the drug-smuggling trade as Hezbollah’s key economic lifeline reveals that the group is connected to all the [criminal] organizations, whether it’s in the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden or Sri Lanka. There, they are on the same field as the big players,' one former Mossad agent told Shomrim. At the same time, he added, 'if they have, let’s say, a smuggling route to Paris which brings in $10 million a year, and they use that money to carry out a terror attack, then it’s gone. And still, this connection creates relationships and the possibility of getting to know and then recruit people who are not directly connected to the smuggling operation but are from the criminal underworld.' Former Mossad: 'Our surveillance of the drug-smuggling trade as Hezbollah’s key economic lifeline reveals that the group is connected to all the [criminal] organizations, whether it’s in the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden or Sri Lanka. There, they are on the same field as the big players,' On the seam line between criminal activity and terrorism are international drug dealers. Earlier this year, the United States and the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on an Iranian narcotics trafficker called Naji Ibrahim Sharifi-Zindashti. According to American authorities, Zindashti and his network enjoy protection from the regime in Tehran and, in exchange, have carried out assassinations and kidnappings (some of which were foiled) for the Iranian Intelligence Ministry in the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands, Turkey and even the United States. Another similar case is that of Ramin Yektaparast, who, while not involved in trafficking narcotics, was a senior member of a German motorcycle gang and who German authorities suspected of murdering a member of a rival gang before fleeing to Iran. A court in Dusseldorf found that Yektaparast was responsible for organizing a Molotov cocktail attack on a synagogue in Bochum and that he was probably also responsible for a shooting attack on another synagogue, this one in nearby Essen. Yektaparast was shot dead in Tehran early this year in an operation that has been attributed to the Mossad. Yoram Schweitzer: 'The most important part of the process is to maintain that deniability and using the criminal element adds another degree of separation. Another layer of protection. That allows Iran to claim that these assassinations are criminal in nature, not political.' The gang leader fled to Iran French authorities believe that the terror cell operating on their soil was headed by a major drug dealer from the Lyon area called Umit Bulbul, who, as far as they are aware, is currently in Iran. Bulbul, who was born in Pau in southwestern France, had two known aliases. One of these was Ilan Isaac Hadjaj, a French-born Jew. Another was a fictitious Turkish national called Harun Öztürk. The cell’s operations were carried out by an Algerian-born French national known as Abdulkarim S., who was also known as Krimo. His full name cannot be published due to reporting restrictions in France. Krimo is well-known to French law-enforcement bodies, having served time for involvement in a gang warfare double murder in Marseilles and drug trafficking. As part of Iran’s efforts to keep the various members of the network apart, Bulbul and Krimo were never in direct contact. Acting as their intermediary was Sedat (whose name cannot be published for similar reasons), who has a rich criminal record involving violence, theft, extortion and drug trafficking – and who is currently serving time in a French prison. It was almost natural that he would be selected as the go-between: he was one of Bulbul’s lieutenants in the gang’s narcotics enterprise and was a former cellmate of Krimo. Krimo’s activation shows how the cell operated and what the Iranians were planning – including the fact that Tehran’s hit list included three senior members of the Jewish communities in Berlin and Munich. Although Krimo was barred from leaving France because of the conditions of his release from prison, acting on Iranian orders he traveled at least twice to Germany to collect intelligence on the targets. On one occasion, he traveled to Munich by train, having purchased a ticket using his brother-in-law’s identification documents and not before remembering to turn off his cellphone before leaving French territory. When he reached his hotel, he used his phone with a local SIM card. During his time in the city, Krimo visited the quiet neighborhoods of the Au-Haidhausen borough. Not exactly a hot tourist destination – but Krimo had other intentions. Au-Haidhausen is the location of businesses belonging to two of the intended assassination victims. He walked past the premises several times, even entering the internal courtyard and taking videos and photographs of the surroundings, the entry door and the back and front entrances of adjacent buildings. He had no idea, of course, that he was being followed by undercover German intelligence agents the whole time. Krimo spent a total of two days in Munich before returning to France. A week later, he once again boarded a train to Germany. When he alighted in Munich, on April 21st, he was stopped by local police and his documents were photographed. Even though he was under surveillance, this was actually a routine and random stop – but it concerned him. In a voice message he sent to an unknown recipient, he complained about the large police presence and returned to France two days later. European authorities continued to surveil Krimo and members of his cell, but then something unexpected happened: German magazine Focus reported on the Mossad warning mentioned at the start of this article and added that a manhunt was underway for Krimo. Investigators were worried that he would flee and, the next day, he was arrested along with his wife, who was suspected of abetting him. Under questioning, Krimo claimed that he had been working on behalf of a former cellmate, a young man of Turkish heritage called Emre, whose surname he never knew. He claimed that he met Emre in Lyon to get instructions and money from him – 1000 euros to take photographs of buildings in Germany. He said that Emra told him that the offices of companies that had defrauded a friend of his were located in these buildings. Although the story sounds far-fetched, it is not impossible that Krimo had no idea he was working for the Iranians. Subsequently, according to Krimo’s testimony, Emre asked him to set fire to several buildings in southern France, explaining that it was for the purposes of insurance fraud. Krimo claimed that he had not carried out the arson attacks himself but had introduced Emre to other criminals. The buildings in question were torched in late November and early January and all were connected in some way to Israeli-owned companies. By the time of the arson attacks, the cell’s operations were known to French security authorities. What remains unknown for the time being is whether members of the cell managed to go under the French radar to carry out these firebombings or whether authorities allowed them to do so in order to keep monitoring the cell, collect more intelligence and avoid revealing their sources. Another unresolved question is whether 'Emre' is a name that Krimo invented to shield Sedat and Bulbul from incrimination. When shown photographs of the two men, Krimo claimed he had never met them. However, there is evidence that suggests a connection. In November 2023, a seven-second phone call was made from a device used by Sedat to Krimo’s wife’s cell phone. Furthermore, after Krimo and his wife were arrested, authorities searched Sedat’s prison cell and found a USB drive and three cell phones – at least one of which he had been using. That device contained Bulbul’s contact information in the Facebook Messenger app, while Krimo’s contact was saved in the Telegram app. During questioning, Krimo’s wife confirmed that she had heard him mention Sedat’s name. Krimo and his wife are currently awaiting trial in France. Responses The Prime Minister's Office, which is responsible for the Mossad, issued the following statement: 'Since October 7, there has been an increase in the threat level to Israelis and Jews across the world from terrorist organizations. Responsibility for protecting every Israeli citizen or Jewish person in a foreign country rests with the local intelligence, security and law-enforcement services. Intelligence agencies are constantly engaged in dialogue and cooperation to deal with threats.' France’s General Directorate for Internal Security refused to answer questions on the issue and officials said that they are prohibited from discussing the case since legal proceedings are still underway. The Iranian embassy in the Netherlands issued the following response: 'Iran strictly abides by international law and respects the sovereignty of all states. Allegations that Iran is involved in directing or supporting attacks in Europe are unfounded and ridiculous. This is part of a campaign of deception aimed at damaging relations between Iran and European countries. It is unfortunate that such accusations are given credence, as their sole purpose is to sow division and mistrust.' Attorneys representing Krimo said that 'Mr. S. is currently the sole defendant (alongside his wife, whose involvement he denies) in a case whose severity is only becoming apparent to him when he is presented with the evidence. The failure to identify and/or arrest the assassins from the terrorist squad forces him to assume a role that is far too big for him. 'Mr. S. has been consistent during questioning. This shows, on the one hand, that he did not know the targets of the people who approached him and, on the other hand, that he bears no resentment whatsoever toward the Jewish community. There are no signs of radicalization or anything that could suggest that he is antisemitic. Nonetheless, he has been held in solitary confinement for more than three months. 'The severity of Mr. S.’s involvement is incalculably lower than the main players’, who are located above and below him in the criminal plan. Their arrest would allow him to return to his rightful position and allow him to be dealt with in accordance with his relative involvement in the affair.' Attorneys for Krimo’s wife said that: 'Our client knows nothing about the crimes she is alleged to have committed. She has no criminal past and is not known to the legal system. She has two children and is pregnant with a third and holds no radical views. These facts are not challenged but, nonetheless, she was incarcerated before her trial and countless requests for her release have been denied. She is likely to give birth to her third child behind bars. 'There is a terrible situation when it comes to cases classified as ‘terrorism’: individual freedoms and basic democratic principles such as the presumption of innocence are pushed aside in the name of ‘caution,’ which, in this case, is based on nothing but the security context of the case.' Shomrim was unable to obtain responses from Sedat and Umit.

Lebanon reports strikes in Beirut's Dahieh quarter	Hezbollah-affiliated news outlet Al-Mayadeen reported late Saturday that strikes were felt in Beirut's Dahieh quarter.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkccfqj11g	2024-10-05T13:35:51-07:00	
Anniversary of Gaza war draws thousands of pro-Palestinian protes...	Thousands of pro-Palestinians protestors take to the street in the U.S. and Europe calling to end Israel's war in Gaza as soon as possible Thousands of protesters took to the streets in several major cities around the world on Saturday to demand an end to bloodshed in Gaza, as the war in the Palestinian enclave approaches its first anniversary and spreads in the wider region. About 40,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London while thousands also gathered in Paris, Rome, Manila and Cape Town. The war was triggered when the Palestinian terror group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023 in an attack that killed 1,200 people and in which about 250 were taken as hostagess. 'Unfortunately, in spite of all our goodwill, the Israeli government does not take any notice, and they just go ahead and continue their atrocities in Gaza, now also in Lebanon and in Yemen, and also probably in Iran,' said protestor Agnes Kory in London. 'And our government, our British government, unfortunately is just paying lip service and carries on supplying weapons to Israel,' she added. In London, pro-Israel supporters waved flags as pro-Palestinian marchers walked by. There were 15 arrests on the sidelines of the protests, according to police, who did not specify whether those detained were from either group. In Rome, police fired tear gas and water cannons after clashes broke out. Around 6,000 protesters defied a ban to march in the city center ahead of the October 7 anniversary. In Berlin, a demo drew about 1,000 demonstrators, who bore Palestinian flags and chanted 'One Year of Genocide', a term which Israel disputes, saying it is defending itself. The demonstrators also criticized what they said was police violence against pro-Palestinian protesters in Germany. Israel supporters in Berlin protested against rising antisemitism and scuffles broke out between police and pro-Palestinian counter-protesters. Over the past year, the scale of the killing and destruction in Gaza has drawn some of the biggest global protests in years, in a wave of anger that defenders of Israel say has created an antisemitic climate in which protesters question Israel's right to exist as a nation. The war in Gaza has spread to the region, drawing in Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq. Israel has sharply escalated a campaign against Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah in recent weeks and Iran launched a barrage of missiles against Israel this week. In Paris, Lebanese-French protestor Houssam Houssein said: 'We fear a regional war, because there are tensions with Iran at the moment, and perhaps with Iraq and Yeme. We really need to stop the war because it's now become unbearable.' While its allies such as the United States support Israel's right to defend itself, Israel has faced wide international condemnation over its actions in Gaza, and now over its bombarding of Lebanon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted criticism and argued his government is acting to prevent a repeat of the October 7 assault by Hamas. International diplomacy led by the United States has so far failed to clinch a ceasefire deal in Gaza. Hamas wants an agreement that ends the war while Israel says fighting can end only when Hamas is eradicated. In Manila, activists clashed with anti-riot police after they were blocked from holding a demonstration in front of the U.S. embassy in the Philippine capital in protest at the United States supplying Israel with weapons. Demonstrations to mark the first anniversary were due to take place later on Saturday in other cities across the world, including the United States and Chile. Some demonstrations in support of Israel are also planned over the weekend.

IDF dismantles Hezbollah tunnel meters away from border	Military spokesperson uncovers footage of forces operating inside Radwan Force deep underground complex before collapsing it The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit on Saturday revealed footage of forces operating in Lebanon inside of a large terror tunnel utilized by the terror group’s Radwan Force found 300 meters (984 feet) away from the border with Israel. 'The Paratroopers Brigade, Yahalom Unit and the Northern Command Combat Engineering Unit, under the command of the 98th Division, destroyed 250 meters of underground terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon,' the military said in a statement. 'The underground infrastructure was identified and investigated during cross-border operations conducted in recent weeks in coordination with special units. IDF troops uncovered command centers, terrorist combat packs, and a large number of weapons designated to be used in an invasion by Hezbollah’s Radwan Forces into Israel. They also found living quarters equipped with showers, a kitchen, and stockpiles of food,' the statement added. According to the military, 'The underground infrastructure did not cross into Israeli territory and was sealed by the Northern Command Combat Engineering Unit and the Yahalom Unit in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense Department of Engineering and Construction.' The IDF added that forces are continuing to operate in the area in search of additional threats against Israel. 'Inside a Hezbollah stronghold used by the terrorist organization as a base to carry out attacks on Israeli civilians, the soldiers uncovered hundreds of weapons. The soldiers also eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and directed aerial strikes,' the military's statement read.

Ambulances with terrorists: Hezbollah's 'Medical Corps'	Hezbollah utilizes tactic similar to Hamas in Gaza and hijacks civilian medical complexes to carry out terror attacks and smuggling operations Lebanon reports hits on hospitals, medical teams and ambulances, but avoids addressing how medical personnel are assisting terrorists or dealing with Hezbollah's use of civilian and medical facilities. Like Hamas, the terror organization extensively uses civilian infrastructure, and reports say terrorists and weapons are being transported via ambulances and medical vehicles. To highlight the issue in international media, a headline in the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese outlet Al-Akhbar published on Saturday read, 'Six hospitals between complete and temporary closure — the enemy begins its war on health facilities.' Further, the number of Lebanese reports about medical personnel injured or killed in Israeli strikes has risen in recent days. Hezbollah is also a political entity that operates medical services in Lebanon, with its medical body being the Islamic Health Authority. Established in 1984 and licensed by the Lebanese Interior Ministry in 1988, it provides healthcare services in Lebanese society, runs education and training programs, promotes medical projects and supports Hezbollah's terror activities. This is in practice Hezbollah's 'Medical Corps,' serving its military wing under the guise of a civilian organization. Reports of casualties from the Islamic Health Authority were also during the war. Other organizations besides Hezbollah operate medical personnel. The Amal Movement, which has been fighting against Israel near the border in recent months and suffered casualties, has its own medical team under the name Islamic Al-Rissala Scout Association. The Islamic Health Authority released the names of 11 casualties from Israeli strikes in various areas in southern Lebanon on Friday. Reports of medics killed and wounded have been steadily coming in from Lebanon over the past two days, adding to the numbers mentioned last week by Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad, who reported 97 medical and emergency personnel killed since the start of the war and 188 wounded. He also claimed 9 hospitals had been targeted and 45 healthcare centers affected. Reports on Friday said that 5 hospitals, 4 of them in southern Lebanon, were rendered inoperative due to Israeli strikes, including the Marjayoun Governmental Hospital which closed its doors after an Israeli strike targeted two ambulances at its main entrance, the Meiss Ej Jabal Hospital, which ceased operations due to road closures and disrupted supply lines and Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil. Hezbollah, much Hamas in Gaza, uses civilian infrastructure including hospitals for terrorism. The IDF Spokesperson Unit reported on Saturday that the Israeli Air Force 'with the direction of IDF intelligence, struck Hezbollah terrorists who were operating within a command center that was located inside a mosque adjacent to the Salah Ghandour Hospital in southern Lebanon. 'The command center was used by the Hezbollah terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel.' The statement also added Hezbollah continues to illegally use hospitals in the country. Salah Ghandour Hospital issued a statement on Friday acknowledging the Israeli strike after receiving an evacuation warning beforehand. It said that nine medical staff were injured and that most of the medical staff had been evacuated. The statement didn’t address any Hezbollah activity inside the hospital. Hezbollah’s use of ambulances is also well-documented. A few months ago, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit revealed that Hezbollah uses ambulances from the Islamic Health Authority to transport terrorists and weapons. 'In recent days, we have observed increasing use of rescue vehicles to transport operatives and weapons by Hezbollah,' IDF Spokesperson for Arabic Media, COL Avichay Adraee, said on Friday. 'The IDF warns against this practice and calls on medical teams to distance themselves from the terror organization's operatives and refrain from cooperating with them. Any vehicle proven to carry an armed terrorist will be attacked regardless of its type,' he added.

Hezbollah rocket hits Karmiel home, no injuries reported	Terror group focuses fire on northern Israeli city, managing to damage one building amid intense rocket barrages; mayor calls on residents to adhere to Home Front Command guidelines A Hezbollah rocket on Saturday fell in Karmiel, located in northern Israel, following a barrage aimed at the country from Lebanon. No injuries were reported in the incident, however, the rocket hit a local building causing significant damage to it and the surrounding area. Karmiel Mayor Moshe Koninsky called on the city’s residents to strictly adhere to the IDF Home Front Command wartime guidelines shortly after the hit was reported. 'We find ourselves after several barrages aimed at the city. Most have been intercepted, but a direct hit was seen at one home. I ask again, enter your safe rooms as soon as you hear alert sirens sounding.' The Lebanese Iran-backed terrorist group intensified its launches against Israeli cities as far as Haifa Bay following IDF strikes across Lebanon aiming to weaken its firing capabilities and targets its operatives. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Friday that the IDF eliminated about 250 Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon in the last four days. During the operation, more than 2,000 military targets were attacked, including terrorist infrastructure, military complexes, warehouses, weapon caches and launch pads. According to the IDF, among the killed terrorists were five battalion commanders, ten company commanders and six platoon commanders. It was also reported the forces eliminated terrorists who were entrenched in buildings close to the border.

Macron urges halt to arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza	French president criticizes Jerusalem's wartime policies in Gaza and adamantly calls on nations to stop supplying Israel with weapons and military equipment French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday urged a halt to arms deliveries to Israel, which has been criticized over the conduct of its retaliatory operation in Gaza. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,' Macron told broadcaster France Inter. 'France is not delivering any,' he added during the interview recorded early this week. The United States provides about $3 billion in weapons to Israel each year. In May, the State Department said it did not have enough evidence to block shipments of weapons but that it was 'reasonable to assess' that Israel has used arms in ways inconsistent with standards of humanitarian law. In September, the UK said it was suspending some arms exports to Israel, citing a 'clear risk' that they could be used in a serious breach of international humanitarian law. Macron reiterated his concern over the war in Gaza that is continuing despite repeated calls for a cease-fire. 'I think we are not being heard,' he said. 'I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel,' he said, adding that the war was leading to 'hatred.' Macron also said avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a 'priority.' 'Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza,' he added. On Monday, Israel marks the first anniversary of the devastating October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the Gaza war and has now engulfed neighboring Lebanon, creating a perilous regional crisis. The confirmed death toll from the attack, including hostages killed in captivity, has reached 1,205 on the Israeli side, most of them civilians.

US fears of Israeli retaliation 'going too far' against Iran, rep...	International outlet reports the Biden administration worries it can't influence Israeli decision-making against Tehran which could impact the November elections American news outlet Bloomberg published an extensive report on Friday detailing Washington’s frustration over the 'lack of influence' the U.S. has on Israel regarding its military actions, especially in light of Israel's ground entry into southern Lebanon. Two sources familiar with U.S. policy said Israel is aware it has a 'window of opportunity' to take action before the presidential election on November 5. Amid a potential Israeli attack on Iran in response to its ballistic missile strike against the country, crude oil prices surged on Thursday after U.S. President Joe Biden said Israel was considering striking Iran's oil facilities and advised against it. Higher oil prices could threaten the Biden administration's hopes of keeping fuel costs low for Democratic voters. 'If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields,' Biden told reporters, adding that Israel hasn't yet decided on its response. A senior U.S. State Department official told CNN on Friday that Israel has not given the Biden administration any guarantees that it won't target Iran's nuclear facilities in response to the Iranian attack. A source familiar with the administration's policy was quoted by Bloomberg expressing concern in Washington from Israel 'going too far' in in retaliation against Tehran. Senior IDF officials clarified on Saturday the response to the ballistic missile strike will be 'significant.' The report also addressed Israel's ground entry into southern Lebanon, suggesting that Israel's previous maneuvers in the country developed into 'deadly quagmires,' and that the last U.S.-led effort to change the Middle East — the 2003 invasion of Iraq — only made the region less stable. 'We should all understand that this war will get wider, that it may involve the United States in ways we wish it would not, that it may change oil prices for America as we head toward the winter,' said Wendy Sherman, a veteran diplomat who left the U.S. State Department after serving as deputy secretary of state in 2023. Biden's special envoy to the Middle East Amos Hochstein, who has tried for months to prevent war in the north, said on Friday the U.S. did not give a 'green light' for an Israeli ground operation in Lebanon. 'Ultimately, only a diplomatic resolution will allow residents to return home. We continue to work [with the] governments of Israel & Lebanon on [the] best path to restore calm,' he said. Biden had little choice but to try to exert whatever influence he had left on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A senior Western diplomat said some allies are considering the prospect of a 'Samson option' — a scenario where a Kamala Harris victory would allow Biden to cave under pressure and cut off arms supplies to Israel to force a cease-fire. But with U.S. polls showing the race between Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump is close, the option seems irrelevant for now, meaning the White House will likely continue its effort to temper Israel's expanding military actions seemingly.

Sky News: Israel confirms Safieddine, Nasrallah's successor, kill...	Amid rocket barrages all over northern Israel, causing extensive damage to several homes in the Galilee and Haifa region, Arabic-speaking Sky News channel reports that Israel has supposedly confirmed a successful strike on Hassan Nasrallah's would-be successor to head Hezbollah In a significant escalation of regional tensions, two distinct rocket barrages originating from Lebanon activated sirens across a wide swath of northern Israeli communities, stretching from the Haifa region and into both the Lower and Upper Galilee. Concurrently, Israeli security officials confirmed on Saturday to the Arabic-language Sky News network that Hashem Safieddine, a prominent figure in Hezbollah's leadership as the head of its Executive Council and the intended successor to his cousin, Hezbollah's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, had been eliminated in an Israeli strike in the Dahiya quarter of Beirut. Lebanese security sources informed Reuters shortly before that since the series of attacks in the Beirut district, Safieddine has been 'unreachable.' Furthermore, three security sources noted that Israeli Defense Forces attacks on the outskirts of Beirut are impeding rescue teams from accessing the heavily targeted areas. Saudi television channel Al-Hadath previously reported, citing unnamed sources, that Israel, while not officially commenting on the operation attributed to it, received confirmation of Safieddine's demise. Sources indicated that the magnitude of the strike in Beirut, specifically targeting Hashem Safieddine, left 'no possibility of survival.' By midday, Al-Hadath further reported that Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers were also killed alongside him. It was asserted that 'Hashem was killed in the strike with aides, Iranian commanders, and replacement field commanders of Hezbollah.' Israeli intelligence sources, in discussions with The New York Times, revealed that the attack aimed at an underground bunker hosting senior Hezbollah officials. Reports suggest that Safieddine and the head of the intelligence department of the Shia militant organization were present at the meeting, held at a considerable depth, as noted by Al-Arabiya network. Various Saudi networks have raised questions regarding the whereabouts of Ismail Qaani, the commander of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, who according to Arab reports, has been 'missing' for several days. It's noteworthy that following the strike that killed Nasrallah in Dahiya, rumors surfaced about Qaani's potential presence, though the Iranian Mehr news agency clarified, amid circulating rumors, that the Iranian Quds Force commander was not harmed in the attack on Hezbollah's central headquarters. These extraordinary strikes, reportedly targeting Safieddine, occurred minutes after IDF announced the evacuation of several buildings in the Beirut district. 'It was a ring of fire, Israel attacked 11 times consecutively,' a source close to Hezbollah relayed to AFP. Officially, neither the terrorist organization nor Israel has yet addressed the strike or the fate of the high-ranking Hezbollah official closely associated with the Ayatollah regime in Tehran, who is also the son-in-law of Qassem Soleimani. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1mr9iaar	2024-10-05T05:41:17-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2017/05/20/7792688/7792688_0_0_750_422_0_small.jpg

Sky News Arabic reported, citing Israeli security sources, that the death of senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine has been confirmed. He was identified as the successor to Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last week. Early Friday morning, IDF confirmed that it conducted a targeted attack in the Dahiya neighborhood of Beirut.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1sa4sccr	2024-10-05T04:38:03-07:00	
Cadence, tone, inflection and topics: What characterized Nasralla...	Hassan Nasrallah's speeches were characterized by their structured nature and emotional delivery, as he carefully detailed agenda points and repeated key ideas; His presentations often included slow, calm speech punctuated by moments of raised voice for emphasis, evoking strong reactions from his audience The recently-slain Hassan Nasrallah was known for his speeches, which Israel closely monitored. These speeches, sometimes fiery, ended with his elimination, concluding years of lengthy broadcasts since the Second Lebanon War. These speeches were shown on giant screens to his supporters, who reacted as directed by their leader from his bunker. In recent years, Nasrallah didn't speak live in front of crowds. His speeches were broadcast from his hiding place, yet he maintained control over his audience, and not just them. The Arab world, the Western world, and Israel watched every word, emphasis, and hint from Nasrallah, trying to understand the leader of the terror organization, Iran's ally, and his future plans. Not all of his speeches focused on Israel. Some addressed Lebanon, regional issues, and religious topics. When he did address the issue of Israel, Nasrallah demonstrated extensive knowledge of internal Israeli issues, internal struggles, politics, the general atmosphere, and the Israeli media. Nasrallah usually spoke in a very organized manner, outlining the agenda at the beginning of each speech. He often spoke slowly and calmly, with a half-smile—even when his organization was in distress—and ensured his ideas were repeated. Occasionally, he raised his voice to threaten, earning cheers from the crowd. The background behind him in the broadcasts changed from speech to speech, depending on the topic, circumstances, and date. What remained almost unchanged was Nasrallah's attire and appearance. 'Nasrallah taught us to take his speeches seriously, and we followed him blindly. It became a ritual. Nasrallah speaks, and everyone rushes to read, interpret, and explain,' said Orna Mizrahi, former deputy head of the National Security Council and a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies. 'Nasrallah created a certain clarity for us. You could read the speeches, understand what he wanted, the directions, and the strategy. Now we need to learn anew where to find the signs of the organization's strategy if there is one at all.' Mizrahi said that in her view, the appearances of Nasrallah that will be remembered are mainly the 'Spider Web' speech in May 2000, after the IDF's withdrawal from Lebanon, and the 2006 interview after the Second Lebanon War, where he said that if he had known what the abduction of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev would lead to, Hezbollah would not have carried it out. Nasrallah, as Mizrahi described, didn't just deliver speeches—he also occasionally gave interviews to channels associated with his terror organization. In July 2022, marking 40 years of Hezbollah, he was interviewed by the Al-Mayadeen channel and spoke about the 'end of Israel,' envisioning a future where people would be seen with suitcases heading to airports, ports, and border crossings with Egypt and Jordan. Nasrallah claimed then that Israel is an 'entity with no future' and asserted that it wouldn't take 40 years for this to happen. Currently, it is worth noting that those who have fled and sought refuge are Nasrallah's own people, from the Shiite towns, from the southern Lebanon villages, from the Al-Bekaa area in southern Lebanon, and from the Dahiya district. Nasrallah used them over the years as human shields, hid weapons in their villages, and exposed them, without hesitation, to the threat of war. As lies turn to embarrassment Nevertheless, Mizrahi described that in his last speech, Nasrallah presented the complexity of assessing his enemy. 'In his last speech, he continued with threats but acknowledged Israel's technological superiority. He had a positive appreciation of the enemy on one hand—and also a burning hatred and desire to do everything to make us disappear from his sight,' she said. 'He had a relatively restrained approach—understanding Hezbollah's limitations of power.' Nasrallah's speeches were indeed characterized by emotional displays. In a speech on Laylat al-Qadr this year, he mentioned the commandment of 'Shahada' and the 'martyrs' killed fighting Israel, spoke with a choked voice—and the audience cried together with him. In 2018, he broke into tears during a speech for Ashura ceremonies, condemning the custom among Shiite believers of cutting children's faces during mourning rituals. 'The whole world sees what's happening here—and I ask you to exercise restraint and stay away from anyone trying to create a negative impression of us,' he said then. Nasrallah also tended to lie. 'I don't know if he believed his lies or not,' Mizrahi said. 'It was very noticeable that in his early speeches, he talked about the many casualties in Israel and the deaths Israel is hiding. He talked about large numbers. Gradually, he talked less and less about these topics.' According to Mizrahi, Nasrallah lied when embarrassed: 'When it was hard for him to explain things, like October 7, he lied about things that happened that day.' Hezbollah's response to the elimination of Fuad Shukr, for example, led the terror organization to promote lies that Israel is hiding a significant attack at the Glilot base, with dead and wounded. The organization even provided 'accurate' numbers—far from reality. 'I don't know if someone whispered in his ear or if he tried to build a narrative,' Mizrahi said. 'In his speeches, he tried to build narratives. The narrative of 'Israel is weak,' for example, to build it, he also used internal tensions in Israel.' According to Prof. Eyal Zisser, an expert in the modern history of Lebanon and Syria and Deputy Rector at Tel Aviv University, Nasrallah's speeches were essentially the tool through which he outlined policy. 'In recent decades, he wasn't publicly active, so his speeches were both for his supporters and his enemies, the only way to gauge moods, intentions, and plans,' he said. According to him, 'Since he is the one who makes the decisions and he was central, the speech was something that summarized for us how he sees things, what he thinks, and what his plans are. It became the tool through which he and his organization say where we came from and where we are going.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/r1hztcacc	2024-10-05T04:17:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/08/19/H1jIAYset/H1jIAYset_0_55_2500_1408_0_small.jpg
Sirens activated in Haifa and surrounding communities	Sirens have been activated in the are of greater Haifa, including small communities such as Yagur, Ibtin, Tirat HaCarmel and others.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhnh9ccc	2024-10-05T03:33:53-07:00	
Commando Brigade turning every rock in villages across Southern L...	Commando Brigade's combat team fighters continue operating in southern Lebanon as part of the focused ground activity that began this week, in villages where extensive parts of their infrastructure have been converted into Hezbollah terror targets. This was reported by IDF spokesperson, who noted the fighters are conducting raids based on intelligence guidance on terror infrastructures both above and below ground in mountainous, complex, booby-trapped areas, and in dense, built-up areas. Forces have located and destroyed weapon caches, observation posts, missiles, and launch sites aimed at Israel, and have eliminated dozens of terrorists in cooperation with the Air Force.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skpb3k0rc	2024-10-05T02:51:57-07:00	
Most intensive aerial campaign in the world outside Gaza in the ...	Since the IDF maneuver began in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah has issued around 100 claims of responsibility for actions against Israel and its forces, including within Lebanon; In this period, IDF operations have resulted in the elimination of more than 250 terrorists, including 21 commanders, over four days of focused activity Since the IDF began its maneuver in southern Lebanon last Monday, Hezbollah has issued approximately 100 'claims of responsibility' for actions against Israel and IDF specifically, including within Lebanon. In some statements, the Shiite terrorist organization claimed it fired at gathering areas on the northern border where IDF troops were preparing for a ground entry into Lebanon for the first time since 2006. In recent days, there has been a significant increase in Hezbollah's claims of responsibility, with some turning out to be false or at least inaccurate. The terrorist organization's apparent aim is to project 'achievements' on the ground, likely due to distress following a series of senior eliminations in Lebanon. Alongside attacks against IDF soldiers maneuvering in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah continued its relentless firing toward Israeli territory, which also expanded to additional areas. After launching a rocket aimed at Tel Aviv for the first time last week, Hezbollah this week launched its first major barrage toward the country's center, triggering alarms in Tel Aviv and surrounding region. According to the terrorist organization, this was firing at 'Base 8200 in Glilot and Mossad headquarters' and at 'the airbase in Sde Dov.' Firing toward Haifa, surrounding towns, the Lower Galilee, and the bases in these areas, which was considered unusual until a few weeks ago, has become much more frequent over the past week and the one before. For comparison, until the beginning of Operation 'Northern Arrows' in the middle of last month, alarms were heard in Haifa only twice since the start of the war. In contrast, over the past two weeks, no fewer than 14 alerts have been activated throughout the city. Since the maneuver began this week, according to IDF data, more than 700 launches from Lebanon to Israel have been identified. Since the IDF entered Lebanon on the ground, Hezbollah has claimed in several statements that it managed to cause casualties among the fighting forces on the ground and described 'clashes with IDF forces' in other statements. However, many of these announcements have been found to be inaccurate. 250 terrorists eliminated, over 2,000 targets attacked Alongside the difficult incidents and the heavy toll, IDF is recording achievements in the fighting in southern Lebanon. During four days of focused activity in southern Lebanon, more than 250 terrorists have been eliminated, according to the IDF, including 21 commanders. IDF spokesperson updated that among the eliminated commanders, there are five at the battalion commander level, ten company commanders, and six platoon commanders. Additionally, the army estimates that the entire southern Lebanon region has been evacuated of population, with a total of about 600,000 having left and reached north of the Litani River. Forces operate in southern Lebanon in brigade formation attacks, combining aerial activity alongside tanks and artillery. The IDF added that during the activity, forces are eliminating terrorists entrenched in buildings and locations close to the fence, locating and destroying weapons storage, ready-to-launch launchers, and Hezbollah's charges left behind. The forces' activity has so far been carried out from controlling areas over six villages, focusing on Hezbollah operatives and weapon stockpiles, even underground. 'We are combing with iron combs and finding much more than we knew. We located dozens of large weapons caches. We found many more underground infrastructures than we knew, including supply tunnels of 40-50 meters—and we have begun destroying those infrastructures. The Paratroopers Brigade eliminated 15 terrorists who emerged from shafts and hideouts in the last 24 hours,' IDF relayed. 'The most intense aerial combat in the world in the past 20 years' Additionally, Air Force operates above and around ground forces—at all hours of the day. From preemptive strikes against military targets in the raid destinations to removing threats in the area through collection and attack missions. So far, more than 2,000 military targets have been attacked, including terror infrastructures, military buildings, weapons storage, and launchers. According to reports in Lebanon and IDF announcements, the main target areas of the Air Force are southern Lebanon, the Al-Bekaa area in the east, connecting Lebanon with Syria, and the Dahiya of Beirut. Data published last night on CNN showed that Israel is bombing across Lebanon more than the US at the peak of its fight against ISIS and at a higher rate than the US military attacked in its war in Afghanistan. According to data from the Lebanese Ministry of Health, more than 1,400 people have been killed in the country in the past three weeks due to the massive airstrikes. Additionally, more than 7,500 others were injured. However, data from the Ministry of Health in Lebanon are not always accurate, as not all casualties reach treatment in various hospitals. It should be noted that Israel, for its part, sends messages to civilians in Lebanon before attacking certain areas. Just last week, several such warnings were sent to residents of the Dahiya district and its surroundings, where Israel attacked significant weapon stockpiles. In that district, as known, a number of senior Hezbollah officials, including the organization's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, were eliminated in an airstrike about a week ago. According to Airwars, which monitors and collects data on airstrikes in conflict zones, 'Israel's bombings, which it says are aimed at Hezbollah strongholds, mark the most intensive aerial campaign in the world outside Gaza in the past two decades.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hybgporcc	2024-10-05T02:48:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/05/B1UKmBAC0/B1UKmBAC0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Saudi FM: 'No diplomatic relations with Israel without two-state ...	Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud says that while normalization with Israel was imminent before October 7, their position has now shifted, saying that without a two-state solution and a divided Jerusalem, the Saudi government will not agree to formalize diplomatic relations with Israel Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud articulated in the Financial Times why Riyadh paused its normalization with Israel, which was nearly finalized before October 7. He emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, warning of the region's dangerous escalation and the necessity for 'courage and leadership' to forge a sustainable peace amidst the devastation and despair. He declared, 'The time has come to embark on an irreversible path to a solution, culminating in two states—Palestinian and Israeli—living side by side.' Farhan underscored Saudi Arabia's enduring commitment to resolving the conflict, noting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's strong condemnation of Israel's actions. 'Saudi Arabia will tirelessly work towards establishing an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without this condition,' he wrote. He stressed that an independent Palestinian state, in Saudi Arabia's view, would provide regional stability, integration, and prosperity. 'A two-state solution is not merely an ideal; it is the only viable path to ensuring Palestine, Israel and the region’s long-term security,' he argued. 'Uncontrolled escalatory cycles are the building blocks of wider war. In Lebanon, we are witnessing this first hand. Peace cannot be built on a foundation of occupation and resentment; true security for Israel will come from recognizing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.' Farhan noted that the barriers to peace are not the 'It is essential to understand that the true obstacles to peace are not the Palestinians and Israelis who yearn for stability and coexistence, but rather the radicals and warmongers on both sides who reject a just resolution and seek to spread this conflict across our region and beyond.' He emphasized the importance of a PA-administered civilian control of Gaza: 'We have witnessed the perseverance of the Palestinian Authority in maintaining calm in the occupied West Bank despite unrelenting obstacles. Its commitment to non-violence and co-operation must be supported. A lasting resolution cannot be achieved without both Gaza and the occupied West Bank being under PA control.' He further argued that Israel's interest are not as benign as it claims, supposedly more interested in offense than defense. 'It has been clear for too long that self-defence is not Israel’s primary goal in this war. Instead, it seems the objective is to eliminate the conditions for life with any modicum of dignity for decades to come. By continuing the assault on Gaza that has killed over 40,000, according to Palestinian health officials, and displaced almost 2mn, expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank and imposing movement restrictions, Israel creates a reality that diminishes prospects for a sovereign Palestinian state. 'Merely recognizing Palestine is not enough. We must demand more accountability in line with International Court of Justice opinions. This includes the implementation of UN resolutions, the imposition of punitive measures against those that work to undermine Palestinian statehood and incentives for those who support it.' 'A global alliance of UN member states and international organizations now supports diplomatic efforts for a permanent ceasefire, the release of hostages and detainees, and addressing the humanitarian suffering of Gaza's residents,' he added. 'This alliance will seek to advance concrete measures to uphold international law, end the occupation, and realize the two-state solution on a clear timeline. 'Palestinian statehood is a prerequisite for peace, rather than its byproduct. This is the only path that can lead us out of this cycle of violence and into a future where both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace, with security and mutual respect. Let us not delay any longer.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj8ykicar	2024-10-05T00:13:59-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/04/29/ryM11nPC2WR/ryM11nPC2WR_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

I'll be the first to return': Female Northern Command officer ev...	Lieutenant Colonel S., the the IDF’s first female offensive operations at the IDF's Northern Command, recounts northern conflict and says actions against Hezbollah is critical Lieutenant Colonel S., the IDF’s first female offensive operations head at the military’s Northern Command, had been evacuated from her home at the onset of the Gaza war on October 7. 'We can’t get used to a situation of families being evacuated from their home for a year,' She told Ynet. Since the outbreak of the war, S. has also been working to change this reality. The officer has been responsible in recent months, among other things, for dozens of plans aimed at eliminating Hezbollah commanders and reducing the organization's capabilities. She took up her position about a month ago, stepping directly into Operation Northern Arrows, much of which she conceived during her previous roles in the Northern Command. In the long months leading up to the IDF's operation against Hezbollah, she operated in her previous position executing attack plans against Hezbollah's rocket array. These actions degraded the terror army’s capabilities, making it harder for them to fire mortars and rockets as planned toward northern communities. One of these communities is Kibbutz Matzuva, near the border in the western Galilee, where S. herself lives. She was evacuated from there a year ago with her three small children and her husband, Major B., who also serves as a Northern Command intelligence officer. As a result, the two have become a constant point of inquiry from their friends in Kibbutz Matzuva and the nearby town of Shtula, where she grew up. 'I can't tell them what we're doing, but I assure them that we are practically restoring security and that we've taken away many of Hezbollah's capabilities. We can’t get used to a situation of families being evacuated from their home for a year, but we're at a point where we will be able to return home safely very soon — and I'll be the first to return to the house we built in the kibbutz,' she said. Lieutenant Colonel S. stressed that weakening Hezbollah and the heavy blows inflicted by her comrades in the Northern Command didn't start last month but have been ongoing, with thousands of targets being hit daily over the past year from the air and the ground, directed by the Northern Command’s operation center. 'We know how to fire at exact locations, with full control and creative ideas from all offensive sources, including the Navy, which is working with us,' she said. 'We've been formulating these plans for years and suddenly executing them is thrilling and gives an adrenaline rush when you see it happen before your eyes. The reality here won't be what it was before.' Before Operation Northern Arrows began, S. and B/ managed to visit her parents briefly to support them, hinting that they'd be gone for a long period of time. 'For months now, my parents have taken full responsibility for raising the kids, doing homework with them and supporting us from afar,' she said. 'We're at a critical juncture and we're actively restoring the sense of security for all northern residents. Hezbollah has weak points and we know exactly where to strike. We're shaking Hezbollah and the reality that existed here on October 6 won't return,' she added. 'Our home hasn't been damaged and we had just finished building it before the war. We managed to visit briefly to water the plants and make sure it remained intact, but we'll return to it to raise our children without a doubt.'

Israel eyes retaliation on Iran: ‘They will pay with interest’; I...	Sources say Israel planning strong response against Tehran soon, placing Islamic Republic under 'immense pressure'; US official says 'Israel can rest assured it has our backing'; Israel may also target Iraq militias after deadly drone strike American officials indicated on Friday that an Israeli strike on Iran is likely imminent, following Iran's launch of over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. The main question now, they said, is what role the U.S. will play in response to the Iranian attack. While U.S. aircraft are not expected to participate in the strike, there will undoubtedly be coordination between Washington and Jerusalem, officials said. However, they added that this could still change, emphasizing that the U.S. is focused on protecting its forces and highlighting America’s role in intercepting Iranian missiles earlier this week. 'Miscalculations can happen,' one official noted. 'We are certainly trying to prevent this from escalating into a regional war, but it’s clear the U.S. could be drawn in.' The officials also underscored their understanding of Israel's need to respond, though they acknowledged the complexity of a potential strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. 'It’s not as simple as eliminating Iran’s nuclear infrastructure with a single bombing run. It’s very complicated,' they added. Regardless, the officials made it clear that Israel has the U.S.’s full support. 'Israel will do what it needs to do—but they don’t want a regional war either. Israel can rest assured it has our backing, and we’re in sync with them,' one official said. A senior State Department official told CNN that Israel has not promised the Biden administration that an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites is 'off the table' in response to the Iranian missile strike. 'We hope to see wisdom alongside strength, but there are no guarantees,' he said. When asked if Israel might strike Iran on the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack, the official responded: 'It's hard to say. In some ways, I think Israel would want to avoid that timing, so if anything happens, it will likely be before or after.' He added, 'The U.S. has worked for nearly a year to prevent this conflict from escalating into a larger war—and so far, we’ve managed that. But now we’re on the edge.' President Joe Biden also addressed the situation on Friday, saying 'If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.' Unexpectedly joining the White House daily press briefing, Biden further said, 'Israel won’t make an immediate decision; we’ll wait to see when they want to talk. The key thing right now is to avoid a full-scale war and rally our allies to contain it.' Iran's state news agency SNN reported Friday that a senior official from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard warned, 'If Israel makes a mistake, we will target its gas and energy facilities.' This came after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, during a visit to Beirut where he met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, said, 'We are determined to support Hezbollah, the government and the people of Lebanon. Israel is committing war crimes, and Arab and Islamic nations must mobilize international organizations against Israel.' He later added, 'The attack on Israel was legitimate self-defense; we have no plans to continue—unless Israel decides to strike us.' In response, Israeli sources familiar with the situation said that Israel is planning a severe retaliation against Iran. 'Their threats don’t affect us at all. We see tremendous pressure in Tehran—they’re panicking. Israel will strike hard, and they can keep threatening, but they will pay the price, with interest,' the source said. Meanwhile, the IDF reported that two Israeli soldiers were killed Tuesday night in northern Golan by a drone launched from Iraq. The victims were identified as Sergeant Daniel Aviv Chaim Sofer, 19, from Ashkelon, a communications officer trainee with Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion, and Corporal Tal Dror, 19, from Jerusalem, a communication specialist with the same battalion. Twenty-four other soldiers were injured, including one in serious condition, one in moderate condition, and 21 with minor injuries. Another drone was launched that night but was intercepted. The pro-Iranian militia group Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they carried out 'three drone strikes on targets in the north.' This marks the first time that drone strikes from Iraq have resulted in Israeli casualties. Regarding the militia's actions in Iraq, sources said, 'We will find the appropriate response, both for the drone attack on our soldiers in the Golan and otherwise. It's clear that Iran is activating all possible fronts, and we must be prepared for more surprises.' This incident follows a similar escalation from Yemen when a drone strike led to the death of an Israeli civilian. In response, the IDF struck the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah in Yemen. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared, 'The first time they struck an Israeli, we retaliated. The fire is spreading across the Middle East.' Iran behind attacks on Israeli embassies As anticipation mounts for Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack, the opposition channel Iran International reported that Tehran is behind recent armed assaults on Israeli embassies in Sweden and Denmark. A well-informed source told the channel that 'the Islamic Republic used local criminal elements to carry out these terror attacks on embassies and continues its efforts to target tourists and Jewish and Israeli centers across Europe.' Referring to the arrest of a criminal gang in June responsible for shooting at the Israeli embassy in Sweden, the source said, 'Investigations revealed that this group was also directed by agents of the Islamic Republic.' Following that incident, Swedish intelligence warned that the Iranian government was recruiting Swedish gang members to carry out violent acts against groups and individuals in the country. The source emphasized that 'hiring criminals to execute terror attacks on behalf of the republic against perceived enemies is one of Tehran’s preferred methods.' This approach, he added, allows Iran to distance itself from acts of terror and portray them as 'mere criminal activities.'

IDF forces clash with Hezbollah terrorists in close range battles...	IDF soldiers notice that Hezbollah operatives prefer to fight up close instead of shooting from a distance like Hamas after having encountered terrorists in several incidents Unlike the Hamas terrorists in Gaza, most of whom fled their positions during the IDF maneuver in the Gaza Strip and shot mainly from afar, Hezbollah operatives remain to fight in blank-range battles with the IDF soldiers, who entered southern Lebanon for limited targeted raids on Monday. In the first days of the limited operation in southern Lebanon, during which more than 250 terrorists were eliminated, the IDF noticed a recurring pattern among the Hezbollah operatives. The Hezbollah terrorists do not engage the IDF soldiers until they are close and fight in close-range battles. For example, the paratrooper brigade, who were the first to cross the border, reported six point-blank range encounters with Hezbollah terrorists in the first four days of the operation. In all of these encounters, according to the reports, Hezbollah was defeated and its operatives were eliminated, despite having lost some soldiers and others sustaining injuries. The Hezbollah squads are quite small, ranging from one to a few terrorists in each cell. On Thursday, for example, in another encounter by one of the forces, a terrorist hid in a building and opened fire at soldiers who entered to search it. The soldiers use drones to locate and attack the terrorists instead of risking themselves. In the case of the late Captain Ben Zion Falach, the paratroopers realized quickly, as part of their extensive experience in Gaza, that the terrorists were operating from a combat complex integrated into a tunnel shaft. That prompted the IDF to destroy the complex with engineering means. The soldiers also noticed that the Hezbollah operatives only act if they see soldiers approaching. The IDF's attacks in the region have severely damaged Hezbollah's supply lines and combat capabilities. For example, the IDF destroyed the regional headquarters in the Bint Jbeil Municipality building during the holiday which shows the terror organization's initial signs of erosion. Despite Hezbollah's forces being diminished and its infrastructure damaged, its operatives managed to fire a barrage of mortar bombs at the troops in one of the neighboring villages. There were no casualties to the IDF forces in this incident. Hezbollah's great losses accumulating the last year in IDF airstrikes, the pager and communication device explosions and the recent limited raid, prove to be weighing the terrorist organization down. However, the IDF's objective in the southern Lebanon villages is to rid the area of Hezbollah and allow the northern residents to return home eventually. Earlier, the IDF spokesperson informed that during the last four days of operations in southern Lebanon, more than 250 terrorists were eliminated, including 21 commanders. According to his statement, the 250 operatives included five battalion commanders, ten company commanders, and six department commanders. In addition, the IDF estimates that the entire southern Lebanon population evacuated and about 600 thousand left and arrived north of the Litani river. The IDF continues to operate in southern Lebanon which combines air activity alongside limited targeted raids with tanks and artillery. The IDF added that during the operation, the forces eliminated terrorists entrenched in buildings adjacent to the fence, located and destroyed weapon caches, launchers ready for launch, and Hezbollah IEDs that were left behind. Since the beginning of the operation in southern Lebanon, eleven IDF soldiers have been killed in combat. The eleven soldiers are: Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, Sergeant First Class Or Mantzur, Staff Sergent Almken Terefe, Staff Sergent Ido Broyer, Captain Itai Ariel Giat, Sergeant First Class Noam Barzilay, Captain Harel Etinger, Sergeant First Class Nazar Itkin, Captain Ben Zion Falach, Corporal Tal Dror, and Sergeant Daniel Aviv Haim Sofer.

A day after the assassination attempt of Hashem Safieddine, who was designated as the successor of former Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, reports indicate that the terror organization's head of the intelligence unit was present at the meeting that was attacked. Also, according to the reports, it can be estimated that all those present were killed as a result of the collapse of the bunker or toxic gases that were emitted into the tunnels. Israel estimates that is how Nassrallah was killed last week.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h182qqt0a	2024-10-04T09:47:10-07:00

Inbar's baby looks for his murdered mother at night	Inbar Segev Vigder was murdered on the night of the Iranian missile strike in a shooting attack in Jaffa; She died protecting her 9-month-old son: 'He will not want for anything' Yaari Vigder, whose wife Inbar was murdered in the shooting attack in Jaffa on the eve of the Iranian attack, told Ynet, 'I don't know where we will continue our lives, in Jaffa or in Tel Aviv. It depends on our ability to contain the event.' Inbar was murdered on the light rail, while she was protecting their son Ari who was in a carrier. 'I got there and started turning over Zaka bags. I was looking for Inbar and Ari. I didn't listen to the police who told me to go to the safe zone because of the missiles,' Yaari said. 'I arrived at the hospital and I was upset there as well. I searched for them like crazy. Our story is very special, but I'm leaving out the details because it already feels excessive to me.' He described that despite the chaos, Ari is in good hands. 'He is surrounded from all sides. This is my new life mission, to make sure that he does not want for anything. The warmth of love, first-class treatment and the education that Inbar wanted him to receive. I receive help from my parents these days, my mother tries to feed Ari at night,' he said. His son Ari, only nine months old, is still breastfeeding and was sleeping with his mother in the same bed until her death. 'I feel that he is managing to adapt. I put my bed next to his bed to get up at night, to hear Ari. When he woke up I fed him and he didn't want to eat. I saw that he didn't fall asleep so I picked him up and put him with me, on a mattress on the floor. He used to wake up several times at night, but today he woke up only at half past five in the morning,' he added. Several women from all over the country donated breast milk to Yaari's son. 'He started daycare in September and Inbar pumped for him. He started eating solids but drank only her pumped milk. The nights were also all Inbar's, she would put him to sleep by breastfeeding. I would see them asleep together. At night he looked for her. I feel that the mother's milk supported him and gave him comfort. We have a lot of supplies in the freezer and also in the milk bank. I respond to women that we don't need milk anymore.' 'I didn't take for granted that people would mobilize to help us, but an amazing thing is happening here. People are coming together for a common goal. Here is our personal tragedy that has received national attention. Everyone feels a part of this pain. I thank every mother who heard about our story and offered to give the most intimate thing between her and her baby. The giving surrounds us, it is so symbolic of my Inbar,' he said. However, he explained that he still does not know when he will use the donated milk. 'Breastfeeding, beyond the nutritional values, is the personal and deep connection between Inbar and Ari. Today it is less relevant. We need to understand how to make the transition because this period will be saturated with changes.' The shiva, which is not held due to the holiday, will be held for a few days next week in an alternative mourning ceremony. At the same time, parents all over the country have taken part in the social media trend to post photos with their babies in carriers in Inbar's memory. 'Ever since Ari was born, he was in a carrier,' said Yaari. 'Inbar would have been very happy to see this campaign. She would like to strengthen the bond between mothers and their babies.' In addition, Inbar and Yaari's friends launched a fundraising campaign to raise donations. 'Little Ari lost his mother Inbar, who was murdered in the terrible attack in Jaffa. At the age of 9 months, he has to learn to live without a mother, and we want to ensure that his life will be as good and stable as possible,' the campaign page reads.

Where is safer, Lebanon or Syria? the dilemma of refugees fleeing...	Syrians who escaped their country and the abuse of the regime, now forced by the Beirut government to return home; Assad remains quiet in his palace overlooking Damascus expressing a tepid regret at Nasrallah's assassination Long lines move slowly toward the Masnaa border crossing between Lebanon and Syria as Syrian civilians try to make their way out of Lebanon's war with Israel. It costs $100 for anyone over 18 to cross, children are free. 17-year-old Shatilah describes how her father begged the Syrian border officials to agree to only half that sum because it was all he had. Those crossing are mainly women and children. Syrian men between 16 and 35 years of age, do not enter Syria, fearing being sent to military training camps. The regime called them to come home but did not elaborate on the fate that awaited them. There is a slow evacuation of Syrian refugees, who escaped their own country in recent months or the past year or two ago, fleeing Israeli attacks and the abuse of the Syria regime. Syrian soldiers board the buses on the border and search them, pulling people out for more intensive investigations before instructing the driver to continue on to Damascus where more searches and questioning will take place. Buses heading to Idlib, carry those identified as supporters of the opposition to Assad and they will remain in the city which is surrounded by government troops, and will be unable to leave. Their names are registered and they will face their punishment later, according to Adalah, a 20-year-old Syrian who said that was why he intended to stay on the Lebanese side of the border. Some 1.5 Syrian refugees were in Lebanon. A staggering figure for a country with a population of just 5 million. They were willing to do any work, for any pay, just to survive. When the exodus from South Lebanon began, and the IDF dropped leaflets warning of the pending attacks, the Syrians packed up quickly. They did not decide to go home. It was the decision of the Lebanese government. Syrian President Hafez al Assad remains in his secluded palace overlooking Damascus. He's heard the rumors that his brother Mahr was killed in an Israeli strike on his home where he hosted senior Iranian military officials. He commands the Syrian military's 4th division but is also in charge of the security detail that protects the president. He also maintains strong ties to his counterpart in Iran. Assad has not uttered one public word since Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, whom he admired. The messages of condolence from the Syrian regime were tepid. Assad's wife Asma is fighting cancer again and may be in Russia for treatments and his mistress was killed in mysterious circumstances last July, probably at the hands of Iran, shortly before escaping to Russia. He remains silent although his country is often under attack from Israel, targeting Iranian assets. Senior Syrian leadership meets daily, according to local media reports, but nothing comes out and no special security measures are announced. Assad's guards urged him to go underground with two of his children, as Iran's supreme leader had done.	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/ryijpvp0r	2024-10-04T06:42:36-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/Hyxg11900g0A/Hyxg11900g0A_1_314_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Military says anti-tank missiles, rockets and launchers found inside homes by forces on the ground to remove Hezbollah threat from north, trucks carrying concrete brought in to block Hezbollah attack tunnels Massive amounts of munitions remain in South Lebanon and cameras placed by Hezbollah operatives in the terrain, provide terrorists with intelligence on IDF troop movements and deployment. The forces that began a ground incursion into Lebanon earlier this week, have already uncovered many advanced anti-tank missiles. The IDF revealed on Friday that its troops operating in South Lebanon have found massive amounts of weapons and terror infrastructure inside villages and homes. The ground operations aim is to remove them and prevent the terror group from using them to attack northern Israel. 'Over the past 24 hours, the troops discovered rocket launcher munitions, anti-tank missiles, and rockets - inside a residential home,' the military said in a statement. 'The weapons were found by a bed and a picture of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The troops also located and confiscated dozens of weapons left behind in buildings and civilian homes in southern Lebanon. The weapons located include rocket launchers aimed at Israeli territory, anti-tank missiles, firearms, observation posts, and an explosive device buried by the enemy in the area.' The IDF said it was transporting truckloads of concrete to block tunnels, and blowing up others, while at least 100 terrorists have been killed. Israel also suffered casualties after nine soldiers were killed in the fighting. The military said it has observed increasing Iranian efforts to arm Hezbollah and has therefore launched strikes on the border region between Lebanon and Syria including destroying underground tunnels used for arms smuggling. On Thursday, the air force attacked a border crossing point at Masnaa, operated by the Lebanese government claiming it was used to bring in arms for Hezbollah. IDF Arabic language spokesperson Major Avichay Adaree said that since Israel attacked Hezbollah run border crossings late last month, which were the main access point for weapons, the Masnaa border, became the primary source of weapons being brought into Lebanon.

Nasrallah was pearl of Lebanon, Khamenei says	Iran's Supreme leader says October 7 massacre justified, missile strike on Israel, minimal response to its crimes; source says Nasrallah buried in temporary grave fearing Israeli attack on mass funeral Iran's Supreme leader Ali Khamenei said on Friday that the Hamas massacre of October 7 was justified. The Iranian leader spoke in a rare appearance leading Friday prayers in Tehran, speaking in Arabic. He also said the Iranian missile attack on Israel was minimal in light of its crimes and said Iran and its regional proxies would not back down from Israel. 'The brilliant action of our armed forces a couple of nights ago was completely legal and legitimate', Khamenei said. He referred to slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as 'a dear brother and source of pride.' calling him the pearl of Lebanon and claiming his influence went beyond the borders of Lebanon and the Arab world. 'Nasrallah was the flag of resistance, the voice of the oppressed. Under his leadership Hezbollah grew one step after the other. The enemy thought it could defeat it by killing its leaders, by destruction and harm to civilians but it was unable to hurt Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic Jihad and other movements', Khamenei said. An official close to Hezbollah told the AFP earlier that Nasrallah had been temporarily buried in a secret location fearing Israel would target a large funeral. 'Hassan Nasrallah has been temporarily buried until the circumstances allow for a public funeral,' the source said. The Iranian regime came under criticism after Nasrallah's assassination for failing to respond to Israeli attacks including the killing of senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last July. Friday's appearance was the first time in four years that the Supreme leader chose to lead prayers in Tehran, after the assassination of Quds force commander Qasem Soleimani by the United States, and his speech in Arab made clear that it was directed at Iran's proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. 'Al-Aqsa Flood was the Palestinian's natural right,' he said referring to the massacre on October 7. 'Defense of the people of Lebanon, and Gaza is legitimate and no one can have the right to condemn it. So was the latest Iranian operation,' he said. He then addressed the Hezbollah's armed terrorists and said defense of that country was the duty of all Muslims. 'The bloodshed must not weaken your resolve. The resistance will not back down because of the death of its people, and victory will be hers.' Khamenei said the U.S. aims to turn Israel into the source of energy for the West and to import Western goods into the Middle East. 'Reality shows us that all the attacks against our enemies are a service to the entire region and to humanity.'

Israel attacks Lebanon civilian border crossing to Syria	IDF says after Hezbollah-run crossings are attacked late last month, Masnaa crossing run by government becomes primary source of arms flowing for into Lebanon for use by terror group Israeli strikes sealed off Lebanon's main border crossing with Syria early on Friday, hours after an intense Israeli attack on Beirut's southern suburbs that is thought to have targeted the heir apparent to Hezbollah's slain secretary general. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen Network said traffic at the Masnaa crossing, going both ways across the border, which had seen some 300,000 people, mostly Syrians, flee Lebanon to Syria, was stopped. Lebanese Transportation Minister Ali Hamieh said the attack near the border crossing created a large crater forcing people to walk across the frontier. Israeli officials said that the crossing was used to bring in arms for Hezbollah although weapons will likely still make their way across the border to replenish the arsenal of the Iran-backed terror group after much of its armaments were destroyed in Israeli attacks. IDF Arabic language spokesperson Major Avichay Adaree said that since Israel attacked Hezbollah run border crossings late last month, which were the main access point for weapons, the Masnaa border, operated by the Lebanese government and used by civilians, has been the primary source of weapons being brought into Lebanon. The military returned to strike heavy machinery that was brought in to repair the crossings that were attacked. 'Hezbollah's 4400 unit began transporting weapons, we believe is for use in South Lebanon,' Adaree said. 'We attacked a truck carrying weapons on Wednesday and it was full of armaments, judging by the secondary explosions, we saw,' he said.

The strike described as powerful comes soon after IDF's Arabic Language spokesperson Major Avichay Adaree, warns residents of the area to quickly evacuate to safety if they were near Hezbollah infrastructure or assets Air Force fighter jets dropped some 73 tons of bombs on the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut, the Dahieh, overnight in the strike targeting the presumptive new leader-to-be of the terror group Hashem Safieddine. According to a report in the New York Times, a high-level meeting of senior members of Hezbollah had been taking place in an underground bunker there when the strike occurred. Officials in Israel believe Hashem Safieddine, designated to replace slain Hassan Nasrallah, may have been in the bunker that was attacked although his fate early on Saturday, remains unknown. Military officials said the targeted attacks on Hezbollah leaders, disrupt the terror group's ability to re-arm and command its troops to action. The strike that began close to midnight on Thursday was described as powerful and came soon after IDF's Arabic Language spokesperson Major Avichay Adaree, warned residents of the area to quickly evacuate to safety if they were near Hezbollah infrastructure or assets. A source close to Hezbollah said the IDF strike formed a ring of fire around the targeted area and at least 11 waves of bombings took place, one after the other. More strikes on the Dahieh were reported in the later overnight hours. Rescue operations continued throughout the morning.

Rescued Yazidi captive says life in Gaza unbearable	Fawzia Amin kidnapped as a child by ISIS and trafficked to Gaza tells reporters of her horrific journey; had contacted Israeli reporter asking for help Yazidi woman Fawzia Amin, who was rescued from Gaza told CNN that she was kidnapped as a child when ISIS captured Iraq's northern city of Sinjar and since then was trafficked across several counties over the next few years. 'We ended up in Al-Hol camp [in Syria] before we were smuggled to Idlib in 2019, and from there, we went to Turkey. In 2020, they arranged a passport for me in Turkey so I could fly from Istanbul to Hurghada, Egypt, and then to Gaza,' she said. For the past year, she had been in the southern part of the Gaza Strip in Rafah where life, she said was unbearable until she was rescued. 'Hamas constantly harassed me due to my Yazidi background and contact with my family, even going so far as to format my phone during their investigations,' she said. Amin contacted Roi Kais, an Israeli journalist with Kan Broadcasting Authority, and sent him a photo of her fake I.D. identifying her as Mariam Mohamed. She said she had been abducted by a group she could not name and was in Mouassi in Khan Younis, on her own. To show she was there she then turned her camera on the destruction around her that she said was caused by Israeli attacks and asked for help to get out of there. She asked Kais not to report on her story. According to the IDF, her rescue marks a complex political-diplomatic process carried out with the aid of Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). Fawzia was taken from her home in Iraq to Syria after she was kidnapped, where she was purchased by a Palestinian ISIS supporter who brought her to Gaza. She was forced to bear his children, and he later returned to Syria, where he was reportedly killed in an attack. However, the terrorist’s family continued to hold the woman hostage until her recent release. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sido’s release, now 21 years old, noting that it was carried out 'via a joint effort with the international intelligence service,' without mentioning Israel's role or the fact she was held in Gaza. According to Iraq’s foreign ministry, the release was coordinated 'in close collaboration with the U.S. embassies in Baghdad and Amman, as well as Jordanian authorities, after over four months of efforts and monitoring.' The ministry also mentioned that Sido was moved between several countries before being released. Her family said they were able to be in contact with her and that she told them she was in Gaza but claimed she had been brainwashed and asked them to leave her there. The Israeli Foreign Ministry’s digital diplomacy division head David Saranga announced the rescue on Thursday and said, 'Fauzia was held captive by a Palestinian Hamas-ISIS member for years. Now, she has reunited with her family. Her story is a reminder of the cruelty faced by Yazidi children who were taken by force. Some 101 Israelis are still held hostage in Gaza.'

US President Biden does not believe there will be 'all-out-war' i...	I think we can avoid it. But there is a lot to do yet, a lot to do yet,' Biden tells reporters as global oil prices surge, amid traiders concern over potential supply disruptions U.S. President Joe Biden said he did not believe there is going to be an 'all-out war' in the Middle East, as Israel weighs options for retaliation after Tehran's largest-ever assault on its arch-enemy. However, Biden said more needed to be done to avoid a Middle East war, as Israel's military hit Beirut with new air strikes in its battle against Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Asked by reporters in Washington on Thursday how confident he was that such a war could be averted, Biden said, 'How confident are you it's not going to rain? Look, I don't believe there is going to be an all-out war. I think we can avoid it. But there is a lot to do yet, a lot to do yet.' While the United States, the European Union, and other allies have called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire in the Israel-Lebanon conflict, Biden said the U.S. was discussing with Israel its options for responding to Tehran's assault, which included Israel striking Iran's oil facilities. 'We're discussing that,' Biden told reporters. His comments contributed to a surge in global oil prices, and rising Middle East tension has made traders worry about potential supply disruptions. 'There is nothing going to happen today,' Biden added. Asked later if he was urging Israel not to attack Iran's oil installations, Biden said he would not negotiate in public. On Wednesday, the president said he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites. A U.S. official said Washington did not believe Israel had decided yet how to respond to Iran. Israel says its operations in Lebanon seek to allow tens of thousands of its citizens to return home after Hezbollah bombardments during the Gaza war forced them to evacuate from its north. Early on Friday, Lebanon's health ministry said 27 people were killed and 151 wounded over the prior day. Hezbollah says it has repelled several land operations by Israeli troops, with measures such as ambushes and direct clashes. The group said it killed 17 Israeli military personnel in combat in southern Lebanon on Thursday, citing its field and security sources. Israeli forces did not comment on the claim.

Israeli strikes on Beirut target potential new Hezbollah chief	Israeli officials tell U.S. media outlets attacks on Hezbollah's stronghold in the Lebanese capital were to go after Hashem Safieddine in an underground bunker after residents urged to leave the area The Air Force conducted targeted strikes on Hezbollah's stronghold in the Dahieh sector of Beirut overnight, targeting Hashem Safieddine, rumored successor to its assassinated leader Hassan Nasrallah, in an underground bunker, according to reports. After warning residents in the area to evacuate, The IDF bombed an underground bunker using bunker-busting munitions, to eliminate him. Arab media reports claimed Safieddine. His fate remains unknown. Designated as Nasrallah’s successor since the 1990s, Safieddine was brought back to Beirut from his studies in Iran to head Hezbollah’s Executive Council just two years after Nasrallah assumed leadership. He is also related by marriage to Qassem Soleimani, the former commander of Iran’s Quds Force, who was killed by a U.S. strike in 2020. Safieddine, on the U.S. terror list since 2017, has managed Hezbollah’s education system, finances and foreign investments, leaving military and strategic matters to Nasrallah. He has maintained close ties with Tehran and supports the Iranian regime, with his brother Abdullah serving as Hezbollah’s envoy to Iran. Saudi Arabia's Al Hadath channel reported on Monday that Hezbollah's Shura Council has chosen Hashem Safieddine as the organization's new secretary-general.

Israeli jets strikes in West Bank city of Tulkarem	Israeli fighter jet targeted a house with terrorists following a parade for a recently released prisoner; Among the dead was the commander of the terror organization in the Tulkarm refugee camp The IDF carried an airstrike on Thursday targeting a house with terrorists in the West Bank city of Tulkarm. According to Palestinian reports, 16 people were killed in the attack, including Raed Radwan, the commander of the terror group in the Tulkarm refugee camp. Palestinians claimed that shortly before the strike, a parade had been held for a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, who had been released from Israeli prison after 20 years. The event was attended by many armed individuals. This is the first airstrike in Tulkarm by a fighter jet since the Second Intifada. Until now, in the few instances where the IDF has used airstrikes in the West Bank, they targeted Jenin and Nablus. In August, the head of the terror group in the Nur Shams refugee camp, Mohammed Jaber (Abu Shujaa), was killed. He had been involved in multiple attacks, including the June attack in Qalqilya that killed Amnon Mukhtar, 67. Jaber commanded around 30 terrorists in the camp. Security officials have noted a significant difference between the popularity of terrorists on social media, particularly those from refugee camps, and their relatively low level of local support. For terror groups, social media is a crucial tool for glorifying attackers and recruiting young followers. The most recent IDF airstrike in Jenin was in May, targeting a terror operations center. Islam Khamaiseh, a wanted terrorist, was killed in that strike. For years, since the end of Operation Defensive Shield, the IDF refrained from airstrikes in the West Bank. However, due to the surge in terror attacks last year — even before the current war — that policy has shifted, and aerial targeted killings in the area have resumed.

We won't let Hezbollah resettle on the border' IDF chief says	IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi says the main goal of the Lebanon operation is to establish security in the north and allow the returning of the residents to their homes after over a year of being displaced During the holiday on Thursday, IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, conducted a situational assessment at the command centers of the IDF’s 98th and 36th Divisions, both of which are currently operating in southern Lebanon. In his remarks, Halevi said: 'Throughout the holiday, the IDF continues to operate intensely in Lebanon and in other arenas. I met with the commanders and soldiers of the 98th Division and the 36th Division, who are operating in Lebanon for a very important mission — establishing security in the north and returning the residents to their homes after over a year of being displaced.' 'Returning the residents means destroying the terrorist infrastructure Hezbollah has built near the border so they could raid our communities and kill Israeli civilians when given the order. We are very determined to destroy this infrastructure and eliminate anyone present there. We will not allow Hezbollah to settle in these places. The damage to Hezbollah in all sectors — Beirut, the Beqaa Valley, and southern Lebanon — will continue.' 'Our troops in Lebanon are eliminating more and more terrorists — every encounter ends with us having the upper hand. Our troops are more prepared and trained than ever, bearing the experience from the operations in Gaza, and their advantage in the combat arena is clear. The troops are supported by aerial and ground firepower capabilities, and they are operating courageously. 'I heard the initial findings from the battles in which we lost brave soldiers who fell heroically while fighting Hezbollah terrorists. I saw commanders who advanced in the face of fire, leading their soldiers forward, and courageously defeating the enemy. We will continue to fight in light of the heroism of these soldiers, and we will support and embrace their beloved families. 'Today, I also met with the reservists, who left their homes, families, and jobs and are here with us, bringing much experience, knowledge, and a strong spirit. I have great appreciation for the reservists, the soldiers, and the commanders in regular duty, as well as for their families. 'We will continue to operate across active arenas to bring greater security to the State of Israel as we begin the new year of 5785.'

Drug sale flyers distributed in schools across Tel Aviv	Parents in Tel Aviv discovered that flyers offering a menu of drugs for quick orders were distributed in many schools; 'The children also received messages from blocked numbers' says coordinator of the high school forum at the Tel Aviv-Yafo Parents' Committee Drug sale flyers were found in several schools across Tel Aviv, offering a list and prices for a quick order of various drugs. The list included cocaine, 2C-B psychedelic drugs, ketamine, and ecstasy. After several children brought the flyers home to ask their parents about them, alarmed parents reached out to the city council and the police, revealing that this is a widespread issue. 'This is not just a phenomenon in Tel Aviv; it's happening all over the country,' said Shira Imraglik, coordinator of the high school forum at the Tel Aviv-Yafo Parents' Committee. 'We've been contacted by dozens of parents from across Tel Aviv. Flyers were distributed at school entrances, in nearby parks, and at community centers. It spread from child to child. In addition to the physical flyers, children are receiving messages on WhatsApp from anonymous numbers. This is a life-threatening issue that could lead children into serious drug trafficking or use. Parents were horrified.' According to her, 'The person behind the phone number on these specific flyers was quickly apprehended by the police, but we know that drug trafficking continues to take place around schools. Couriers are coming on bikes and exploiting the naivety of children.' The Israel Police stated, 'The Israel Police is actively combating the scourge of drugs in all its aspects, utilizing all available means and resources across various platforms to ensure the safety and health of citizens, especially young people.'

Heroic Egoz commandos Lebanon battle thwarted abduction of fallen...	The Egoz troops stormed to a building and engaged in point-blank combat to prevent any possibility of an abduction; This scenario was trained for years to counter such incidents in Lebanon, especially during preparations for ground operations Initial details from the intense combat in southern Lebanon early Wednesday revealed that Egoz commandos stormed a building to engage Hezbollah terrorists at close range, aiming to prevent any potential abduction. At the same time, Israeli air forces targeted vehicles from Hezbollah's Radwan unit, which were approaching the site—likely in an attempt to capture the fallen soldier's body. Shortly after the initial clash inside the building where the battle began, one of the fallen soldiers was lying near surviving Hezbollah terrorists. Fearing the body might be taken, the soldiers quickly encircled the building. The fallen soldier’s comrades stormed the building, engaging in close combat with the terrorists. Meanwhile, Egoz Unit's drone team identified reinforcement vehicles from the Radwan unit approaching, possibly to seize the body and escape. The vehicles were struck by air, and the terrorists inside were neutralized. For years, Israeli forces have trained for combat scenarios in Lebanon, including the threat of soldier abductions, especially during preparations for ground operations. Hezbollah has long viewed abductions as a potential strategic achievement in its battles with Israel. Consequently, specific guidelines were given to the soldiers, outlining how to respond to such scenarios under all circumstances—both during advances and in direct combat with terrorists. These procedures were thoroughly tested by IDF 'red teams' tasked with simulating abductions during Lebanon-related drills. In Wednesday's Egoz battle, weather conditions were harsh, with heavy fog and complete darkness. The Israeli Air Force bombarded nearby routes and buildings, including a mosque where some of the terrorists had fled. The mosque was destroyed, with at least 30 terrorists killed in the strike. Around 30 Israeli soldiers were wounded in the battle, and at least four injured soldiers continued to fight. The fallen Egoz soldiers are Captain Harel Etinger, 23, from Eli, and Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, from Modi'in Maccabim Re'ut, both served as squad commanders in the elite Egoz Unit of the Commando Brigade; Sergeant First Class Noam Barzilay, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir Tzur Yigal, Sergeant First Class Or Mantzur, 21, from Beit Aryeh-Ofarim, and Sergeant First Class Nazaar Itkin, 21, from Kiryat Ata, all soldiers in the Egoz Unit; Captain Itai Ariel Giat, 23, from Shoham, an officer in the Yahalom Unit of the Combat Engineering Corps.

'It’s in tunnels and rooms like these, the Israelis say they are finding Iranian weapons that were smuggled first to Syria and then into southern Lebanon,' Yingst said while walking through the tunnel which he said is located less than a kilometer from the Israeli border. According to him, soldiers who walked ahead of him had to cross minefields and navigate difficult terrain to reach it. 'Our war is not with the Lebanese civilians,' one of the soldiers inside the tunnel told the Fox News reporter. 'Our war is with Hezbollah, who after the 7th of October began firing almost 10,000 rockets at Israeli civilians. Unlike them, we do not target civilians, we target terrorist infrastructures.' The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit addressed the overnight operation, saying, 'The IAF, with the direction of the IDF Northern Command, struck approximately 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in Lebanese territory, including terrorist infrastructure sites, terrorists, weapons storage facilities, observation posts, and additional terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon.'

Foreign Ministry says Fawzia Amin Sido was taken captive at 11 and sold to terror group supporter in Gaza, where she was held for 10 years before being reunited with her family Fawzia Amin Sido, 21, a young Yazidi woman kidnapped from her home in Iraq by Islamic State terrorists in 2014 when she was just 11 years old, was rescued from Gaza by IDF forces and reunited with her family in her home country. The woman’s rescue marks a complex political-diplomatic process after which Sido was released after ten years in captivity with the aid of Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). According to various reports, Fawzia was taken from her home in Iraq to Syria after she was kidnapped, where she was purchased by a Palestinian ISIS supporter who brought her to Gaza. She was forced to bear his children, and he later returned to Syria, where he was reportedly killed in an attack. However, the terrorist’s family continued to hold the woman hostage until her recent release. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sido’s release, now 21 years old, noting that it was carried out 'via a joint effort with the international intelligence service,' without mentioning Israel's role or the fact she was held in Gaza. According to Iraq’s foreign ministry, the release was coordinated 'in close collaboration with the U.S. embassies in Baghdad and Amman, as well as Jordanian authorities, after over four months of efforts and monitoring.' The ministry also mentioned that Sido was moved between several countries before being released. The Israeli Foreign Ministry’s digital diplomacy division head David Saranga announced the rescue on Thursday and said, 'Fauzia was held captive by a Palestinian Hamas-ISIS member for years.

A year of war: Israel's struggles and triumphs on multiple fronts	Failures of October 7 yet to be investigated; with 101 hostages in captivity, political dawdling on Gaza's future and displaced northern residents, uncertainty persists; yet the IDF’s recovery offers hope; a look back to a year that changed everything I’m optimistic this Rosh Hashana because of the tremendous motivation demonstrated by the masses who wanted to fight alongside the Gaza border region residents and rescue them from the inferno on October 7. I’m optimistic because of the motivation of regular and reservist soldiers I’ve seen in all the fighting sectors; because of the civilian general public’s motivation to help the wounded and conserve the Third Temple as a Jewish and democratic state. My long years of experience reporting wars have proven to me, beyond doubt, that the winner is the side that’s motivated, and determined to fight to live. So, I believe we’ll be here for generations to come. A year on since October 7, 2023, and the best comfort, perhaps the best medicine, is the rapid recovery, within hours or days, of Israel’s civilian population and the IDF from the shock and rage. Hundreds of reservists and civilians on that terrible Shabbat were driven by grief and horror to come to the aid of the communities under attack. Along with the IDF’s faltering response, this was Israel’s counterattack against the two commando divisions Hamas sent into Israeli territory. Were it not for this counterattack by security squads, IDF special forces units, at their own initiative running into fire, civilians who took up weapons and came from great distances to help the Gaza Periphery residents, the disaster could have been many times worse. Hamas could have conquered considerable territory in the south and the losses, horrors and damage immeasurably greater. But the lessons of October 7 and the failures that led to it should be left to the IDF’s authorized commissions of inquiry. We’re still in the midst of the Iron Swords war, referred to by some as an existential war, and from a strategic perspective, the ability to exist in the region as a sovereign Jewish state, it is indeed an existential war. So, it’s worth trying to understand where Israel has succeeded and where, somewhat less. In A Year of War, a series of articles for Rosh Hashana, Ynet surveys the results of the war to this point, starting with the terrible failure, through the achievements and mistakes, through to the picture right now. ******************************************************************************************* After October 7: The IDF's six successes that shaped the war Following the military's colossal failure during Hamas' attack on southern Israel, it quickly recuperated and acted decisively against Israel's enemies; these are its greatest achievements so far READ HERE ******************************************************************************************* The IDF’s five major setbacks following October 7 Over 60,000 Israelis remain internally displaced by Hezbollah, revealing the army's struggle to fight on two fronts; meanwhile, Hamas still holds hostages, with Sinwar rejecting every proposal as he hopes for a regional war that will shift the balance in his favor READ HERE ******************************************************************************************* Israel’s complex battle across multiple fronts since October 7 Reeling from the Hamas massacre, the IDF focused on Gaza while gradually wearing down Hezbollah in the north before launching a ground offensive; meanwhile, Israel works to contain West Bank unrest, as Iran’s assault presents new regional opportunities READ HERE ******************************************************************************************* The IDF’s four force multipliers after October 7 Amid harsh war in Gaza and growing conflagration on the northern border, the military counted on four critical components to bolster itself READ HERE Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by9kge2cr	2024-10-03T03:48:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/BJKNKwYCC/BJKNKwYCC_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

IDF, Shin Bet confirm Sinwar confidant Rawhi Mushtaha eliminated	Military says precise strike in Gaza eliminated Hamas' government head in the enclave alongside two other senior terror group officials The IDF and Shin Bet confirmed on Thursday that the terrorist Rawhi Mushtaha, who headed Hamas’ government in the Gaza Strip, was eliminated in a joint strike in the enclave. Two other terrorists, Sameh al-Siraj who held the security portfolio on Hamas' politburo and Hamas' Labor Committee — and Sami Oudeh, commander of Hamas' General Security Mechanism were also killed. 'IAF fighter jets struck and eliminated the terrorists while they were hiding in a fortified and equipped underground compound in the northern Gaza Strip. The compound served as a Hamas command and control center and enabled senior operatives to remain inside of it for extended periods of time,' the IDF and Shin Bet said in a statement. 'The compound was managed by senior members of Hamas' General Security Mechanism and functioned as a hideout for the Hamas leadership, led by Mushtaha.' Hamas hasn’t officially announced the officials’ death in order to avoid lowering the morale of its operatives, as it did with the cases of Mohammad Deif and other eliminations in Gaza. 'Rawhi Mushtaha was one of Hamas' most senior operatives and had a direct impact on decisions relating to Hamas' force deployment. Mushtaha was involved in military decisions while also acting as the Head of Hamas Civil Governance in the Gaza Strip and holding the Prisoners Affairs Portfolio. He also formerly held the finance portfolio,' the military added. Mushtaha served a 22-year prison sentence in Israel before being released in the Gilad Shalit release deal in 2011. He was arrested by Israel for his involvement in the abduction of two IDF soldiers in 1988. 'Mushtaha, alongside Yahya Sinwar, established Hamas' General Security Mechanism. They served a prison sentence together in an Israeli jail. Mushtaha was considered to be the most senior figure in the Hamas political bureau in the Gaza Strip, and during the war maintained civil control of the Hamas regime, while simultaneously engaging in terrorist activity against Israel. Mushtaha was Sinwar's right-hand man and one of his closest associates,' the IDF and Shin Bet’s statement read. 'The IDF and ISA will continue to pursue all of the terrorists responsible for the October 7th massacre and will operate against anyone who threatens the State of Israel.'

IDF eliminates 60 terrorists across Lebanon in air, ground operat...	Military reports it targeted over 200 Hezbollah assets across Lebanon in overnight ground and air operation including in Bint Jbeil The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Thursday that air and ground units targeted Bint Jbeil’s municipality complex and eliminated 15 Hezbollah terrorists inside it overnight. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization systematically violates international law, while brutally exploiting government and civilian buildings as well as the population as human shields for terrorist activity, in order to harm IDF soldiers and the civilians of the State of Israel,' the military said in a statement. 'The IAF, with the direction of the IDF Northern Command, struck approximately 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in Lebanese territory, including terrorist infrastructure sites, terrorists, weapons storage facilities, observation posts, and additional terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon,' it added. The IDF also added Air Force fighter jets targeted 'terrorists who fired missiles yesterday toward the area of the Ramim Ridge alongside terrorists who fired projectiles at IDF soldiers operating in southern Lebanon.' 'Furthermore, IDF soldiers identified terrorists that launched projectiles toward additional IDF soldiers operating in southern Lebanon. The IAF swiftly struck and eliminated the terrorists,' the military said. 'This morning, over the past few hours, two Hezbollah terrorists fired at soldiers from the Golani Brigade operating in the area. The IAF swiftly struck the terrorists and no IDF injuries were reported.' The strike comes after Lebanese reports said the IDF struck central Beirut Thursday overnight, killing at least 46 terrorists.

The IDF’s four force multipliers after October 7	Recap: Amid harsh war in Gaza and growing conflagration on the northern border, the military counted on four critical components to bolster itself 1. Israeli Air Force: The Israeli Air Force's systems and capabilities have remained the primary factor enabling Israel to handle a multi-front war successfully for nearly a year. This includes strategic levels (repelling Iran's missile attack and carrying out strikes in Yemen), operational levels (executing strikes in Gaza and pushing Radwan forces away from the northern border), and tactical levels (eliminating a terrorist cell that planted an explosive on a busy road near Tulkarm). It's important to stress the almost unimaginable interception capabilities of Israel’s air defense systems, which protect the home front and give lawmakers flexibility in reaching operational decisions. Another noteworthy point is the Air Force headquarters' ability to plan and execute quality operations in record time based on emerging military intelligence. Examples include the elimination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in his Beirut bunker and the strikes in Yemen. An equally significant achievement was the management of ammunition and resources, allowing Israel to maintain diplomatic freedom of action even in cases of disagreements with the U.S. There are two critical lessons from the Air Force's outstanding success: first, the Air Force must continue to rely on advanced, manned fighter jets and helicopters for the coming years. Drones are important but can't provide the same flexibility and diverse operational options as a manned air fleet. The second conclusion is that the Air Force must be closely involved in border defense, as it currently operates alongside ground forces in Gaza and the northern border. The large forces now defending the borders must include an integral air support. 2. The Intelligence Corps: Over the past year, especially following October 7’s failures, the IDF intelligence target gathering unit has stood out. Its deployed array, alongside the Shin Bet, has provided high-quality, detailed and reliable strategic and tactical intelligence. The intelligence network delivers information to the firepower and ground units, directing operations both above and below ground. The effective cooperation between the Shin Bet and the Military Intelligence Directorate, which has grown tighter, produced human intelligence of a quantity and quality that contributed significantly to defeating Hamas. This was crucial not only in locating key underground tunnel shafts but also in supporting efforts to free hostages and recover bodies. This cooperation likely stemmed from a shared sense of guilt among the leadership of both agencies over the failures that led to the massacre. 3. Combat engineers and special units: During the war in Gaza, combat engineers, along with special forces from both compulsory and reserve units became a significant force multiplier by destroying Gaza's main underground fighting systems. IDF Southern Command Chief Major General Yaron Finkelman realized that Hamas and Islamic Jihad would retain the ability to wage endless guerrilla warfare even after their battalions were dismantled and half their terrorists were killed should these abilities remain in place. The challenge was identifying the correct tunnel shaft through military intelligence, descending into it without soldiers being harmed by explosives or ambushes, and then moving through the tunnel to uncover what's inside — documents, computers, command posts, money and other items that could advance the release of hostages. Along the way, forces had to deal with thick metallic blast doors, explosives and rigged explosives. Combat engineers and special units continue to operate in this manner in an accelerated manner. 'We're seeing this mission through,' said Southern Command's combat engineering chief COL Avshalom Dadon several months ago. 'We can almost see the end but it'll take some time. You need to be careful and act according to guidelines when it comes to combat engineering operations above and below ground, or people could get killed.' 4. Advanced technology: The war saw massive and intensive use of advanced technologies across all fronts —from tiny drones that identified Hamas terrorists hiding in rooms and planting explosives, to sophisticated radars and various robots that enabled special forces to fight underground successfully. Moreover, intelligence flows directly from the IDF Intelligence Corps forces on the field. This gains importance given the previous criticism of over-reliance on technology before October 7. It was then thought that technological means could replace a strong, manned military presence to protect the border. Israel in this war saw that technology was a blessing if used correctly. Ultimately, it's the people who determine victory or defeat. This reliance on technology was key to the phenomenal military successes of Operation Northern Arrows. Such achievements wouldn’t have been possible without advanced technology.

Israel’s complex battle across multiple fronts since October 7	Recap: Reeling from Hamas massacre, the IDF focused on Gaza while gradually wearing down Hezbollah in the north before launching a ground offensive; meanwhile, Israel works to contain West Bank unrest, as Iran’s assault presents new regional opportunities Gaza: An offensive rollercoaster The IDF's ground offensive in Gaza, initially slow but later accelerated, has been both a success and a source of frustration for field commanders. It is now clear as day that without a ground incursion, it would have been impossible to dismantle the threat. This is primarily because Hamas had a strategic advantage it built for itself in the form of underground tunnel networks, where it hid, fired rockets, produced weapons and managed its war operations. The IDF knew these networks were not necessarily measured by miles but by 'strategic centers of gravity.' As long as these remained intact, Hamas could survive. And as long as it survived, it could recover and launch another attack on Israel. The above-ground structures, located within civilian areas, were also built as regional centers of gravity. The IDF needed to physically reach these sites to eliminate the terrorists operating from them, who defended the shafts leading to the underground. The IDF launched an operation involving three divisions fighting in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. A senior IDF commander remarked, 'If you don’t initiate and attack, at best, you end up with a draw.' This was not a decision made lightly. In the weeks following the massacre, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with various former officials, including retired Major General Yitzhak Brik, who warned him that the IDF was unprepared and incapable of carrying out the mission, which would result in thousands of casualties. The Americans also tried to caution Netanyahu and the IDF General Staff that a ground offensive in Gaza would not only result in losses but would also lead to destruction that Israel would struggle to withstand in the face of global public opinion. What tipped the scales was the insistence of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Operations Directorate Commander Major General Oded Basiuk. They convinced decision-makers that after several weeks of preparation, the IDF would be capable of executing a successful offensive to take control of Gaza, dismantle Hamas' military capabilities and then maintain the achievement through a security perimeter along the Palestinian enclave’s edges and targeted raids on areas where Hamas would attempt to rebuild its forces. The motivation, initiative, rapid mobilization and combat readiness displayed by both the reserves and regular ground forces during the preparation period boosted the confidence of the IDF's top brass, who had been demoralized by the sense of responsibility they felt for the failures of October 7. For the sake of caution, they decided to adhere to the IDF's traditional operational concept—attacking one main front, the center of gravity, while holding off on others. This approach was taken despite the fact that the Air Force could have divided its strength and operated with full force in both the north and the south, as initially planned. Historians will ultimately decide whether the decision to act in Gaza while holding off in the north, and evacuating residents, was justified. But it clearly ensured an efficient use of the IDF's assaulting forces and a prudent management of the military’s stockpile of munitions and equipment. During the waiting period for the ground offensive, the IDF—together with the Shin Bet—refined its tactical approach for coordinating ground and air forces to operate effectively in a large, vertical battlefield, fighting both above and below ground. In the opening phase, it was decided to attack along several axes with tank battalions, infantry and engineering units, closely coordinated with air and ground fire support. One of the innovations was the immediate availability of air support—whether from fighter jets, drones or helicopters—at every stage of the battle, supporting both mounted and foot soldiers. The Air Force was integrated from the planning stages through to the ground combat. Precision munitions of various sizes were dropped on buildings and compounds where intelligence identified enemy forces, sometimes just 100 meters from IDF troops. In thousands of sorties and strikes, there were four cases of friendly fire that injured IDF soldiers. The simultaneous assault on the terrorists' centers of gravity, both above and below ground, initially progressed slowly. The IDF had already informed the political leadership that dismantling the terrorist armies built by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad over decades would take about a year, but the slow pace—especially with the aid of the Engineering Corps’ D9 bulldozers—frustrated some field commanders early on. The underground operations, in particular, advanced heavily and sluggishly. On the other hand, the above-ground fighting unfolded far more effectively and quickly, following the Air Force’s intense so-called 'belt of fire' strikes on high-rise buildings and Hamas resistance hubs before the ground offensive even began. Initially, Hamas battalions emerged from tunnels and launched large-scale counterattacks on the advancing forces, using new types of deadly RPG launchers and proximity explosives attached by militants to tanks and armored vehicles. However, the Trophy active protection systems proved their worth and reduced casualties. Counterattacks—such as at the Force 17 outpost in the Jabalia area and elsewhere—failed. Afterward, terrorists shifted to small-unit tactics, emerging from tunnel shafts to attack, but these proved far less effective. The relatively low number of IDF casualties during the fighting in Gaza and the north was due not only to the protection provided by the armored vehicles and the Trophy systems but also to the defensive tactics the IDF employed. Crucially, rapid evacuation—coupled with life-saving medical care—played a significant role in reducing the toll. A total of 346 IDF soldiers fell during the ground offensive in Gaza, out of 715 killed in the entire war. Some 4,481 were wounded, including 2,298 in Gaza; of those, 20 remain hospitalized in serious condition, 145 in moderate condition and four with minor injuries. The five-phased plan in the north It is now known that for several days, Hassan Nasrallah seriously considered capitalizing on the momentum and shock caused by Hamas' attack to execute Hezbollah's operation to conquer the Galilee, led by the terrorist group's elite Radwan Force. Hezbollah has been planning this operation for at least ten years, and by October 8, 2023, they had 2,400 Radwan fighters and 500 Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives ready for action, heavily armed with explosives to breach concrete walls and fences, as well as ladders for scaling into border-adjacent Israeli communities and IDF outposts in the north. Had this plan been carried out, it would have been catastrophic—far worse than Hamas' attack. However, the rapid deployment of three IDF divisions to the northern border and the efficient defensive preparations, despite the IDF’s primary focus on Gaza, likely caused Nasrallah and Hezbollah’s commanders to decide against exploiting Israel’s confusion and shock following the deadly October 7 attacks in the south. Hezbollah’s plan is prepared, effective and far more dangerous than Hamas’, but the Gazans stole the spotlight. It took a few days for the IDF to be convinced that Nasrallah was content with supporting Hamas through rocket fire and fiery statements of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, despite having the capability to launch a ground invasion into the Galilee. Radwan Force fighters, supported by Hezbollah’s firepower, were positioned right on the border. What also helped restrain Hezbollah was the Israeli Air Force’s readiness for action in the north, as well as the swift deployment of IDF reservists to strategic positions, effectively blocking potential enemy routes. Northern Command faced two primary threats. The most dangerous was the Radwan Force, positioned mere hundreds of feet from Israeli communities and outposts, posing an immediate threat. The second was Hezbollah’s extensive missile arrays, hidden in southern Lebanon and aimed at northern Israel, roughly up to the Haifa-Tiberias line. With the political and military leadership deciding to focus on Gaza as the active front while holding the line in the north, Northern Command, under the guidance of Major General Ori Gordin, formulated a phased action plan. The broad goal was to erode Hezbollah’s strength and prepare the ground for a future operation that would involve aerial bombardments and ground maneuvers, set to launch once the General Staff advised the political echelon to shift the focus from the south. In line with this plan, the IDF initially concentrated on neutralizing the immediate threat posed by the Radwan Force. An additional effort was made to repel infiltration attempts by militant cells from various Palestinian organizations. Since the political and military leadership decided that Gaza would be the active front while the north would be contained, Northern Command, under the guidance of Major General Ori Gordin, developed a phased action plan. The primary goal was to wear down Hezbollah and prepare the ground for a future operation, involving airstrikes and ground operations, to be executed when the General Staff recommended shifting the focus from the south. According to this plan, the IDF first concentrated on eliminating the immediate threat posed by the Radwan Force. Another key effort was repelling infiltration attempts by terrorist cells from various Palestinian organizations. The danger posed by the Radwan Force and the intensified short-range firepower of Hezbollah’s anti-tank missiles and myriad rockets was the reason for the massive evacuation of approximately 60,000 residents from their homes in the Galilee along the border. Some evacuated on orders, while others did so voluntarily. They have yet to return home. In the first phase, Northern Command succeeded in pushing a significant portion of the Radwan Force 3-5 miles away from the border through airstrikes and artillery fire. Hezbollah fighters abandoned their well-fortified positions—some in bunkers and some in trenches—concealed within Lebanon’s mountainous terrain. In the second phase, according to reports, the IDF began sending small ground forces on covert raids into these positions to seize weapons and equipment left behind. Meanwhile, the IDF improved its ability to locate and neutralize Hezbollah's anti-tank missile launchers, forcing them to retreat and reducing their effectiveness. Hezbollah’s attempts to strike with its suicide drones and heavy Burkan and Falaq rockets, based on Nasrallah’s 'eye for an eye' doctrine, met with limited success. In the third phase, alongside efforts to counter drones and rockets, Northern Command focused on eroding Hezbollah’s command and control structure in preparation for a potential ground incursion into Lebanon, possibly reaching the Litani River or beyond. Hezbollah’s field commanders began disappearing in large numbers, as the IDF, using precise intelligence and airstrikes, systematically eliminated them one by one. The fourth phase began in August: Operation Northern Arrows. The opening strike, which stunned Hezbollah and the world, involved the detonation of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies—an action attributed to Israel. But the peak came with the assassination of Nasrallah last Friday. The fifth phase commenced overnight Tuesday this week, with the IDF conducting a limited ground operation aimed at clearing Hezbollah’s rocket-launching sites and Radwan Force positions near the border. The objective is to prevent Hezbollah fighters from launching direct, short-range fire on Israeli border communities and IDF outposts. Once this goal is achieved, the ultimate aim of the war can be pursued: ensuring that the residents of northern Israel can safely return to their homes. West Bank: Avoiding a third Intifada Alongside the fighting in Gaza, Central Command launched an aggressive campaign in the West Bank. The objective was to prevent terrorist groups, inspired by Hamas and Iran, from organizing in refugee camps to attack settlements and targets inside Israel, and to avert the outbreak of a full-scale third Intifada involving the entire West Bank population, which would overwhelm the already stretched IDF forces. This effort has so far been successful. The Iranian offensive: The birth of a regional defense network A significant achievement in the war came during the night of April 13-14, when Iran and its proxies launched a barrage of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and explosive drones at Israel. To repel this attack, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and the IDF General Staff executed a detailed plan that exceeded expectations in its effectiveness. This success laid the groundwork for a potential regional air defense system, which could involve Sunni Arab states in defending against missiles, drones and possibly even Iran's future nuclear capabilities.

Satellite images reveal damage to Israel’s key Air Force base aft...	International outlet presents new photos of Nevatim air base following Iranian missile assault; IDF stresses no damage done to Air Force capabilities Satellite images published released by the international news agency Associated Press (AP) on Thursday revealed the damage caused by Iran's ballistic missile attack on the IDF’s Nevatim air base near Be'er Sheva. The images, taken on Wednesday, show a large hole in the roof of a hangar near the base’s main runway. Debris from the roof is also scattered around the structure. AP noted the IDF has not clarified what caused the damage seen in the images. In addition to the satellite photos, a CNN analysis claimed that missiles launched from Iran struck the Mossad headquarters or near it, as well as Nevatim and the Tel Nof air bases. The IDF confirmed damages were caused to buildings at the bases but stressed that there were no casualties and no aircraft were hit. The attack didn’t affect the Israeli Air Force's operational integrity, as missions could be launched immediately after the assault. A dramatic video recorded on the night of the attack in the Negev Desert — near Nevatim base, which according to foreign reports was targeted by Iran alongside other Air Force bases —showed multiple missile strikes in quick succession. Nevatim, the largest and most critical Air Force base in Israel, was also one of the primary targets of Iran's previous attack in April. The base, located east of Be'er Sheva, hosts three F-35 fighter jet squadrons, as well as transport squadrons operating Super Hercules and Hercules aircraft. It is also home to the Wing of Zion, Israel’s state aircraft.

Salha, who was released as part of the Gilad Shalit release deal in 2011, is remembered for his role in the brutal lynching of IDF reservists Vadim Nurzhitz and Yosef Avrahami in October 2000 in Ramallah, when he presented his bloodied hands outside of a window. On October 12, 2000, Nurzhitz and Avrahami mistakenly entered Ramallah on their way to a military base near the West Bank, instead of bypassing the city through the Hizma checkpoint. As soon as they entered the Palestinian city, they were identified as Israelis by their yellow license plates and a Palestinian mob began pelting their vehicle with stones and attacking them. At one point, they were stuck in a traffic jam, preventing them from driving away. Palestinian policemen took them to the Al-Bireh police station, all while threatening them with rifles. Along the way, the reservists were subjected to brutal violence by the mob, with no attempt by the officers to protect them. Even when the reservists arrived at the police station, the crowd gathered outside, demanding to pull them out and murder them. Eventually, the doors were opened and the crowd, along with Palestinian policemen, beat the two men to death with extreme violence. Their bodies were then thrown into the street, where further abuse continued. Salha, originally from the village of Deir Jarir near Ramallah, admitted during his 2001 arrest that he was part of the mob that stormed the police station and strangled one of the soldiers while others beat him. When he saw his hands covered in the soldiers' blood, he went to the window and proudly displayed them to the crowd below. In 2004, he was convicted of the murder of Corporal Vadim Nurzhitz and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2011, however, he was one of the terrorists released as part of the Shalit release deal.

The IDF’s five major setbacks following October 7	Recap: Over 60,000 Israelis remain displaced by Hezbollah, revealing the army's struggle to fight on two fronts; meanwhile, Hamas still holds hostages, with Sinwar rejecting every proposal as he hopes for a regional war will shift the balance in his favor 1. It’s hard to decide what’s worse: the fact that tens of thousands of residents of the north haven’t been able to return to their homes for almost a year, or the failure of not bringing back the hostages still in Hamas' hands. Either way, in strategic terms, the fact that Hezbollah managed to uproot 60,000 Israelis from their homes and create a broad strip of fire several miles wide along the northern border is a serious failure, unseen since the War of Independence. It has one major root cause: The IDF couldn’t conduct fierce fighting on two fronts. 2. The hostages. The failure isn’t that we haven’t managed to create the conditions and military pressure to make a fanatical religious murderer like Hamas leader Yahyah Sinwar agree to a second deal to release the hostages. I’m not getting into an argument as to whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the security Cabinet missed opportunities for deals, but the basic conditions are rather basic: Hamas can absorb heavy losses such as the destruction of its capabilities and military and civil infrastructure, and still keep functioning as a guerilla organization. Terrorist organizations don’t run a war with clear objectives, and if their forces are seriously harmed, they can’t advance. But terrorist organizations in general, and in Gaza in particular, strive to survive. In this respect, survival in Gaza is victory. This is what Sinwar is going for at this stage, and he’s refusing any deal offered to him. He still believes that a regional war will ease the pressure on him and force Israel, which he believes will be defeated in such a war, to accept his conditions and allow him to restore his, and Hamas’s power. He wants to be like Al Qaida and ISIS, presently restoring themselves under the Taliban in Afghanistan. This is the main reason there’s no hostage deal right now. Sinwar’s views may change or soften in the future in light of the blow dealt to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ongoing successes there - even more so if Iran doesn’t join in the war. Then, he’ll be willing to negotiate a new deal 3. Not managing to bring down Hamas’ civilian control of Gaza and allow Israel to control humanitarian aid going into Gaza would allow the IDF to achieve one of the war’s objectives. This failing is Netanyahu’s and that of the Security Cabinet who have opposed every initiative presented by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the IDF to find ways to set up an alternative civilian government. Netanyahu and his coalition partners from the Religious Zionist and Otzma Yehudit parties oppose collaborating with the Palestinian Authority regarding civilian rule in Gaza on ideological grounds. And right now, there’s no better alternative to Hamas on the horizon. 4. The well-publicized quarrels with the American administrations that have harmed, and continue to harm, deterrence, efforts to release the hostages and the war effort in general. In most cases, both sides are guilty: The Americans for internal election considerations, and due to incorrect international strategy, keep trying to tie Israel’s hands. I’m not talking about agreeing to the humanitarian effort Washington is forced on us. In this respect, U.S. President Joe Biden probably did us a favor, as if Israel had demoed the evacuees, huddled in 'open shelters,' humanitarian aid, our international legitimacy to fight in Gaza and in the north would have completely eroded and we may be facing sanctions by now. But the Americans weren’t satisfied with waving humanitarian aid in the faces of the right-wing coalition parties, but also tried influencing the war’s path by repeatedly demanding a ceasefire, long before the IDF got as far as Rafiah. They tried this by public warnings of hurting the city’s civilian population, despite the IDF proving to them that it could vacate the population before taking control on the ground. But going into Rafiah, mainly because of the Americans, was put off for months, taking the pressure off Sinwar and harming operational success. 5. We haven’t managed to stop the international wave of delegitimization against the just war conducted so that the residents of the north and south of Israel may safely return home, to be free for years to come, of the threat of mortar fire from surrounding terror armies Most Israelis still struggle to understand how world public opinion can have abandoned them, how they’re trying to bind its hands and accuse them of war crimes after the horrors of October 7. They need to be told that this is not only the outcome of Israel’s failure in public diplomacy and simply that Islamic elements arriving as refugees to Western countries have, over the years, taken hold of politics and changed the cultural-academic conversation to one hostile to Israel, even in places Israel had generally been supported since the 1948 War of Independence. The cultural conversation distorting history, portraying Israel as an evil colonial element, spearheading Western imperialism, overlooking the complex historical facts of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is the primary cause of the collapse of legitimacy. Just as Israel found a way to turn things around military in Lebanon, it needs to find a way to turn things around in terms of international legitimacy.

Israel strikes central Beirut 'for first time since 2006'	Military moves to target Hezbollah assets in the center of Lebanon's capital with local reports claiming at least six were killed in attack The IDF struck at the heart of Lebanon’s capital of Beirut Thursday overnight with local reports alleging the attack also involved Israeli warships. It was later reported the military targeted a complex belonging to the Hezbollah-owned Islamic Health Organization with local media saying at least six were killed and seven wounded as a result. CNN reported the attack was the first one executed against the center of the capital since 2006 and added a loud explosion was heard following the strikes. Many families left the area after the incident, according to reports. Three missiles also hit the southern suburb of Dahieh, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, and loud explosions were heard, Lebanese security officials said. The southern suburbs came under more than a dozen IDF strikes on Wednesday. The IDF also struck Baalbek located in eastern Lebanon overnight, with local authorities reporting at least 46 individuals were killed and 86 injured in Wednesday’s attacks. The military urged residents of Lebanese villages who have evacuated their homes not to return until further notice. 'IDF raids are continuing,' spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X on Thursday.

After October 7: The IDF's six successes which shaped the war	Recap: Following the colossal failure of Hamas' attack, the military quickly recuperated and acted decisively against Israel's enemies; these are its greatest achievements so far 1. Firstly, the rapid recovery by the IDF and the civilian population. These recovered within hours, and by October 8, the army and volunteer civilian organizations in all fields were already up and running. The IDF began conducting an organized war to repel Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists still within Israeli territory and volunteer organizations started taking care of evacuees and the reservists who mobilized in droves, mostly without being drafted. They simply showed up. In the first hours and days, the government and its leader weren’t functioning at all, or very partially, and they weren’t responding to the needs of those under attack. At the same time, the IDF felt that Hezbollah would exploit the momentum of Hamas’s success, and also try storming the Galilee and that attention and available IDF forces would have to be divided between the two sectors. All this occurred within days. Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were repelled back to the Gaza Strip and started receiving aerial bombardments and artillery fire. Three, primarily reservist, divisions were deployed on the northern border, from the mountainous Hermon thickets and Har Dov across to Rosh Hanikra in the west. They positioned themselves in defensive formations, protecting Israel from a northern version of the October 7 massacre. I believe the IDF and civilian population’s rapid recovery is far and away this past year’s best achievement. This is what prevented a serious disaster and the slow collapse of the State of Israel. Military theory states that, after absorbing a surprise attack in which the enemy penetrates lines of defense, the defensive army retreats to a second line and prepares for containment. But there was no second line on October 7. The civilian communities were at the front and Israel managed to stop the Hamas attack and avert much worse results along the border. 2. The ground operation above and below ground in Gaza, in which the IAF, special forces units together brought about the dismantling of Hamas and Islamic Jihad’s fighting force. Out of 23 Hamas battalions, only one or two remain in the central camps, where Israel is not operating due to the assessment that most of the hostages are there are two million displaced Gazans living in 'open shelters' in the area. The IDF doesn’t control the entire Gaza Strip, but can move to any area it chooses within hours, sometimes minutes. It can also gather intelligence and deter Hamas military organization almost unimpeded. A static presence in the area could still expose IDF forces to anti-tank missiles and devices left by Hamas as part of guerilla warfare. Rocket fire, however, even mortar shelling, into Israel has almost completely stopped. Hamas has, effectively, ceased being an immediate threat to Israel’s residents as it was before October 7. 3. The dramatic reversal of the Israel-Hezbollah power balance as part of 'Operation Northern Arrows.' The intelligence community, IAF and Northern Command managed to land a series of precision shocks on all Hezbollah power components, believed to have destroyed over half its capabilities of endangering the Israelis in the Northern Galilee in particular, and Israel’s home front in general. These shocking moves, based on precise intelligence provided by the intelligence community were ready for operation some time ahead. They were implemented at the right time, after the weight of the fighting force had been transferred from Gaza where, as mentioned good security control has been achieved. 4. Repelling April 13-14 and October 1 Iranian attacks. Primarily the first practical realization of Israeli-American operational collaboration that proved extremely effective in whose framework, practical infrastructure was laid for a regional defense coalition against the Shiite axis. 5. IDF Central Command, in aggressive operation, managed to avert, at this stage, a third Intifada in Judea and Samaria There have been terrorist attacks, mainly on roads, in and around Jewish communities, but the IDF has raided refugee camps, harming the battalions inside them (with the help of the Air Force and the Yamam Counter-Terrorism Unit) and has managed to maintain an almost normal fabric of life, reducing terrorist attacks, and preventing them from spilling over to within the Green Line. 6. Restoring Israel's and the IDF's general deterrence in the region, particularly against the Iran-led axis. This deterrence, greatly eroded October 7, has been restored thanks to the surprise operations and cognitive blows the intelligence community and the IDF landed on Hezbollah in Lebanon, no less than dismantling Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. The terrible destruction in Gaza, resulting from fighting terrorists from within a civilian population, and the use of explosive devices, constitutes a deterrent to the same extent that it causes public and political to Israel across the world. Deterring the Iranian attack, which produced no results, alongside achievement in the north, has not only restored deterrence but raised it a notch compared to before. Until then, deterrence had been localized, against the countries surrounding us. We’re now talking about regional deterrence with even global implications. The IAF’s surprise attacks in Lebanon have proven how good we are on the offensive. And repelling 200 ballistic missiles on October 1 proves we’re a defense powerhouse too. But we shouldn’t be resting on our laurels.

Biden says US would not support Israeli strike on Iran nuclear si...	U.S. president urges Israel to act 'proportionally' following intense Iranian bombing of country, described attack as 'ineffective' as Jerusalem mulls retaliation U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its missile attack and urged Israel to act 'proportionally.' Biden spoke a day after Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in a move that he previously described as 'ineffective.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack. 'We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us (G7 nations) agree that they have a right to respond but they should respond proportionally,' Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One. Some analysts said Israel's response would likely be sharper than when Iran fired missiles and drones at Israel in April, suggesting this time it could target Tehran's nuclear or oil facilities. Asked whether the U.S. would back any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, Biden told reporters: 'The answer is no.' Biden said more sanctions would be imposed on Iran and that he would speak soon with Netanyahu. 'Obviously, Iran is way off course,' he said. U.S. Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell said the administration was seeking to align its position with Israel on any response to Iran's attack but also recognizes the Middle East is on a 'knife's edge' and a broader escalation could imperil both Israeli and U.S. interests. Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Washington-based think tank Carnegie Endowment, Campbell repeated the U.S. view that what Tehran has undertaken was 'deeply irresponsible' and that there must be a 'return message.' 'I think we tried to underscore our support for some of the actions that Israel has taken,' he added. 'We have real wariness about an extended or substantial ground set of operations in Lebanon,' Campbell said. The Israeli army is locked in combat at its northern border with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters. On Wednesday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed -- the deadliest suffered by Israel's military on the Lebanon front in the past year of border-area clashes between Israel and Hezbollah. Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over, barring further provocation.

3 killed in Israeli airstrike on Damascus, reports say	Targeted building in Syrian capital's Al-Mazzeh neighborhood reportedly often visited by Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders; 2 of victims not Syrian Three people were killed Wednesday afternoon in an airstrike targeting a building in the Al-Mazzeh neighborhood of Damascus, reportedly frequented by Hezbollah commanders and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. According to local reports, two of the victims were non-Syrian. At least four others were wounded in the strike, which hit a three-story building. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition group, reported seven casualties in the attack. The Syrian Defense Ministry confirmed the airstrike occurred at 5:25 p.m., stating that Israel targeted a residential building, killing three civilians and injuring three others, while causing significant damage. Syrian outlet Voice of the Capital reported that the building targeted in the strike was located near a site previously attacked in January, where senior Hezbollah commander Youssef Omayed Dar, also known as 'Haj Sadiq,' and two of his aides were killed. Sources suggested Wednesday's strike was an assassination, though the target remains unknown. Last Friday, Syrian state media reported that five soldiers were killed in an Israeli airstrike near Damascus. The attack, launched from the Golan Heights around 1:35 a.m., targeted a military post near the Syria-Lebanon border. In Lebanon, a drone strike last week reportedly killed three people in southern Lebanon when the drone targeted a vehicle on the Wadi al-Ayoun road between Sarbine and Beit Lif villages. That same night, Israeli airstrikes were reported in several locations in Lebanon, including the village of Jwaya, where multiple casualties were reported. Earlier this month, reports also emerged of an Israeli strike on a vehicle near Damascus International Airport, with several members of the pro-Iranian Iraqi Kataib Hezbollah militia reportedly killed.

Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth to air special broadcast on October 7, 2024, to mark one year since Hamas attack; program will feature interviews, reports and discussions on war's impact, focusing on victims, families and recovery efforts On October 7, 2023, at 6:29 a.m., Israel was shaken by a surprise Hamas attack, plunging the nation into chaos. What was meant to be a festive Simchat Torah turned into a day of horror, with numerous deaths, injuries and kidnappings. Among the hostages, 101 are still held captive by Hamas. That day changed Israel forever. The newsroom of Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth faced an unprecedented journalistic challenge, as reporters and editors worked around the clock to provide swift and accurate coverage of the unfolding events. Little did they know, the tragedy would strike close to home, with the murder of their own photographer, Roy Edan, and his wife, Smadar. Their children, Michael and Amalia, hid for hours in a closet, while their daughter, Abigail, was kidnapped to Gaza and later released in the first hostage exchange. For the past year, Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth have continuously covered the developments on the frontlines and home front, focusing on the victims, hostages, families and communities that were displaced. The news teams have faced professional challenges while maintaining journalistic ethics and sensitivity to the complex issues at hand. To mark the anniversary, on Monday, October 7, 2024, Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth will host a special broadcast day, featuring live programs from the heart of the newsroom and key locations across Israel. The broadcast will include interviews with key figures and discussions on the pressing issues that have shaped the past year of conflict, which shows no signs of ending. Highlights include Israel Prize laureate Ron Ben-Yishai, who has witnessed every Israeli war, reporting from Gaza and summarizing the year of war; leading commentators Nahum Barnea, Nadav Eyal and Ronen Bergman will discuss critical decisions and exclusive revelations in a special panel; military analyst Yossi Yehoshua will conduct a hard-hitting interview with a senior IDF official; journalist Hen Artzi Sror will have an emotional conversation with children who lost a parent in the war; photographer Ziv Koren will present his most powerful images and Avi Issacharoff will assess Hamas' condition and what comes next. In the field, reporters will meet key figures in the north battling to defend the region, and survivors from the Nova music festival massacre, kibbutzim and southern cities will recount their harrowing experiences and ongoing recovery. The program will also spotlight families of reservists, wounded heroes on the frontlines and the reconstruction of the damaged Alumim dairy farm, restored with the support of volunteers and the Dairy Farmers Fund by Tnuva. Guests scheduled to appear include Yossi Shelley, Director-General of the Prime Minister’s Office and head of the Recovery Directorate; regional council heads Yossi Keren, Alon Davidi and Tamir Idan; Metula council head David Azulai; Osem Nestlé CEO Avi Ben Assayag; Chaim Taib, president and founder of the Menomadin Foundation and Brigadier General (res.) Amir Avivi, chairman and founder of the Israel Defense and Security Forum.

Hamas says responsible for Tel Aviv shooting attack	Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades claim responsibility for deadly terror attack and confirm two terrorists were affiliated with terror group The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing, claimed responsibility for the shooting attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday in which seven Israelis were murdered. According to the terror group’s statement, the two Hebron terrorists were members of the terror organization. The IDF surrounded the Palestinian town in the West Bank after initial investigation suggested the terrorists originated from there. The attack has heightened alert levels across the country, particularly in the West Bank after it was suspected the terrorists infiltrated the area via a breach in the West Bank barrier. Tensions in the area have escalated ahead of Rosh Hashanah and the upcoming October 7 anniversary. Security forces have already mapped the homes of the two terrorists and seven suspects have been arrested as part of the investigation into the attack, which indicated the two infiltrated from an area close to Jerusalem, leading the IDF Central Command to reinforce the border during the holiday period. Three additional IDF battalions were recently deployed to the West Bank. Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, the military’s open-fire policy has been updated, specifically regarding illegal infiltrators attempting to cross into Israel, resulting in several shooting incidents. The Central Command is deeply concerned about the activities of terrorist organizations along the West Bank barrier. Both the Shin Bet and the IDF are aware of persistent efforts by Iran and Hamas to smuggle weapons into refugee camps and armed terrorists through the eastern border. One major concern suggests Iran might stir unrest among Jordanian residents, like the situations in Gaza and Lebanon, challenging Israel along another border. Jordan is closely monitoring these developments with deep concern, as several attempts have been made to arm and embolden residents near the border to act against Israel. Reinforcements are in place along near the West Bank border, Hebron and the West Bank proper, where large forces from the Judea and Samaria Division are operating. The upcoming holiday period and the significance of October 7 also raise tensions in the area. Over a month has passed since the Central Command initiated a campaign aimed at dismantling terrorist infrastructure in the northern West Bank to prevent attacks inside Israel. So far, around 100 terrorists have been eliminated and many more have been arrested. The Shin Bet and IDF, however, still warn about Hamas and Iran's intent to carry out attacks. At the same time, the Palestinian Authority is attempting to project its governance in West Bank cities like Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarm.

Under fire and heavy fog: 30 terrorists killed in heroic Lebanon ...	Egoz soldiers clash with Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanese border village, taking heavy fire; casualties evacuated under harsh weather conditions; at least 30 soldiers wounded in fighting, 7 seriously; 2 soldiers killed by anti-tank fire in separate incident Six IDF commandos were killed in intense combat in southern Lebanon early Wednesday morning, as a detachment of elite Egoz Unit soldiers launched an assault around 4:30 a.m. and encountered Hezbollah terrorists in a building near the border. The soldiers were met with heavy fire from small arms, anti-tank missiles and mortars. Despite the harsh weather conditions, medical teams and Unit 669 rescue forces, along with ground and air support, worked heroically under heavy fire to evacuate the wounded. Two Golani Reconnaissance Unit soldiers were killed by an anti-tank missile in a separate incident. Seven more soldiers were severely wounded. Poor weather conditions, including heavy fog and total darkness, complicated the operation. The Air Force carried out strikes on nearby roads and buildings, including a mosque where some of the terrorists had fled. The mosque was destroyed in the attack, and at least 30 Hezbollah fighters were reportedly killed. Around 30 Israeli soldiers were wounded in the incident, with several continuing to fight despite their injuries. Egoz Unit's drone team provided crucial support, guiding forces and launching missiles to fill gaps caused by the low visibility for Air Force aircraft. Earlier encounters on Tuesday saw Egoz commandos eliminate six Hezbollah terrorists without Israeli casualties. Since the beginning of Israel's ground operation on Monday night, the IDF has reported the killing of around 50 Hezbollah terrorists by commando forces. In the months leading up to the ground assault, Israeli forces had targeted 650 Hezbollah positions in the sector near the Upper Galilee. Despite this, Hezbollah’s elite Radwan force had concealed underground rocket launchers and command centers, waiting for the IDF’s ground incursion. On Wednesday evening, the IDF named the eight soldiers that were killed in two separate incidents: Captain Harel Etinger, 23, from Eli, and Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, from Modi'in Maccabim Re'ut, both served as squad commanders in the elite Egoz Unit of the Commando Brigade; Sergeant First Class Noam Barzilay, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir Tzur Yigal, Sergeant First Class Or Mantzur, 21, from Beit Aryeh-Ofarim, and Sergeant First Class Nazaar Itkin, 21, from Kiryat Ata, all soldiers in the Egoz Unit; Captain Itai Ariel Giat, 23, from Shoham, an officer in the Yahalom Unit of the Combat Engineering Corps; Staff Sergeant Almken Terefe, 21, from Jerusalem, and Staff Sergeant Ido Broyer, 21, from Ness Ziona, served in the Golani Brigade's Reconnaissance Unit. During the clash that claimed the lives of the six Egoz soldiers, a commando officer and four other soldiers were severely injured. The fighting unfolded as the commando unit entered a building in a Lebanese village near the border, leading to an extended firefight. The difficult weather and heavy mortar fire made the evacuation and rescue operations highly challenging, with air support providing crucial assistance in isolating the battlefield and extracting the wounded. Two soldiers were killed, likely by anti-tank missiles or mortar fire. The battle included close-quarters combat with Hezbollah terrorists, supported by tank and artillery shelling from the IDF. In another incident during the day’s fighting, a Golani Brigade medic from the 51st Battalion was critically injured in northern combat operations.

Iran's Khamenei warned Nasrallah of Israeli plot to kill him, sou...	Supreme leader feared Hezbollah was compromised and infiltrated but Nasrallah was confident in his security and trusted his inner circle completely Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Hezbollah leader Syyed Hassan Nasrallah to flee Lebanon days before he was killed in an Israeli strike and is now deeply worried about Israeli infiltration of senior government ranks in Tehran, three Iranian sources said. In the immediate aftermath of the attack on Hezbollah's booby-trapped pagers on Sept. 17, Khamenei sent a message with an envoy to beseech the Hezbollah secretary general to leave for Iran, citing intelligence reports that suggested Israel had operatives within Hezbollah and was planning to kill him, one of the sources, a senior Iranian official, told Reuters. The messenger, the official said, was a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) commander, Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, who was with Nasrallah in his bunker when it was hit by Israeli bombs and was also killed. Khamenei, who has remained in a secure location inside Iran since Saturday, personally ordered a barrage of around 200 missiles to be fired at Israel on Tuesday, a senior Iranian official said. The attack was retaliation for the deaths of Nasrallah and Nilforoushan, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement. The statement also cited the July killing of Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and Israel's attacks on Lebanon. Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death. Israel on Tuesday began what it labeled as a 'limited' ground incursion against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Iran's foreign ministry and the office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which oversees the country's foreign intelligence agency Mossad, did not reply to requests for comment. Nasrallah's assassination followed two weeks of precise Israeli strikes that have destroyed weapons sites, eliminated half of Hezbollah's leadership council and decimated its top military command. Iran's fears for the safety of Khamenei and the loss of trust, within both Hezbollah and Iran's establishment and between them, emerged in the conversations with 10 sources for this story, who described a situation that could complicate the effective functioning of Iran's Axis of Resistance alliance of anti-Israel irregular terror groups. Founded with Iran's backing the 1980s, Hezbollah has long been the most formidable member of the alliance. The disarray is also making it hard for Hezbollah to choose a new leader, fearing the ongoing infiltration will put the successor at risk, four Lebanese sources said. 'Basically, Iran lost the biggest investment it had for the past decades,' said Magnus Ranstorp, a Hezbollah expert at the Swedish Defense University, of the deep damage caused to Hezbollah that he said diminished Iran's capacity to strike at Israel's borders. 'It shook Iran to the core. It shows how Iran was deeply infiltrated also: they not only killed Nasrallah, they killed Nilforoushan,' he said, who was a trusted military adviser to Khamenei. Hezbollah's lost military capacity and leadership cadre might push Iran towards the type of attacks against Israeli embassies and personnel abroad that it engaged in more frequently before the rise of its proxy forces, Ranstorp said. Iran makes arrests Nasrallah's death has prompted Iranian authorities to thoroughly investigate possible infiltrations within Iran's own ranks, from the powerful IRGC to senior security officials, a second senior Iranian official said. They are especially focused on those who travel abroad or have relatives living outside Iran, the first official said. Tehran grew suspicious of certain members of the Guards who had been traveling to Lebanon, he said. Concerns were raised when one of these individuals began asking about Nasrallah's whereabouts, particularly inquiring about how long he would remain in specific locations, the official added. The individual has been arrested along with several others, the first official said, after alarm was raised in Iran's intelligence circles. The suspect's family had relocated outside Iran, the official said, without identifying the suspect or his relatives. The second official said the assassination has spread mistrust between Tehran and Hezbollah, and within Hezbollah. 'The trust that held everything together has disappeared,' the official said. The Supreme Leader 'no longer trusts anyone,' said a third source who is close to Iran's establishment. Alarm bells had already rung within Tehran and Hezbollah about possible Mossad infiltrations after the killing in July of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike on a secretive Beirut location while meeting an IRGC commander, two Hezbollah sources and a Lebanese security official told Reuters at the time. That killing was followed a few hours later by the assassination of Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran. Unlike Haniyeh's death, Israel publicly claimed responsibility for the killing of Shukr, a low-profile figure who Nasrallah nonetheless described, at his funeral, as a central figure in Hezbollah's history who had built its most important capabilities. Shukr was key to the development of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precision-guided missiles, and was in charge of the Shi'ite terror group's operations against Israel over the past year, Israel's military has said. Iranian fears about Israeli penetration of its upper ranks stretch back years. In 2021, former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the head of an Iranian intelligence unit that was supposed to target agents of Mossad had himself been an agent for the Israeli spy agency, telling CNN Turk that Israel obtained sensitive documents on Iran's nuclear program, a reference to a 2018 raid in which Israel obtained a huge trove of top secret documents about the program. Also in 2021, Israel's outgoing spy chief Yossi Cohen gave details about the raid, telling the BBC that 20 non-Israeli Mossad agents were involved in stealing the archive from a warehouse. Pager warning Khamenei's invitation to Nasrallah to relocate to Iran came after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah blew up in deadly attacks on Sept 17 and 18, the first official said. The attacks have been widely attributed to Israel, although it has not officially claimed responsibility. Nasrallah, however, was confident in his security and trusted his inner circle completely, the official said, despite Tehran's serious concerns about potential infiltrators within Hezbollah's ranks. Khamenei tried a second time, relaying another message through Nilforoushan to Nasrallah last week, imploring him to leave Lebanon and relocate to Iran as a safer location. But Nasrallah insisted on staying in Lebanon, the official said. Several high-level meetings were held in Tehran following the pager blasts to discuss Hezbollah and Nasrallah's safety, the official said, but declined to say who attended those meetings. Simultaneously, in Lebanon, Hezbollah began conducting a major investigation to purge Israeli spies among them, questioning hundreds of members after the pager detonations, three sources in Lebanon told Reuters. Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, a senior Hezbollah official, was leading the investigation, a Hezbollah source said. The probe was progressing rapidly, the source said, before an Israeli raid killed him a day after Nasrallah's assassination. Another raid earlier last week had targeted other senior Hezbollah commanders, some of who were involved in the inquiry. Kaouk had summoned for questioning Hezbollah officials involved in logistics and others 'who participated, mediated and received offers on pagers and walkie-talkies,' the source said. A 'deeper and comprehensive inquiry' and purge were now needed after the killing of Nasrallah and other commanders, the source said. Ali al-Amin, the editor-in-chief for Janoubia, a news site that focuses on the Shi'ite community and Hezbollah said reports indicated that Hezbollah detained hundreds of people for questioning after the pagers saga. Hezbollah is reeling from Nasrallah's killing in his deep bunker in a command HQ, shocked at how successfully Israel penetrated the terrorgroup, seven sources said. Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy research director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut with a focus on Iran and Hezbollah, described the offensive as 'the biggest intelligence infiltration by Israel' since Hezbollah was founded with Iran's backing in the 1980s. The current Israeli escalation follows almost a year of cross-border fighting after Hezbollah began rocket attacks in support of its ally Hamas. The Palestinian terror group killed 1,200 people and seized 250 hostages in an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, according to Israeli tallies. Loss of trust The Israeli offensive and fear of more attacks on Hezbollah have also prevented the Iranian-backed terror group from organizing a nationwide funeral on a scale reflecting Nasrallah's religious and leadership status, according to four sources familiar with the debate within Hezbollah. 'No one can authorize a funeral in these circumstances,' one Hezbollah source said, lamenting the situation in which officials and religious leaders could not come forward to properly honor the late leader. Several commanders killed last week were buried discreetly on Monday, with plans for a proper religious ceremony when the conflict ends. Hezbollah is mulling the option of securing a religious decree to bury Nasrallah temporarily and hold an official funeral when the situation permits, the four Lebanese sources said. Hezbollah has refrained from officially appointing a successor to Nasrallah, possibly to avoid making his replacement a target for an Israeli assassination, they said. 'Appointing a new secretary general could be dangerous if Israel assassinates him right after,' said Amin. 'The group can't risk more chaos by appointing someone only to see them killed.'

Military confirms several bases received concentrated fire in Iranian strike, stresses Air Force remains fully operational The IDF reported Wednesday that several Air Force bases were damaged in Tuesday's Iranian missile attack but emphasized that no aircraft were harmed, and upcoming missions remain unaffected. The army credited its long-standing defense and operational integrity plan for successfully mitigating the impacts, highlighting the effectiveness of air defense systems like Iron Dome and Arrow, as well as infrastructure protection and emergency deployment strategies. The Israeli Air Force praised the public’s response, describing their adherence to Home Front Command instructions as 'heroic,' which helped prevent casualties. 'Defense is based on knowing thousands of missiles and rockets will be fired while continuing operations without harm to personnel or aircraft,' the military said. 'No aircraft were damaged. Only administrative buildings and peripheral components were hit, with the core of our operations remaining secure.' Meanwhile, a CNN analysis revealed that missiles launched from Iran struck or landed near sensitive sites, including Mossad headquarters and Air Force bases in southern and central Israel. The IDF added that while Iran used its most advanced missiles 'without restraint,' it did not deploy hypersonic missiles, which Tehran does not possess despite claims to the contrary. 'Iran knows, and we’ve proven, that we can strike any point in Iran. We won’t respond directly but will act against them as we always have and will continue to do so according to our considerations,' the IDF added. 'The Iranian attack failed because it targeted our home front, not our military capabilities.'

IDF confirms eight soldiers slain in southern Lebanon operation	Initial military investigation into incident reveals combat teams encountered Hezbollah terrorists in apartment and evacuated under heavy artillery fire The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Wednesday that eight combat soldiers were killed during battles in southern Lebanon. They are: Captain Harel Etinger, 23, from Eli, a Squad Commander in the 'Egoz' Unit, Commando Brigade; Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, from Modi'in Maccabim Re'ut, a squad commander in the elite Egoz Unit of the Commando Brigade; Captain Itai Ariel Giat, 23, from Shoham, an officer in the 'Yahalom' Unit, Combat Engineering Corps; Sergeant First Class Noam Barzilay, 22, from Kokhav Ya'ir Tzur Yigal, a soldier in the 'Egoz' Unit, Commando Brigade. Sergeant First Class Or Mantzur, 21, from Beit Aryeh-Ofarim, a soldier from the 'Egoz' Unit, Commando Brigade; Sergeant First Class Nazaar Itkin, 21, from Kiryat Ata, a soldier from the 'Egoz' Unit, Commando Brigade; Staff Sergeant Almken Terefe, 21, from Jerusalem, a soldier from the Golani Reconnaissance Unit, Golani Brigade; Staff Sergeant Ido Broyer, 21, from Ness Ziona, a soldier from the Golani Reconnaissance Unit, Golani Brigade. Since the war in Gaza broke out on October 7, 346 soldiers fell during operations in the Strip, with the latter eight being the first ones to fall in the IDF’s operation in Lebanon. Early reports into the incident in which the Egoz Unit’s soldiers were killed revealed the forces entered a building in a Lebanese village near the border. Inside, they encountered Hezbollah terrorists, resulting in injuries to the soldiers. This was followed by prolonged fighting and evacuation under challenging weather conditions, with heavy mortar fire directed at the troops. Military helicopters evacuated the wounded while Israeli aircraft provided support fire to isolate and rescue the injured. Two soldiers were killed in the incident, likely by an anti-tank missile or mortar. The fighting involved close-quarters combat with terrorists alongside tank and artillery shelling.

A terrorist pointed his gun at my head, I was sure he'd blow my ...	For 54 days, Itay Regev endured a nightmare in Hamas captivity—shot, bleeding and subjected to abuse; speaking to Ynet, he recounts his near-death experience and shares how he’s rebuilding his life as a model and actor, turning trauma into resilience Itay Regev endured a harrowing 54 days in captivity at the hands of Hamas terrorists in Gaza, surviving brutal conditions and constant psychological torment before his release. Without the aid of special effects, his story is one of remarkable endurance and courage, made all the more extraordinary given the physical and emotional toll he faced. The 19-year-old, who sustained severe leg injuries during his abduction on October 7, was bleeding and in constant pain during his captivity. He was also separated from his sister, Maya, a torment in itself. Throughout his ordeal, his captors sought to break him, mocking him, playing cruel mind games and subjecting him to both physical and mental abuse. Yet, despite the unimaginable circumstances, Regev’s spirit remained unbroken. Regev vividly recalls a chilling moment early in his capture. 'A minute after I lay on the road, one of the terrorists came and stood on my back with the barrel of gun pointed at my head for two minutes. Those were two minutes of paralyzing fear. I was sure he'd blow my head off any second. I said goodbye to life.' After tying his hands, his captors transported him and others, including his uninjured friend Omer Shemtov and Maya, in a van. Inside the vehicle, the abuse escalated. 'They acted like animals. Each one screamed, and every terrorist took turns looking us in the eyes and cursing us up close,' Regev said. 'I was slapped repeatedly, and they violently pulled Maya's hair. They took pleasure in mocking us. There was a moment when a terrorist asked us if we loved Israel. We said no, and he looked me in the eye and said, 'Liar, liar,' and slapped me. There were nine terrorists there, with Omer and me lying in the van, and they continued cursing and spitting.' Regev’s injuries worsened, requiring hospital treatment. 'There were seven armed terrorists in the room with me, each one more terrifying than the last. They looked at me with evil smiles,' he recounted. A terrified doctor, under the terrorists' watchful eyes, removed a bullet from Regev’s leg—without anesthesia. 'There was someone else in doctor's clothes, sweating, scared, terrified. Before he approached my leg with the forceps, one terrorist told me, 'Be quiet, or we will kill you.' The doctor took the forceps and removed the bullet from my right leg. I realized he was going to do it without anesthesia, without pain relief. I wanted to scream but bit my lips,' he recalled of the excruciating pain. Now free, Regev is beginning to rebuild his life, starting his first acting role in a youth series and using sports as a means to cope with his trauma. He finds solace in boxing and training but admits that the attention he’s received has been difficult. 'Suddenly, everyone knows me. At first, it felt good—the State of Israel loves me—but after a while, you just wish no one knew about you and people would see you as a regular person. When strangers talk to you, it's like they're speaking a different language.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sj8aqnyrc	2024-10-02T07:41:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/ryWKTDlDR0/ryWKTDlDR0_0_0_1920_1080_0_small.jpg

The Iranian missiles behind the attack on Israel	Iranian expert reveals three types of missiles launched at Israel, including one reportedly equipped with maneuverable warhead; Israeli officials deny Iran possesses hypersonic missile capabilities Three types of advanced ballistic missiles from Iran's arsenal were deployed in the powerful missile strike on Israel, Qatari newspaper The New Arab reported on Wednesday, citing Iranian media. An Iranian military expert told the paper that the missiles used in the attack were the Fattah-1, Emad and Ghadr-110H models. On Tuesday, Iran launched nearly 200 missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, though some landed in central and southern Israel. Israeli officials vowed a severe response to the large-scale attack, while Iran continued issuing threats. A video was released showing Revolutionary Guard Commander Hossein Salami ordering the operation, dubbed 'Operation True Promise 2,' following a similar attack in April of the same name Iranian military expert Morteza Al-Masawi informed the Qatari newspaper that the Fattah-1 missile has a range of 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) and is equipped with a maneuverable warhead. 'One key advantage of these missiles is their ability to be launched from commercial ships, submarines, warships, Russian Su-24 aircraft and Iranian F-4 planes,' he noted. The Fattah-1 was unveiled by Iran's Revolutionary Guard in June 2023, with then-president Ebrahim Raisi in attendance. Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May, called the missile 'a pillar of national strength.' The Iranian missiles behind the attack on Israel The missile is 44.6 feet long, 31.5 inches in diameter, and travels at speeds between Mach 13 and Mach 15. It is also reportedly capable of evading radar detection. Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, through the news agency Sabreen News, also claimed the Fattah-1 was used in Tuesday’s attack. Al-Masawi claimed that Iran joined the club of hypersonic missile nations in November 2022, though Israeli officials have repeatedly denied that Tehran possesses hypersonic missile capabilities. Regarding the Ghadr-110H, Al-Masawi described it as a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles), a modernized version of Iran's Shahab-3 missile. The Ghadr measures 52 feet in length, 4.1 feet in diameter, and carries a warhead weighing between 700 kilograms and one ton (1,550-2,200 pounds). It travels at Mach 9, is capable of evading radar, and can be launched from mobile platforms, the expert added. Al-Masawi also explained that the Emad is an advanced variant of the Ghader surface-to-surface ballistic missile, with a range of 1,700 kilometers (1,060 miles). Weighing 1.75 metric tons (3,860 pounds), the missile has enhanced guidance and control capabilities, allowing for precise targeting. The Emad was developed by Iran's Defense Ministry and was first revealed in October 2015.

From mosque to massacre: How the Tel Aviv attack unfolded	New footage prior to deadly attack in which 7 Israelis were murdered shows terrorists enter a Jaffa mosque and threaten worshippers not to leave before exiting to execute massacre New details about the terror shooting attack in Tel Aviv that took place on Tuesday, in which seven Israelis were murdered, reveal that the two Palestinian terrorists who illegally entered the country entered the Al-Nuzha Mosque in the city minutes before the attack began. 'No one leaves the mosque; whoever leaves, risks their own head,' they threatened. D., who was praying at the mosque on Tuesday, recounted that the two entered the mosque with large backpacks, hid them near the restrooms and pulled out weapons and a knife. 'They threatened us not to leave, then exited the mosque heading west, saw the train stopping at the station from afar and started shooting people at point-blank range. I saw it myself because I ran after them. People fell on the spot. They murdered Jews, they murdered Arabs.' Ali, the person in charge of the mosque, said that one of the terrorists 'opened the closed door with an M-16 rifle in his hand. He just stuck his head in and said, 'No one will leave, whoever does will be responsible for their deaths,' and then left. The other one waited for him outside. We closed the doors, called the police and heard the gunfire.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said following the attack he would demolish the mosque if it was discovered the terrorists made use of it to hide or escape. Police investigation revealed that the worshippers weren’t suspected of any wrongdoing. 'We've been living together for 70 years. Is he here to create hate between Arabs and Jews? He should stay in his place,' Ali said in response to Ben-Gvir’s words. After leaving the mosque, the terrorists ran down the Jaffa’s main street and entered a light rail car that had stopped at a nearby station. There, they opened fire at point-blank range on the passengers including Shahar Goldman and Inbar Segev-Vigder. Another victim was Ilia Nozadze, a Georgian national. The terrorists continued along the city’s Jerusalem Boulevard, shooting at passersby until they were neutralized by security forces at the scene. The two terrorists — Mohammed Masek, 19, and Ahmed Al-Haimoni, 25 — were armed with M-16 rifles, magazines and a knife. Masek was killed at the scene, while Al-Haimoni was seriously injured. They crossed into Israel from the West Bank but the exact timing of their infiltration is still unknown. A joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Israeli Police Tel Aviv District revealed that the two terrorists hadn’t been previously arrested. One of them was known for a public disturbance incident. The IDF imposed a closure on the West Bank city of Nablus, began making arrests and raided Al-Haimoni's house in the Palestinian town overnight. Footage showed the arrest of his family members, including his father and several brothers. The detainees, suspected of assisting the terrorists in obtaining weapons and entering Israel, were transferred to Shin Bet custody for questioning.

Foreign Minister Israel Katz bans UN secretary-general from entering Israel after denouncing 'broadening of Middle East conflict' without mentioning Tehran Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Wednesday declared UN Secretary-General António Guterres a 'persona non grata' in Israel, banning his entry into the country. Katz condemned Guterres in an X post for his failure to unequivocally denounce Tuesday's Iranian missile attack on Israel, which targeted Israeli civilians, instead condemning 'the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation' without mentioning Tehran. 'Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel, as almost every country in the world has done, does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil,' he wrote. He also criticized Guterres for not condemning the October 7 Hamas attack, which saw widespread violence and atrocities, and for failing to lead efforts to declare Hamas a terrorist organization. 'A Secretary-General who gives backing to terrorists, rapists, and murderers from Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and now Iran—the mothership of global terror—will be remembered as a stain on the history of the UN,' he further wrote. An Israeli official further said that Guterres 'crossed all the lines,' citing his refusal to designate Hamas as a terror group and his defense of the UN’s Palestinian relief agency, UNRWA, despite its alleged ties to Hamas in Gaza.

What Israel did to Hezbollah in a week, a US-led coalition could...	Brig. Gen. (res.) Amir Avivi praises Israel’s 'shock and awe' military successes in Lebanon but said that addressing the Iranian threat itself will take global support The last several days of Israeli military operations in Lebanon have been remarkable. In a matter of days, Israel pulled off the pager plot, killing dozens of Hezbollah members in a highly targeted operation, and took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and numerous other officials in a strike on the group's headquarters. Brig. Gen. (res.) Amir Avivi stated that the situation has been very different since last April. 'The strategy was to focus on Gaza and not open other fronts, the response then was very pinpointed. One month ago Israel reached the point where the terms for the destruction of Hamas were set. Hamas as a military organization is dismantled. Israel was able to shift from the South to the North, understanding that dealing with Hezbollah would mean dealing with Iran.' When asked what kind of response will Israel carry out, Avivi said Israel has been preparing for this for a long time with many different capabilities. It's not just going to be one attack, and not just with airplanes. Israel needs to deal with Iran's nuclear plans. 'The Iranians have Shahab 3, the Sajil, and the Haibar missiles,' he explained. 'Each ballistic missile carries half a ton of explosives. Ballistic missiles go through space and back to the atmosphere. Israel's Arrow 3 and Arrow 2 deals with it in space. If the Arrow misses the missiles, Iron Dome is the backup.' Avivi also said that similarly bold successes against Iran are possible—if the international community is willing to take part. 'Israel at the moment is almost by itself dismantling all the proxies of Iran,' Avivi, who heads the Israel Defense and Security Forum, said. 'But I think that dealing with Iran, it’s a global issue. It’s a regional issue that should be led by the U.S. What Israel did in seven days against Hezbollah, a global coalition can do in three days in Iran. This is not about boots on the ground. It’s not about spending 20 years in Iraq or Afghanistan. This is about a major airstrike to take out all their major capabilities.' Doing so would protect 'the whole Western society' from a nuclear Iran, Avivi said. Avivi explained the exceptional success of Israel’s recent military efforts against Hezbollah by noting the extensive planning that went into them. 'Israel has been preparing for 18 years for a war in the north and really building amazing capabilities,' he said. The planning paid off over the past several days as Israel carried out what Avivi called a shock and awe military strategy in Lebanon. 'This is what Israel has done,' he said. 'And at the peak of this amazing process, the toppling of all the leadership of Hezbollah in their main headquarters, destroying completely, really, the heart of the command and control of Hezbollah and eliminating Nasrallah himself. I think that the whole world, certainly the Middle East, is looking at it amazed and shocked.' But eliminating Hezbollah’s leadership may not be enough to secure Israel’s northern border. 'We need to really dismantle the whole organization. And in order to bring back safely the 60,000 Israelis who have been displaced for so long, 11 months, we need to push Hezbollah out of south Lebanon,' he said. The violence in northern Israel, Avivi said, is the result of an international failure to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1701, the resolution that ended the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War and made Hezbollah's presence in southern Lebanon illegal. 'We have all the right to do everything needed to really restore security to Israel. And I think that at the moment, the only realistic, theoretically speaking, the only force that can really impose 1701 is Israel,' he said. If Hezbollah does not surrender, Israel will carry out a ground operation in Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure and create a buffer zone, Avivi said. 'When the Israeli citizens return home, they need to see IDF on the other side. They need to see Israeli flags,' he said. 'They need to know they’re safe, that they’re not going to experience a danger like the south on the 7 of October.' Avivi said that Israel’s biggest challenge, the threat of a nuclear Iran, still lies ahead. He called on Israel’s allies to take action against Iran. So far, securing American support has been complicated. Avivi confirmed that the U.S. was not made aware of plans to assassinate Nasrallah before he was taken out, but that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris expressed their support after the fact. One key point of contention between the U.S. and Israel is the question of a cease-fire. 'The cease-fire doesn’t work for Israel,' Avivi said. 'We need to win decisively on all fronts and eliminate these dangers on our borders. A cease-fire is not going to solve our problems.' He called on the U.S. to get behind the Israeli effort to eliminate the threats facing it, including the Iranian threat. 'The administration needs to understand Israel is not going to stop until we really win in this war,' he said. As the northern front continues to develop, the war in Gaza is also nearing the one-year mark. Avivi listed three goals the Israeli military has for Gaza: dismantling Hamas as a military and governmental entity, returning all the hostages, and creating a reality in Gaza where forces like Hamas cannot come to power. So far, Israel has managed to dismantle Hamas as a military entity, Avivi said. That achievement is made clear by the fact that Hamas has not fired a single rocket into Israel in response to Nasrallah’s assassination. However, Hamas still exists as a governing body and 101 hostages are still held in Gaza. 'We have a lot to do yet in Gaza, and one of the things we need to do is really take control of the humanitarian aid, prevent this aid from Hamas, make sure that it goes only to citizens, and start doing a siege on areas where there are no citizens while supplying the citizens in the humanitarian zone,' Avivi said. 'But do a siege on the terrorists, really get them to surrender and not continue their aggression.' According to Channel 12, Israeli intelligence knew at one point where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was but chose not to target him due to hostages being in his proximity. Avivi said he could not confirm that report. 'I do know that Israel is doing everything to really find him and also everything to release the hostages,' he said. Avivi said that the war in Gaza was 'not a win' at this point. 'Winning is achieving the goals of war,' he said. 'We haven't achieved all of them yet.' 'Enhance the military pressure on Hamas, deal with the humanitarian aid, and eventually I think there will be victory and we’ll bring back our hostages,' he said. While noting that Israel’s current focus is in the north, Avivi said that he expects continued military pressure will eventually break Hamas and result in the release of the remaining hostages. 'I think that what’s happening in the north will impact dramatically also the south,' he said. 'I mean, when Hamas sees the way Israel is destroying Hezbollah, they understand that it’s game over for them. They hope that the original war will shift everything in their favor, and it’s working exactly the opposite.' Avivi's vision for Gaza the day after the war involves leadership by local clans, without the involvement of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or the Palestinian Authority. Israel will continue to have security oversight of Gaza to ensure that new terror armies don't spring up, he said, noting that the process of dismantling terror infrastructure and deradicalizing the population will take years. For now, as the war in Gaza enters its second year, many Israelis still want to know why Israel was not prepared for the Hamas invasion, especially after witnessing the very capable plan carried out in Lebanon. Avivi said that hyperfocus on the northern threat was part of what allowed October 7 to happen. 'Israel really thought that the main war would be in the north and not in the south, and didn’t prepare properly,' he explained. 'We’re paying for this, and it’s a big lesson for the next time to understand that we really need to be prepared on all fronts, invest intelligence on all fronts, and not allow a terror army to attack us like that.'

What’s at stake as Netanyahu and Gallant face ICC arrest warrants...	International Criminal Court expected to decide on request for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders soon; critics say Israel missed chance for voluntary appearance The International Criminal Court (ICC) is close to deciding whether to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, following a request by Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan. Speculation suggests the decision could coincide with the anniversary of the October 7 massacre, though a delay remains possible. Israel has filed two objections, hoping to halt the process. One challenges the ICC’s jurisdiction over the case, while the other accuses the prosecutor of violating court protocol by not allowing Israel to investigate the allegations independently. While these objections have briefly delayed the court's decision, there is little optimism in Jerusalem that they will succeed. Should the ICC move forward with arrest warrants, Israel is expected to appeal. However, the appeal process could take months, and an appeal does not guarantee that the ruling will be overturned. If warrants are issued, all 123 ICC member states would be obligated to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant if they enter their territories and extradite them to The Hague. The question of immunity for sitting officials remains unresolved, with past cases, such as deposed Sudanese despot Omar al-Bashir, illustrating the complexities of enforcing such warrants. The implications extend beyond the individuals targeted. The ICC decision could strain Israel’s diplomatic relations, especially with key allies like France, Germany and the UK, which may advise Netanyahu and Gallant to avoid visits to prevent legal entanglements. Non-member states could also choose to arrest and extradite them, increasing the international pressure. The issuance of warrants would imply that Netanyahu and Gallant are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which could damage Israel’s already fragile international standing. Countries such as Canada might even be pressured to sever ties with Israel’s leadership. Furthermore, it could impact Israel’s military operations, raising concerns about international sanctions and arms embargoes. Israel’s options to prevent the warrants are limited. One potential avenue is the formation of a state commission of inquiry into the events of October 7. However, Netanyahu has rejected the attorney general’s recommendation to establish such a commission, leaving the country without a mechanism to assert it is investigating the matter internally. If the warrants are issued, they could haunt Netanyahu and Gallant for life, limiting their international travel and exposing them to arrest, even after their terms in office end. While Netanyahu could still travel to non-ICC member states such as the U.S. or Russia, ICC warrants would severely curtail his diplomatic reach. The warrants would likely end any dialogue between Israel and the ICC. Netanyahu has accused Prosecutor Khan of political bias, and the Israeli government claims the ICC’s actions are politically motivated. Israel has made it clear that it will not negotiate or extradite its leaders to The Hague. One factor that could influence the court’s decision is the broader regional context. Significant developments, such as the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah or Netanyahu’s role in brokering normalization with Saudi Arabia, could weigh on the court’s deliberations. A source familiar with ICC operations suggested that arrest warrants would make Netanyahu a 'persona non grata' in many Western nations, potentially forcing leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron to distance themselves. Critics argue that Israel’s handling of the ICC has been flawed. Though it does not formally recognize the court, Israel has engaged with it by submitting legal documents. Observers have noted that Israel missed an opportunity to negotiate a voluntary appearance for Netanyahu and Gallant, which could have allowed them to continue serving in their roles. The situation recalls the 2014 case involving Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who faced charges at the ICC. Kenyatta temporarily relinquished his powers to attend a hearing, denying the charges and maintaining his role. His lawyer at the time, Karim Khan, is now the ICC’s chief prosecutor. The trial continued in Kenyatta’s absence, allowing him and then-Vice President William Ruto to retain their leadership positions. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skpvrfkra	2024-10-02T02:53:48-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/05/20/Byd300yYQR/Byd300yYQR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Trump says Israel-Iran hostilities 'like two kids fighting in the...	‘Sometimes you have to just let it go a little bit, we'll see what happens,’ Republican presidential hopeful remarks after Iran missile attack on Israel; running mate Vance accuses Biden of unfreezing funds Tehran used to arm itself In the wake of Iran’s missile attack on Israel on Tuesday, presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on the escalating conflict, equating the animosity between the two nations to 'two kids fighting in the schoolyard.' 'This has really been bad, but they have to finish that process. Think of it like two kids fighting in the schoolyard. Sometimes you have to just let it go a little bit, we'll see what happens,' Trump remarked. However, he also said, 'I’ve been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don’t want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. But they are very close to global catastrophe.' Meanwhile, Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance took a more direct approach, accusing President Joe Biden of enabling Iran’s aggression by releasing frozen funds. 'Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration,' Vance said in a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz. 'What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well.' Walz, vowed there 'will be consequences' for Iran’s actions but did not provide specific details. Tuesday’s vice presidential debate, likely the last before the November 5 election, saw Walz and Vance clash in New York just hours after Iran’s missile attack. The debate began with a question on whether the candidates would support a U.S. attack on Iran. Walz emphasized Israel’s right to self-defense, while Vance avoided a direct answer but criticized the Biden administration for allowing Iran’s nuclear program to advance. 'Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place,' Walz retorted. 'So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership. And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted, because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump. The debate, though contentious, did not deliver a clear winner. A CBS poll showed viewers were split, with 42% favoring Vance and 41% backing Walz, while 17% called it a draw. Unlike the Harris-Trump debate, microphones were not muted, though CBS hosts exercised that option once during a heated exchange on immigration. Vance dodged a question about separating undocumented immigrants from their U.S.-born children, instead attacking Harris for what he called chaos at the southern border. Walz countered by blaming Trump for blocking bipartisan immigration reform. Another key moment came during a clash on abortion. Vance denied supporting a federal abortion ban, despite past statements to the contrary. Walz responded, 'We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world. This is about health care. In Minnesota, we are ranked first in health care for a reason. We trust women. We trust doctors.' The debate peaked when Walz attacked Trump’s refusal to accept his 2020 loss. 'He lost the election,' Walz said. 'This is not a debate. It's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world, because, look, when Mike Pence made that decision to certify that election, that's why Mike Pence isn't on this stage.' Vance, like Trump, refused to directly acknowledge Biden’s 2020 victory, instead insisting that Trump had ensured a 'smooth transition.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjmwedqac	2024-10-02T02:19:29-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/02/B14rPHqCC/B14rPHqCC_0_0_3000_2003_0_small.jpg

IDF expands ground operation in southern Lebanon with elite divis...	Army says 36th Division joins 98th Division in fighting as it issues evacuation warning for dozens more Lebanese villages; nearly 100 rockets fired from Lebanon since morning The IDF announced on Wednesday that its 36th Division, including the Golani Brigade, the 188th Armored Brigade, the Etzioni Brigade and other units, has joined the ground offensive in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah terror infrastructure. The operation is supported by airstrikes and artillery fire from the 282nd Fire Brigade. Following a situational assessment, the army declared Tuesday night that the border towns of Dovev, Sasa and Malkia in the Upper Galilee were a closed military zone, with entry to these areas strictly prohibited. The move followed a similar closure in the border communities of Metula, Misgav Am and Kfar Giladi. Meanwhile, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee issued a warning to residents of 24 villages in southern Lebanon, urging immediate evacuation due to Hezbollah activity. 'For your safety, you must leave your homes immediately,' the statement read, adding that any civilian near Hezbollah fighters, facilities or weapons risks their life. The IDF instructed residents to move north of the Awali River and avoid heading south. The directive comes a day after the army had ordered residents of 29 southern Lebanese villages to evacuate. Israel launched what it described as a 'limited' ground incursion into its northern neighbor overnight Tuesday after nearly a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with the Iranian-backed terrorist group. Images and videos of IDF forces in southern Lebanon were released Tuesday, with the army confirming that the 98th Division had raided Hezbollah terror infrastructure. Northern Command chief Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin held a situational assessment near the border with 98th Division Commander Brig. Gen. Guy Levy as forces advanced on their targets in Lebanon. Under the command of the 98th Division, units currently fighting in Lebanon include the Paratroopers Brigade, the Commando Brigade and the 7th Armored Brigade. 'During the raids, paratroopers uncovered dozens of weapons and combat positions, while fighters from the Egoz unit located and destroyed a Hezbollah rocket-launching and explosive storage site,' said the IDF. The Air Force supported the ground operation with over 100 strikes on Hezbollah targets in the last 24 hours. 'We are carrying out a focused operation led by the 98th Division against Hezbollah’s Radwan forces and offensive positions threatening northern Israel,' Gordin told commanders during the situational assessment. 'Our goal is to neutralize them and pave the way for the safe return of northern residents. We are determined, and you are leading the way—keep going.' Earlier Tuesday, the IDF revealed that more than 70 covert operations had been conducted in southern Lebanon this year, destroying thousands of Hezbollah weapons and over 30 tons of explosives intended for use in an invasion of the Galilee. These weapons had been hidden in tunnels and bunkers along the border and were part of Hezbollah’s plan to occupy parts of northern Israel. These revelations were partially intended to provide legitimacy for Israel's ground operation in southern Lebanon, which began with a covert entry under the cover of massive air and artillery bombardment. The 98th Division, which entered Lebanon from three separate battle groups that had previously fought in Gaza, has since secured key positions in the region. The Paratroopers Brigade, Commando Brigade and 7th Armored Brigade are now engaged in combat in Lebanon, facing resistance from Hezbollah fighters, including advanced anti-tank threats. However, the IDF's extensive preemptive strikes on hundreds of targets in the area over the past year are expected to ease their path during the ongoing operation. The IDF called up four reserve brigades and additional forces for operational tasks in northern Israel on Tuesday. 'Their mobilization will support the ongoing combat efforts against Hezbollah and the achievement of the war's objectives, including the safe return of northern residents to their homes,' a statement said. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has fired nearly 100 rockets from Lebanon toward northern Israel since early Wednesday in more than 20 separate salvos. In one such attack, the Iranian-backed terrorist group fire approximately 20 rockets toward the Haifa Bay region, landing in unpopulated areas. Earlier, about 30 rockets were launched toward the Galilee, most of which were intercepted. Short-range Burkan missiles struck the border villages of Shtula and Zar’it in the Upper Galilee, causing damage to homes and vehicles, but no injuries were reported. Residents of the area had been evacuated last October at the start of the war. In the border town of Metula, at least ten homes were damaged in a barrage of a dozen rockets. Meanwhile, Saudi outlet Al Hadath reported that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) conducted 17 bombing raids on the Dahieh district of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. Four apartment complexes were reportedly destroyed. 'IAF fighter jets carried out a series of targeted strikes in Beirut against weapons production facilities and other terrorist infrastructure,' the IDF said in a statement. 'Steps were taken to minimize civilian casualties, including issuing advance warnings to residents in the area.' Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al Akhbar reported that IAF jets also attacked targets in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, while artillery fire struck several villages in southern Lebanon. The paper also reported that an Israeli drone targeted a motorcycle in Bint Jbeil, a town in southern Lebanon. Lebanon's National News Agency reported Wednesday that three people were killed in an Israeli airstrike targeting a house in the town of Dibel, near Bint Jbeil. Earlier on Wednesday, the IDF said Hezbollah had fired a rocket at central Israel, but it landed in an unpopulated area with no damage or injuries. No sirens were activated. The IDF Homefront Command instructed residents of the Upper Galilee, including Safed, to remain near shelters and avoid travel or large gatherings, anticipating further rocket fire in the coming hours. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjhmqd9ra	2024-10-02T01:32:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/02/HkfttDv5AR/HkfttDv5AR_1_94_1601_901_0_small.jpg

The missile wemt through the living room': In threatened norther...	In Lebanon border town of Shtula, Ora Hatan remains steadfast, cooking for soldiers and maintaining hope despite constant Hezbollah fire; 'Since IDF took off the gloves, people here have started to smile' The blaring siren didn’t distract Ora Hatan from her cooking duties, nor did the explosion that followed moments later. After all, she was responsible for feeding 250 soldiers for the holiday, plus a journalist who arrived to a table laden with chicken and rice, grilled eggplant and homemade pickles. Having stayed in the moshav of Shtula in the Western Galilee, right on the Lebanese border, since the onset of the war, she had grown accustomed to it all. Her young son Yair, soon to celebrate his 11th birthday, has also gotten used to the sirens and explosions. When the blast echoed, he dashed to the balcony to watch the smoke rising from the impact site. When I asked Ora if she feared for his safety, she replied, 'Let’s ask him. Yair, are you scared?' To which he said, 'I’m only afraid of the jackals.' 'Two months ago, a rabid jackal bit him. We rushed to the hospital for a vaccine. Luckily, we weren’t here then, because the neighboring house was hit by an anti-tank missile that day. All my windows shattered, and the outer wall was pocked with shrapnel. By the way, I’m sure Hezbollah knows me by now. There’s probably some guy in the village with binoculars saying, 'There goes that crazy lady again.'' When she tells the story of her mother, Sarah Hatan, who lit a torch at the Independence Day state ceremony and at age 70 traveled alone on a journey to Kurdish Iraq, hitchhiking and taking taxis, you begin to understand where Ora inherited her courage. Ora and her sister eventually found their mother, sipping tea in a hotel lobby on the Turkish border. 'If my mother were alive, she’d say, 'I didn’t come from Kurdistan 80 years ago just to leave our home and become refugees again.'' Ora, one of 14 siblings, is a single mother, a home-based business owner, and a law student. She took me to see the family restaurant, destroyed by a rocket strike. Fifteen minutes after we left, two mortar shells landed where we had been standing. Shtula is a small farming community of about 300 residents, nearly all of whom have evacuated. It alert squad members have been on call for a year. Those off-duty were enjoying a cup of Kurdish black tea with cinnamon. They heard the news of Nasrallah's elimination through their radio. Orly Hajbi, their operations coordinator, reported that his body was found intact in the rubble. Someone quipped, 'He’s lightly dead.' 'Since the IDF took off the gloves, people here have started to smile,' says Eliyahu Galil, a member of the small town's alert squad member, just before the ground incursion began that night. 'Until now, we played ping-pong with them. We’ve moved to chess. And now they’ve lost their king. When we got the message, we danced and sang Sabbath songs. We even allowed ourselves a little beer.' Eliyahu, 42, married with five children, has a personal vendetta against Nasrallah. His house, located at the edge of the moshav just yards from the border, was hit by two anti-tank missiles. 'When the first missile was fired, I had just come home to pick up some things,' he recalls. 'It sounded like a truck barreling toward you. I had a few seconds to reach the shelter and close the door. The missile went through the living room and kitchen.' In his case, it ended with property damage. His friend in the emergency squad, Lior Hatan, lost his cousin, Eyal Uzan, who was killed in early December by an anti-tank missile while checking his peach and apple orchards near Moshav Netu’a. Lior owns a guest villa that has been abandoned since the war began. 'I have clients who used to come every year, and now they write to me: 'We’re on vacation abroad; bring your family and come to us. Our home is your home.'' Noam Elimelech, a 28-year-old medic from Kfar Yona, has been attached to the emergency squad since July. Before that, he fought in Gaza. 'We started in the northern Gaza Strip, then moved to the central camps and Khan Younis. In my first hour in Gaza, I treated a badly wounded soldier from an explosion on our force. We were supposed to start a rotation in Rafah, and I said: enough is enough. I came here to gather some strength for the next round. I’m already due at the Nitzanim Corridor.' Israel Levi, 68, is the oldest member of the emergency squad. 'We came here in '69 from the Lachish region. My mother is from the Hatan family. She’s in her 80s, married at 14. Now she’s evacuated to Nof HaGalil.' Carrot or stick Shlomi Hatan, 55, has been the security officer of Shtula for 20 years. 'This is one of the most threatened communities in the area because of the topography and the hostile village opposite us,' he explains. 'There are terror squads that pop up, shoot and flee. Our demand is simple: move them from the frontline opposite Shtula. By brains or by force, it must be done, even if it means establishing a security zone on the other side. Only this way can we bring back the residents, especially families with children.' Ora, whose home is located next to the site of the 2006 kidnapping of IDF soldiers by Hezbollah that led to the Second Lebanon War, fears a repeat. 'We mustn't enter Lebanon,' she says, 'Absolutely not. My heart is with the soldiers' mothers and their wives and children. Nasrallah and his cronies have set up many traps. At the end of the day, there will be a settlement. So what's the point? It's a shame for every soldier killed. We need to reach an agreement, but one that will be enforced. Not by the UN or other forces. Until then, we must continue bombing them from the air, and the IDF is doing it beautifully, leaving no trace of their leadership.' Ahead of Rosh Hashanah, Ora went to clean the abandoned synagogue. 'It should be clean, even if there are no worshipers. I prayed: 'God, let the hostages return to their families.' I don't care about anything else. Let them come home first.' This was the only time during the interview that this fearless woman teared up. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hy00artfc0	2024-10-01T22:47:44-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/yk14100436/yk14100436_0_0_945_697_0_small.jpg

Thief breaks into homes while residents shelter from missiles	Security cameras capture the man entering a Tel Aviv building, enters apartments after residents leave amid sirens warning of incoming strike While residents of Tel Aviv were in shelters during Iran's missile strike on Tuesday, having just learned about the murderous terror attack in Jaffa, one man chose to break into their homes and steal their property. When we returned home after the all-clear, we realized we were robbed,' Idan Matalon said. 'Security cameras captured a man entering the stairwell when the sirens began.' He said that when the thief saw people leaving their apartments to go to the shelter, he went up to the first floor and stole computers, a wallet and a bag, before escaping the building. 'We are still checking to see what else is missing.' Iran fired 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in the attack that began shortly after seven people were murdered in a deadly terror strike in Jaffa. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryymyuqr0	2024-10-01T22:33:31-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/BJmzHsTFCA/BJmzHsTFCA_0_47_1186_668_0_small.jpg

The gifted dancer from Lod is survived by her husband, parents and three sisters; baby saved after mother killed by terrorists identified as Hebron residents that were killed on site Thirty-year-old Shahar Goldman, a dancer from Lod was one of the seven victims of Tuesday's terror attack in the Jaffa quarter of Tel Aviv. She was survived by her husband, parent and her three sisters. Her mother Esthar, is an educator and well known in the mixed Jewish and Arab city. Her sister Meirav, is a musician in the Philharmonic Orchestra in Berlin, where she received the devastating news. A IDF soldier was critically hurt in the attack that also wounded 15 people. The terrorists who opened fire on civilians in Jaffa were identified as Mehmed Khalaf Saher Rajab and Hassan Mohammed Hassan Tamimi, both from the West Bank city of Hebron, in Israel illegally, were killed on the scene. The IDF imposed a closure on Hebron in the wake of the deadly terror attack. An initial investigation revealed that one of the terrorists was armed with an M-16 rifle and the other with a knife. They opened fire on people leaving the city's light rail on Jaffa's main street, then shot at other passersby. The wounded were transported to the Wolfson Hospital in Holon and the Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv. Among the victims was a young woman who was carrying her baby when she was shot. The infant was picked up by a survivor of the attack who brought her to hospital. 'The money hugged her baby, that was the most powerful image,' 22-year-old Arik Mrchenkov who was wounded by shots to his back, said. 'The baby was covered in blood. It is a miracle he survived.' Paramedic Eran Nissan who lives in Jaffa ran out to administer to the wounded. He was treating a woman who had taken a shot to her arm when he heard more gunfire. 'Along with two others, we dragged the girl to a back room and blocked the door,' he said. 'There were others who were lightly injured with us there, but I treated the girl who was conscious the entire time.' He said police and more medical teams arrived quickly and he helped the girl into an ambulance outside. 'I so hope she survived,' he said. Nissan made it home to his wife just in time for the Iranian missile strike on Israel >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk0tj8q00	2024-10-01T21:52:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/02/SJWpcJ50C/SJWpcJ50C_0_45_720_405_0_small.jpg

Israel threatens direct strikes on Iran’s nuclear or oil faciliti...	Israel reportedly conveys message to Iran, saying it would retaliate by targeting strategic facilities in Iran for any strike on its territory, 'no matter how small or large'; Netanyahu: Iran has made a 'grave mistake' Israel has reportedly warned Iran of direct retaliation targeting its nuclear or oil facilities following Tehran's large-scale missile attack, The Wall Street Journal report Tuesday, citing Arab officials. The report claims that Iran had alerted regional Arab officials of its plan to launch the missile barrage, which prompted Israel to send a clear message, saying it would respond to any attack on its territory, regardless of the scale or casualties. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Tuesday night that Iran had 'made a grave mistake' and would 'pay the price' for the attack. According to IDF, Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, many of which were intercepted, though some hit various locations across Israel. Israeli officials reportedly emphasized that the country would retaliate for any strike, 'no matter how small or large' the impact, and even if there were no casualties. Earlier in the day, military analysts indicated that Israel is seriously considering striking Iran’s nuclear facilities, a possibility under greater discussion than at any point in the past decade. Ynet analyst Nadav Eyal noted that Iran's two main deterrent forces, Hezbollah and Hamas, have been severely weakened, limiting Tehran's ability to respond to a potential Israeli strike. 'But that could change for the worse,' Eyal wrote, adding that political timing—especially the current U.S. administration's reluctance to veto Israeli actions—could be a factor. He argued that the recent Iranian attack might strengthen voices in Israel advocating for a preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. The IDF announced plans for significant retaliatory strikes across the Middle East, though it did not specify if these would target Iran. 'There is no damage to the Air Force’s capabilities—neither to aircraft, defense systems, nor detection systems. Tonight, and in the coming hours, the Air Force will strike throughout the Middle East with force,' a military spokesperson said. Senior Israeli officials vowed a strong response to the Iranian missile attack. A defense official promised a 'severe reaction,' while another Israeli official warned that 'what Iran has experienced so far is a fraction of what it will face now.' 'The Iranian regime does not understand our determination to defend ourselves' Netanyahu declared that Iran’s missile barrage targeting Israel had failed, crediting the country's advanced air defense systems. 'Iran once again attacked Israel with hundreds of missiles. This attack was thwarted thanks to Israel’s air defense, the most advanced in the world. I commend the IDF for this impressive achievement. Iran made a grave mistake tonight—and it will pay for it,' Netanyahu said. Netanyahu emphasized Israel’s resolve in defending itself. 'The Iranian regime does not understand our determination to defend ourselves or to retaliate against our enemies. Sinwar and Deif didn’t understand it, Nasrallah and Mohsen didn’t understand it, and apparently some in Tehran don’t either. They will understand. Our rule remains: those who attack us will be attacked in return.' Foreign Minister Israel Katz also vowed a strong response to the attack, saying, 'The mullah regime crossed a red line—Israel will not remain silent in the face of Iran’s criminal assault on our citizens. The entire free world must stand with Israel to stop Iran’s axis of evil before it’s too late.' Katz also expressed gratitude for the support of Israel’s allies, particularly the United States, and noted that, according to a CNN report, Jordan’s air force also participated in intercepting the missiles. 'The solidarity and support from many countries and leaders will not be forgotten. We know who our friends are,' Katz said. Iran, for its part, claimed the missile attack was in retaliation for the recent assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Iranian general Abbas Nilforoushan and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said the missiles targeted 'military bases' near Tel Aviv and warned of further attacks if Israel retaliated. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted a message in Hebrew on Twitter, saying, 'With God's help, the blows of the resistance front will become stronger and more painful against the worn and decaying body of the Zionist regime.'

The street was strewn with injured people': Witnesses describe h...	They spotted a guy near the barbershop and asked if he was Arab. He said, ‘Yes, yes, I’m Arab,’ and they moved on,' says eyewitness Witness accounts from the scene of Tuesday's deadly shooting in Tel Aviv's Jaffa quarter paint a picture of chaos and fear amid the highest security tensions since October 7. Nadia, a Jaffa resident, was cycling along the boulevard when gunmen opened fire. 'When I reached the Ehrlich station, gunfire erupted. I threw my bike and hid behind an electrical box. I saw two men with long guns firing continuously. They spotted a guy near the barbershop and asked if he was Arab. He said, ‘Yes, yes, I’m Arab,’ and they moved on,' she said. Moti, the owner of a nearby kiosk, described the relentless gunfire. 'We heard endless rounds of shots in every direction. We rushed outside in panic and saw figures running down the street, likely the attackers. It was hard to watch,' he recounted. Roy, who was in a nearby supermarket, said, 'The gunmen fired indiscriminately at a shop. I later saw them fleeing toward northern Jaffa. The street was strewn with injured people.' Mohammed El-Sayed, a florist on the street, witnessed the light rail stopping in front of his shop. 'A woman got off the train screaming. I ran inside and saw a wounded baby, other injured people, and some who were dead. It’s a terrible feeling to witness this scene. It’s a sad and difficult day. Everyone was heading home, preparing for the holiday, and they didn’t make it back. We tried to help as much as we could. We were selling flowers for the holiday, and then this tragedy happened,' he said. Israel Police Commissioner Daniel Levy arrived at the scene, calling it 'a difficult event' and saying, 'Every call we receive is being checked. We had no prior intelligence on this attack. We know the identity of the gunmen and are handling the matter with the Shin Bet security service.' Tel Aviv District Police Commander Peretz Amar provided further details, confirming that the two attackers boarded the light rail, opened fire inside, and then continued shooting on the street. 'The attackers were neutralized by rail security guards, the municipal Special Operations Unit, and police officers,' Amar said. The shooting, which took place on Jerusalem Boulevard, left seven people dead and 16 others injured, some critically. A preliminary investigation revealed that the attackers first opened fire on light rail passengers before targeting pedestrians. Security forces shot and killed the two gunmen. The wounded were transported by Magen David Adom teams to Wolfson Medical Center in Holon and Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, police ruled out the presence of additional gunmen at the Sharon Hotel in Herzliya, following earlier concerns.

Sullivan: Iranian missile attack on Israel 'defeated and ineffect...	US national security advisor says attack successfully thwarted thanks to professional response of IDF and coordinated efforts of US military forces U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel did not result in any deaths or known damage to aircraft or strategic military assets. 'Based on what we know, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,' Sullivan said during a White House briefing. Sullivan emphasized that the U.S. military worked closely with Israel in the defense effort, which included American naval destroyers assisting in intercepting the missiles. He added that the U.S. continues to work with the IDF and Israeli authorities to assess the full impact of the attack. Iran launched over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening, and Israeli and American officials are investigating the reported death of a Palestinian in Jericho, believed to be linked to the missile fire. Sullivan credited the limited damage and lack of casualties to the professionalism of the IDF and the joint defense preparations with U.S. forces. 'We will consult with Israelis on the next steps, including how to respond and monitor further threats from Iran and its proxies,' he said. Earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden warned Iran of severe consequences if it attacked Israel. 'This is a significant escalation by Iran,' Sullivan told reporters. 'It is equally significant that no one was killed in this attack, thanks to our coordinated efforts with Israel. We have made it clear that there will be severe consequences for this attack.' International condemnation followed the strike. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock strongly condemned Iran’s missile barrage, urging an immediate halt to the attack and warning of its dangerous escalation. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office also condemned the missile strike, calling for de-escalation across the region. Starmer reportedly spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan’s King Abdullah II, according to Sky News. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkqt5ttrr	2024-10-01T13:20:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/SJT40TKC0/SJT40TKC0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg
Blast rocks Tel Aviv, wall of fire in Negev: Dramatic footage fro...	Ballistic missile interceptions from Iran captured across Israel; multiple impacts recorded in Negev, while blast wave damages restaurant in northern Tel Aviv; large crater found at heavily damaged school in Gedera Approximately 180 ballistic missiles were launched from Iran toward Israel on Tuesday, sparking widespread defense operations across the country. The attack mirrored a similar large-scale strike in April, with dramatic footage emerging from various locations, including Gaza and Jordan, showing Israel’s defense systems intercepting the missiles and documenting some of the impacts. One particularly striking video from the Negev in southern Israel, which was reportedly targeted by Iran, showed a series of explosions lighting up the night sky, with multiple plumes of smoke resembling a wall of blasts. Footage of high-altitude missile interceptions, similar to those from April’s attack, was captured across Israel, including in Samaria, Jerusalem and southern regions. In another scene, filmed from the coastal city of Herzliya, a large explosion was visible, though no direct impact was reported in the city. However, a missile struck an open area in northern Tel Aviv, with the blast wave causing significant damage to a restaurant. In Gedera, a missile made a direct hit on the Chabad Flame School, leaving a large crater outside the building and causing heavy damage. The school, part of a growing network of Chabad institutions, educates nearly 400 students. 'Just thinking about how hundreds of students were here just hours ago, learning about Rosh Hashanah—it’s a huge miracle,' said the network’s director Rabbi Eliyahu Krichovsky. The Magen David Adom ambulance service (MDA) reported that two people in the Tel Aviv area were lightly wounded by shrapnel. Minor injuries were also reported nationwide, mainly from people running to shelters or suffering from shock. The missile interceptions and impacts were widely shared on social media, even in Gaza and Jordan. In the West Bank, large missile fragments were found in the town of Sanur near Jenin, while in the Jericho area, a Palestinian worker from Gaza was reportedly killed by a missile strike. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement: 'We carried out numerous interceptions, and there have been only a few direct hits. We do not detect any additional aerial threats at this time, which is why we have issued instructions to leave the shelters.' He urged the public to refrain from sharing information or footage, adding, 'We are maintaining a high level of readiness and will continue to protect Israel's citizens.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk727tk0c	2024-10-01T12:56:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/SybAN3KA0/SybAN3KA0_0_276_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
IDF mobilizes 4 reserve brigades to fight on Lebanon front	Army says mobilization will support ongoing combat efforts against Hezbollah and achievement of war objectives, including safe return of northern residents home The IDF has called up four reserve brigades and additional forces for operational tasks in northern Israel, the army said on Tuesday following a situational assessment 'Their mobilization will support the ongoing combat efforts against Hezbollah and the achievement of the war's objectives, including the safe return of northern residents to their homes,' a statement said. Earlier, the IDF revealed that over the past few months, 70 covert operations were conducted inside Lebanon to disrupt Hezbollah's preparations for its plan to conquer Israel's Galilee region. According to the IDF, special forces crossed the border dozens of times, destroying Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure, including underground facilities. The forces gathered intelligence and neutralized advanced weaponry, including Iranian-made arms. 'During these operations, IDF forces neutralized more than 700 targets,' the spokesperson said. Troops raided villages and dense terrain, breached underground sites along the border and uncovered weapon caches, terrorist staging areas and more. Throughout these missions, the forces gathered valuable intelligence and systematically destroyed weapons and sites, including underground infrastructures and advanced arms, many of which were Iranian-made. 'Over the course of 200 nights and hundreds of days, and through dozens of operations in enemy territory, the forces uncovered, neutralized and destroyed underground complexes, struck thousands of military targets and dismantled weapon storage facilities, including tons of explosives, terrorist hideouts, and command centers,' the army added. Some of the weaponry was brought back to Israel. The IDF continues to degrade Hezbollah's capabilities and infrastructure and push the group away from the border, ensuring the safe return of northern residents. In a special briefing, the IDF displayed a map found in one of the sites, showing Hezbollah's plans for a Galilee invasion. 'The map includes a legend marking Israeli communities and targets for attack, all of which Hezbollah intended to capture,' an army spokesperson said. 'Their plan was to invade Israeli territory, much like Hamas did. Our operations throughout the war have severely damaged their ability to carry this out. Israel has made clear that Hezbollah's attacks will have severe consequences, yet the group continues to risk Lebanon in a broader conflict.' Findings from the covert operations included massive explosives meant to breach the border wall, along with thousands of rockets and weapons hidden in tunnels and basements along the border, intended for Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces to invade Israel. 'We've dealt a heavy blow to Radwan, but the threats have not been fully eliminated, which is why we've launched divisional operations,' the spokesperson said. Earlier on Tuesday, sirens sounded across a series of towns in Gush Dan, the Sharon region and Samaria. For the first time in this war, a significant barrage was fired at central Israel from Lebanon. According to the IDF, three to five rockets were likely launched, some of which were intercepted. Magen David Adom (MDA) reported three injuries, including a bus driver in his 50s who was hit by shrapnel in the head near Highway 444, close to the Horashim interchange. Two other people sustained light injuries. Hezbollah has fired rockets at several northern communities, including Safed. The terror group claimed that some of the attacks targeted IDF troop gatherings. No injuries were reported, though impacts and interceptions were recorded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyi3vtkr0	2024-10-01T12:14:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/S1WC88UFA0/S1WC88UFA0_0_205_1970_1108_0_small.jpg

Israeli officials vow Jerusalem will not stand idle following barrage of over 200 missiles fired across country; Tehran says 'fully prepared for any retaliation' Senior Israeli officials made it clear Tuesday evening that Israel will not remain silent in response to Iran's massive missile attack. A security official vowed that 'there will be a severe response,' while another Israeli official stated, 'What Iran has faced so far is just a fraction of what it will face now.' A high-ranking government official added, 'Israel has every legitimacy to deliver an unprecedented strike on Iranian soil—now is the time to strike at the head of the Iranian snake.' Preliminary assessments suggest that tonight’s Iranian attack involved the launch of over 200 ballistic missiles. In recent days, Israel repeatedly warned that any attack by Tehran would be met with a harsh response, and earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. also warned Iran of 'severe consequences' if it launched an attack. Against this backdrop, Israel issued its retaliatory threats this evening. Meanwhile, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, adding that Tehran 'is fully ready for any retaliation,' and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei remains in a secure location after Tehran fired missiles at Israel. Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards added that they launched tens of missiles toward Israel and warned that if Israel retaliated Tehran's response would be 'more crushing and destructive', Iranian state TV reported. 'After a period of restraint, Iran has targeted the heart of the occupied territories with tens of missiles following the martyrdom of (Hamas leader) Ismail Haniyeh ... the intensification of the Zionist regime's attacks on Lebanon and Gaza, the martyrdom of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and (of) Guards Commander Abbas Nilforoushan.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkb3z2f0c	2024-10-01T11:14:35-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/Syyf2oYAR/Syyf2oYAR_0_133_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Military spokesperson says troops uncovered and destroyed underground infrastructure, struck thousands of targets and hundreds of weapons storage facilities, tons of explosives 'Since the beginning of the war, the IDF has conducted dozens of targeted operations in areas near the border in southern Lebanon in order to dismantle Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure that pose a threat to Israeli civilian communities in northern Israel,' The IDF said on Tuesday. The announcement was made a day after IDF troops began a land offensive, described as limited in scope, into Lebanon. Some of the operations were carried out up to 10 kilometers north of the border and according to military plans, 15 years in the making. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's plan was for Radwan units numbering 4,000 to 6,000 men, disguised as civilians, to enter the area where equipment had been placed awaiting them to invade border area communities and abduct soldiers. They were divided into groups, each numbering hundreds in battalions responsible for specific locations along the 135-kilometer (84 miles) border from the shore to the foothills of the Golan Heights. The military said that based on precise intelligence, troops conducted targeted operations against Hezbollah compounds to dismantle the military capabilities of the terror group's Radwan force and prevent them from invading Israel as Hamas did on October 7. 'The soldiers identified and breached underground access points near the border area, exposed extensive weapon caches, assembly areas for terrorist operative operations, and more. During these operations, the troops also collected valuable intelligence and methodically dismantled the weapons and compounds, including underground infrastructure and advanced weaponry of Iranian origin,' the statement went on to say. 'The troops also uncovered and destroyed underground infrastructure, struck thousands of targets and hundreds of weapons storage facilities, tons of explosives, and hundreds of living areas for operatives, command centers and more. Some of the weapons were recovered and taken by the soldiers back into Israeli territory.' The IDF believes a few hundred Radwan troops remain active in the area and some 1,000 are further north near the Litani River and the coast. Most Radwan fighters fled north of the Litani, the military said. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that there are many villages in the border region of South Lebanon that have terror infrastructure in them and that the military's offensive was ongoing although he could not say how long it would last. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryziyuk0a	2024-10-01T06:32:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/BJziXXvYR0/BJziXXvYR0_0_0_1280_720_0_small.jpg

IDF intercepts drone Houthis say was aimed at 'military target in...	Military reports Yemeni threat intercepted kilometers off of Israel's shores; terror group says launched five drones toward several Israeli areas The IDF reported early Tuesday morning that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) intercepted a UAV over the Mediterranean Sea, dozens of kilometers west of Israel's coast in the central part of the country. On Tuesday, Yemen’s Houthis said they had launched a total of five drones overnight, four toward Eilat and another toward a 'military target in Jaffa.' In the Houthis' statement, they claimed to have attacked an 'Israeli military target in Jaffa (Tel Aviv area)' using a 'Jaffa' drone model. They also claimed to have aimed at 'military targets in Eilat using four 'Samad 4' model drones.' The Houthis' drone launches toward Israeli territory took place just over a day after another extensive Israeli strike in Yemen, approximately 1,800 km (1,118 mi) from Israel. The IDF Spokespersons Unit reported the strike was a large-scale operation involving dozens of aircraft, including fighter jets, refueling planes and intelligence aircraft which, under the guidance of the IDF Military Intelligence Directorate, attacked military targets used by the Houthis. Power stations and a seaport used for importing oil were targeted in the attack. Further, the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported the Houthis transferred Iranian weapons to the area as well as supplies for military needs and oil using the targeted infrastructure and ports. 'The strike was carried out in response to the recent attacks launched by the Houthi regime against Israel,' the IDF said in a statement. In response to the strikes, the Houthis began issuing threats against Israel, while also attempting to downplay the strike’s outcomes. 'The Israeli strikes on Hodeidah port and the power station won’t cause Yemen to stop its military operations,' a source told the Lebanese network Al-Mayadeen. 'Attacks on civilian targets will be met with attacks on civilian targets and the enemy should be aware of this. Yemen's bank of targets deep inside Israel is large and strategic,' the terror group added. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1s3buyc0	2024-10-01T05:29:26-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/19/SJY973vuR/SJY973vuR_0_181_535_302_0_small.jpg
Mediators try to entice Sinwar to make deal in light of Israeli a...	U.S. State Department spokesperson says no contact with Hamas leader for weeks despite efforts by mediators to receive response to proposals; Officials say the Hamas chief may see Iran desert Hezbollah and reconsider ; Assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is message to Sinwar that Israel will reach him too Israel was trying to leverage its latest achievements in its war against Hezbollah in Lebanon to prompt Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to agree to a cease-fire and hostage-release deal. Although rumors that he had been killed persist, and on Sunday the IDF released a photo showing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi at his desk with an infographic in the background featuring a picture of Sinwar with a question mark over his face, Israeli officials believe he is alive. It appears that a deal that would see the return of 101 Israelis dead and alive, who are still captive in Gaza, is not currently possible but the mediators are trying to entice Hamas, although they are getting no response. U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller also said in a briefing to reporters on Monday that the terror group has been unresponsive. He said talks with Israel were continuing but that Hamas has been incommunicado for weeks. Sinwar had hoped for a multi-front war against Israel that would drag the region into a broader conflict that includes missile fire from Iran, Israeli officials said. they believe that is why he would be in no hurry to make a deal. The assassination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is a message to him that Israel will reach him too and that by agreeing to a cease-fire deal he may be able to save his life. But much depends on Iran's actions. If it is deterred and does not shower Israel with missiles, Sinwar may conclude that just as Tehran turned its back on Hezbollah, its most valued proxy in the north, he too would be abandoned. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skqknlfc0	2024-10-01T05:24:53-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/02/22/Syb3UZ0Nhp/Syb3UZ0Nhp_0_0_1300_732_0_small.jpg

Soldiers hurt in Nablus raid as IDF eyes potential surge in West ...	Military bolsters deployment ahead of the Jewish High Holidays and anniversary of Hamas massacre while pushing ahead with anti-terror operations that have already killed 100 terrorists An IDF soldier was seriously wounded and three others suffered moderate injuries when troops clashed with terrorists during an operation in Nablus that began on Sunday. The military said the forces killed Abed Shahin, a terrorist responsible for attacks against forces, in the West Bank and for enlisting more operatives in the area around Nablus to carry out more attacks. The counter-terrorism operations on the West Bank are not slowing down. On the contrary according to the Head of the Central Command Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth. Since the military launched its efforts to counter the surge of terror attacks late in August in attacks that murdered seven Israelis, some 100 terrorists have been killed and many others arrested. Since then security forces have responded to the growing use of IED in the refugee camps. Troops confiscated materials that can be used to produce explosives such as fertilizers, destroyed explosives labs and arrested terror operatives connected with the supply chains that enable the production of such weapons. The military regard their achievement as critical and the IDF has bolstered its troop deployment to the area and currently has 25 battalions dedicated to the West Bank. The events in Gaza and Lebanon, including the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, impact the events on the ground, a security official. But the coming month of Jewish holidays and October 7, which will mark a year since the Hamas massacre, are of greatest concern for the IDF, over efforts to destabilize security on the West Bank and the security forces including the Shin Bet are concentrating their efforts to prevent any such events. Palestinian sources said that in the past month dozens of armed terrorists have surrendered to the Palestinian Authority Security Services (PA) including in the Nablus and Jenin refugee camps. The PA is trying to project to the world an ability to rule over the West Bank cities, to legitimize its possible future rule over Gaza after the war. Palestinian officials are concerned over the sanctions imposed on them by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich that have financial ramifications for the PA, and his threats to penalize Israeli banks that service the PA, which would cause further harm. A security official said there is currently a tense routine. 'We've seen marches of armed men and attempts to enlist support for Hezbollah and Hamas continues ceaselessly to control the Palestinian street and prompt mass riots. Until now, those efforts have not succeeded by but that does not mean they won't later. We are facing tense days. The West Bank can ignite at any moment.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk2qqxycc	2024-10-01T04:01:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/yk14100932/yk14100932_0_0_468_264_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah turned villages into bases': IDF captures key areas in...	Limited ground operation in Lebanon begins with forces and tanks entering southern Lebanon alongside air support; IDF top spokesperson reviews move, criticizes UN inaction The IDF’s ground operation in southern Lebanon began overnight between Monday and Tuesday with a covert crossing under the cover of heavy air and artillery strikes that lasted throughout the night. Forces consisting of three brigade combat teams that previously fought together in the Gaza Strip have secured dominant areas in southern Lebanon in the initial move. The combat teams are expected to encounter resistance from Hezbollah terrorists, as well as advanced anti-tank threats. However, the fact that the IDF has been attacking hundreds of targets in the areas into which the forces entered for nearly a year is expected to ease their operations during the fighting. 'The Israel Defense Forces is conducting limited and targeted raids along Israel’s northern border against the threat that Hezbollah poses to civilians in northern Israel. These localized ground raids will target Hezbollah strongholds that threaten Israeli towns, kibbutzim and communities along our border,' IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement to the foreign press on Tuesday. 'Hezbollah turned Lebanese villages next to Israeli villages into military bases all ready for an attack on Israel. Hezbollah had prepared to use those villages as staging grounds for an October 7-style invasion into Israeli homes. Hezbollah planned to invade Israel, attack Israeli communities and massacre innocent men, women and children. They called this plan ‘Conquer the Galilee,'' he said. Hagari also criticized the UN, the international community and Lebanon. 'For decades, UN Security Council resolutions have called on Lebanon to make sure that its territory is free of non-governmental armed groups. UN Security Council resolution 1701 from 2006, agreed upon by Israel and Lebanon, requires that there be no armed personnel assets and weapons other than those of the government of Lebanon and UNIFIL in southern Lebanon. Eighteen years after 1701, Hezbollah is the world's largest non-state army, and southern Lebanon is swarming with Hezbollah terrorists and weapons.' 'If the State of Lebanon and the world can't push Hezbollah away from our border, we have no choice but to do it ourselves. I want to make it clear: Our war is with Hezbollah, not with the people of Lebanon. We do not want to harm Lebanese civilians and we're taking measures to prevent that. We will not let the 7th of October happen again on any one of our borders. We will continue doing whatever necessary so that Israeli families can return to their homes in safety and security,' he added. The limited ground operation in Lebanon was approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet Mondaynight. During the discussion, ministers expressed frustration over leaks that reached the U.S. about the maneuver after they were briefed on the matter by Israel. Some ministers questioned why the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit addressed the maneuver even before the cabinet discussion and were told it was necessary to address various reports in the foreign media. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1ohcntrc	2024-10-01T03:06:30-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/rkHa8QtRA/rkHa8QtRA_0_153_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Terror group says fired Nour ballistic missile for first time toward the Galilee; Arab reports suggest missile isn't ballistic but anti-naval munition supplied by Iran; Here's what it can do Hezbollah announced on Monday that it fired one of its Nour missiles at Israel for the first time, claiming it was used in an attack on the Galilee. The terrorist organization didn’t provide specific details about the missile, but an Iranian missile carries the same name, which Tehran is believed to supply to its proxies including Hezbollah. According to a report by the Saudi television network Al Arabiya, the terrorist group had previously unveiled its Nour missiles last year, showing a video of anti-ship missile launch platforms in its possession. Al Arabiya added technical details about the missile. According to previous Iranian reports, the Nour missile is an Iranian cruise missile designed for anti-ship combat – an improved version of the Chinese C801 and C802 missiles. The missile is considered one of the earliest models in Iran's military industry, having been introduced by Iranian forces in 1991. Additionally, the missile has a range of up to 170 kilometers (105 miles), a length of 6.38 meters (20.9 feet), a diameter of 36 centimeters (14.2 inches), and a weight of 715 kilograms (1,576 pounds), including a warhead weighing 165 kilograms (364 pounds). The missile operates on solid fuel and has an estimated speed of 0.9 Mach. Al Arabiya claimed that Hezbollah used Nour missiles to strike the Israeli Navy ship INS Hanit in 2006. Boaz Shapira, a researcher at the Alma Research and Education Center focusing on security challenges on Israel’s northern border, said the missile flies at a relatively low altitude over the sea, making detection and interception difficult. According to the institute, the missile has undergone modifications over the years, extending its maximum range to 200 kilometers (124 miles) and improving its guidance systems. It can be launched from sea, air or land platforms. Despite reports from some sources suggesting that the Nour missile used by Hezbollah was a ballistic missile, it seems to be the known Iranian cruise missile, which isn’t ballistic. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by0snxfr0	2024-10-01T02:01:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/24/H1QiZzIeRR/H1QiZzIeRR_0_313_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Tehran fumbles as world wonders about integrity of its 'axis of r...	International outlets raise doubts about Tehran's decades-long project across the Middle East, reporting that it is crumbling amid Nasrallah's assassination International reports have been covering Israel’s war since October 7, 2023, which also involved its conflict against Iran-backed Hezbollah on the northern border. Now, with Hezbollah leadership decimated and amid IDF entrance into Lebanon, the outlets are wondering whether Tehran's 'axis of resistance' made up of its proxies across the Middle East is falling apart. 'Iran came up with the strategy and invested tremendous resources to build each group’s fighting abilities and connect them to one another,' a New York Times article on the topic published on Monday read. 'But the axis’ response as Israel has pummeled Hezbollah in Lebanon in recent weeks — killing many of its commanders and assassinating its leader — has so far been feeble, suggesting that the axis is weaker and more fragmented than many in the region had expected and that Iran feared that widening the war could cause Israel to turn its firepower on Tehran,' it added. According to the American outlet: 'The idea was simple: When a big war with Israel broke out, all the members of the Iranian-backed network of militias in the Middle East known as the ‘axis of resistance’ would join the fight in a coordinated push toward their shared goal of destroying the Jewish state.' Hezbollah was a senior member of Iran’s axis, and the terror organization's Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike last week, was a leading figure. He had close ties to Iran and served as a 'role model' for leaders of other pro-Iranian militias. According to the outlet, his assassination 'badly shaken' the remaining members of the axis, who were likely unprepared for Hezbollah to suffer such significant losses. At this point, the international community still hasn't fully understood why other members of Iran’s alliance didn’t aid Hezbollah in recent weeks. It appears that most of them believed the Shiite terror organization from Lebanon 'could hold its own against Israel.' Additionally, Iran's vague and unclear response following the strike has left doubts in other members of Tehran’s spiderweb. The New York Times reviewed the involvement of these militias and noted it took Syria two days to issue a statement on Nasrallah's death, despite Hezbollah sending thousands of terrorists to help them fight the country’s civil war which set off in 2011. Hamas, after a year of fighting in Gaza, is incapable of doing much to help. Yemen’s Houthis and militias in Syria and Iraq launched attacks on Israel or U.S. bases in the Middle East, but most were thwarted. Two pro-Iranian militias’ commanders in Iraq said that they 'had received no instructions from Iran on how to respond. Everyone was still in shock at Nasrallah’s killing.' NBC also addressed the issue in an article titled 'Is Iran's ‘axis of resistance’ collapsing under Israeli attacks?' In an extensive report on the activities of Iran's pro-Iranian militias, the outlet wrote that 'Israeli airstrikes that wiped out Hezbollah’s top leadership and left its internal security in tatters are a devastating blow to Iran’s decades-long project.' This project, according to former U.S. intelligence officials who spoke with NBC, took decades to build and aimed to project power in the Middle East via Iran's proxy network. Iran viewed Hezbollah as a cornerstone of its strategic plan to arm proxies in various regions across the Middle East. In addition to arming Hezbollah and terror groups in Gaza, militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen were also armed, allowing Iran to one day attack Israel through its proxies and avoid direct confrontation. According to former intelligence officials, however, Iran miscalculated Israel's response to the events and overestimated the strength of the proxy network it built — leading to its collapse. According to NBC, Israel began targeting the Iran-backed Houthis after it dealt heavy blows to Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This Iranian militia in Yemen had made numerous threats against Israel since the war began, attacked ships connected to Israel and launched missiles and drones toward Israeli territory. However, they were also hit twice in significant airstrikes by Israeli fighter jets in retaliation. Meanwhile, as Iran's militias suffer consequent blows, Tehran shows no willingness or intent to intervene in the conflict directly. Although they frequently threaten Israel with a harsh response, they also stressed Hezbollah's capabilities, asserting the terror group can handle the situation alone. 'All the resistance forces in the region support and stand alongside Hezbollah,' Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said following the terror group chief’s death. ' The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront.' According to former intelligence and defense officials, however, this decision could cost Tehran dearly as it raises questions among other militias about Iranian support when it’s needed. The New York Times reported on growing uncertainty surrounding Iran's response to Nasrallah's assassination, which represents the most severe blow Israel has delivered not only to the terror group but also to Iran's entire axis. According to the report, there are disagreements within the Ayatollah regime on the nature of the response against Israel, with more extreme factions calling for a swift retaliation to 'deter' Jerusalem, while more moderate elements, including Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, advocate avoiding what they claim is an 'Israeli trap.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkplxmkcc	2024-10-01T00:26:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/09/By6dSUhn0/By6dSUhn0_0_1_850_479_0_small.jpg

US backs 'limited operation' in Lebanon	US Defense Secretary says he agrees on the need to 'dismantle attack infrastructure along the border' so Hezbollah can't mount 'October 7-style attacks' on north Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke overnight with his U.S. counterpart, Lloyd Austin , and they agreed 'on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hezballah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel's northern communities, according to a readout of the conversation issued by the Pentagon. The statement came hours after U.S. President expressed reservations about a ground operation when asked by reporters whether he was 'comfortable' with Israel's plans to enter Lebanon. 'I’m more aware than you might know and I’m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now,' he said on Monday. Austin made it clear that Washington supports Israel's right to defend itself and reiterated that 'a diplomatic resolution is required to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border.' The Defense Secretary also made it clear that the US intends to protect its people and allies in the region against threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations, and that it is determined to prevent any player from exploiting the tensions or expanding the conflict. Austin once again warned the regime in Tehran, in the shadow of his threats, discussing with Gallant 'the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel.' The White House also expressed support for the limited ground operation in Lebanon, officially confirmed overnight by the IDF. However, the White House referred to what it called the 'risk' of a prolonged invasion which is currently defined as a 'targeted' operation.' The administration said it is holding discussions on the issue with Israel and is pushing for a diplomatic solution. Austin reiterated this in his conversation with Gallant, saying that 'a diplomatic resolution is required to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border.' He and Gallant 'discussed the importance of ultimately pivoting from military operations to a diplomatic pathway to provide security and stability as soon as feasible.' The IDF announced overnight that it had begun a 'targeted ground operation' against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, after the political-security cabinet approved on Monday night the next phase of the operation in Lebanon. The IDF spokesman said in a statement that overnight the IDF began 'limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon. These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel.' 'The IDF is operating according to a methodical plan set out by the General Staff and the Northern Command which IDF soldiers have trained and prepared for in recent months. The Israeli Air Force and IDF Artillery are supporting the ground forces with precise strikes on military targets in the area. These operations were approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon. Operation Northern Arrows' will continue according to the situational assessment and in parallel to combat in Gaza and in other arenas,' the IDF also said. 'The IDF is continuing to operate to achieve the goals of the war and is doing everything necessary to defend the citizens of Israel and return the citizens of northern Israel to their homes,' it concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1i11qlta0	2024-09-30T21:58:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/01/HkUSscu0C/HkUSscu0C_0_34_800_450_0_small.jpg

Ground op in Lebanon will be more complex then Gaza, IDF says	Amid reports that IDF has crossed Lebanese border, senior IDF officer tells Ynet: 'The soldiers felt like caged lions. Everyone understands that there is no other way to return northern residents to their home except to physically remove Hezbollah from the border' The 36th Division of the Northern Command have already had time to forget about its maneuvers in Shejaiya neighborhood of Gaza City at the beginning of the year and the opening of the Netzarim Corridor for the first time in November. The fighters of the Golani and 188th Brigades deployed on the Lebanese border in recent months have completed the final preparations to cross the border for the first time since the summer of 2006, and they are not alone. The IDF's elite 98th Division, which led the raids in the Gaza Strip as part of the third phase of the fight against Hamas, was diverted to the north in the last month, and in recent days the IDF has made several significant decisions and changes regarding its preparations, the purpose of which was to speed up and complete the preparations for the ground operation against Hezbollah. 'We have crossed the Rubicon; battalions and brigades are deep in combat procedures, entire reserve units have carried out successful brigade exercises and adjustments from Gaza to Lebanon. We are far from a decision to enter Lebanon,' a senior IDF officer assessed earlier Monday in a conversation with Ynet. 'The soldiers are determined and alert; We also trained under fire in the north and there are fighters here who performed Sisyphean defense tasks and felt like caged lions. The great IDF trained and prepared and equipped over the years for the mastermind of enemy number one - Hezbollah.' At the political level there are those who are still debating and hesitating about whether to use the ground punch against Hezbollah in addition to the blows that the Shia terrorist army keeps taking from the Air Force. The IDF, for its part, presented to the cabinet renewed confidence in the infantry and tank soldiers who fought inside Gaza for many months and, despite the great attrition, many of the regiments, regular and reserve, have been re-energized and strengthened. 'The soldiers understand that there is no choice and this is the feeling among the commanders as well - there is no other way to return the residents of the north to their homes other than physically removing Hezbollah from the border area, and this can only be done with a ground entry,' said the senior officer. Two preliminary signs of the operation have arrived in recent days: a report in the Wall Street Journal indicating that elite units of the IDF conducted preliminary raids in southern Lebanon, and a call by the IDF to the few residents remaining in towns and villages, such as in the Mount Dov area, to evacuate. The IDF is also expected to convince the political echelon that the conditions for such a move are much better today than in October or November, based on the following data: the thousands of regular daily attacks by the Northern Command on Hezbollah's infrastructure and positions in southern Lebanon that have depleted a high percentage of the capabilities with which it was prepared to operate against the IDF; The removal of thousands of skilled Radwan force operatives to the north of the Litani River (one can assume that their movement back south will be detected by the IDF and will result in them being fired on); the evacuation of most of the Lebanese and Israeli citizens from the border areas and the severe blow that Hezbollah suffered in the pager attack and the elimination of its senior commanders which fatally damaged its command and control capabilities on ground combat operations against the IDF. And yet, the IDF states, this will be a more difficult and complex maneuver than the one against Hamas, since Hezbollah has not yet used some of its capabilities, including the underground bunkers reserved for fighting against the IDF. It is estimated that the IDF has several options for ground action: the largest Includes an extensive reach up to the center of Lebanon, where Hezbollah has military outposts in the form of many launchers of precision missiles and long-range rockets and probably also facilities for the production of weapons. Last month, the IDF announced for the first time that its plans also include the possibility of operations deep in Lebanon. The forces of the 98th Division, including the regular and reserve paratrooper brigades as well as the commando brigade (which went up almost entirely to the north) have the ability to perform with the capabilities of a prolonged independent stay in enemy territory without supplies. Another alternative is a limited operation, in the style of Operation Protective Edge in Gaza in 2014, to clear Hezbollah's presence in the kilometers adjacent to the border and occupy the territory in them until a cease-fire agreement is reached that will include the full withdrawal of the Lebanese army to these areas that observe and control the rockets trained on the Israeli side. 'That's the only way, when the residents see it with their own eyes and don't just hear about assassinations from afar and numbers of targets that were attacked from the air, trust will allow the return of the children to their homes after what happened on October 7,' a security official said Monday. There are those in the political elite who hesitate and hope that the international community led by the U.S. and France will now impose a cease-fire that will include implementation of UN Resolution 1701 from the end of the Second Lebanon War, which prohibits the presence of Hezbollah south of the Litani River. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has already hinted that his position is similar to that of the IDF, and he pushed with all his might to approve a ground operation against Hezbollah. The IDF will demand to proactively and aggressively enforce any such agreement in the future, even in days of calm, and to damage the establishment of a renewed position or presence of Hezbollah near the border; this goes against the government's policy of containment over the years, which allowed the Shiite terrorist organization to fully establish itself in southern Lebanon and its terrorists to reach the perimeter fence, alongside the establishment of dozens of terrorist outposts in front of the houses of Shlomi, Kiryat Shmona and Metula. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s18k9f00ca	2024-09-30T15:02:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/HkeWQ6pM0C/HkeWQ6pM0C_0_43_1601_901_0_small.jpg

At the cabinet meeting, ministers protested the leaks that came out the U.S. officials about the maneuver, after they received an update from Israel. Ministers also asked why the IDF spokesman referred to the operation even before the debate began.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjs00zqdr0	2024-09-30T14:07:23-07:00	
CNN reporter flies aboard Israeli tanker during Yemen strike	Nic Robertson was granted special permission to board a refueling plane that took part in the Yemen strike operation against the Houthis, Israel's longest-range mission in nearly 40 years; 'I had no idea what the destination was, an hour and a half after takeoff they showed me the map and then I realized - it's Hodeida port' CNN correspondent Nic Robertson received special permission to board a refueling aircraft that was part of Israel's strike mission in Yemen on Sunday. These are some of his impressions about the unique experience: 'Aboard an aging Boeing 707, thousands of feet above the Red Sea, I don a set of high-tech 3D goggles and stare at the small TV monitor recessed in a bank of retro dials and switches,' he said. 'Saudi Arabia’s amber desert slides by to my right, Egypt’s coast to my left, and then a monstrous F35 fighter jet fills the tiny screen. I am with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) – the first foreign journalist to be taken on a combat mission more than a thousand miles from Israel aboard a fighter jet refuel tanker,' he continued. 'Israel’s invitation to join this mission came with no detail about the plane’s destination. As I climb the plane’s rickety steps, I have no idea where I am going or what this IDF flight will reveal about military operations.' 'Israeli Air Force security regulations are so tight neither I nor Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, the IDF spokesman accompanying me, are allowed to bring our cellphones aboard. Neither am I allowed to bring a camera or photojournalist.' 'Except for the cockpit, I have access to the more than 50-year-old former commercial airliner, and its commanders, under the condition that they not be named. Flying 1,200 miles (1,500 kilometers), the refueling mission I discover I am joining is the IDF’s longest-range combat mission since a 1985 raid on Tunis,' Robertson said. 'For more than an hour and half, Israeli F35 fighter jets, each worth more than $100 million, close in behind the 707 tanker, nudging toward its trailing fuel pipe. The squadron commander, a 15-year refueling veteran, stares through his 3D goggles, merging two camera images. He jockeys the two long levers beside his seat and steers the nozzle toward the gas-hungry fighter jet’s fuel port.' 'When he shows me a map of the mission, I realize we are on the way to Hodeidah Port in Yemen, controlled by Houthi rebels, backed by Iran. Shoshani tells me the reason for this mission, is that over the past two weeks the Houthis have fired three long-range missiles, all intercepted near Tel Aviv.' 'As the last of the F35s decouple from the fuel feed, the squadron commander visibly eases in his seat, pushes back his goggles, and stretches his shoulders. Each jet is on the nozzle for about 3 minutes, requiring intense focus,' he continued. 'We begin circling, waiting for fighter pilots to deliver their payloads. Any attack from the ground could cost them vital fuel as they try to evade being shot down and require a refill to get back to base.' 'Twenty minutes later we’re headed north, no top-ups needed. I ask the lead pilot on the tanker, a reservist veteran aviator, about the challenges of such a mission and his feelings when civilians are killed. 'We don’t want to kill civilians, he tells me, and we use all the intelligence we have to avoid it.'' 'On the flight, Shoshani told me the message was for Iran too, a warning that while Israel is bracing for retaliatory strikes from Hezbollah in Lebanon, they want the group’s sponsor, Iran, to stay out of the fight,' he concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy72ey000a	2024-09-30T14:01:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/ByzKO06DCR/ByzKO06DCR_405_226_561_316_0_small.jpg

Ground operation in Lebanon begins with heavy artillery, tank fir...	After over 11 months, IDF goes on attack: US announces Israel is 'carrying out limited ground activity along border'; Residents of Kiryat Shmona and surrounding area ordered to stay near protected area Almost a year after the beginning of Hezbollah's incessant fire at Israeli communities, the IDF is crossing the northern border; according to the U.S. State Department, Israel is 'currently carrying out limited operations along the border.' On the Saudi Al-Hadath network a report said that there is 'Israeli preparation for the entry of ground forces and commando forces, in order to locate Hezbollah targets and blow them up.' Another Saudi network, Al-Arabiya reported that tanks penetrated Rmaich in southern Lebanon, but later deleted that report. Residents of Kiryat Shmona and other localities in the area were called to stay near a protected area, against the backdrop of the dramatic developments, which come after the series of assassinations in Lebanon including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. According to reports in Lebanon, the Lebanese army has cleared positions along the border and videos have been published of the withdrawal of troops from border posts to some neighboring villages. Shas chairman Aryeh Deri was the first politician to allude to the ground move when he posted on Twitter the prayer for the welfare of IDF soldiers. A U.S. official told the Washington Post earlier Monday that Israel was preparing to launch a ground attack in Lebanon imminently, but it is expected to be limited. 'Israel’s planned campaign would be smaller than its last war against Hezbollah in 2006 and would focus on clearing out terrorist infrastructure along the border to remove the threat to Israeli border communities,' the source said. The report came as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that 'the next phase will begin soon.' Another U.S. told the CBS news network that Israel has informed the U.S. that it intends to begin the ground maneuver phase, and that it 'may take place within hours.' At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden called for a cease-fire. When asked if he 'feels comfortable' with Israel's plan, he said: 'I’m more worried than you might know and I’m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now.' The New York Times cited U.S. officials who said that they believe they have succeeded in convincing Israel not to launch a major ground attack in Lebanon, after long talks held over the weekend. In the United States, signs were detected that Israel intended to launch a maneuver in Lebanon and that it could come soon. Special units in the IDF have already carried out such raids in recent days, in order to remove combat positions from which Hezbollah planned to target the northern settlements. According to the report, officials in Israel assured their counterparts in the United States that they do not plan for these raids to lead to a major attack by ground forces with the aim of occupying parts of southern Lebanon. The American officials said that they estimate that the commando units will withdraw immediately after the operations is over. However, according to the report, it is still unclear whether this is the final Israeli decision and if there is still a possibility of a large-scale attack. Another hint that the incursion could happen at any moment was given by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who met Monday with mayors of Israeli northern border communities. In a conversation with them, Gallant said that 'the next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon; it will be a significant factor in changing the security situation and will allow us to complete the important mission of returning the residents to their homes.' Earlier Monday, Gallant met with armored fighters on the northern border, and gave another hint when he told them: 'The elimination of Nasrallah is an important step, but it is not the end. In order to return the residents of the north, we will use all our capabilities, including you.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1u3xkdra	2024-09-30T13:06:10-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/Hkg00wvuuA0/Hkg00wvuuA0_0_233_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Iranian hackers claim to breach nuclear research center system in...	The group Handala claims to have stolen nearly 200 gigabytes of data from the Soreq Nuclear Research Center; PM office says the 'incident is known and under investigation' An Iranian hacker group known as Handala announced on Sunday that it had allegedly breached the Soreq Nuclear Research Center and stolen 197 gigabytes of data. The group is believed to be a cyber arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the attack was purportedly in retaliation for the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. While no evidence has been provided to confirm the attack or its success, Handala's claims are considered credible, and it often releases proof of its hacks. However, the group has, on occasion, falsely claimed successful attacks by recycling old data. For example, the group recently re-released private images supposedly stolen from the phones of former Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, former Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, and former Prime Minister Ehud Barak. They also claim to possess sensitive communications and emails from these officials, though without offering any proof. The aim: Psychological impact Handala was behind a cyberattack on Sheba Medical Center three months ago, when data was stolen from a biotechnology company associated with the hospital. The group has also targeted other entities within Israel, often publishing the stolen data. Its primary objective appears to be psychological warfare –creating public anxiety and pressure. This tactic is popular among countries like Iran and Russia, the latter being considered a mentor to Iranian cyber tactics. The Soreq Nuclear Research Center serves the civilian and academic sectors, providing research infrastructure for companies and universities. Its research spans fields such as food safety, electro-optics, laser development, nuclear testing and air pollution detection. Founded in 1958 near Yavne with U.S. support, the center is not involved in defense activities but represents the cutting edge of Israeli scientific research. At this stage, until the hackers release verifiable data, their claims should be treated with caution. However, given the group's track record, it cannot be dismissed outright. Israeli authorities take the protection of such critical infrastructure seriously and, hopefully, this is either an empty boast or one that does not involve sensitive information. The Prime Minister's Office, speaking on behalf of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, said in a statement: 'The incident is known and under investigation. The Soreq Nuclear Research Center maintains the highest level of information security protocols, in line with national security regulations.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjkqmvda0	2024-09-30T12:38:02-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/S1hhQGuAC/S1hhQGuAC_0_264_2560_1440_0_small.jpg

Two 16-year-old boys arrested for attempting to rob a taxi driver in Ashkelon after they were seen in footage pulling out a knife and holding it to his neck; They were caught last week at the end of a police manhunt following the failed robbery Police arrested two 16-year-old boys Sunday on suspicion that they tried to rob a taxi driver in Ashkelon at knifepoint. The incident happened last week, overnight between Thursday and Friday. They will be brought before the Ashkelon Magistrate's Court with a request to extend their detention. In the footage of the attempted robbery, three suspects are seen getting into the back seat of the taxi wearing hoods over their heads and trying to hide their faces. Then one of the suspects pulled out a knife and held it to Nahar Hamoni's neck. Another suspect held a knife to the driver's arm. The police said that a manhunt was underway for the suspects who escaped from the taxi after the unsuccessful robbery attempt. Ashkelon police investigators began an investigation upon receiving the report, while collecting evidence at the same time as conducting an intelligence effort that led to the identification of the suspects. Two of them were arrested while one of them tried to escape by jumping from the window of a house, where he was caught by the police.

US concerned about Iranian revenge after IDF message to Tehran	Amid rising security tensions, Israel and the US prepare for a possible Iranian attack while the IRGC considers a response and rebuilding Hezbollah The Biden administration fears that Iran is planning an attack in the wake of the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and is working together with Israel on 'defense,' a U.S. official told CNN Monday. The source did not specify which Iranian attack might take place, or what steps the U.S. is taking, but noted that the Americans and Israel are preparing to repel such a possible attack. At the same time, the IDF published footage from the refueling planes that were on their way to attack Yemen on Sunday. With that, the IDF sent a message to Iran, saying that 'the refueling planes of the Air Force operate in the war in all sectors and allow the fighter planes flexibility in attacks and activity in any airspace, at any distance.' The assassination of the Hezbollah leader is considered the most severe blow that Israel has dealt not only to the Lebanese terrorist organization but also to Iran's host of proxies. On Sunday, international media outlets reported difference of opinions in Iran regarding the Iranian response to Israel's recent transgression. The radical fundamentalists are calling for an immediate response to deter Israel while the moderate camp, including Iranian President Massoud Pezeshkian who calls to avoid falling into Israel's trap. According to the report in the New York Times, which is based on four Iranian sources, the assassination of Nasrallah, the long-time ally of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was received in Tehran with shock and great concern among the regime's top brass. Iranian officials even wondered if Israel's next target was Iran's Supreme Leader, prompting the regime to move him to a safe location. While deliberating whether or not to attack Israel and possibly start an all-out war, an IRGC source commented anonymously. 'All of the forces in the resistance stand by Hezbollah,' he said. 'It will be Hezbollah, at the helm of the resistance forces, that will determine the fate of the region.' Although Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson has said that Iran 'will not leave any of the criminal acts of the Zionist regime' unanswered, international estimates suggest Iran will not join the fray and directly attack Israel. According to them, Iran will focus on rebuilding Hezbollah in Lebanon and keeping its network of proxy organizations in operation for as long as possible, hinting at an expected increase in movement in Iraq and Syria with convoys and transfers to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Due to Hezbollah's part in the Syrian Civil War, the terrorist organization controls several tunnels near the border that connects the two countries. Since Israel's strike, many Hezbollah field commanders have fled to Syria with their families. According to the source, amid the security escalation, Iran may try to transfer thousands of combatants to the border areas of Lebanon and Syria. In the last two months, thousands of operatives left Iraq for Syria, which implies that Tehran was preparing to strengthen its forces in the region. Meanwhile, the world urges both sides to de-escalate the situation to avoid a full-scale war. The Washington Post reported on Sunday that American estimates say that Israel's intensive campaign to dismantle Hezbollah's leadership in the past two weeks will challenge the terror organization's ability to respond. The U.S. even advised Israel against a ground incursion and claimed that it may produce adverse results. An American official that they see an opportunity to strengthen the Lebanese government at the expense of Hezbollah's political power. Lebanon is currently embroiled in a political crisis as they have not elected a president for two years. It remains unclear how Nasrallah's assassination will affect Lebanon's political situation. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryhdlkd0c	2024-09-30T11:49:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/25/r1fGSrKbRR/r1fGSrKbRR_0_161_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Israel has told the United States it is conducting limited ground operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon near the border with Israel, the State Department said on Monday. 'This is what they have informed us that they are currently conducting, which are limited operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure near the border,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. Asked to confirm they were limited ground operations, he said: 'That is our understanding.' A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters the positioning of Israeli troops suggested a ground incursion could be imminent. After two weeks of intensive airstrikes and a string of assassinations of Hezbollah commanders, Israel has suggested ever more strongly that a land invasion is looming. Miller said that the United States continues to support a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah but added that military pressure can at times enable diplomacy. He cautioned that military pressure can also lead to miscalculation and unintended consequences.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bysexuurc	2024-09-30T11:38:35-07:00	
Mossad infiltrated Iranian intelligence unit established to spy o...	Former president of Iran tells CNN Turk that the man who headed the Islamic Republic's division meant to thwart Mossad operations was found in 2021 to be an Israeli spy, and 'another 20 members were Mossad agents'; They stole Iran's nuclear documents The former president of Iran made an amazing claim in an interview Monday with the CNN network in Turkey. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that Tehran established a unit meant to thwart the operations of Israel's Mossad, and it later became clear to them that the man who headed it was a Mossad agent. Ahmadinejad said that in 2021 it became clear to them that the most senior person in the country whose job it was to deal with Israel's intelligence operations in Iran was a Mossad agent. 'Israel organized complex operations inside Iran. They could easily obtain information. In Iran they are still silent about this. The man who was in charge of the unit in Iran against Israel was an Israeli agent,' he said. And he, according to Ahmadinejad, was not the only one. Besides the head of the Iranian intelligence unit, another 20 members of that unit turned out to be Mossad agents. Ahmadinejad claimed that they were the ones who managed to steal the Iranian nuclear documents in 2018, and were also responsible for the elimination of Iranian nuclear scientists. Ahmadinejad was the president of Iran until 2013. He was succeeded by Hassan Rouhani, and his former chief of staff - former intelligence minister Ali Younesi - admitted in an interview in 2022: 'The Mossad has infiltrated many government departments in the last 10 years, to such a degree that all the country's top officials should fear for their lives.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj11tfdorc	2024-09-30T11:29:47-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/02/B1drMsYNC/B1drMsYNC_0_159_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Israel begins demolition of Hamas-damaged homes in Kibbutz Kissuf...	Residents of Kibbutz Kissufim, where 18 members were murdered on Oct. 7, relocated to a new neighborhood in the town of Omer; 'The demolition brings back memories of October 7. It’s very emotional, but there’s also a sense of renewal,' says a kibbutz member overseeing the reconstruction efforts The demolition of buildings in Kibbutz Kissufim began on Monday, nearly a year after the October 7 massacre. Over the coming months, around 24 structures damaged by the Hamas attacks are set to be demolished and rebuilt. The first to go was the 'Artists' House,' which had also served as a second home for 86-year-old Shlomo Mansour, the oldest hostage still being held in Gaza, with no sign of life from him since the abduction. The Artists' House was located in a building that once served as the kibbutz's children's home, where local artists from Kissufim created and displayed their work. Tal Shaul, a kibbutz native who left and later returned to help with the rebuilding efforts, is overseeing the demolition and reconstruction process. 'This was our children's house. There are so many memories here. Seeing the building come down takes me back to what I saw on October 12, when I first returned after the massacre,' he said. 'It’s incredibly emotional, but at the same time, there’s an element of renewal,' Shaul added. 'As painful as it is, there's also a lot of hope in this. That’s what matters. We’re going to rebuild a new educational center on these ruins. Today marks the beginning of our recovery.' Shaul also leads the 'Odem' program at the Defense Ministry, which trains systems engineers for Israel’s defense industry. Alongside the reconstruction efforts, 78 families from the kibbutz community were resettled Sunday in the town of Omer as part of a temporary housing plan developed by the Tkumah Directorate. New housing units were built for the families, along with seven public buildings, including kindergartens, offices and a playground. The cost of building the Kissufim neighborhood is estimated at over 140 million shekels. On October 7, Hamas terrorists breached the gates of Kibbutz Kissufim, killing 18 residents. The kibbutz's rapid response team engaged in heroic battles with over 70 terrorists. Mansour, one of the kibbutz’s artists, was kidnapped after being handcuffed. His wife, Mazal, survived, and witnesses reported that Mansour was taken from their home after being restrained. Two weeks ago, some members of Kibbutz Be’eri also moved into temporary housing after a new neighborhood was constructed for them at Kibbutz Hatzerim near Be'er Sheva. The first to move were families with children, ahead of the new school year, which began earlier this month. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1f2ibdrr	2024-09-30T09:49:33-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/HyaxDedAA/HyaxDedAA_0_0_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Israel planning to launch ground operation in Lebanon at any mome...	The operation is expected to be limited, according to the Washington Post, citing a US official; the New York Times reports that the US was able to convince Israel not to launch a major ground attack Israel is preparing to launch a ground attack in Lebanon imminently, but it is expected to be limited, an unnamed U.S. official told The Washington Post Monday, in a report which has been corroborated by other media outlets. The report comes as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that 'the next phase will begin soon.' 'Israel’s planned campaign would be smaller than its last war against Hezbollah in 2006 and would focus on clearing out terrorist infrastructure along the border to remove the threat to Israeli border communities,' the U.S. official told the Post. Another U.S. told the CBS news network that Israel has informed the U.S. that it intends to begin the ground maneuver phase, and that it 'may take place within hours.' At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden called for a cease-fire. When asked if he 'feels comfortable' with Israel's plan, he said: 'I’m more worried than you might know and I’m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now.' The New York Times cited U.S. officials who said that they believe they have succeeded in convincing Israel not to launch a major ground attack in Lebanon, after long talks held over the weekend. In the United States, signs were detected that Israel intended to launch a maneuver in Lebanon and that it could come soon. After the talks, they said that they now estimate that the planned attack is small and will include targeted raids in southern Lebanon. Special units in the IDF have already carried out such raids in recent days, in order to remove combat positions from which Hezbollah planned to target the northern settlements. According to the report, officials in Israel assured their counterparts in the United States that they do not plan for these raids to lead to a major attack by ground forces with the aim of occupying parts of southern Lebanon. The American officials said that they estimate that the commando units will withdraw immediately after the operations is over. However, according to the report, it is still unclear whether this is the final Israeli decision and if there is still a possibility of a large-scale attack. Another hint that the incursion could happen at any moment was given by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who met Monday with mayors of Israeli northern border communities. In a conversation with them, Gallant said that 'the next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon; it will be a significant factor in changing the security situation and will allow us to complete the important mission of returning the residents to their homes.' Earlier Monday, Gallant met with armored fighters on the northern border, and gave another hint when he told them: 'The elimination of Nasrallah is an important step, but it is not the end. In order to return the residents of the north, we will use all our capabilities, including you.' The Pentagon said on Monday that the US and Israel are still in discussions 'about the best way forward' when asked by reporters whether Israel was planning a ground offensive in Lebanon. 'We're continuing to engage with them, trying to learn more. We continue discussions on the best way forward,' Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told a news briefing. Singh also said Israel gave U.S. notice but did not coordinate its Sunday strikes in Yemen with the United States. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk00f00hdc0	2024-09-30T09:17:51-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJd11iZ40R/SJd11iZ40R_0_14_1280_720_0_small.jpg
German foreign minister criticizes Israel for assassinating Nasra...	Annalena Baerbock says the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah was an action that 'does not contribute to Israel's security' while her ministry says Israel was exercising self-defense German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock spoke out Sunday against the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a Friday strike on the Dahieh district of Beirut. 'This action leads to significant instability in the region and does not contribute to Israel’s security – in fact, the opposite,' she argued. Baerbock also warned of an escalating security situation and called on Israel to accept a U.S.-backed 21-day cease-fire proposal supported by France, Germany and several Arab nations to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. However, the German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said it was an act of self defense. 'Hezbollah is of course a terrorist organization and it was obviously a meeting of the top leadership of Hezbollah, from which one can assume, even from a distance, that they were planning their further operations,' the spokesperson said. 'So in this respect, there are also reasons to believe that the right to self defense was exercised here,' he added. Public reaction in Germany was notably different. Many saw the Israeli operation as a positive step for the Middle East and a rightful exercise of Israel’s self-defense. 'Since when is Hezbollah a pillar of stability in the Middle East?' quipped Marie-Louise Beck, a former Green Party MP, in response to Baerbock's remarks. Other politicians criticized Baerbock for her silence during Hezbollah’s 11-months of rocket attacks on northern Israel. 'Eliminating the leader of your greatest enemy – an enemy that launches daily rockets at Israel – surely helps Israel’s security,' said Frank Müller-Rosentritt, a foreign policy expert from the FDP, one of the coalition parties. A commentary piece went further, questioning Baerbock's public stance: 'How can we take our foreign minister seriously when she expresses such views and shows no relief over the death of a notorious terrorist? The region has been unstable for years, and this man contributed to that instability, with blood on his hands from both Israel and the Syrian Civil War. Her comments are an invitation for terror to reestablish itself. But this isn’t surprising – back in April, after an Iranian attack on Israel, Baerbock tweeted, ‘Everyone in the Middle East wants to live in peace.’ That was her response.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjptwx00ra	2024-09-30T08:36:03-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/04/17/ryxzFB6lR/ryxzFB6lR_0_123_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Shin Bet says foiled several Iranian assassination attempts in Is...	In an unusual message from the country's security agency, the Shim Bet, asks the public to be vigilant and report suspicious activity; says Iran has stepped up it efforts The Shin Bet has made an unusual announcement, accompanied by a serious warning and a request for public assistance. The security service warned on Monday of an Iranian intention to carry out 'assassination attacks in Israel,' announced that 'significant countermeasures' had recently been carried out and demanded that 'whenever a doubt or suspicion arises, report it immediately to the security services.' 'In recent weeks, the Shin Bet has detected a significant rise in Iran’s efforts to advance assassination attacks against targets in Israel,' the agency announced. In response, the Shin Bet carried out countermeasures described as 'very significant' against the planned attacks, some in very advanced stages of planning and readiness. The Shin Bet added that the details of some of these planned attacks have not yet been released to the public. Two weeks ago, the Shin Bet revealed Hezbollah's attempt to assassinate former Chief of Staff Moshe (Bogie) Ya'alon in Yarkon Park, and that it had foiled another attack by the terrorist organization against a former security official. Two hours after that announcement by the Shin Bet, thousands of pagers exploded in Lebanon, in what foreign publications reported was the opening salvo to the blows that Hezbollah has suffered. In its announcement on Monday, the Shin Bet reported that Iran is working to recruit Israeli civilians to harm senior Israeli officials , as was recently revealed in the investigation and arrest of Ashkelon resident Moti Maman, against whom an indictment was recently filed for serious security offenses. In addition, the Shin Bet said, the Iranians are working even harder to recruit Israeli citizens via the Internet. Iranian officials are trying to locate Israelis on various websites and platforms on the Internet, with an emphasis on websites and channels dealing with cryptocurrency, finance and on-line job searches. Iranian authorities offer those Israelis contacted on the internet a large payment to carry out various tasks, including hiding money and phones in various places in Israel, distributing flyers and writing graffiti, setting fire to vehicles and physically harming people. In many cases, at the time of establishing the relationship and at its beginning, the same Iranian officials present themselves as those who seek to 'employ' the same Israeli citizen to carry out seemingly innocent tasks for payment. But in a short time the requested 'tasks' become dangerous, threatening the security of the state and its citizens. 'The Shin Bet asks the public to pay increased attention and take extra caution in any case where suspicion arises, in accordance with the detailed procedures, especially when the sums involved are large and are not suited to the nature of the requested tasks, or if the requested tasks are unusual,' the agency say. 'If such doubt or suspicion arises , must be reported immediately to the security services.' 'The Shin Bet works to thwart Iranian activity within Israel and throughout the network, views with great severity any action by Israeli citizens on behalf of Iranian entities, whether minor or serious, and will work to exhaust justice with all the tools at its disposal, with anyone who comes into contact with those entities or acts to carry out tasks for them,' the organization clarified. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1qqdedc0	2024-09-30T08:09:21-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/21/rkvv8onTC/rkvv8onTC_0_0_1000_665_0_small.jpg

US to announce over $300 million in aid for Palestinians in Gaza,...	The United States on Monday will announce nearly $336 million in additional humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, according to a U.S. Agency for International Development statement seen by Reuters. The funding, first reported by Reuters, will enable USAID's partners to continue to provide humanitarian aid, including food assistance, health care, nutrition and other services, according to the statement. The funding will also support emergency shelter assistance to displaced Gazans ahead of winter, the statement said. 'Over the last year, this conflict has cost the lives of innocent Palestinians and Israelis and has left Gaza and the West Bank in a state of humanitarian crisis and dire humanitarian need,' the statement said. 'The United States continues to call on all parties to agree to a ceasefire deal and an immediate release of hostages, and to allow for the immediate scale-up of humanitarian aid moving into and throughout Gaza.' A USAID spokesperson said that agency partners have continued to reach people in Gaza with aid, but added that 'barriers to access and insecurity prevent the necessary scaling of assistance to adequately meet the needs of the 2.3 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in Gaza.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjt88e00rc	2024-09-30T07:33:41-07:00

Hezbollah commanders flee to Syria, Iran to send thousands to Leb...	Iran is likely seeking to avoid a regional war, and security officials in the US and several Middle Eastern countries suggest Nasrallah's assassination is unlikely to trigger such a conflict, Bloomberg also reports As the world speculates about Iran's 'next move' in the wake of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's assassination, concerns grow over potential retaliation. Meanwhile, reports from the U.S. indicate preparations for a possible attack from Iranian territory. However, according to a report by Bloomberg, Iran is likely seeking to avoid a regional war. Current and former officials in the U.S. and several Middle Eastern countries suggest Nasrallah's assassination is unlikely to trigger such a conflict. Instead, Iran is expected to focus on rebuilding Hezbollah and keeping its proxies across the region active for as long as possible. Bloomberg highlights the severe blow Hezbollah, and by extension, Iran, suffered with the assassination of Nasrallah and Hezbollah's top leadership. They also note a cautious statement issued by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who declared that the region's future will be shaped by the 'forces of resistance,' but stopped short of issuing a direct threat against Israel. A source familiar with the operations of Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria said Hezbollah’s allies in these countries are now expected to play a central role in smuggling resources to the Lebanese terror group. The same source added that Iran will now also try to move thousands of fighters to the border areas of Lebanon and Syria and, according to him, thousands of fighters have already moved from Iraq to Syria in recent months - a move that probably indicates that Iran is preparing to strengthen its forces in the region, apparently for the purposes of 'deterrence.' Bloomberg also reports that since Hezbollah began assisting the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war in 2012, the Shiite terrorist organization has built bases and a 'sophisticated' network of tunnels in various areas of Syria close to the border with Lebanon. A source familiar the details noted that many Hezbollah field commanders recently fled Lebanon to Syria along with their families. Meanwhile, a drone exploded on Monday at a horse farm in Merom Golan, meters from kids, injuring horses on Golan Heights. No sirens were activated anywhere nearby, to warn of the attack. There were no injuries reported but a fire broke out and was handled by the local emergency response team.

Head of Lebanon Branch of PFLP terror group eliminated, IDF says	During a joint IDF and ISA intelligence-based activity, the Israeli Air Force struck and eliminated the terrorist Nidal Abdel-Aal, head of the Lebanon Branch of the PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) terrorist organization, the IDF announced on Monday afternoon. The terrorist Imad Odeh, who was the head of PFLP's Military Office in Lebanon, was eliminated alongside him. Abdel-Aal led PFLP’s efforts to plan and carry out terror attacks against the State of Israel and directed the organization's terror activities in the West Bank. He operated to establish terror infrastructure in the West Bank to use in attacks on Israeli targets. Nidal Abdel-Aal directed the bus bombing attack in Beitar Illit on March 9, 2023, and the shooting attack from a passing vehicle at the Huwara Junction on March 25, 2023, during which two IDF soldiers were injured. The two terror cells that carried out the attacks were apprehended by the ISA.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy6taq00ca	2024-09-30T06:57:46-07:00	
CERN ends cooperation with Russian scientists	The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) will end cooperation with up to 500 scientists affiliated with Russian institutions, it said on Monday, because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Swiss-based CERN, best known for its studies in particle physics and its Large Hadron Collider, will not renew its cooperation agreement with Russia when it ends on November 30 2024.The decision means around 400 to 500 scientists linked to Russian laboratories will no longer be able to collaborate with CERN, a spokesperson said. Cooperation with around 15 Belarussian scientists has also been stopped. 'CERN is an international organization, but it is not an island. It's not acceptable to support scientific research when wars are taking place between countries which once had staff who worked together at CERN,' the spokesperson said. Russian scientists will be able to continue to work at CERN if they are affiliated with non-Russian institutes, with around 90 having done so.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjo0000xdac	2024-09-30T06:33:28-07:00

In a videotape message in English, the prime minister tells Iranians to imagine a prosperous country at peace; 'The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly addressed the Iranian people and told them that the Iranian leadership does not care about them and is not protecting them. Netanyahu released a videotaped message in English on Monday afternoon, saying: 'I speak a lot about the leaders of Iran. Yet at this pivotal moment, I want to address you – the people of Iran. I want to do so directly, without filters, without middlemen.' 'Every day, you see a regime that subjugates you, makes fiery speeches about defending Lebanon, defending Gaza. Yet every day, that regime plunges our region deeper into darkness and deeper into war. Every day, their puppets are eliminated. Ask Mohammed Deif. Ask Nasrallah,' he said, referring to Israel's killing of leaders of Iranian terror proxies. 'There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country. With every passing moment, the regime is bringing you — the noble Persian people — closer to the abyss. The vast majority of Iranians know their regime doesn't care a whit about them. If it did care, if it cared about you, it would stop wasting billions of dollars on futile wars across the Middle East. It would start improving your lives,' he said. 'Iran’s tyrants don’t care about your future; But you do,' he added. He described a world in which Iran and Israel are at peace, instead of Iranian citizens living in 'endless poverty, repression and war.' 'Don't let a small group of fanatic theocrats crush your hopes and your dreams. You deserve better. Your children deserve better. The entire world deserves better,' he said, concluding: 'The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you. May we together know a future of prosperity and peace.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjao11x00c0	2024-09-30T06:22:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/HJ9L7sUCA/HJ9L7sUCA_437_313_2139_1204_0_small.jpg

Hezbollah drone explodes meters from kids, injures horses on Gola...	No sirens activated in the drone strike; Fires break out at a horse farm while children are present, causing terror, shock; horses wounded from shrapnel, no harm to humans A drone exploded on Monday at a horse farm in Merom Golan, a kibbutz in the western Golan Heights. No sirens were activated anywhere nearby, to earn of the attack. There were no injuries reported but a fire broke out and was handled by the local emergency response team. Two horses were injured by shrapnel. Mozi Anidjar, a member of the kibbutz, described that a children's lesson was taking place in the stable about 20 meters from the impact site. 'I was in my food truck when I heard the boom. I immediately drove to the stable to see if any help was needed for the injured, heaven forbid. A major disaster was avoided; if it had fallen 20 yards closer to the stable, it would have been a disaster in the same level as what happened in Majdal Shams.' The horse trainer and riding instructor mentioned seeing the drone hovering before it hit, saying, 'It just dropped and fell.' He added, 'The children are okay, just a bit in shock.' Michal Laufer, who had been evacuated from Kibbutz Dan in the Upper Galilee to Merom Golan, told Ynet that she heard a loud explosion while in the area, preparing for another move to the center. She explained that after three months, due to the difficult situation and lack of educational frameworks, they decided to leave Merom Golan as well. 'We sent our son to the center and came here to pack up the apartment we rented. We went to the hotel to do laundry with other evacuated friends, and with a laundry basket in hand, I heard a boom and a crazy explosion. Another mother, children, and I went into the bomb shelter. Some of the children were at the hotel entrance with an instructor who said they saw the drone and heard its noise. Then it exploded. I'm shaking all over. The explosion was about a hundred yards from me.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sj9vy11d0r	2024-09-30T05:15:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/r1eCIguAC/r1eCIguAC_442_126_431_243_0_small.jpg

Hurricane Helene kills at least 90 in US; homes and memories wash...	Officials fear more bodies would be discovered, after cellphone towers down across the region, and hundreds of people have yet to make contact with loved ones and are listed as unaccounted for The Southeastern U.S. began a huge cleanup and recovery effort on Sunday and the death toll climbed to 100 after Hurricane Helene knocked out power for millions, destroyed roads and bridges and caused dramatic flooding from Florida to Virginia. The storm's winds, rain and storm surge killed at least 90 people in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia, according to a Reuters tally of state and local officials. Officials feared more bodies would be discovered. With cellphone towers down across the region, hundreds of people had yet to make contact with loved ones and were listed as unaccounted for. Damage estimates ranged from $15 billion to more than $100 billion, insurers and forecasters said over the weekend, as water systems, communications and critical transportation routes were affected. Property damage and lost economic output will become clearer as officials assess the destruction. In North Carolina, nearly all the deaths were in Buncombe County, where 30 people died, Sheriff Quentin Miller told a video conference call with reporters. County Manager Avril Pinder said she was asking the state for emergency food and drinking water. Streets in the picturesque city of Asheville were submerged in floodwater. 'This is a devastating catastrophe of historic proportions,' Governor Roy Cooper told CNN. 'People that I talk to in western North Carolina say they have never seen anything like this.' Search and rescue teams from 19 states and the U.S. government have converged on the state, Cooper said, adding that some roads could take months to repair. In Flat Rock, North Carolina, there were widespread blackouts, and people waited hours in line for gas. 'Grocery stores are closed, cellphone service is out,' Chip Frank, 62, said as he entered his third hour waiting in line. 'It all depends on these gas stations. You're not going to be able to go nowhere, and it's just a scary feeling.' Roughly 2.7 million customers throughout the South were without power on Sunday, a U.S. Energy Department official said, down 40% from Friday after unprecedented storm surges, ferocious winds and perilous conditions extended hundreds of miles inland. South Carolina reported 25 dead, Georgia 17 and Florida 11, according to the governors of those states. CNN reported a total of 93 dead across the South, citing state and local officials. President Joe Biden plans to visit affected areas this week, once he can do so without disrupting emergency services, the White House said. 'It's tragic,' Biden told reporters on Sunday, pledging recovery assistance after declaring major disasters in Florida and North Carolina and emergencies for Florida, North Carolina Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama. 'You saw the photographs. It's stunning.' Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris planned to cut short a campaign trip in Nevada on Monday to take part in briefings in Washington on the hurricane response and will visit the region when doing so won't impede the response, a White House official said. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will visit Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to receive a briefing on storm damage and 'facilitate the distribution of relief supplies,' his campaign said. Helene slammed into Florida's Gulf Coast on Thursday night, triggering days of driving rain and destroying homes that had stood for decades. In Horseshoe Beach, on Florida's Gulf Coast about 70 miles (120 km) west of Gainesville, Charlene Huggins surveyed the debris of her blown-out house, pulling a jacket out of the rubble on Saturday. 'Five generations lived in this house, from my grandmother, my father, myself, my daughter, son and my granddaughter,' Huggins said, holding a chipped glass cake stand. 'So there's a lot of memories here. It just breaks your heart.' Not far away, James Ellenburg stood on the property where his own family has lived for four generations. 'I took my first step right here in this yard.' The roof of one home sat flat in the dirt, its walls blown away. In coastal Steinhatchee, a storm surge â€' a wall of seawater pushed ashore by winds â€' of eight to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 meters) moved mobile homes, the weather service said. Other areas saw a storm surge of 15 feet (4.5 meters). In the nearby tiny community of Spring Warrior Fish Camp, people were surveying the damage on Saturday and still waiting for emergency or first responder aid. 'No one thinks of us back here,' said David Hall, as he and his wife dug through seagrass and dead fish in the office of the hotel they owned. Many of the community's homes are built on stilts because of a local ordinance and survived heavy damage. Kristin Macqueen was helping friends clean up after their house was destroyed in nearby Keaton Beach. 'It's complete devastation,' she said. 'Houses have just been ripped off their slabs.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1mdoeo0a	2024-09-30T05:09:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/Hybs1Gd00/Hybs1Gd00_0_0_3000_2000_0_small.jpg
Nasrallah deputy: 'If Israel decides to enter by land, we're read...	As Hezbollah are primed to name Hashem Safieddine as Nasrallah's successor, the organization's number two accuses the Biden administration of backing Israel's actions and says they will not be deterred by an IDF ground invasion Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem, in his first public address since Israel assassinated the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah last week, said the movement is ready to confront any Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon. 'Israel will not achieve its goals', he said. 'We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.' Qassem accused the United States for 'providing Israel with unlimited support in carrying out the massacre.' Hezbollah's Deputy Secretary-General, threatened Israel once again: 'We will emerge victorious from this battle. Contrary to what the enemy claimed - there was no meeting of 20 leaders. Israel is committing a massacre throughout Lebanon, leaving no home without signs of aggression,' he said. 'Israel will not achieve its goal with its brutality. The path of resistance continues, and Hezbollah pursues its objectives and jihad. The leadership continues precisely as Nasrallah established. We will continue to support Gaza and defend Palestine - at the same pace. What we are doing is the minimum, as part of the plan to continue the battle and what the field demands. We know the battle will be long, and we are ready to face any event. The enemy will not achieve its goal.' Qassem also claimed in his speech that Hezbollah struck targets 90 miles deep inside Israel. 'The enemy is going mad because it cannot match our capabilities,' he said. 'We will win as we did in 2006. Within Hezbollah's structure, there are deputy commanders and ready replacements for when a leader is injured, in every role. We will elect the Secretary-General as soon as possible and according to the approved mechanism. Victory is ours, patience is needed, we are ready.' Israeli forces have dealt multiple blows to Hezbollah in a two-week wave of attacks on targets in Lebanon that have eliminated top commanders, destroyed infrastructure and depleted the terror group's arsenal of weapons. The possibility that Israel's next move might be to send ground troops and tanks over the border is on many minds. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said Tehran would not leave any of Israel's 'criminal acts' go unanswered. He was referring to the killing of Nasrallah and an Iranian Guard deputy commander, Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, who died in the same strikes on Friday. Lebanon's Health Ministry says more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without specifying how many were civilians. One million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes, the government says. The escalation has put Beirut on edge, with Lebanese fearful that Israel will expand its military campaign. 'There is nothing else to say or add, except God save Lebanon,' Beirut resident Nawel said. 'What will happen to me is the same as what can happen to anyone.' Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he was prepared to deploy his army to the border with Israel. He said Lebanon was seeking an immediate cease-fire. After meeting with Lebanese Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, Mikati said a special parliamentary session to elect a new president will be held as soon as a cease-fire in in effect. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syfkqeucr	2024-09-30T04:04:42-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/Sk00WYyuA0/Sk00WYyuA0_67_0_723_407_0_small.jpg

Syrian civil war opened doors for Israel's deep dive into Hezboll...	The iinternal strife created a unique intelligence opportunity for Israel to leverage technological superiority; Israel gathered extensive insights, reshaping its strategic approach and maintaining a vigilant stance against potential threats The Syrian civil war played a pivotal role in enabling Israel's extensive intelligence penetration into Hezbollah, effectively transforming it into a vast repository of insights on Hezbollah operatives, according to an in-depth report in the British Financial Times. In the article titled 'How Israeli Spies Infiltrated Hezbollah,' a former senior Lebanese politician said Hezbollah operatives had to 'expose themselves in Syria,' sharing information with Assad's corrupt intelligence services or the Russian intelligence agencies, which were under constant American surveillance. Following the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Israel recalibrated its intelligence strategy towards Hezbollah. This refocus was accompanied by technological advancements that became 'insurmountable,' including satellites, advanced drones, and even capabilities to hack mobile phones, transforming them into listening devices or, as Hassan Nasrallah noted in one of his speeches, into agents. When Hezbollah deployed its forces to support Assad against the uprising and later to combat ISIS, Israel seized the opportunity. An 'intelligence tapestry' emerged, detailing the roles and responsibilities within Hezbollah, identifying who advanced, who was deemed 'corrupt,' and who precisely returned from ambiguous travels. According to the Financial Times, once Israel identified Hezbollah operatives, their daily behavioral patterns were meticulously logged into a database, drawing data from their vehicle, locations, and even their spouse's mobile phone. Israeli sources told the FT that security footage or the operative’s voice recorded nearby could also be exploited by Israel. Any deviation from the norm, as reported, triggers alerts for Israeli intelligence officers, enabling them to assess whether these operatives intend to launch an attack. The Syrian civil war, as described by the former senior Lebanese politician, was the 'price of supporting Assad,' forcing operatives to expose themselves. The Financial Times further said that in recent months or years, Israeli intelligence refined a technique that intermittently allowed them to pinpoint the location of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated last Friday at the main underground command center of the terrorist organization in the Dahieh. The British publication said that throughout more than ten months of ongoing conflict, Israel concentrated on lower-ranking Hezbollah operatives, a focus to which senior figures in the organization had grown accustomed. Between the two sides, well-defined red lines appeared to exist, and Hezbollah hoped the campaign would conclude with a ceasefire. However, Israel did not dismiss the potential for a massacre akin to that of October 7 occurring in northern communities—and acted accordingly. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryzjw0dc0	2024-09-30T03:04:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/r1bTjzKL0A/r1bTjzKL0A_0_230_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Israeli special ops breech Hezbollah tunnels near border, report	Repeated incursions into Hezbollah's underground tunnel system in South Lebanon aimed to gather intelligence and diminish the terror group's military capabilities ahead of a possible ground offensive IDF special ops fighters entered Hezbollah rockets along the Lebanese border with Israel to gather intelligence and in preparation for the military's possible land offensive that could come as early as this week, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. In the report, the raids took place in recent months as part of the IDF's attempts to diminish Hezbollah's military capabilities along the border. Officials told the paper that the timing of an IDF ground offensive could change and that The Israeli government was under heavy pressure from the Biden administration, to avoid an extensive operation. On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden said a broader conflict must be avoided and that he along with French president Emmanuel Macron and other allies were working hard to secure a temporary cease-fire that would allow for a diplomatic solution to the conflict to be agreed. ABC News reported on Sunday that the military may soon launch small scale attacks across the border into Lebanon to debilitate Hezbollah's positions there. American officials told the network that a ground offensive if launched, would be limited in scope.' The key is fulfilling the promise to Israelis that the tens of thousands displaced from northern Israel will be able to go home.

Hezbollah's lone surviving old generation commander	Talal Hamiyah, one of Hezbollah's senior commanders who is responsible for attacks against Jews and Israelis abroad, avoids assassination after being absent from the bunker bombed by Israel; has a 7 million dollar bounty on his head Following Hezbollah's Shura Council tapping of Hashem Safieddine as the organization's new secretary-general after Hassan Nasrallah's assassination, Israel and the U.S. look for Talal Hamiyah, a senior Hezbollah official who did not attend the last meeting for more than 20 Hezbollah commanders. Hamiyah heads Unit 910 in charge of targeting Israelis and Jews abroad. So far, Talal Hamiyah has successfully dodged attempts on his life, knowing Israel was looking for him and that the Americans had offered a seven-million-dollar bounty on his head. He heads Hezbollah's Unit 910 - also dubbed 'Shadow Unit' or 'Black Unit,' which was established in 2020, after the U.S. assassinated Iran's senior commander of the Revolutionary Guards Quds force in Iraq, to carry out attacks against Israelis and Jews abroad but also against Americans. Hamiyah has close ties to the top brass in the IRGC, which has bases in countries that are part of the Shiite axis (Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen) and certain countries in Africa and maintains close relationships with international criminal organizations around the world. Hamiyah's operatives also recruit, fundraise, and assemble explosives, even in Latin America. Before rising through Hezbollah's ranks, Hamiyah was a clerk at the Beirut airport. Two years later, in the mid-1980s, he joined Hezbollah, reaching high-level positions. To this day, he is wanted in many countries, including the U.S., and hardly ever leaves Lebanon, except to visit Iran, Iraq, or Syria. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjlp3hvcc	2024-09-30T01:05:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/yk14098215/yk14098215_0_86_283_160_0_small.jpg
IDF thwarts possible strike on offshore gas rig	Military releases images of an attack drone intercepted after it enters Israeli economic waters from the north; Houthi rebels also threatened to strike gas drilling and other Israeli energy installations after July Hudeidah port attack The IDF said on Monday that its aerial defenses shot down an attack drone that entered Israel's economic waters from the north, believed to have been targeting and offshore natural gas rig. The suspected attempt to attack Israel's natural gas infrastructure came days after the IDF assassinated Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and many of his senior commanders in a strike on the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut. The terror group on Monday confirmed the death of one more of its senior officials, Ali Karki, who was with Nasrallah in the command bunker that was bombed. Hezbollah had reportedly made numerous attempts to target offshore drilling for natural gas since the war began, most recently last week. In July, a naval vessel, in cooperation with the Air Force, successfully intercepted an unmanned aircraft entering the economic waters from Lebanon. Houthi rebels in Yemen also said they planned to retaliate against Israel for its July attack on the port of Hodeidah, by attacking Israel's natural gas rigs in the Mediterranean and other energy facilities, the Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper Al-Akhbar reported. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkaf7rd0a	2024-09-30T00:41:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/BJuKm0wRC/BJuKm0wRC_0_0_462_263_0_small.jpg

Senior Hamas member and UNRWA staffer, killed in Tyre, Hamas says	Fatah Sharif Abu al Amin praised the Hamas massacre on October 7, was temporarily suspended from the UN agency for 'violating regulations' The Hamas terror group said on Monday that its senior member, Fatah Sharif Abu al Amin, was killed in an IDF strike in the area of Tyre, along with his wife, son and daughter. Al Amin who was quick to praise the Hamas massacre on October 7 was described as the terror group's leader in Lebanon and a member of its international leadership. He was also employed by the UN's Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees UNRWA and was chairman of its teacher's union. UNRWA said he was suspended from his position as teacher in the UN's school last march for a period of three months over what it described was a violation of regulations. After his suspension, dozens protested outside the UNRWA offices in Beirut. Israel accused the UN agency of employing terrorists in Gaza, some of whom participated in the October 7 atrocities. The UN admitted that at least nine of its employees were probably involved in the massacre. The western areas of South Lebanon are Hamas's main stomping grounds and its operatives there, have been responsible for much of the rocket fire targeting Nahariya and towns north of Haifa.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syc0nadac	2024-09-29T23:39:00-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/rkGISnD00/rkGISnD00_0_143_628_354_0_small.jpg

Senior PFLP members killed in Beirut strike	The attack on an apartment block in Beirut was the first carried out on a Sunni neighborhood outside the Hezbollah stronghold in the Dahieh A Palestinian terror group said on Monday that three of its leaders were killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut, the first attack within city limits as Israel escalated hostilities against Iran's allies in the region. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the three leaders were killed in a strike that targeted Beirut's Kola district. The strike hit the upper floor of an apartment building in the Kola district of Lebanon's capital, Reuters witnesses said. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military. The PFLP is another group taking part in the fight against Israel. Israel's increasing frequency of attacks against the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and the Houthi militia in Yemen have prompted fears that Middle East fighting could spin out of control and draw in Iran and the United States, Israel's main ally. Israel on Sunday launched airstrikes against the Houthi militia in Yemen and dozens of Hezbollah targets throughout Lebanon after earlier killing the Hezbollah leader. The Houthi-run health ministry said at least four people were killed and 29 wounded in airstrikes on Yemen's port of Hodeidah, which Israel said were a response to Houthi missile attacks. In Lebanon, authorities said at least 105 people had been killed by Israeli air strikes on Sunday. Lebanon's Health Ministry has said more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said a million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes. The intensifying Israeli bombardment over two weeks has killed a string of top Hezbollah officials, including its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Israel has vowed to keep up the assault and says it wants to make its northern areas secure again for residents who have been forced to flee Hezbollah rocket attacks. Monday's attack in the Kola district appeared to be the first strike within Beirut's city limits. Syrians living in southern Lebanon who had fled Israeli bombardment had been sleeping under a bridge in the neighborhood for days, residents of the area said. The United States has urged a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Lebanon but has also authorized its military to reinforce in the region. U.S. President Joe Biden asked if an all-out war in the Middle East could be avoided, replied: 'It has to be.' He said he would be talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1h7qiwac	2024-09-29T21:13:07-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/BkxWXksvR0/BkxWXksvR0_0_60_800_450_0_small.jpg
Hezbollah names new leader after Nasrallah assassination, report ...	Terror group's executive council head Hashem Safieddine reportedly tapped to succeed cousin slain in Israeli airstrike in Beirut; Iranian axis making arrangements for 'historic funeral' Hezbollah's Shura Council has chosen Hashem Safieddine as the organization's new secretary-general, following the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike on Beirut’s Dahieh district on Friday, Saudi television channel Al Hadath reported Sunday. Safieddine is Nasrallah's cousin and the head of Hezbollah's executive council. His appointment has yet to be officially confirmed by either Hezbollah or Lebanese authorities. Reports over the weekend identified Safieddine as a likely successor to Nasrallah, and various outlets noted that he was not present at the senior meeting where Nasrallah was killed. Safieddine, who closely resembles Nasrallah, is also the son-in-law of former Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani. Often referred to as Nasrallah’s 'shadow,' he has served as Hezbollah’s second-in-command, overseeing the group’s daily operations, including its institutions, finances and investments both in Lebanon and abroad. Since 1994, when Nasrallah recalled him from his studies in Qom, Iran, to lead Hezbollah's executive council—essentially the group’s government—Safieddine has managed all sensitive issues while Nasrallah handled strategic matters. His close ties to both Hezbollah's military wing and Iran have been well-documented, and he has been on the U.S. terrorist list since 2017. Meanwhile, it remains unclear when Nasrallah's funeral will take place. According to Reuters, his body was recovered from the site of the attack. A medical and security official in Lebanon told Reuters that the body was intact and Nasrallah did not suffer direct injuries. His death was attributed to the trauma caused by the explosion. Initial reports suggested the funeral would be held on Monday, but there has been no confirmation from Lebanese or Hezbollah officials. Lebanon’s An-Nahar newspaper reported that Hezbollah's leadership has been holding high-level consultations, involving officials from Iraq and Iran, to finalize funeral arrangements. Although no official statement has been made by Hezbollah, sources say a 'historic funeral' is planned in Beirut. There are also reports that prayers will be held in Iran, after which Nasrallah’s body will be flown to Karbala, Iraq, for burial near Imam Hussein, grandson of Prophet Muhammad and one of the most important figures in Shia Islam. In Iran, a portrait of Nasrallah was displayed alongside President Masoud Pezeshkian during a government meeting on Sunday. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari, in an interview with Sky News Arabia, said Nasrallah 'escalated tensions in Lebanon for Hamas. He paid the price. The world is safer without him; he terrorized many in the region.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1g113nva0	2024-09-29T14:08:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2022/05/20/HyaGDCEv9/HyaGDCEv9_0_0_680_396_0_small.jpg

Strike on Hodeidah port disrupts Houthi fuel supply, military say...	Gallant says cost of attacking Israel 'seen on television screens around the world' in response to repeated missile launches by Houthi rebels The IDF said Sunday that it launched airstrikes on the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah and nearby targets in Yemen after the rebel group repeatedly fired missiles at Israel. Dozens of Israeli fighter jets bombed the city's power station and port, hitting infrastructure used for oil intake as well as an oil depot that had been spared in a previous Israeli strike in July in retaliation for a deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv. The IDF said the attack has halted fuel supplies through the seaport and is expected to severely impact the Houthis' military capabilities. 'This time we targeted the Houthis' bottleneck,' the military said. The IDF confirmed that Air Force jets, which flew 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from Israel, refueled mid-flight during the operation. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was present at the Air Force command center during the strikes. 'The military's ability to strike on seven fronts almost simultaneously speaks volumes about its strength,' Gallant said. 'We are targeting the tentacles of Iran that are spread across the region.' Gallant praised the IDF's long-range capabilities, saying, 'These strikes send a clear message to those who seek to harm us: Israel will exact a heavy price, and we mean it. The cost of attacking Israel is seen on television screens around the world.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk001bmprr	2024-09-29T13:24:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/BkalHyDA0/BkalHyDA0_1_241_352_198_0_small.jpg
Since October 7, 170 new books on the war published, report revea...	National Library report finds most frequently covered topics in recent publications include hostages, stories of heroism, protests, soldiers' memories and rise of antisemitism in diaspora As the first anniversary of the October 7 terrorist attack approaches, Israel's National Library released a special report on Sunday highlighting books published in the wake of the war. According to the report, 169 books and publications have been released, covering topics such as the hostages, stories of heroism, protests and memories of soldiers, as well as the rise of antisemitism in the Diaspora. Of these, 42 are research papers and reports, 30 are nonfiction and reference books, 29 are personal testimonies and accounts of heroism, 14 are poetry collections, 9 are works of fiction and 3 are children's books. The National Library emphasized that the report is only partial, noting that writing and publishing books is a lengthy and complex process, predicting that hundreds more books will be published in the coming years, including a significant number of memorial and tribute books expected to be released around the anniversary of the war. For comparison, the library examined the number of books published after the Yom Kippur War and found that about 300 were released within the first year (by the end of 1974). Over the following 50 years, thousands more books were published on the topic, both in Hebrew and other languages. Since the outbreak of the war on October 7, the National Library has been tasked with creating an archive that documents all aspects of the digital response. So far, this includes 500 million online items, such as WhatsApp messages, social media posts and videos, as well as two million digital files, more than a thousand printed materials like posters, flyers and booklets, and thousands of filmed testimonies. As part of its commemorative efforts, the library has launched a project titled 'Lives Lost: The Works of the Victims of October 7,' which honors those who wrote, edited and translated books before their lives were tragically cut short. Additionally, on October 6, the library will host a musical performance titled 'At the End of Tishrei: An Evening of Poetry and Remembrance,' featuring journalist Ben Shani as host and performances by Shlomi Saranga, Alma Gov, The Backyard and others. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryzhjyvr0	2024-09-29T13:07:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/07/10/SJr00F042DC/SJr00F042DC_145_147_1057_595_0_small.jpg
IDF chief’s cryptic photo sparks questions as Sinwar vanishes aft...	Army releases photo showing IDF chief seated in front of screen with picture of Hamas leader and question mark over his face, amid rumors Sinwar may be dead; speculation grew after reports he went incommunicado The IDF released a photo Sunday evening showing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi at his desk, with an infographic in the background featuring a picture of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar with a question mark over his face. Speculation has grown in Israel over the past week regarding Sinwar's status, with rumors circulating about whether he has been killed or injured after reports that he has been out of contact. However, defense officials said there is no concrete information confirming his whereabouts, and no recent targeted strikes have been reported in areas where Sinwar was believed to be. On Saturday, Saudi-based Al Arabiya reported that Sinwar changed his location in Gaza following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. The report also claimed that Hamas has adjusted its security protocols for Sinwar and other leaders in recent days. Sources told Al Arabiya that Hamas leaders are seeking guarantees in any future cease-fire agreement to ensure their safety. Additionally, Hamas has halted organizational meetings in Lebanon and restricted internal communications to written correspondence to avoid potential Israeli interception or tracking of senior officials' locations. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdwngdrc	2024-09-29T12:50:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/11/HJa74KHSA/HJa74KHSA_0_0_713_401_0_small.jpg

Mocked Israel, suppressed hijab protests: Iranian general assassi...	Iranian deputy foreign minister vows killing of Abbas Nilforoushan 'will not go unanswered'; sanctioned by US in 2022 for role in suppressing civil rights protests in Iran Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi vowed on Sunday that Iran would avenge the killing of senior Quds Force officer Abbas Nilforoushan, who was killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's Dahieh district. 'This will not go unanswered,' Araghchi said, following confirmation from Iranian officials that Nilforoushan had been present in the underground headquarters at the time of the strike. Araghchi’s remarks come amid reports of an internal debate within the Iranian regime over how to respond to Nasrallah’s far more significant assassination. According to The New York Times, hardliners in Tehran are pushing for swift retaliation, while Iran's more moderate President Massoud Pezhkian is cautioning against a regional war that could severely damage Iran's economy. Regardless, Tehran may feel compelled to retaliate, as it did after the assassination of another top Iranian general in an Israeli strike on Damascus in April. Nilforoushan, 58, was described by Iranian media as the 'deputy commander of operations' for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, where he oversaw ground forces. While it’s unclear what he was doing in Lebanon, AP notes the Quds Force’s crucial role in arming and directing Iran’s proxies throughout the Middle East, most notably Hezbollah. Recent reports suggest that Nilforoushan was effectively the Quds Force commander in Syria and Lebanon. Iran’s deputy judiciary chief Ahmad Reza Kahan declared that Nilforoushan had been 'a guest of the Lebanese people' and that Iran has a right to respond under international law. Nilforoushan had previously mocked Israel, frequently repeating anti-Israel rhetoric similar to that of Nasrallah. In a 2022 interview with Iran’s state news agency IRNA, he said: 'The Zionist regime has many cracks—ethnic, cultural, social and military. The regime is more vulnerable to collapse than ever.' That same year, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Nilforoushan, accusing him of playing a direct role in suppressing civil rights protests in Iran. The sanctions coincided with widespread demonstrations following the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died after being detained by Iran's morality police for not wearing a hijab in accordance with strict Sharia law. Nilforoushan blamed Iran's enemies for stoking the protests. Nilforoushan also fought alongside Syria’s Assad regime in the bloody civil war that saw the Syrian dictator maintain power with the help of Iran, Hezbollah and Russia. He began his military career during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, and Iranian media described him as a close associate of powerful Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2020. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bj8wwwp0r	2024-09-29T12:22:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/S1P00iuSCR/S1P00iuSCR_0_10_800_450_0_small.jpg
Israel strikes on four fronts, sending stark warning to Iran	Senior official says fighter jets flew 1,800 kilometers to strike Houthi assets in Yemen, including Hodeidah port and airport, underscoring Air Force capable of reaching targets at similar distance to Iran if required The Israel Defense Forces launched extensive airstrikes Sunday on targets in Yemen, Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, including the Lebanese capital Beirut. The strikes reportedly targeted sites in Homs, western Syria and areas near Damascus. Senior officials told Ynet that the strike on Yemen came in response to Houthi missile fire on Tel Aviv on Saturday. The attack was also aimed at deterring Iran from retaliating for the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli officials said the strikes were intended to send a clear message to Iran, with the IDF showing it can engage on multiple fronts. Air Force jets flew 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) to strike Hodeidah, a distance comparable to that from Israel to Iran. 'The strike on Yemen aims to exact a heavy price for their attacks,' an Israeli official said. 'If the Houthis continue targeting Israel, our strikes will intensify.' Iran has vowed to avenge the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran last July in an attack attributed to Israel. The IDF said in a statement that dozens of Israeli Air Force planes, including fighter jets, mid-air refueling aircraft and reconnaissance planes, struck military targets belonging to the Houthi forces in the Ras Issa and Hodeidah areas of Yemen. The targets included power plants and a seaport used to import oil, which the Houthis used to transfer Iranian weapons. The military added that the damage to Houthi infrastructure would take time to repair. 'The IDF is determined to continue operating at any distance—near or far—against all threats to Israeli citizens,' the statement concluded. The military also confirmed targeted strikes on Hezbollah officials in Beirut’s Dahieh neighborhood, including a senior commander from Unit 1600, responsible for producing rocket and missile materials and trafficking the addictive stimulant Captagon. In Gaza, the IDF said it targeted a Hamas command center operating from a school. The military stressed it had taken precautions to avoid civilian casualties. Meanwhile, Syrian state media reported that air defenses were activated in response to Israeli strikes near Damascus, following earlier strikes on Homs. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkuvrevca	2024-09-29T11:59:56-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/By7x5sJPA0/By7x5sJPA0_0_453_520_293_0_small.jpg

New Hope Party leader Gideon Sa'ar joins government amid war	Veteran lawmaker assigned minister without portfolio, will be included in inner circle of war consultations and serve as member of Security Cabinet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday that New Hope Party leader Gideon Sa'ar is set to join the government as a minister without portfolio. He will also be included in the inner circle of war consultations and serve as a member of the Security Cabinet. Sa’ar’s return to government comes after years of tension between him and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Once a close ally and a senior figure in the prime minister's ruling Likud party, Sa’ar broke away from Likud in 2020 to form the New Hope Party, citing deep disagreements with Netanyahu’s leadership and policies. Sa’ar had previously held key roles under Netanyahu’s leadership, including serving as minister of education and the interior. However, his defection was seen as a direct challenge to Netanyahu, as Sa’ar became one of his most vocal critics, positioning himself as an alternative leader on the right. In the early days of the war, Sa'ar joined an emergency unity government with Netanyahu under the National Unity alliance with former IDF chiefs of staff Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, taking part in the War Cabinet. Sa'ar, Gantz and Eisenkot resigned from the Cabinet in June, citing their inability to influence key decision-making processes. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryaeq11prr	2024-09-29T09:46:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/SJ5WXZv0C/SJ5WXZv0C_0_0_1280_836_0_small.jpg

Saudi crown prince says doesn't care about 'Palestinian issue'	Mohammed bin Salman reportedly tells Blinken kingdom's young population first learning about Israeli-Palestinian conflict through Gaza war Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in January that, while he does not personally prioritize the Palestinian issue, it holds significant importance for the Saudi people, according to a report by The Atlantic. 'Do I care personally about the Palestinian issue? I don’t, but my people do,' he reportedly said during a meeting in Al-Ula, a remote oasis in Saudi Arabia, as part of American efforts to address the ongoing war in Gaza and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages. The crown prince explained that with 70% of Saudi Arabia’s population being young, the Gaza war marked the first time many of them were exposed to the Palestinian issue. During the meeting, Blinken sought to revive talks on Saudi-Israeli normalization, which had stalled after the October 7 Hamas attacks and the subsequent war. When asked what it would take to resume progress, the crown prince responded, 'calm in Gaza.' According to the report, Blinken also inquired whether Saudi Arabia would tolerate Israeli operations in Gaza to dismantle terrorist infrastructure. Bin Salman reportedly replied that such incursions might be acceptable 'in six months or a year,' but stressed they could not be tied to any cease-fire agreement. A Saudi official later suggested that the details of the crown prince's comments in The Atlantic report were inaccurate but did not deny the overall substance of the remarks. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1s1111ypra	2024-09-29T09:07:54-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/03/21/rylmMSKAT/rylmMSKAT_0_156_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

IDF confirms strike on Houthi-controlled targets in Yemen	The IDF said it carried out a large-scale aerial operation on Sunday, striking what it described as 'Houthi-controlled military targets in Yemen,' about 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from Israel's border. 'The airstrikes focused on key military infrastructure in the Ras Issa and Hodeidah regions, including power stations and a port used for importing oil. These facilities were being used by the Iranian-backed Houthi regime to transfer weapons and military supplies, including oil, to their forces,' a statement read. According to the army, dozens of aircraft, including fighter jets, tankers and reconnaissance planes, participated in the operation, which was directed by the Military Intelligence Directorate. The IDF said the operation was in direct retaliation for recent Houthi missile attacks on Israel. Over the past year, the Houthi regime has intensified its activities against Israel, working closely with Iranian militias in Iraq to destabilize the region and disrupt global shipping routes.

The incident follows a recent spike in missile activity from Yemen, where just Saturday night, a surface-to-surface missile was fired toward Israel, triggering air raid sirens across several regions. The missile was successfully intercepted outside Israeli territory. This latest missile was the second launched by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the past three days, adding to growing tensions. Earlier this month, the Houthis fired a missile at Israel, partially intercepted near Ben Gurion Airport, raising concerns over Israeli deterrence.

IDF targets senior Hezbollah commander in fresh Dahieh strike	Strike reportedly targets commander of Unit 1600, which oversees production materials for rockets and missiles, as well as drug manufacturing operations organization traffics globally to fund its activities The IDF resumed airstrikes on Sunday, targeting the Dahieh district in Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. The main target of the attack was reportedly the commander of Hezbollah's Unit 1600, a division responsible for developing missile and rocket materials, as well as weapons production. Unit 1600 is also allegedly behind the production and trafficking of the addictive, amphetamine-type stimulant drug Captagon, which funds Hezbollah's global terrorist activities. The unit's highly restricted bases are located within civilian neighborhoods, with access granted only to those with personal authorization from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah or his cousin, Hashem Safieddine. Safieddine, seen as Nasrallah's successor, was also reportedly targeted in a separate Israeli strike on Saturday. In the early hours, another strike was reported in Dahieh, raising tensions as Hezbollah revealed on Sunday the identities of senior commanders who died alongside Nasrallah. Among them was Ali Karaki, third in command and the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, who had previously survived an Israeli assassination attempt, and Nabil Qaouk, a central council member in charge of internal security. Hezbollah confirmed that Nasrallah’s body was recovered from the underground command bunker bombed on Friday. While Hezbollah's initial statement did not detail the exact circumstances of his death, sources indicated that Nasrallah had no visible wounds, and the likely cause of death was blunt trauma from the force of the blast. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bk11211cl0a	2024-09-29T07:17:37-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/HJctRhIA0/HJctRhIA0_0_251_961_540_0_small.jpg
Pilots reveal: The tactical feints that led to Nasrallah's assass...	After leading successful assassination mission targeting Hezbollah leader in Beirut, 69th Squadron commander calls operation 'historic,' emphasizing precision, team effort and emotional impact; 'We knew exactly who the target was' Following the airstrike that eliminated Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah and key operatives, Hatzerim Air Base commander Brig. Gen. Amichai Levin hailed the operation as a historic military success. In an interview, Levin explained, 'Dozens of bombs hit the target within seconds, and no anti-aircraft missiles were fired.' The precision strike took out Nasrallah's command bunker in Beirut’s Dahieh district, a move Israel hopes will reshape the strategic landscape in the Middle East. Levin, in command for just two weeks before the operation, said the mission was a critical step toward achieving Israel's war objectives. 'Nasrallah was the central figure in the Shiite axis,' he said, adding that his elimination would significantly impact Hezbollah and Iran's regional strategies. The operation, conducted by Israel’s elite 69th Squadron, was executed with high-level coordination between intelligence and military units. 'The intelligence provided was incredibly precise, which allowed for such a successful mission,' Levin said. He emphasized that the mission showcased a level of decisiveness and initiative that had been missing before October 7, when Israel was caught off guard by surprise attacks from Hamas. 'This is my most important lesson from that day because we must act aggressively and proactively against those who seek to harm us and there are more of them. The mission is not over and we will keep striking Hamas at its roots as we deal with the northern threat.' 69th Squadron commander Lt. Col. M. noted that his wife is from a kibbutz near the northern border and her family was evacuated at the beginning of the war. 'This is a significant firepower with many planes. We waited for a few days until an opportunity arose. People realized this was an unusual opportunity, and therefore they had to know how to succeed and be very precise. Young teams that had only completed training a year ago, along with 50-year-olds in the reserves, participated in the mission. 'We knew exactly who was the target' The squadron commander led the formation alongside a reservist pilot. Describing the mission, Lt. Col. M. said, 'The operation went smoothly, exactly as planned. We knew exactly who was the target.' Following the landing, the emotional commander reflected on the significance of the mission. 'I hugged the crew because you probably only do something this big and historic once in a lifetime. The second hug was for my technical officer, who worked tirelessly to arm the planes. His brother was killed on the Lebanese border. The third was to my family, at Friday night dinner. We didn't talk much, waiting for results, but they understood.' Lt. Col. M. revealed that the target's identity was kept secret until just hours before the operation. 'When the pilots learned who the target was, they understood the mission's value and risk.' Brig. Gen. Levin added, 'The key operational challenge was precise intelligence—ensuring the target didn't flee before the strike. We employed creative tactics to ensure success.' He noted that Hezbollah's anti-aircraft defenses were neutralized prior to the operation, and the pilots synchronized a large amount of ordnance, striking within seconds of each other. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1svs2l00	2024-09-29T06:53:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/HkQ1ccWmAA/HkQ1ccWmAA_194_220_890_501_0_small.jpg

Syrian national wearing keffiyeh goes on rampage in Germany, crit...	A Syrian man wearing in the city of Essen set fire to a building, then threatened passers by with a machete while locals scrambled to safety; He was eventually apprehended, and the media is curiously silent about the incident A 41-year-old Syrian man launched an attack in the city of Essen in western Germany on Saturday night, injuring 31 German citizens, including eight children. Two of these children, ages 2 and 4, are in critical condition. Video footage from the scene shows the Syrian man wearing a keffiyeh and armed with a long machete. He set fire to one residential building, got into his gray Opel van, drove a few hundred yards, and set another residential building on fire. In footage captured before the arrival of security and firefighting forces, citizens are seen placing ladders, which were too short, against the building's exterior wall in an effort to get people out of the burning buildings. Parents, screaming hysterically for help, were desperately trying to rescue their children by pulling them out of windows. Ten minutes later, the suspect returned to his van, drove a short distance, and crashed into the windows of two shops. At this point, he exited the vehicle wielding a large machete and attempted to threaten those around him, but bystanders managed to keep their distance by throwing objects at him and using iron rods and wooden sticks. The police captured the suspect, but have not yet disclosed the motive for the attack. One line of investigation suggests that the Syrian was enraged by his wife leaving him, prompting a destructive spree, although this does not explain the attack on the additional building, the shop crashes, and the use of a machete. Some media outlets reported it as a terrorist attack, with journalists noting that he wore a keffiyeh on his head. Two helicopters evacuated the injured from the Essen attack, including five who were seriously wounded, to a nearby hospital. In both cases, the suspect used a gas canister to set the buildings ablaze. He ignited fires in the wooden staircases, trapping the building's residents with no means of escape. Despite the horrific attempt at mass murder and the critical condition of two toddlers (lung damage in children from smoke inhalation is extremely lethal), the German media, preoccupied throughout the weekend with harsh condemnations of Nasrallah's elimination (including from Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock), attempted to downplay the incident, push it to the back of the news, and conceal the fact that the perpetrator was a Syrian national. This attack is part of a wave of terrorist assaults on German citizens by Muslim immigrants, which has resulted in the murder of four citizens, including an on-duty police officer. This surge in terror has prompted authorities to adopt a firmer stance against Islamist elements in the country and a more aggressive policy against immigration, including the redeployment of police forces at the country's borders. The violence by Muslim immigrants in Germany has also strengthened the far-right in the country, as seen in elections held this month in three federal states, and in polls for the federal elections to be held next year. In neighboring Austria, where federal elections are being held today, the right-wing is also expected to win, primarily due to dissatisfaction with immigration policies and citizens' personal security concerns. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b12cchia0	2024-09-29T05:41:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/HJx11x4o8AA/HJx11x4o8AA_1_501_800_451_0_small.jpg

Nasrallah's body recovered from rubble two days after assassinati...	His body is intact and cause of death appears to be blunt trauma from the force of the blast The body of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been recovered from the site of an Israeli air attack on Beirut's southern suburbs and is intact, a medical source and a security source told Reuters on Sunday. While Hezbollah's statement on Saturday confirming Nasrallah's death did not say how exactly he was killed nor when his funeral would be, the two sources said his body had no direct wounds and that it appeared the cause of death was blunt trauma from the force of the blast. The IDF confirmed Saturday that Nasrallah was killed in the attack on Hezbollah's central headquarters Dahieh district of Beirut, and more than three hours later Hezbollah also confirmed that their leader was killed in the attack, but the Shiite terrorist organization did not specify exactly how and when his funeral would take place. Along with Nasrallah, Ali Karaki, commander of the southern front in Hezbollah, and other commanders in the terrorist organization also were killed in the same attack. More than 80 bombs, with an average weight of one ton of explosive material per bomb, were dropped on the Hezbollah headquarters, which the bunker-busting munitions penetrated, though Israel has not confirmed the use of such bombs. Squadron 69 ('The Hammers') led the attack in Operation New Order with its F-15I ('Thunder') planes, which are considered the leading bombers of the IDF. According to the IDF, the attack was carried out while the top brass of Hezbollah was at its headquarters and engaged in coordinating terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wspnlra	2024-09-29T04:52:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/29/Sk5APcURC/Sk5APcURC_0_312_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
How do Palestinians truly feel about Nasrallah's demise?	Despite criticism and occasional mocking of Palestinian Authority, PA leaders not celebrating Hezbollah chief's assassination by IDF;’ We are confident that Hezbollah will continue his path and uphold the banner of resistance until Jerusalem is liberated’ Nearing the twilight of his tumultuous reign, Hassan Nasrallah fashioned himself as the 'guardian of Palestine,' offering Hezbollah's military might to the cause against Israel. Yet, the relationship between the leader of the Iran-backed Shiite terror group and the Sunni Palestinians was not always harmonious. While Nasrallah engaged in alliances with various terrorist factions, tensions were particularly pronounced with the Palestinian Authority. Animosity between Hezbollah's secretary general and the Palestinian leadership dates back to the era of Yasser Arafat, who died in 2004. In an interview from that period, Nasrallah, when asked about his disagreements with the Palestinian leadership, retorted: 'What Palestinian leadership? Yasser Arafat? We do not recognize this leadership, and it holds no legitimacy among the Palestinians.' In another speech, he provocatively questioned: 'Why isn't there a Palestinian officer or policeman who would assassinate Arafat and proclaim Arafat a disgrace to the Palestinians?' A senior official from the Palestinian Authority, speaking to Ynet following Nasrallah's elimination, stated, 'There were never any ties with Nasrallah or his organization. On the contrary, he preferred to insult us, glorify Hamas, encourage them to defeat Fatah and oust them from power. He sought to incite and deepen the rift between Hamas and Fatah.' Despite this history, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas issued a succinct condolence message to the Lebanese people on the death of Nasrallah and to the citizens of the country. The PLO, an umbrella organization, also released a statement expressing sorrow and calling for an urgent cessation of the conflict 'against Palestinians and Lebanese.' In Ramallah, a protest against Israel took place in the evening, with images of Nasrallah prominently displayed. For Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the relationships were markedly different. Nasrallah viewed them as a critical operational arm within the territories for the 'axis of evil.' Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy leader of Hamas, stated in a recorded message: 'We mourn with the Palestinian people and the entire nation the death of Hassan Nasrallah and his fellow fighters.' He added: 'The occupation bears responsibility and consequences for Nasrallah's elimination and the attack in Beirut. The assassination of Hassan Nasrallah will not break the resistance.' Ziyad al-Nakhalah, secretary-general of Islamic Jihad, was also known to be close to Hezbollah's secretary-general and the Iranian leadership, which provided him significant financial support. 'The Palestinian resistance understands that it has lost great support in its path, and it will remain loyal to his memory and great legacy,' al-Nakhalah stated. 'We are confident Hezbollah will continue his path and uphold the banner of resistance until Jerusalem is liberated.' In Gaza, a year into the war initiated by Hamas and joined by Hezbollah, opinions diverged following Nasrallah's elimination. Anas Sharif, a journalist from Jabaliya who is affiliated with Hamas, tweeted: 'We belong to God, and to Him we shall return. O God, compensate us for our disaster and give us something better.' In contrast, Gazan journalist Ihab Al-Fasfus wrote on Facebook: 'In a moment, he found himself before God, accountable for all his deeds in creation... and there will be no intercession or forgiveness.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkqgriuaa	2024-09-29T04:36:27-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/Sk11jaXaBAC/Sk11jaXaBAC_0_227_3000_1689_0_small.jpg

Special report by Lebanese journalist: Everyone is asking, 'Who b...	As refugee centers fill up and rent is jacked up following assassination of Hezbollah's Nasrallah, Lebanese public is reacting with either hysteria, repression or suspicion; Despite major blow, fear of Hezbollah still exists on the street 'This man, Hassan Nasrallah, will not die,' claimed Lebanese Hezbollah supporters on Saturday. Many of them are still waiting to see him on television screens, explaining what will happen next. They think that the announcement of his death is a ruse and a tactic designed to confuse the enemy. It's hard to believe. Yesterday I went for a long walk through Beirut's streets. The city, which always was bustling with life, seemed dead. In the few places where young people still gathered, there was complete hysteria: 'This man was killed in his prime, they killed him and humiliated him,' claimed Nasrallah's supporters, who were almost the only ones who went out into the street. A few hours before, Lebanese citizens held a demonstration in Beirut, with dozens of young people standing in the street, holding Lebanese flags and remaining silent. Although they are still afraid of Hezbollah operatives, their goal is to convey a message to the world that 'Lebanon will remain Lebanon,' with or without the terrorist organization and its leaders who have been eliminated. It is interesting to discover that the people pointed fingers at Iran and not at Israel. 'They abandoned him,' they said in Beirut. 'Nasrallah was revered in Tehran, (Supreme leader Ali) Khamenei brought him closer, made him an ally, and abandoned him.' Khamenei, so the supporters claimed, has a habit of abandoning his allies. First, he abandoned Ismail Haniyeh, then all of Gaza, and now Nasrallah. Lebanese Hezbollah supporters consider Nasrallah's death an Iranian betrayal. The Shiites in Lebanon, who are not members of my sect, are calling to boycott the Iranian ruler, whose representative was eliminated in the strike in the Dahieh district. On the night of the attack, people in the streets of Beirut were already telling stories about Iran's distance from Nasrallah, about his scorn in the eyes of leader Khamenei. These are stories that no one can confirm nor deny. Lebanese Hezbollah supporters consider Nasrallah's death an Iranian betrayal We now know that Hezbollah's actions were completely visible to Israeli intelligence. All his steps were monitored for many months. All the phone calls had another ear listening. A question that disturbs the Lebanese public is: 'Who betrayed Hezbollah?' Conspiracy theories are circulating, with one of them claiming that the Iranians betrayed him to reach a new nuclear agreement with the Americans. According to this theory, the Iranians lied to Nasrallah that the fighting against Israel would not last long but gave him up to the Israelis. Some believe it was the Syrian intelligence officers who led Israel to Nasrallah. Either way, someone betrayed Hezbollah, and Israel was able to discover the exact location of the organization's leadership. Somehow, Israel managed to discover the location and the participants of the secret meeting. The echoes of the explosion were felt dozens of kilometers away from the site of the bombing. This explosion reminded me of the mega-explosion in the port of Beirut in 2020 when the whole city shook following the magnitude of the horrific destruction, with hundreds of dead and injured. Citizens of Israel, think of us, of the innocent citizens of Lebanon. We are not a party to the war. We are suffering. The Lebanese waited with bated breath for confirmation of the rumors of Nasrallah's assassination. At first, they were sure that this was Israeli propaganda and Hezbollah waited almost a day to make the announcement. In the meantime, refugees from Dahieh found themselves and their families without a roof over their heads, crying, destitute, lost and refusing to believe that this disaster had befallen them. This situation did not start with Nasrallah's death. On Monday the residents of South Lebanon woke up to the sounds of sirens from the Israeli army bombings, which called them to evacuate their homes immediately. The residents fled, carrying a few belongings, and escaped in cars, creating an endless traffic jam. Their journey from southern Lebanon to Beirut, which usually takes two hours, took 20 long hours. When they finally arrived in Beirut, they found that no reception centers were waiting for them. There was no emergency plan. The Education Ministry opened makeshift schools, and Beirut residents voluntarily took refugees into their homes. The churches also took in refugees, but the Lebanese government was nowhere in sight to help or mobilize. Dahieh refused to take refugees at the beginning of the week. Now, when the residents fled in fear, they discovered that the reception centers were already full. Many had to spend the nights in their cars. Others slept by the side of the road, on blankets that they managed to get out of their homes before fleeing. Other refugees spent their days and nights in the Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, forced to reside near the dead buried there. There are also refugees who chose to flee to areas hostile to Hezbollah, such as the city of Tripoli in northern Lebanon. They discovered signs meant to welcome them. However, the refugees were warned not to hang pictures of the hated Nasrallah and to remove his pictures from their cars. Citizens of Israel, think of us, of the innocent citizens of Lebanon. We are not a party to the war. We are suffering. Even if some of the food stores are open, no one can afford to buy enough food. Meat has not been on our table for many days. Power outages last at least nine hours a day, and rent has tripled. A house that cost $1,000 two weeks ago has now jumped to $3,000. Two families squeeze into a small two-room apartment. We were promised a short war, but for almost a year the citizens of Lebanon have not known their fates. Anyone who can afford it, tries to escape or runs away. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese refugees are still sleeping under the stars. They say that Hezbollah is done! So they say. Some argue that this is just a short break before the next stage of the campaign. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/hjgb45u0c	2024-09-29T04:19:52-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/yk14096132/yk14096132_1_134_1256_708_0_small.jpg

Activists protest escalating Mideast crisis outside UK base in Cy...	Pro-Palestinian campaigners protested at the gates of RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus on Sunday, accusing Britain of offering tacit support to Israel's ongoing operations in Gaza and elsewhere. Chanting 'Out with the bases of death' a couple of hundred people holding Palestinian and Cypriot flags peacefully protested outside the locked gates of the facility, Britain's largest in the Middle East. Britain last week sent additional troops to Cyprus to be in position to assist any potential evacuation of nationals trapped in Lebanon, which is reeling from a barrage of Israeli air strikes which culminated in the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday evening. The UK has two military bases on Cyprus, a former British colony. RAF Akrotiri has been used in the past as a staging point for airstrikes against Houthi forces in Yemen in retaliation for attacks on Red Sea shipping that the Iran-backed group says is a response to the war in Gaza .A British bases spokesperson said: 'No RAF flights have transported lethal cargo to the Israeli Defense Forces.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkjzynicr	2024-09-29T03:43:46-07:00

The Kremlin said on Sunday that amendments to Russia's nuclear doctrine had been prepared and were about to be formalized, meaning the relevant documents setting out the circumstances in which nuclear arms can be used by Moscow will be updated. President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday that under proposed changes to the doctrine Russia could use nuclear arms if it was struck with conventional missiles and would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. The changes were widely seen as an attempt by Putin to draw a 'red line' for the United States and its allies by signaling that Moscow will consider responding with nuclear weapons if they allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range Western missiles.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjzjdjicr	2024-09-29T03:12:37-07:00

Mixed emotions for families who lost loved ones at hand of Nasral...	Some 18 years have passed since the Second Lebanon War, and families whose loved ones were killed during that time are experiencing mixed emotions; Some are happy he's gone, but for many it just triggers a flood of painful memories The assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, one of Israel's premier enemies in recent decades, has elicited mixed reactions among bereaved families whose loved ones were killed during his tenure. For some, it represents personal and historical closure. Yet, emotions are far more complex: while it is indeed a significant achievement for Israel's security forces, it does not heal the deep wounds left by war on the souls of grieving parents, siblings and children. Liora Hasson, whose son, Staff Sergeant Guy Hasson, fell on August 13, 2006, during the final day of the Second Lebanon War, said she is 'not getting carried away' with celebrating until the entire so-called axis of evil is destroyed. 'If we put everything in perspective, I'm not celebrating or handing out sweets. I've already taken my hit. I am glad that the head of the 'axis of evil' has been eliminated, but I will only truly rejoice when the entire axis is destroyed. Until then, this is just a small point in my heart, warming another corner, but I'm not getting carried away. Revenge won't lead to anything. After today, we should remember what all the fallen in this current war have said and what our sons hoped for – that when this nation unites and works together, we will prevail eightfold. The only comfort would be if Guy returned; nothing else will help. As a Jewish Israeli, I am proud that we have wonderful sons in the sea, air and land forces who know how to do the job,.' she said. 'In a sense, quite the opposite – today I am sadder, and the pain is sharper. This entire period is déjà vu of what happened 18 years ago. If we were united and did not have this hatred among the people, we could have reached this operation much sooner. We have the capabilities and everything, but everything is overshadowed when there is hatred,' she added. 'There's a song written by Moshe Klughaft called 'We Deserve More.' I think what summarizes the IDF's tremendous success today in eliminating Nasrallah is seeing that we deserve more. We have an excellent army, a wonderful nation, and if we know how to direct it, unite it and not incite, then we will reach perfection, and as a people we deserve more. Today, there's nothing more fitting than this song to tell our leaders: we deserve more, more than what you are. We deserve leadership that understands and knows how to unite this nation. We deserve people who know how to take responsibility.' 'For many years I waited for Nasrallah to be held accountable' Tal Sheinbrum, whose brother Yaniv Sheinbrum fell in the Second Lebanon War alongside Guy Hasson, reflected on the sense of closure. 'This is something that has accompanied me personally and my family for 18 years since the Second Lebanon War, where I fought alongside Yaniv. We were both in Lebanon. On the last day, when the cease-fire terms had been agreed but had not yet taken effect, Yaniv was hit by an anti-tank missile. While they were treating him, another missile hit, and he died. I was deep in Lebanon at the time and was informed in the evening hours, and from that moment our lives changed. I won't say that I was preoccupied daily with Nasrallah's future, but for many years I waited for him to be held accountable for what happened to my brother and others during the 30 years he has led this organization. Hearing that it happened gave me a significant sense of closure and revenge for all the evil he brought to this world,' he said. Is there a message you’d like to convey to our leaders? 'The policy of containment has not proven itself. This attempt not to heat up the area and not to disturb the calm in the north and south has led us to a harsher reality than before. We need to respond wherever and whenever they try to harm us. Beyond that, I think the policy that relies solely on military action and strikes will not change the future for my children in the Middle East and in our country. We need to leverage military successes for a more strategic solution to change the reality so our children have a future here. As a citizen of the state, a father, and a bereaved brother – with all due respect to Nasrallah, Hezbollah and Hamas, in the end, the only thing that will determine the fate of the state and the chance for our children to live here is the internal relations among us within Israel. We need to stop the division, look at each other, and see our brothers.' Lt. German Rozhkov fell in battle near Hanita in the Western Galilee in March 2002, at the age of 22. That day, two terrorists infiltrated from Lebanon, positioned themselves on two hills near Kibbutz Hanita, and opened fire on cars passing by on a road near Kibbutz Matzuva. About 20 poeple were wounded and five were killed. Rozhkov, who happened to be in the area, bravely charged at the terrorists but did not survive the encounter. His mother, Ludmila, who lives in Kiryat Shmona and was evacuated to a hotel in Tiberias at the start of the war, called the assassination of Nasrallah an 'amazing event.' 'You have no idea how much I waited for this moment, as a bereaved mother. A single bullet from Hezbollah terrorists who infiltrated Israel caused me to lose my only son, German. He was a young officer who loved Kiryat Shmona so much and charged the terrorists courageously. Since I lost him, I haven't really had a life,' she told Ynet. She describes her feelings upon hearing about the assassination: 'I'm already waiting to visit German's grave in the military section of the cemetery in Kiryat Shmona. I will tell him that our army is strong and mighty, and there's nothing like our air force. The assassination of Nasrallah is an amazing event, something we should have seen long ago.' However, Ludmila emphasizes that the assassination does not end the struggle. 'Sure, they eliminated Nasrallah, the man who frightened us for many years, but this is not the time to be dazzled or relax. We must continue to act and deliver more blows. Who knows who will step into the shoes of this wicked man. It might be someone even more violent and determined in their ideology to destroy Israel.' During the Second Lebanon War, a great tragedy occurred in early August. Near the entrance to Kibbutz Kfar Giladi, soldiers from the Hiram battalion were preparing to enter Lebanon. As they were organizing at the entrance to the kibbutz cemetery, a rocket fired from Lebanon hit them directly. The blast killed Major Eli Alkarif and 11 other reserve soldiers. Alkarif's widow, Libi, talks abut the aftermath of the incident with pain. 'We have a group of widows who lost what was most precious to them. The husband who was killed left behind a wife and small children in the great tragedy of Kfar Giladi. Yesterday, there were rumors that perhaps Nasrallah had been killed, and today it became certain by morning. To tell the truth, there's no sense of relief; this is something that should have been done long ago, despite the complexity involved in such an assassination. Personally, I feel that justice has been done. I thought I would feel relief, but it didn't really happen. We went through a prolonged nightmare of threats and intimidation with Nasrallah, and it's good that he was eliminated. We must see who will come in his place and ensure that the residents of the north can safely return to their homes.' Tzion Saadia, whose son Liran was killed in the Second Lebanon War in 2006, responded to Nasrallah's assassination with a Biblical verse: ''I will pursue my enemies and overtake them; I will not turn back until they are destroyed.' The soil of Lebanon has claimed over a thousand soldiers' lives and wounded thousands, including our son Liran who fell in the Second Lebanon War, along with many fighters. The Israel Defense Forces is a strong army that we trust. For us, today feels like closure as the air force killed the arch-terrorist.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rj50zyic0	2024-09-29T02:45:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/SkShoYrRC/SkShoYrRC_0_166_1280_721_0_small.jpg

Son-in-law and adviser of former US President Donald Trump, praised assassination of Hassan Nasrallah as 'the most important day in the Middle East since the Abraham Accords breakthrough' which he brokered, and called on Israel to finish the job: 'It has no option to back down' Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump, who alsothe most important day in the Middle East since the Abraham Accords breakthrough.' 'I have spent countless hours studying Hezbollah and there is not an expert on earth who thought that what Israel has done to decapitate and degrade them was possible. This is significant because Iran is now fully exposed. The reason why their nuclear facilities have not been destroyed, despite weak air defense systems, is because Hezbollah has been a loaded gun pointed at Israel. Iran spent the last forty years building this capability as its deterrent,' Kushner posted on the X platform. 'President Trump would often say, 'Iran has never won a war but never lost a negotiation.' The Islamic Republic’s regime is much tougher when risking Hamas, Hezbollah, Syrian and Houthi lives than when risking their own. Their foolish efforts to assassinate President Trump and hack his campaign reek of desperation and are hardening a large coalition against them,' he also wrote in a long post. Kushner also said that 'Iranian leadership is stuck in the old Middle East, while their neighbors in the GCC are sprinting toward the future by investing in their populations and infrastructure. They are becoming dynamic magnets for talent and investment while Iran falls further behind. As the Iranian proxies and threats dissipate, regional security and prosperity will rise for Christians, Muslims and Jews alike.' Trump's advisor, who is Jewish, emphasized that Israel now finds itself with threat from Hamas in Gaza 'mostly neutralized' and with the 'opportunity to neutralize Hezbollah in the north', saying that 'It’s unfortunate how we got here but maybe there can be a silver lining in the end.' He emphasized that 'Anyone who has been calling for a ceasefire in the North is wrong. There is no going back for Israel. They cannot afford now to not finish the job and completely dismantle the arsenal that has been aimed at them. They will never get another chance.' Kushner described Iran as 'reeling' and said that Hezbollah's weapons cache is 'unguarded and unmanned.' 'Failing to take full advantage of this opportunity to neutralize the threat is irresponsible,' he wrote. 'This is a moment to stand behind the peace-seeking nation of Israel and the large portion of the Lebanese who have been plagued by Hezbollah and who want to return to the times when their country was thriving, and Beirut a cosmopolitan city. The main issue between Lebanon and Israel is Iran; otherwise there is a lot of benefit for the people of both countries from working together.' 'The right move now for America would be to tell Israel to finish the job. It’s long overdue,' he wrote. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1poqflcc	2024-09-29T01:26:03-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/12/21/rygNGu6ZPp/rygNGu6ZPp_1717_459_1284_723_0_small.jpg

Iranian president at odds with hardliners on how to respond to Na...	Regime in Tehran was dumbfounded by Nasrallah's death and immediate steps were taken to secure Ayatollah Khamenei, fearing he might be next, NYT reports; President Pezeshkian thinks an attack on Israel might prove detrimental to Iran's security, while hardliners in Tehran advocate for a powerful response The assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah represents a significant strategic blow not only to the Lebanese terrorist group but also to the broader Iranian axis. This development raises pressing questions about how Iran will navigate its next steps. As detailed in the New York Times, which cites insights from four Iranian informants, the assassination of Nasrallah –a long-standing ally of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei – sent shockwaves of anxiety through Tehran's corridors of power. Iranian officials are reportedly pondering whether Iran itself might be Israel's subsequent target, with Khamenei – who, according to a recent Reuters report, has been relocated to a secure location – possibly in the crosshairs. 'This loss is devastating and, frankly, we have no means to recover from it,' Mohammed Ali Atbani, a former vice president of Iran, told the New York Times. 'We will not engage in war; that's not an option. Yet, Iran will steadfastly support armed groups in the region and continue efforts to ease tensions with the West. These objectives can be pursued concurrently,' he asserted. In the wake of Friday's attack on Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut, Khamenei convened an emergency session of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. Iranian sources briefing the Times reported that during this meeting, held at Khamenei's residence, there was significant discord over the nature of Iran's response. Conservative council members, including Saeed Jalili, who lost the recent presidential election to Pezeshkian, argued for a rapid move to 'restore deterrence' against Israel, fearing Netanyahu might otherwise push the conflict to Tehran’s doorstep, according to a source familiar with the meeting's details. In contrast, Pezeshkian, representing Iran's reformist camp that seeks to de-escalate tensions with the U.S. and lift sanctions, warned against a harsh and quick response, urging caution to avoid falling into what he claims is Netanyahu's trap –a bid to provoke a regional war. Additional moderate council members expressed during the meeting that Israel has 'crossed all red lines,' while voicing concerns that an Iranian attack on Israel might invite a direct counterstrike against critical infrastructure within the Islamic Republic. Given its current economic fragility, they argued, Iran cannot afford such a confrontation. In his first public statement following Nasrallah's assassination, Khamenei exercised caution, implying that he anticipates Hezbollah will spearhead the retaliation, with Iran playing a supportive role. 'All resistance forces in Iran stand alongside Hezbollah,' Khamenei declared. 'It will be Hezbollah, leading the resistance forces, that will shape the region's future.' Analysts consulting with the New York Times suggested that Khamenei's remarks indicate that Iran currently lacks an effective strategy to counter Israel's assaults on its proxies. 'Faced with the choice between full-scale war with Israel and 'lowering its profile' for self-preservation, it seems to opt for the latter,' they wrote. Despite Khamenei's cautious approach, the Times notes that Iranian state television—controlled by Jalili's hardline allies – called for the Ayatollah regime to launch a direct attack on Israel. 'There is no distinction between Tehran, Baghdad and Beirut,' an Iranian TV host claimed, arguing that Israel aims to harm them all. 'Netanyahu understands only one language: that of ballistic missiles and drones.' The report emphasizes that, before deciding on retribution against Israel, Iran's primary focus is to rehabilitate Hezbollah after the severe setbacks it has encountered in recent weeks. Two sources from the Revolutionary Guards, including one involved in recent regime discussions on Iran's response, stated that Iran's immediate priority is to enable Hezbollah to 'regain its footing,' appoint a successor to Nasrallah, establish a renewed command structure, and rebuild a secure communication network (following the beeper and walkie-talkie bombings attributed to Mossad). Subsequently, they indicated, Hezbollah could plan its response to Israel. Revolutionary Guards sources added that Iran plans to dispatch a senior Quds Force officer to Beirut, via Syria, to aid in Hezbollah's recovery efforts. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjvubdlcc	2024-09-29T00:48:14-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/09/By6dSUhn0/By6dSUhn0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Austrian voters appear ready to elect far-right 'Freedom Party'	Should the latest polls prove accurate, it's likely that Herbert Kickl, chairman of the 'Freedom Party of Austria' will become the nation's newest chancellor after Sunday's elections; The party is highly resistant to immigration from the Middle East, and also has adopted some antisemitic views As Austria edges toward its general elections on Sunday, the political landscape is poised for a seismic shift. Polls forecast a significant triumph for the far-right Freiheitliche Partei Österreich, or 'Freedom Party of Austria,' an entity with historical ties to the Nazi movement. This could herald the ascent of its leader, Herbert Kickl, to the chancellorship, marking the first time since World War II that such a position is held by a member from this faction. The election outcomes are anticipated to mirror the prevailing European trend toward policies that resist immigration, oppose the European Union, and waver in their support for Ukraine, while adopting a conciliatory stance toward the Kremlin. The Freedom Party's manifesto is rooted in a stringent anti-immigration stance. It seeks to emulate Austria's neighbor, Hungary, which has successfully curtailed the influx of Muslim immigrants, fortified its defenses against radical Islam, and drawn inspiration from Austrian cities where party representatives have prioritized security. These cities have bolstered police forces, installed street surveillance and linked immigrant integration with access to municipal social benefits. In contrast to its neighbor Germany, Austria's far-right party has historically participated in coalition governments, notably under Jörg Haider in 2000. It was also part of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's coalition and remains a coalition partner in three major Austrian states. However, this election might witness an unprecedented milestone with a party member vying for the chancellery and the formation of a government. Currently, the Freedom Party leads the polls with 27%, holding a two-point lead over the People's Party. Despite its modest population of nine million, Austria holds significant clout within the European Union, primarily due to its strategic geographic positioning for trade: the Tyrol region serves as the north-south conduit, while the country's eastern frontier is the nexus between Western Europe and the Balkan states. Should the party ascend to power and pursue initiatives akin to Brexit, distancing or even severing Austria from the EU, it could deal a severe blow to trade relations. However, Austria's geographical importance transcends commerce, extending into security dynamics. The Freedom Party’s rise, perceived as staunchly pro-Russian, could forge a coalition of EU nations sympathetic to Moscow – Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia – thus facilitating the Kremlin's efforts to undermine Western European morale. Geography also plays a pivotal role in immigration and asylum policies: Austria has absorbed more immigrants relative to its population than any other EU country. This is a significant factor behind the Freedom Party's impressive polling performance. These dynamics have led Austrians, who for decades saw themselves as the Nazis' first victims, to rally behind a party founded in the 1950s by former Nazis. Twenty years ago, Jörg Haider elevated the party from obscurity to prominence, and now Kickl, his protégé, is steering the party toward national leadership post its 2019 expulsion due to major scandals. Kickl has advanced a platform that can be viewed as 'Haider-plus': under his leadership, the party openly advocates for a policy of re-migration for those deemed foreigners by authorities. Those anticipating that Kickl might temper his extreme views in a pragmatic turn, reminiscent of Giorgia Meloni in Italy, should recall his tenure as Interior Minister. He orchestrated raids on state security services over suspicions of infiltration by informants and rebranded reception centers as 'departure centers.' The sole hope for Kickl’s opponents lies in the People's Party, the conservative Christian-Democratic faction, opting to isolate the Freedom Party. However, given their historical alliances – having twice entered coalitions – and policy alignments that are closer to the Freedom Party than the current Green Party partners, the likelihood is favorable that Herbert Kickl will emerge as a leading candidate for Austria's chancellorship following Sunday's elections. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rk7eldirc	2024-09-28T23:39:58-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/By0IXmX0C/By0IXmX0C_0_207_3000_1689_0_small.jpg
Nasrallah elimnated: Days of mourning and demonstrations; Syrian ...	A TV presenter choked on tears, Lebanese citizens mount protest marches and wonder 'Who will lead the battle now?', and in Iraq and Yemen they announced three days of mourning; In Iran, protesters took to the streets in support of Hezbollah and the residents of the Gaza Strip The Shiite axis lost one of its most prominent leaders, and the announcement of the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah stunned many. A news anchor on the Lebanese Al-Mayadeen network, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, reported Saturday afternoon in a voice choked with tears that the leader of the terrorist organization had been assassinated in Beirut. According to a report on the Qatari Al-Araby TV channel, Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon felt deep sadness and shock when they learned of Nasrallah's assassination. Mohammed Shabaro, an Al-Araby network journalist, reported that hundreds of Lebanese citizens spontaneously went out Saturday day for protest marches in the streets of Beirut after hearing the news. He reported that he also witnessed several of those in the street crying and suffering emotional breakdowns and claimed that these reactions were not limited to Hezbollah supporters, but also included other sectors of the Lebanese public. 'We are talking about a large-scale security and political event that will change many things in Lebanon,' the reporter said. The Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat also described the feeling of confusion on the Lebanese street after the assassination of Nasrallah. According to the report, people who left their homes were waiting for an explanation about what was going to happen next. One of the residents was quoted as saying: 'A big loss... we will wait for a response.' A young man in his 20s asked: 'Who will lead the battle now? How will we face our fate without him?' While the supporters of the terrorist organization were still in shock, in the city of Tripoli in Lebanon they actually celebrated the death of Nasrallah. Videos of Lebanese and Syrians sharing sweets and shooting in the air as a sign of joy were circulated on the networks. Also from Idlib in Syria, which is under the control of the Syrian opposition, similar scenes of celebrations spread since Nasrallah has many enemies in Syria. Many Syrians remember the atrocities committed by his men when they were sent to assist Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. In recent weeks, many Syrians, mainly Sunnis, celebrated the vulnerability of Hezbollah, from the attacks of explosive pagers and walkie-talkies to the assassination of the organization's leader. They handed out sweets in the streets and posted videos explaining why they hate the terrorist organization so much. The Syrian regime, however, holds a different position. The Syrian Foreign Ministry issued an official condemnation of the assassination on Saturday. 'Lebanon today lost the Secretary General of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, in a cruel and cowardly Israeli attack, which targeted a residential area in the Dahieh area of ​​Beirut, with devastating bombs that caused his death along with a large number of innocent civilians,' it said in a statement. The statement added that Syria 'lays the full responsibility on Israel of the serious consequences of the criminal act.' In the hours after the assassination was officially confirmed, first by the IDF spokesman and later by the terrorist organization Hezbollah, condemnations began to appear from the countries of the Shiite axis. Iraq was among the first countries to announce three official days of mourning. Iraq's Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani said in a statement that the assassination of Nasrallah is 'a crime that confirms that Israel has crossed all the red lines.' In Iran, after the official authorities in the country categorically denied that Nasrallah was killed, with the the official confirmations the condemnations and chants against Israel began to emerge. The spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Nasser Kanaani, said that 'Nasrallah's path will continue and achieve the goal - the liberation of Jerusalem.' Iran's official Tasnim agency posted videos of demonstrations by Iranians against the assassination of Nasrallah. The agency added next to one of the videos that the protesters expressed their willingness to support and help Hezbollah and the residents of the Gaza Strip. The videos also show signs promising violence against Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced Saturday night that Iran is determined to protect its security and confront Israel over its actions. The Houthis in Yemen also announced three days of mourning on Saturday. Pictures of Nasrallah and memorial videos were distributed on the group's social media channels. Abd al-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis in Yemen, spoke Saturday night, and condemned the attack saying: 'No matter how great the casualties, it increases our motivation toward escalation. His (Nasrallah's) martyrdom is a loss for the entire Islamic nation. We confirm that the fronts of support, the axis of jihad and the flag of Islam will remain and rise higher.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkdlpd8rc	2024-09-28T23:26:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/H1yo6y800/H1yo6y800_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Small scale' movements into Lebanon may have started, US officia...	Netanyahu promised to continue attacking into Lebanon and Gallant met with IDF chief of staff to discuss 'expansion of military action' in north; ABC News reports Sunday morning that small-scale cross-border operations may have begun, or will soon begin, in order to destroy Hezbollah positions; 'Not enough to behead organization to return residents of north to their homes Small-scale operations or cross-border movements have begun, or will soon begin, into Lebanon in order to disable Hezbollah positions located right on the border with Israel, ABC News reported on Sunday morning, citing two American sources. The report comes hours after other reports in U.S. media, including by CNN, which reported that Israel is preparing for a ground maneuver in Lebanon. The sources who spoke with ABC emphasized that Israel does not appear to have finally decided whether to launch a ground operation against Hezbollah, but, according to them, it is ready for it. The officials also emphasized, as recently clarified by IDF officials, that if a ground operation happens its scope will be limited. The key is fulfilling the promise to Israelis that the tens of thousands displaced from northern Israel will be able to go home. To do that, decapitating Hezbollah is not enough, the officials said, referring to the assassination of the leader of the Shiite terrorist organization Hassan Nasrallah on Friday night. The reports come as Israeli officials signal that the elimination of Hezbollah will indeed not be enough to complete the goal of returning the residents of the north to their homes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clarified in a televised statement on Saturday night that Israel will 'continue to strike at its enemies,' and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced that he was holding an operational situation assessment, 'with an emphasis on the readiness of the IDF forces to expand offensive activity in the northern sector,' with IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, who himself said after the elimination of Nasrallah that the IDF had not completed using its 'toolbox.' The US officials who spoke with ABC also referred to reports of tensions between Israel and the Biden administration following the assassination of Nasrallah, which Washington publicly insists it was not informed about in advance, although according to officials it did receive an advance update of 'few minutes notice at best.' In response to reports that U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin 'blew up' when Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed him about Nasrallah, the officials said, 'We do bear a lot of risks' in the region, and their people were not given a lot of notice to prepare for possible hostile responses to the assassination, which did not please U.S. officials. In addition, according to one source, U.S. 'interests in the region could be badly harmed' if U.S. officials lose their contacts with the Israelis. According to the sources, the U.S. approach has not changed; it believes that only a diplomatic settlement is a long-term solution to the crisis. They also noted that a military campaign might lay the groundwork for such a solution. President Joe Biden himself was asked Saturday night by reporters whether Israel's ground entry into Lebanon is inevitable, and he answered evasively: ''It's time for a cease-fire.' When asked whether Washington would respond to missile attacks on American warships in the Red Sea, he said: 'We are responding.' Meanwhile, the extensive bombings against Hezbollah targets continue, as part of the Northern Arrows operation. Israeli Air Force fighter jets, under the direction of the Northern Command, attacked terrorist targets in the territory of Lebanon overnight, the IDF spokesman announced on Sunday morning. The targets attacked included rocket launchers aimed at Israel, buildings where weapons were stored and military structures belonging to the terrorist organization. The IDF spokesman also noted that over the past day, the army attacked hundreds of Hezbollah terrorist targets throughout Lebanon. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h100lru8a0	2024-09-28T21:56:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJd11iZ40R/SJd11iZ40R_11_0_1270_715_0_small.jpg

Following the impact, fires broke out in the Michmash area of ​​Binyamin, and firefighting teams from the Binyamin regional station were dispatched to the area. Fire and rescue spokespersons reported that the fire threatens the settlement, and that after scanning the area it is clear that the rocket did not land on a building, contrary to reports circulating through various channels. Teams from Magen David Adom arrived at the scene after receiving several calls for help. In addition, the Binyamin Regional Council reported that due to the fire there are power outages in several localities. A short time later, the electric company updated that it had restored the electricity supply to the localities of Ma'aleh Michmash and Mitzpe Hagit. About an hour later, alarms were set off warning of the intrusion of hostile aircraft in several communities in the Western Galilee, including Nahariya, Gesher HaZiv, Betzet, Rosh Hanikara, Liman, Matzuva, Hof Betzet, North Military Industrial Zone, Ben Ami, Shlomi, Sa'ar, Evron and Shavei Zion. Several explosions were heard in the area after two drones were intercepted, according to the IDF spokesman. The Home Front Command later declared the incident to be over. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjzgeeura	2024-09-28T14:44:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/ByTxukLAR/ByTxukLAR_115_65_647_365_0_small.jpg
Israel preparing limited ground incursion into Lebanon, senior US...	Israel has rejected a cease-fire proposal - even a limited one - in Lebanon, even though it has already eliminated many of Hezbollah's top officials, official tells ABC News Israel is preparing for a limited ground incursion in Lebanon, a senior US official claimed in a report published on ABC News. The source claimed that Israel is preparing for the ground operation even though it has already killed more than 30 senior Hezbollah officials, most significantly the organization's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. According to the unnamed source, Israel has rejected a proposal for a cease-fire, even a limited one, and is continuing its attacks against targets which are believed to contain long-range missiles and weapons. At the same time Israel is not listening to the Biden administration despite its repeated calls for a diplomatic solution, according to the report. The U.S. and Western countries still hope, despite the assassination of Nasrallah, to find a way toward a cease-fire in the north. At this stage it is not clear what will happen to the U.S. initiative and whether it even still exists. The chances of a cease-fire at this stage are not high, but if there is someone able to make decisions in Lebanon who will agree to the terms of withdrawal to the north of the Litani River and a disengagement from Gaza then it is possible. As for who this responsible party is, the answer is not clear. The preferred option from Israel's point of view is for the Lebanese government to fill the vacuum, but the problem is that within the government there are quite a few ministers who are under Hezbollah's authority. It must be assumed that whoever succeeds Nasrallah will not make such a move without the blessing of the patrons from Tehran, so everything ultimately goes back to Iran. Regarding the joint cease-fire initiative of the U.S. and France, sources in Israel familiar with the matter say that from the beginning of the discussions the contacts were with the Lebanese government and not with Hezbollah and the initiative did not have much chance of materializing even before the elimination of Nasrallah. It is difficult to know what the chances of such a cease-fire initiative are now. It is unclear who the Lebanese government can talk to on the ground itself. It may take some time before Hezbollah appoints a successor to Nasrallah, so it is not clear how feasible this move is. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wzokicc	2024-09-28T14:06:15-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/BkzTBir00/BkzTBir00_0_83_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Nasrallah elimination will return residents to north and bring ho...	Settled accounts with those responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans,' Netanyahu says in address to the nation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday night that the elimination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was necessary to achieve Israel's war goals. In a statement from the Kirya defense headquarters in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, a few hours after returning from the United States and a little more than a day after the assassination of Nasrallah, Netanyahu said that: 'We settled accounts with those responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans and dozens of Frenchmen. 'Nasrallah was not a terrorist. He was the terrorist. He was the axis of the axis, the central engine of Iran's axis of evil. He and his men were the architects of the plan to destroy Israel. He was not only activated by Iran, many times he also activated the Iran.' Netanyahu said that 'at the beginning of the week I came to the conclusion that the powerful blows that the IDF landed on Hezbollah in the last few days would not be enough. Nasrallah's killing was a necessary step toward achieving the goals we have set, returning residents of the north safely to their homes and changing the balance of power in the region for years to come. Because as long as Nasrallah was alive, he would quickly restore the capabilities we took away from Hezbollah.' Netanyahu said that Nasrallah's elimination both promotes the return of the residents of northern Israel to their homes, 'but also advance the return of our hostages in the south.' 'The more (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar sees that Hezbollah is no longer coming to save him, the greater the chances for the return of our hostages,' he said. There is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach Netanyahu thanked the IDF, the Israeli Air Force, Military Intelligence, the Mossad and the Shin Bet for their 'great achievements, and not only yesterday.' 'We have great achievements, but the work is not yet complete. In the coming days we will face significant challenges, and we will face them together. Nasrallah spoke of us as 'spider webs'. But instead of 'spider webs,' he discovered steel tendons of a united people And we are determined to ensure its existence and its future, and not only Hezbollah has discovered this,' Netanyahu continued. 'All those who oppose the axis of evil, all those who groan under the violent tyranny of Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, in Syria, in Iran itself and in other places, all of them were filled with hope today,' Netanyahu stressed. 'I say to the citizens of those countries: Israel stands with you.' He addressed the leaders of Iran: 'I say to the Ayatollah regime - whoever strikes us, we will strike. There is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel will not reach, and today you already know how true this is. These are great days. We are at what appears to be a turning point in history. A year ago, on October 7, our enemies attacked us and thought that Israel was on the way to extinction. One year later, blow after blow, they realize how much their hopes have faded. We are determined to continue to strike our enemies, to return our residents to their homes and all our hostages. We don't forget them for a moment.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rksuz0bra	2024-09-28T12:39:04-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/02/B1e9ybs72A/B1e9ybs72A_145_98_1058_596_0_small.jpg

Sinwar runs scared after Nasrallah assassination, changes locatio...	Hamas has also changed leader Yahya Sinwar's security protocols in recent days, and has decided not to meet in Lebanon in the near future Yahya Sinwar and senior Hamas officials are running scared after the wave of assassinations in Lebanon. Al Arabiya reports Saturday that, after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Sinwar changed his location in Gaza. It was also reported that in recent days Hamas has changed security protocols for the organization's leader in the Gaza Strip. Sources told the channel, which is owned by Saudi Arabia and broadcasts from Dubai, that Hamas leaders want any future cease-fire to ensure that they will not be harmed. As an additional precaution, Hamas decided to stop the organization's meetings in Lebanon in the near future. In addition, Hamas is limiting communication within the organization to correspondence only to prevent the possibility of intercepting conversations or locating locations. Senior Islamic Jihad officials also decided to suspend meetings in Lebanon in the wake of the strike on Nasrallah and other Hezbollah leaders, according to the report. Earlier on Saturday, Hamas issued a statement following the assassination of Nasrallah. 'We mourn for His Honor Hassan Nasrallah and remember his life and the journey full of sacrifices for the liberation of Jerusalem and the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, and his honorable roles in supporting the Palestinian people, our brave resistance and our legitimate rights , and his insistence on continuing on the heroic front of supporting our people and our resistance in the Al-Aqsa flood. 'We are sure that this crime and all the crimes and assassinations of the occupation will not affect the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine except with determination, and continue with all the strength, courage and pride, in the way of martyrs, follow their path and in their footsteps, and continue the path of resistance and steadfastness until victory and defeating the occupation.' Nasrallah's maternal cousin, Hashem Safi al-Din, is believed to have survived the attack or was not in the bunker with Nasrallah when it happened. He was designated as Nasrallah's successor and reportedly has taken over, although perhaps secretly for the time being, until the official meetings of the Shura Council are held to appoint a successor. The appointment of Safi al-Din is a step with a double declarative meaning – both to show continuity and continuity in command and leadership, and also to entrust it to someone who is known for his extreme positions toward Israel and the struggle against it. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by4fo6bcr	2024-09-28T11:42:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/BJDQD1qp0/BJDQD1qp0_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Lebanon locked down to prevent Hezbollah , IDF says	Military says it aims to prevent arms being brought in to replenish Hezbollah's depleted arsenal after Israel attacked missile storage facilities The IDF has placed Lebanon under lockdown to prevent Hezbollah from rearming itself with Iranian weapons after its arsenal was depleted in Israeli strikes. Since the targeted killing of Hassan Nasrallah in the terror group's underground command bunker in the Dahieh quarter of Beirut on Friday, the Air Force has repeatedly attacked Lebanese heavy machinery sent to rebuild six military border crossings to Syria, damaged in previous strikes. The military also informed Lebanon officially, that it would not allow cargo planes arriving from Syria and Iran, to land at Beirut's international airport. Earlier on Saturday, an Iranian cargo plane was refused landing permission and had to return to Iran. The IDF breached communications at the control tower and warned against allowing the plane to land under threat of attack. According to reports, Israeli jets attacked an industrial area 500 meters from the airport. Reuters quoted a security source who said it was the closest strike yet to the airport. Middle East Airlines CEO Mohammad al-Hout said the airport was operating normally. 'The Beirut airport is not being targeted, there are no weapons there,' al-Hout told Reuters. Civilian travel and border crossings would not be impacted, the IDF said. Thousands of Lebanese civilians crossed into Syria in recent days, many of them hoping to escape the Israeli attacks. But if an Iranian ship attempts to doc in a Lebanese port, it may encounter Israeli action off the Lebanon coast. Some 600,000 Lebanese residents of the South have left their homes heading north and 400,000 residents of the Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the southern sector of Beirut have also escaped the bombings. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bke0011tbca	2024-09-28T11:19:05-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/HyA7uhBAR/HyA7uhBAR_1_0_1094_615_0_small.jpg

I will always support Israel’s right to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis,' Harris said.

'As part of his role, Yassin collaborated with all of Hezbollah's offensive units, was personally involved in the planning of terror attacks that were executed during the war against Israeli civilians and soldiers, and planned additional attacks to be carried out in the coming days.' The Air Force also carried out strikes in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley after targeting Hezbollah assets in South Lebanon, Beirut and the Lebanon Mountains to the north. In total, some 3,500 bombs were dropped on Lebanon in the past week. The IDF said it had more surprises for Hezbollah in store and aims to diminish the terror group's military capabilities. 'We are now focused on strangling Hezbollah and are fully prepared to face Iran and its proxies including in Syria,' the IDF said. Earlier, the Homefront Command announced restrictions on crowd sizes in central Israel, limiting them to no more than 1,000 people in any given location.

The United States fully supports Israel's right to defend itself against Iran-supported groups, president says, but aims to deescalate conflicts in Lebanon, Gaza through diplomatic means US President Joe Biden on Saturday referred for the first time to the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, since it was confirmed earlier in the day by the IDF and by the terrorist organization itself. In a statement, Biden said that the killing of Nasrallah 'and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror. His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese civilians.' Biden noted that 'the strike that killed Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre on October 7, 2023. Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a 'northern front' against Israel.' The U.S. president emphasized that 'The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups. Just yesterday, I directed my Secretary of Defense to further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war.' He called for a diplomatic solution to Israel's conflicts on both the northern and southern borders. 'Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means. In Gaza, we have been pursuing a deal backed by the UN Security Council for a cease-fire and the release of hostages. In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,' he concluded.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkdobnbar	2024-09-28T10:21:25-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/06/06/B1gwA7LyHC/B1gwA7LyHC_0_148_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

Army confirms 'sirens activated due to surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen, which was intercepted outside country’s borders' The IDF reported that a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the Arrow defense system outside Israeli territory on Saturday, triggering air raid sirens across central Israel. The army confirmed that 'the sirens were activated due to a surface-to-surface missile launched from Yemen, which was intercepted outside the country’s borders.' The Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance services said there were no immediate reports of casualties, aside from individuals who suffered shock or were injured while rushing to shelters. Hazem Al-Asad, a member of the Supreme Political Council of Yemen's Ansar Allah (the Houthis), posted a photo of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah on X shortly after the missile launch with a Hebrew caption, reading 'They will not pass, and revenge will come.' Nasrallah was assassinated by Israel in a targeted attack on Hezbollah's central command bunker in Beirut's Daheih district. This incident follows another missile launch from Yemen on Thursday night, which also set off sirens in central Israel. Earlier this month, a Houthi missile targeting central Israel was 'partially intercepted,' with fragments of its warhead exploding near Ben Gurion Airport. Israel did not respond to that attack, leading to concerns about eroding deterrence. This contrasted with Israel’s previous response when the Air Force struck the port of Hodeidah in Yemen after a deadly drone attack on Tel Aviv in July that killed one person and injured ten others. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who returned from the UN General Assembly in New York, is expected to hold security consultations and assessments later Saturday, his office announced. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy36p9rrr	2024-09-28T08:40:22-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/SkiJh9r0R/SkiJh9r0R_33_601_532_300_0_small.jpg
IDF changes guidelines following Nasrallah assassination	In first statement since Nasrallah's death, the IDF spokesperson informs that gatherings will be limited to 1,000 people in central Israel but school will be held as usual: 'It's not over yet' A day after he made the dramatic announcement about the IDF's strike on Hezbollah's central headquarters and hours after the confirmation of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah's assassination, IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari informed that the Home Front Command will change its guidelines.

Nasrallah's likely successor has close ties to Iran	Hashim Safi Al Din is slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's cousin who oversees the group's education system and finances including its investment arm financing terrorism; He is on U.S. terror list since 2017 Hashim Safi Al Din, head of Hezbollah's Executive Council could replace the group's slain long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. He was reported to have survived the Israeli attack on the terror group's underground bunker on Friday. Al Din is Nasrallah's cousin and has been designated, next in line since the 1990s when he was called back to Beirut from his studies in Iran, to head Hezbollah's Executive Council just two years after Nasrallah took over leadership of the Group. According to a report in the Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper he is also related by marriage to Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Quds force, killed by the U.S. in 2020. Over the past three decades, he oversaw all daily and sensitive aspects of Hezbollah's civilian operations including its education system and finances including foreign investments, leaving strategic matters to Nasrallah. He heads an investment group operating in Lebanon, across the Arab world, in Africa, Europe and North and Latin America. Al Din has close ties to the military wing of Hezbollah as well and has been on the U.S. terror list since 2017. He maintains good relations with Tehran and supports its regime after his religious studies there. His brother Abdullah is Hezbollah's envoy to Tehran, which the Saudi newspaper says could increase his chances of being named the next leader of the group. He was born in 1964 in a village near the coastal city of Tyre in South Lebanon, to a well-established family of clerics. Since the outbreak of the war, Al Din represented Nasrallah in public events including at the funeral of high-ranking members of terror-group, who were killed in the coordinated detonation of communication devices, attributed to Israel. 'The wounded will return to their Jihad,' he said. 'We tell the enemy that if its aim is to stop support of Gaza, it must know that that will only grow.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1y0kirrr	2024-09-28T02:56:09-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2017/05/20/7792688/7792688_0_1_750_422_0_small.jpg

Army plans to escalate strikes as large secondary explosions reported in Lebanese capital; Israel warns Iran it will block any weapon transfers, including hostile flights to Beirut The IDF struck Hezbollah weapon depots stored beneath civilian buildings in Beirut’s Laylaki neighborhood, the IDF said in a statement early Saturday. The attack followed a televised announcement by IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, who said that Israel would soon target strategic capabilities, including an Iran-funded anti-ship missile array hidden in the heart of Beirut’s Dahieh district. Hagari noted that during the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired such missiles, one of which hit the Israeli naval vessel INS Hanit, killing four sailors. 'Nasrallah himself has threatened strategic and critical facilities in Israel at sea and near the shore,' Hagari said, adding that these missiles pose a serious threat to global shipping routes and Israel’s strategic infrastructure. He warned that the explosion from the strikes could cause the targeted buildings to collapse. After the IDF struck the suspected sites, large secondary explosions were reported across Beirut, indicating the destruction of weaponry. Earlier, a source close to Hezbollah told Reuters that contact with the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, had been lost. The IDF believes Nasrallah was at least injured and likely killed in the strike on Hezbollah’s central command in Dahieh. The operation, launched at 6:20 p.m., was described by the IDF as 'highly significant, with potential implications for the Middle East.' However, the military is still assessing the results and has not confirmed if other senior Hezbollah commanders were present. The IDF plans to continue targeting Hezbollah’s capabilities following the strike in Laylaki neighborhood, aimed at crippling the group's resources. 'Challenging days lie ahead,' Hagari said, adding that the military will intensify its attacks in a coordinated effort. In addition to Iranian-supplied coastal defense missiles, the IDF plans to strike other strategic assets in Beirut that Hezbollah could use for retaliation. In recent days, the IDF has exposed Hezbollah’s hidden weapon caches in southern Lebanon, and the current strikes aim to reveal how Hezbollah stores strategic weapons and arms in Beirut’s Dahieh, using buildings as shields. 'We will not allow any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah in any way,' Hagari emphasized. 'We know about these transfers and are thwarting them. IAF aircraft are patrolling the Beirut area, and we are making it clear that hostile flights with weapons will not be allowed to land at Beirut airport. It is a civilian airport and must remain as such.' Hagari also said that the IDF has conducted a readiness assessment under the chief of staff's direction, saying, 'The IDF is prepared on all fronts, and we are still evaluating the results of the attack on the command center located in the heart of the Dahieh district. The strike was very precise. We are conducting a situation assessment, and there are no changes in [Home Font Command] guidelines. We will update immediately if anything changes.' Earlier, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee urged the immediate evacuation of three buildings in central Dahieh: the Munir Shadid building and adjacent structures in the Laylaki neighborhood, the Shiyit building and nearby structures in the Al Hadath neighborhood and the Al Salam complex in the area. 'If you are near Hezbollah properties, for your safety, you must evacuate the buildings immediately and move 500 meters away,' Adraee said. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1uxsovaa	2024-09-27T15:11:20-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/28/SkeAtwjVCC/SkeAtwjVCC_0_352_961_541_0_small.jpg

Looking east: The importance of Jordan to Israel’s security	Across Israel’s longest border, danger is mounting constantly; while King Abdullah’s reign is stable and a quiet border is in both sides’ interest — can the Hashemite regime deliver the goods? Jordan is a ticking bomb. Israelis love quiet, and we all find it comfortable not to probe too deeply into what’s happening in the kingdom that safeguards our eastern border — Israel’s longest border with any next-door neighbor. Beyond that kingdom, an ocean of threats, hostility and chaos extends. We find it comfortable to believe that the king, despite occasional unfriendly statements, will be sure to do whatever needs doing in order to maintain quiet. But the king’s throne, which in any case hasn’t always excelled in stability, is wobbling. And that wobble is growing stronger by the day. The instability threatens to undermine security not only in Jordan but throughout the Middle East. The troubles of the Hashemite kingdom are also the troubles of Israel, and the Israeli public only partly realizes what’s eating away at the foundations of the monarchy. The first reason for the Hashemite regime’s fragility derives from the kingdom’s large refugee population. In 1948, there were 400,000 people in Jordan and today there are 11.5 million, including many refugees. That growth has come mainly from enormous waves of immigration. Immigration from where? After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, many refugees arrived in Jordan from the east. Tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees are estimated to still reside in Jordan, but today their numbers are small in comparison with the Syrian and Palestinian refugees. A huge number of refugees fled into Jordan from the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. According to figures from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, some 670,000 Syrian refugees are registered in Jordan; but according to unofficial estimates, those refugees could even number a million or so. Besides accommodating 'new' refugees, Jordan has housed Palestinian refugees since 1948. How many? The Hashemite regime has an interest in concealing the actual number, so it isn’t clear. But out of 11.5 million Jordanian citizens in all, the Palestinian population is estimated to total at least 3.5 million. And along with all those refugees, Jordan also hosts refugees and immigrant workers from countries such as Yemen, Sudan and Egypt. Given shelter in times of trouble, asylum seekers might be expected to show gratitude. But not necessarily. The flood of foreigners in Jordan is under incitement from various ideological and political sources aiming to topple the Hashemite dynasty and take over the kingdom. Given shelter in times of trouble, asylum seekers might be expected to show gratitude. But not necessarily. The flood of foreigners in Jordan is under incitement from various ideological and political sources, each with its own motivation to topple the Hashemite dynasty and take over the kingdom. The Muslim Brotherhood’s ideology, for example, has won great sympathy among Jordan’s large Palestinian sector. It’s the same ideology that’s shared by Hamas and that inspired the assassination of President Sadat in Egypt. Moreover, Iran is of course also troubling the waters and creating great pressure by way of Iraq and Syria at the borders of the kingdom. So Jordan has changed from a country adjoining territories such as an American-dominated Iraq to a country adjoining Iranian proxy organizations — all this at a time when the King’s loyal Bedouin minority is waging tough domestic battles that ruinously weaken it. The volume of weapons smuggled from Iran into the West Bank area, and even into Israel proper, results directly from the Jordanian army’s inaction. Israel can already distinctly feel the effects of the Jordanian government’s weakness. The volume of weapons smuggled from Iran into the West Bank area, and even into Israel proper, is a direct consequence of the Jordanian army’s weakness. And the Iranian–Palestinian effort to mount terror attacks against Israel, such as the one at the Allenby Bridge Crossing, is no less a consequence. Sensing weakness, the Iranian octopus is focusing considerable effort on turning Jordan into one more proxy of the Ayatollahs, like Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. If Iran succeeds in its plan for Jordan, there’s no need to explain what a serious challenge Israel will face. The question now is how to confront that security challenge in its present form, because it threatens to turn into a serious headache before long. The first thing to do is to beef up the relatively scanty Israeli forces in the Jordan Valley and the Arava. In addition, a network of meaningful obstacles should be set up, centered around a barrier like the one at the Egyptian border. The sphere of economics is also critical to our eastern neighbor’s stability. So Israel should continue following through on programs that are now partially in effect, such as the economic corridor that crosses Jordan eastward to India, the Sea-to-Sea Project and increased industrial and agricultural cooperation. Remember that Jordan relies heavily on Israel for energy. And the supply of water to the East Bank rests on agreements between Amman and Jerusalem. Granted, anti-Israeli statements are heard more than rarely from east of the river. The relationship has known ups and downs and it isn’t all rosy today. But diplomatic and geopolitical strategy requires cool consideration in view of the alternatives, rather than emotionally colored thinking. It’s important to bear in mind that not everything depends only on us. Jordan is an independent country, with complicated internal dynamics that Israel can influence only so far. But Israel has helped the Hashemites more than once to stay on the throne. The best-remembered example was during Black September, when King Hussein was facing substantial danger and Israel threatened to step in against any Syrian invasion of Jordan. Granted, anti-Israeli statements are heard more than rarely from east of the river. The relationship has known ups and downs and it isn’t all rosy today. But diplomatic and geopolitical strategy requires cool consideration in view of the alternatives, rather than emotionally colored thinking. Brig. Gen. (Res.)

Nasrallah was present at command center,' Israeli officials say	Israel and the world await updates on Hezbollah leader's fate following Beirut strike; 'No one there could have survived,' Israeli official says; Nasrallah was reportedly on brief visit to Beirut 'Enough is enough,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, without hinting at the imminent military action. Behind the scenes, however, plans for the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Dahieh district had been approved before the Israeli leader departed for the UN. An operational window presented itself, and the final green light was given. According to a U.S. official who spoke with ABC, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and some of his associates were in Beirut for a brief visit when the strike occurred. The official did not confirm whether Nasrallah was at the targeted site, but this may have been the operational opportunity identified by Israeli intelligence. Israeli officials believe Nasrallah was present at the command center, with one saying, 'Anyone there could not have survived.' Netanyahu, who authorized the strike while in the U.S., abruptly left a press briefing following his speech at the UN General Assembly after being approached by his military secretary. The Prime Minister’s Office later announced that Netanyahu would cut his trip short and return to Israel, departing the U.S. at 3 a.m. Israel time. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement that Hezbollah’s central command was located beneath residential buildings in Dahieh. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Manar reported that at least six buildings were destroyed in the attack. Local reports indicated that around 10 explosions were heard in the Lebanese capital. Footage from the scene showed extensive damage, with the Lebanese news agency reporting that the attacks created a 'belt of fire' from Burj Barajneh to Haret Hreik. Security sources in Lebanon told Reuters the attack, the most extensive Israeli assault on the southern Beirut Hezbollah stronghold since the war began, targeted an area where top Hezbollah officials are usually based. Iran's embassy in Lebanon said on X that the strike represents a dangerous game-changing escalation that will 'bring its perpetrator an appropriate punishment.' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar were in the Air Force command center in Tel Aviv during the attack. Israel updated the United States about its upcoming operation, but a Pentagon spokesperson denied Washington knew of the strike in Beirut in advance. The spokesperson also said that U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart as the operation was ongoing. Netanyahu, addressing the United Nations earlier Friday, said Israel must defeat Hezbollah and prevent the group from posing a threat along its northern border. 'Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that has murdered American, French and other civilians. We will not allow them to sit on our border and plan another October 7,' Netanyahu said. 'Israel has no choice—and every right—to eliminate this threat, and that is exactly what we are doing.' 'We have eliminated commanders responsible for the murders of Israelis, Americans, and French citizens, and then we took out their replacements, and their replacements’ replacements,' Netanyahu added. 'We will continue our strikes until we achieve all our objectives.' Friday's attack came on the heels of a spree of assassinations of high-profile Hezbollah commanders and figures. On Thursday, the IDF killed Hezbollah’s air unit commander Mohammed Srur in Beirut, using three missiles near the site where Ibrahim Aqil, Hezbollah’s head of operations, and other senior Radwan Force commanders were killed last weekend. On Tuesday, the IDF targeted Ibrahim Qubaisi, Hezbollah’s head of missile operations, in a strike on Dahieh. According to the army, several key commanders in Hezbollah’s missile and rocket divisions were with Qubaisi at the time of the strike. Earlier this week, the IDF attempted to eliminate Ali Karaki, Hezbollah’s southern front commander and the organization’s third-highest-ranking official. However, Hezbollah announced that Karaki survived and had been moved to a secure location. In July, Fuad Shukr, described as Hezbollah’s 'most senior military commander and head of the group’s strategic operations,' was killed in Dahieh. According to the IDF, Shukr was a close aide and strategic adviser to Nasrallah. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkeh1ynra	2024-09-27T12:39:34-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJmyNdVAC/SJmyNdVAC_0_0_853_488_0_small.jpg

Lebanon’s health minister says buildings hit in Israeli airstrike on Beirut housed civilians and condemned IDF flights near airport, calling them 'serious threat'; at least 2 killed and 76 injured Israel has 'crossed all lines' with its attack on Hezbollah's command center in Beirut’s Dahieh district Friday, a Hezbollah parliamentary source told Qatari newspaper The New Arab but vowed it would not destabilize the organization. The powerful strike, which reportedly targeted Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, killed at least two people and injured 76 others, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Search efforts for survivors continued in the area amid widespread anger in Lebanon. Lebanese Health Minister Firas Al-Abyad said that some of the targeted buildings were occupied by residents, and Lebanese media reported that the strike was carried out by F-35 fighter jets while civilian aircraft were landing and taking off at the nearby Rafic Hariri International Airport, posing a serious risk to passengers. Khalil Nasrallah, a commentator close to Hezbollah, suggested on social media that the 'rules of the game have changed.' The airstrike, aimed at Hezbollah’s central command, has raised questions in Israel about whether Nasrallah was present at the time and his fate. Iran’s Tasnim News Agency and Sky News Arabia reported that Hezbollah sources claim Nasrallah is alive and in a secure location. However, an Iranian official told Reuters that 'Tehran is assessing his condition.' A U.S. official told ABC News that Nasrallah and his deputies were in Beirut for a 'brief visit' during the attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who authorized the strike while in the U.S., abruptly left a press briefing following his speech at the UN General Assembly after being approached by his military secretary.

32 years at the helm: Who is Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah?	Nasrallah, 64, has led Hezbollah since the assassination of his predecessor in 1992; after Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon, he was perceived as a Arab hero; the arch-terrorist targeted by Israel in Beirut Israel attempted to assassinate Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on the Dahieh district of Beirut on Friday, but his fate remains unknown. Nasrallah, 64, has served as Hezbollah's secretary-general since 1992, following the assassination of his predecessor, Abbas Musawi. Known for his fiery rhetoric, charismatic presence and eloquent speeches, Nasrallah has become one of Lebanon’s most prominent figures and a significant leader within the broader radical Islamist movement. Born in a refugee camp in eastern Beirut, Nasrallah was the eldest of nine children in a poor Shiite family originally from a village in southern Lebanon. From a young age, he was deeply interested in Islam and dedicated much of his time to religious studies. During the Lebanese Civil War, he and his family returned to their village, where he joined the Shiite Amal movement. Nasrallah’s talents and dedication were soon noticed, and he was taken under the wing of a prominent local cleric. At 16, he was sent to study at a prestigious seminary in Najaf, Iraq, under the guidance of Abbas Musawi, a fellow Lebanese who would later become Hezbollah’s leader. The two developed a close friendship. In 1978, as the Iraqi regime began cracking down on Shiite clerics, Nasrallah and Musawi fled Iraq along with hundreds of other Lebanese seminarians. Upon returning to Lebanon, Nasrallah continued his studies and taught at a religious seminary established by Musawi in Baalbek. His charisma and militant messages quickly elevated his status as a religious leader, attracting a devoted following. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Nasrallah, following Musawi’s lead, left the Amal movement and joined forces with the newly formed Hezbollah, which was supported by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Nasrallah's leadership abilities quickly became evident, and he was appointed commander of Hezbollah’s forces in the Bekaa Valley. Under the guidance of the Revolutionary Guards, the Lebanese Shiites worked to develop a new framework known as Hezbollah. Nasrallah was a founding member and part of the organization's leadership from its inception. Over the years, Nasrallah consolidated his position as both a military and religious leader within Hezbollah, leading several successful operations against Amal fighters in the late 1980s. He later traveled to Iran to continue his studies in the holy city of Qom. When the conflict between Hezbollah and Amal resumed in 1989, Nasrallah returned to Lebanon, where he participated in the fighting and sustained minor injuries. By the following year, he had become one of Hezbollah’s top military commanders and a member of the group's highest decision-making body, the Shura Council. During that time, the organization’s leadership was divided between different factions loyal to Syria and Iran. In 1991, amid negotiations between the two countries, Musawi, who was seen as an ally of Damascus, was appointed secretary-general of Hezbollah, with Iran-backed Nasrallah’s influence within the organization further solidified. The campaign to eject Israel from Lebanon In 1992, Musawi was assassinated by Israel and Nasrallah took over the helm. Under his leadership, Hezbollah launched a wave of retaliatory attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets worldwide, including bombings at the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which left dozens dead. Nasrallah’s leadership faced a significant challenge in 1997 when former Hezbollah leader Sheikh Subhi Tufayli led a 'revolution of the hungry' in protest of what he saw as the group’s abandonment of its social commitments to Lebanon’s Shiite community in favor of becoming a mainstream political organization. However, with support from Iran and Syria, Nasrallah successfully quashed the uprising, disarming Tufayli’s supporters in the Baalbek region. From 1985, following Israel’s withdrawal from most of Lebanon, Hezbollah waged a persistent guerrilla war against Israeli forces and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the security zone. Under Nasrallah’s guidance and with backing from Iran, Hezbollah’s military capabilities grew significantly. However, the IDF's superior firepower resulted in high casualties for Hezbollah fighters, and many of their operations ended in failure. Israeli attempts to end the prolonged conflict, such as Operations Grapes of Wrath and Accountability, were met with Hezbollah rocket and mortar fire on northern Israel, international condemnation and the group’s entrenchment within the civilian population. Under Nasrallah’s leadership, Hezbollah shifted its strategy to include targeting Israeli public opinion, recognizing that the Israeli public’s sensitivity to casualties was a potential vulnerability. This approach turned the media into a key battleground for Hezbollah, contributing to a protracted conflict that inflicted ongoing casualties on both sides, including Hezbollah fighters, IDF soldiers and SLA forces. By the late 1990s, the continuous casualties and lack of a decisive outcome led to growing public opposition in Israel to the military presence in Lebanon. This pressure culminated in the Israeli government’s decision to withdraw from the security zone. In May 2000, the IDF executed a unilateral withdrawal to the international border, ending its 18-year presence in southern Lebanon. An Arab hero post-Israeli withdrawal The Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon elevated Nasrallah to a hero’s status across the Arab world. Shortly after, he was promoted to the religious rank of Hojjat al-Islam. During celebrations marking the withdrawal, Nasrallah delivered a speech declaring, 'Israel has nuclear weapons and the strongest air force in the region, but in reality, it is weaker than a spider’s web.' His so-called 'Spider Web' theory suggested that Israeli society’s sensitivity to casualties and perceived decadence made it vulnerable to a prolonged struggle and heavy losses. Domestically, Nasrallah focused on solidifying Hezbollah’s influence within the Shiite community, particularly against its main rival, the Amal movement. A significant portion of the group’s budget was allocated to establishing welfare, education, charity and healthcare institutions, providing free services to the community. Despite Israel’s withdrawal, Nasrallah refrained from ending hostilities, frequently attacking and mocking Israel and its leaders in his speeches. While the intensity of the conflict decreased, it was marked by sporadic skirmishes and preparations for future confrontation. In early July 2006, a Hezbollah squad attacked an Israeli military patrol along the Israel-Lebanon border, capturing two Israeli soldiers and killing three others. In response, the Israeli government launched a large-scale military operation against Hezbollah, later known as the Second Lebanon War. During the war, Nasrallah went into hiding, fearing an Israeli assassination attempt. However, he continued to deliver messages to the Lebanese public and engage in psychological warfare with Israel through speeches broadcast on Hezbollah’s television station. The last speech Since then and until October 2023, Hezbollah, with significant Iranian support, has armed itself extensively but largely avoided direct clashes with Israel. Over the past month, Israel has killed several senior Hezbollah commanders close to Nasrallah. Foreign reports have also attributed to Israel a large-scale sabotage operation of communication devices used by the group’s operatives, resulting in dozens of deaths and thousands of injuries. Last week, in a televised speech, Nasrallah vowed that Israel would face a 'harsh and just punishment' for its recent actions, warning, 'We are currently in the most sensitive phase of the campaign.' However, he did not specify what Hezbollah’s retaliation would look like, saying that the details are kept within a 'small circle' of the group’s leadership. 'I won’t speak of the time, form or place. The response will come,' Nasrallah declared, adding, 'The aggression is unprecedented and will face a harsh reckoning and just retribution—whether from an expected or unexpected place.' He accused Israel of intending to kill 5,000 people—presumably referring to Hezbollah members—in the communication device blasts, claiming, 'The enemy has crossed all red lines with this action.' Nasrallah also hinted that Israel’s actions could be considered a declaration of war, though he stopped short of making such a declaration himself. Nasrallah is married to Fatima Yassin. His eldest son, Hadi Nasrallah, was killed by Israeli forces in September 1997. His body was transferred to Israel and later returned to Lebanon as part of a prisoner exchange deal for the remains of an Israeli Navy commando killed in a separate incident the same year. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj5rfdva0	2024-09-27T10:55:11-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/19/HklEg112KaA/HklEg112KaA_0_0_3000_1672_0_small.jpg

Army says terror group's HQ located beneath residential buildings in Lebanese capital's Dahieh district; no changes to Home Front Command safety guidelines The IDF said it carried out an airstrike on Friday evening targeting Hezbollah’s central command, located beneath residential buildings in the Dahieh district in southern Beirut. Some media reports suggested that the Lebanese terrorist group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was the intended target. 'On October 8, Hezbollah, led by Nasrallah, initiated a war and has since escalated the situation,' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement. 'Israel warned them, but they continued their aggression against our citizens and sovereignty. The Air Force continues to strike terror targets to diminish their capabilities.' Hagari added there are no changes to the Home Front Command’s safety guidelines and any updates will be provided immediately through official channels. Security sources in Lebanon told Reuters the attack, the most extensive Israeli assault on the southern Beirut Hezbollah stronghold since the war began, targeted an area where top Hezbollah officials are usually based. Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Manar reported that six buildings were destroyed in the attack. Local reports indicated that around 10 explosions were heard in the Lebanese capital. The strikes hit Beirut shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue Israel's attacks on the Iranian-backed terrorist group in Lebanon in a closely watched United Nations speech, as hopes faded for a cease-fire that could head off an all-out regional war.

Israel aims to keep Lebanon ground operation as brief as possible...	Army completes call-up of 2 reserve brigades in preparation for a potential expansion of the conflict in Lebanon and a possible ground incursion The IDF announced on Friday that it has completed the mobilization of the 6th and 228th reserve brigades in preparation for a potential expansion of the conflict in Lebanon and a possible ground incursion. An Israeli official told AFP that the aim would be to keep any ground operation in Lebanon as brief as possible. 'We will try to make it as short as we can. We are preparing for this every day, and we definitely have the means,' the official said. The official also dismissed claims that Israeli airstrikes have resulted in high civilian casualties in Lebanon, asserting that many of those killed were Hezbollah members. 'They are not publishing the names of the dead. Many were from Hezbollah,' he said, accusing the militant group of using civilians as human shields. In addition to the two brigades, the IDF has also mobilized several additional reserve battalions to support efforts to secure the northern region and enable residents to return to their homes safely. Emergency depots have been opened, and logistical and combat equipment has been distributed to reservists. Photos from the north show dozens of tanks poised for possible deployment. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, visiting the northern border, said, 'The enemy wanted attrition, and they are getting crushed instead. There have been blow after blow to key operatives and the command chain, dramatic moves to eliminate their missile and rocket capabilities, and many more operations from air and sea.' During a briefing with 91st Division commander Brig. Gen. Shai Klapper and other senior officers, Gallant emphasized the need for readiness in the region. 'What you’ve seen in the past two weeks has changed Hezbollah significantly, and we need to capitalize on that. Continuity in battle and exploiting success are key. We are looking at how Hezbollah is behaving—it’s a problem of capability, fear, and control. The lack of commanders in their chain of command is significant, especially with the Radwan Force. The dramatic operation last Friday changed a lot.' Gallant added, 'We have been waiting for this opportunity for a long time, not just in the past year, but for many years. We have unfinished business with many elements here, and in the end, we want to live here properly, both in this region and in the more western fronts. So keep going, use the time, and surprises will come—both for the enemy and for our forces. We will give you as much warning as possible, but the dynamics are known.' Meanwhile, airstrikes in Lebanon continued. The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Manar reported that 14 villages across the country were hit afternoon within two hours. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjp11znncr	2024-09-27T06:33:41-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/27/SJeuboZ400/SJeuboZ400_0_0_1280_773_0_small.jpg

We have to make a deal with Iran,' Trump says	Republican presidential candidate says would attempt and negotiate a new deal with Tehran should he be elected without providing details U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday he was willing to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran if elected. 'I would do that,' Trump said without elaborating on the potential deal’s details. 'We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal.' Trump's statements, made in the context of his tight race against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, are notable given the hostility he previously demonstrated toward Tehran — both as president and during his campaign. Trump's campaign claimed this week that U.S. intelligence informed him that Iran was planning an assassination attempt on his life. According to Politico, Trump's comments were aimed at easing tensions with the Iranian regime. Trump said that he would have been ready to reach an agreement with Iran within a week after the elections were he reelected in 2020. ' I would’ve made a fair deal with Iran. I was gonna get along with Iran. The deal was simple: Iran can’t have a nuclear missile. It cannot have that nuclear capability,' he said. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who arrived for the annual UN General Assembly in New York alongside Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, said that Tehran was ready to resume nuclear talks. He noted that Iran is prepared to restart negotiations 'if the other parties are also ready,' to do so. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers collapsed after Trump decided to withdraw from the agreement and reinstate sanctions on Iran. Iran has since violated many of the agreement’s clauses. In his speech at the UN this week, Iran's president stressed that Tehran was willing to cooperate with major powers to save the agreement. Pezeshkian said in his address that the sanctions against the Islamic Republic are 'inhumane' and harm Iranian residents. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byixjmnac	2024-09-27T05:23:23-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/20/SyFswO9TA/SyFswO9TA_1_25_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
Once buildings in Beirut start collapsing, it'll be clear we're ...	As IDF operation against Hezbollah continues military is adamant to cut off Lebanon from smuggling routes used to deliver weapons to terror group from across the Middle East Amid Operation Northern Arrows against Hezbollah announced by IDF Chief of Staff LTG Herzi Halevi last week, military indications point out the Iran-back terror group is maximizing its efforts in receiving new munitions and military equipment from Tehran via smuggling routes in Syria, Iraq and Iran — which the IDF is now adamant in disrupting. More than 200 Hezbollah targets were attacked on Thursday out of approximately 3,000 since Israel’s large-scale operation began. Four border crossings in Lebanon were attacked by Israeli Air Force fighter jets as well, with plans to escalate strikes in the coming days to disrupt Hezbollah's smuggling routes. A mid-operation assessment by the IDF indicated that the operation’s initial strikes, which severely impacted dozens of Hezbollah commanders — including top officials who were eliminated — are the primary reason the Shiite terror army has struggled to implement its contingency plans. These included the daily firing of thousands of rockets, precision missiles and drones against Israel in general and Tel Aviv in particular in large-scale barrages. Hezbollah’s initial shock over the elimination of its key leaders, including its air unit commander, has hindered its ability to reassess and formulate additional actions. The IDF, however, said it has yet to fully unleash its force. 'It will be clear that we are applying our full strength once buildings in Beirut start collapsing or the IDF Northern Command forces initiate a ground operation. We're not there yet.' The IDF believes that the past week demonstrates Hezbollah has lost its operational balance, though it still retains significant capabilities for major attacks deep within Israel. As a result, prolonged strikes are necessary which will possibly last several more weeks. At this stage, the IDF isn’t attacking dual-use infrastructure in Lebanon, such as bridges that Hezbollah could also use, reserving these elements for an all-out war. One of Israel's primary objectives in this operation is to sever the connection between Lebanon and Gaza. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah committed — and followed through on his promise — to fire at Israel as long as fighting continues in the Gaza Strip. The Ground operation in Gaza has been dramatically reduced to a minimal force maintaining the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors in the past month, with only a few hundred soldiers involved and without the widespread ground raids that were initially planned for the war’s 'Phase C'. Meanwhile, the Israeli Air Force sees both fronts as joined. The pilots who attacked hundreds of additional targets in Lebanon on Thursday also participated in airstrikes against Hamas's recovering positions in Gaza, as part of support for divisions defending the Gaza border. According to IDF estimates, Hezbollah is still equipped with thousands of short-range rockets as well as thousands of drones and precision missiles. However, the elimination of senior figures in recent days has disrupted its ability to use them. The IDF is aware Hezbollah hasn’t yet deployed its heavy arsenal, much of which has been targeted: precision missiles, and not only surface-to-surface missiles but also advanced Russian-made Yakhont cruise missiles which the IDF believes the terror group still holds from its part in suppressing the Syrian civil war. The Yakhont missile can hit any target along Israel's coast within a range of about 300 km (186 miles), potentially crippling the Haifa and Ashdod ports and endangering Israel's gas rigs. However, the IDF believes Hezbollah would need to assemble the missile’s components from various hideouts In order to deploy it, a process the IDF has detected and disrupted. Another key target being gradually worn down is Hezbollah's Radwan Force, the terror group’s elite unit comprising thousands of highly trained soldiers organized into battalions. Israel has made significant efforts to distance the unit's operatives from southern Lebanon. The Radwan Force’s command chain has been hit or eliminated by the Israeli Air Force in recent days, which the IDF believes has disrupted Hezbollah's plans to invade the Galilee which took over two decades to develop and designed to mirror Hamas’s invasion on October 7. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1tla114rr	2024-09-27T04:37:13-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/26/SJXUZJm00/SJXUZJm00_0_159_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
