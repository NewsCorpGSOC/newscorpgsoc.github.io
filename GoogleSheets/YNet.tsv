U.S. proposal for northern cease-fire revealed, criticized for vi...	Following discussions between U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, and Lebanon's PM and parliament speaker, Hezbollah news service Al-Akhbar reveals the specifics of a fresh proposal aimed at resolving northern tensions; Plan involves extending international forces' jurisdiction north of Litani River, but Prime Minister Najib Mikati rejects Western oversight The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, aligned with Hezbollah, reported Tuesday morning that Amos Hochstein, the special Mideast envoy for President Joe Biden, introduced a new proposal during his visit to Beirut. The proposal aims for a political resolution on the northern front by amending UN Security Council Resolution 1701. According to the Al-Akhbar report, Hochstein seeks to revise the preamble to transform it into a resolution targeting peace along the Lebanon-Israel border and to prevent an armed presence in Lebanese areas near the border. Hochstein discussed these details in a meeting on Monday in Beirut with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berri. 'The U.S. wants to end the conflict entirely, and we must devise a formula to put a definitive end to it,' Hochstein said. 'We need to ensure all parties understand that Resolution 1701 must be implemented. We are committed to resolving the conflict based on this resolution.' The report pointed out that Hochstein's proposal includes extending the geographical scope of international decision-making authority north of the Litani River, increasing the number of international forces operating within the peacekeeping forces, and boosting the number of military forces intended to be deployed in this region. The proposal reportedly also suggests expanding the missions of the international forces (UNIFIL) to grant them the right to inspect any location, vehicle or house suspected of containing weapons, and to conduct surprise patrols in any area without needing approval from Lebanese authorities (except in cases of intrusion into private property). Hochstein’s proposal further includes broadening the operations of international forces along the Lebanese coasts, including monitoring Lebanese seaports and inspecting ships, deploying monitoring teams at active or closed civilian airports, and establishing watchtowers and checkpoints along the Lebanon-Syria border. The report noted that Berri told Hochstein that Resolution 1701 is clear and requires no amendment. The report also indicates that the U.S. envoy was effectively trying to entice Lebanon with his proposals. Sources from the newspaper reported that any new mechanism must provide similar measures on both sides of the border and ensure there are no 'Israeli violations on land, sea or air.' Furthermore, according to Hezbollah, any discussion will not address the organization's weapons outside the geographical scope of Resolution 1701. Additionally, Hezbollah rejects the deployment of international or foreign forces along the border with Syria, as it contradicts Lebanese sovereignty. Hezbollah also claims the UN Security Council cannot add a new country to the states operating in the international forces without obtaining full Lebanese consent. The organization further rejects American and British oversight of the international forces' operational mechanism.

These are the 5 men that will lead Hamas in place of Sinwar	Five instead of one: A senior council based in Qatar will lead the terrorist organization in place of Yahya Sinwar, killed last week in Gaza A senior council will replace Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli troops last week in Rafah, as head of the Gaza terror group Hamas, two Hamas officials told the French news agency, AFP. 'The Hamas leadership’s approach is not to appoint a successor to the late chief, the martyr Yahya Sinwar, until their next elections' scheduled for March 'if conditions permit,' a well-informed source from the Palestinian group told AFP. The council, which includes five members, was established after the assassination in August of the head of the Hamas Political Bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, following the difficulty in communicating with Sinwar in Gaza. The council, based in Doha, Qatar, includes the representative of Hamas in Gaza, Khalil al-Haya; the representative of Hamas in the West Bank, Zaher Jabarin; the Hamas representative of Palestinians abroad, Khaled Mashaal; as well as the head of the Shura Council of Hamas, Mohammed Darwish. The name of the fifth member, the secretary of the Political Bureau, was not published since he is never identified 'for security reasons.' Another source in Hamas said that the leadership of the terrorist organization discussed the question of appointing a new leader without announcing him by name - but this possibility was dropped. These are the members of the council that will replace Sinwar to lead Hamas: Khaled Mashaal Mashaal is considered one of the most powerful people in the political bureau of Hamas, but his views differed from those of Sinwar - also, including when it comes to the relationship with Iran. Mashaal is currently the leader of Hamas abroad. He headed the political bureau of Hamas for 21 years, from 1996 to 2017, when he decided to end his position, and was replaced by Haniyeh. In 2021, he was elected again as the leader of Hamas abroad in an attempt to return to the arena Palestinian politics. In 1997, he was saved from an assassination attempt on his life in a failed Mossad operation in Jordan. Mashaal was indicted last month in the U.S. for involvement in the October 7 massacre. He lives a luxurious life in Qatar, and in the past his fortune was estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion. In recent days there has been a round of interviews to mark the anniversary of the October 7 massacre. In one of the interviews Mashaal caused a stir when he claimed that Hamas' losses are 'tactical,' while Israel's losses are 'strategic,' especially in the international arena. He was criticized by residents of Gaza and also by the members of the Fatah leadership, who appeared to grow closer to Mashaal after the elimination of Haniyeh. Regarding that assassination, Mashaal said - probably by mistake - that 'Iran killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.' Khalil al-Haya Khalil al-Haya, Sinwar's deputy, left the Gaza Strip before October 7 - and since then he is considered one of the senior leaders conducting the negotiations for a cease-fire and a hostage deal on behalf of the terrorist organization. Al-Haya also has a good relationship with Iran - where he arrived after the elimination of Haniyeh to participate in his funeral. The New York Times reported that Al-Haya was part of the 'limited military council' that Sinwar convened for two years to plan the October 7 attack, and was also the special envoy for the secret talks that took place on the subject with Iran and Hezbollah. Six months ago Al-Haya signaled that Hamas would not agree to a deal until the end of the war. 'If we are not promised that the war will end, why would I agree to hand over the hostages?' he said. In the same interview with the AP news agency, al-Haya claimed that the IDF had not destroyed even 20% of Hamas' capabilities at the time. 'The solution is to reach agreements,' he said. When asked if he regrets the October 7 massacre, he replied that he does not - despite the destruction in the Gaza Strip. He asked rhetorically: 'Suppose they destroy Hamas. Will the Palestinian people disappear?' Zaher Jabarin Jabarin, 55, is considered the 'economic brain' of Hamas. He served as the holder of the prisoner file in Hamas and was the deputy leader of the terrorist organization in the West Bank until the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut. A comprehensive article in the Wall Street Journal after that assassination reported that in recent years Jabarin has become the de facto supervisor of an economic empire that the United States estimates is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, an empire that finances the terrorist activities of Hamas. Jabarin is the one who manages Hamas' financial ties with Iran on behalf of Hamas and, according to U.S. and Israeli sources, takes care of the transfer of funds from Tehran to the Gaza Strip. He is also responsible for a series of companies that transfer regular income to Hamas, and operates a network of private supporters and businessmen who transfer funds to the terrorist organization. Mohamed Ismail Darwish The relatively unknown among the members of the council is Mohamed Ismail Darwish, also known as Abu Omar Hassan, who heads the Shura Council of Hamas. A week after Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran, it was reported that he had been chosen to replace him as head of the Political Bureau - but then Hamas announced that Sinwar had been appointed as his successor.

IDF destroys central base of Hezbollah's Naval Unit	Overnight, under the direction of the IDF Intelligence Directorate and the Israeli Navy, the Israeli Air Force struck Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, command centers and additional terror targets in Beirut. Some of the targets were located underground and included aerial and naval equipment used by Hezbollah to carry out terror attacks against the State of Israel. Among the targets in Beirut was a central base of Hezbollah's Naval Unit, where Hezbollah stored military speed boats, a training center, and an area to conduct experiments. The Naval Unit's speed boats were intended to be used in attacks on Israeli Navy vessels and against naval and strategic targets within Israel's territorial waters, according to the IDF.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h11mhrvlyx	2024-10-22T01:13:20-07:00

7 East Jerusalem residents arrested for plotting assassinations	Arrests made after joint investigation by Shin Bet and the Jerusalem Metropolitan Police; They admitted that the main motive was nationalistic; Comes a day after a serious espionage case was announced, in which seven northern residents suspected of carrying out missions for the Islamic Republic were arrested Seven young men between the ages of 19 and 23, residents of Beit Hanina in East Jerusalem, were arrested on suspicion of planning to eliminate a nuclear scientist and the mayor of a city in the center of the country. This is a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem police. The arrests first announced on Tuesday morning follow a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Jerusalem police. The investigation revealed that an Iranian official contacted the main suspect, named Rami Aliyan, who recruited him and gave him tasks in exchange for money. The suspect managed to recruit six more people from his neighborhood to carry out the tasks, including setting fire to vehicles in Ein Kerem, spray painting graffiti and throwing a grenade at the house of a security forces member. In addition, they received instructions to purchase weapons and grenades. The main task that the Iranian handler asked them to carry out included gathering intelligence on the mayors a city in the center of the country and assassinating one of the country's top nuclear scientists. The young men prepared the required intelligence and even made contacts to purchase weapons, but were arrested before they could complete the moves. Each of those involved has incriminated himself, and they were arrested in September. An indictment is expected to be filed against them Wednesday, after a prosecutor's statement has been submitted. Aliyan acted under the instructions of Iran, which provided him with precise details regarding the target of the assassination, and the young men were supposed to carry out preparation in the field. Although they failed to purchase the required weapons, the Iranians transferred funds to them to carry out the operations. The investigation revealed that the young men received different payments for different tasks: • 500 shekels for photographing various places, including the Weizmann Institute. • 1,500 shekels for photographing a certain destination. • 2,000 shekels for burning a car. • $100 for spraying graffiti against the state, and 'return the hostages now.' • Between 13,000 and 15,000 shekels were allocated for the purchase of guns and rifles , but they did not have enough time to complete the transaction. During the investigation, some of the suspects admitted to being in contact with the Iranians and carrying out the operations, and said that the main motive was nationalistic. The arrests come a day after a serious espionage case was revealed, also involving Iran, in which seven Israelis who immigrated from Azerbaijan, including a father and son, are suspected of having maintained contact for two years with elements in the Islamic Republic - as part of which they photographed military bases, which were also the targets of the ballistic missile attack from Iran earlier this month. Some of the seven were caught when they were following an Israeli senior official and his son, whom they allegedly planned to assassinate. It is described as one of the most severe security breaches in Israel's history. The Rishon Letzion Magistrate's Court revealed on Monday that the seven, all residents of Haifa and northern Israel, will be indicted on Friday. Among the suspects are a soldier who deserted from duty and two minors. The suspects—Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nisan, Vyacheslav Guschin, Yevgeni Ioffe and the two minors—were arrested on September 19 on suspicion of espionage. The indictment will include charges of collaborating with enemies of the state, which carries a potential life sentence. The suspects allegedly worked under the direction of Iranian operatives in exchange for hundreds of thousands of shekels paid in cash and cryptocurrency.

There are 1.2 million displaced people in Lebanon and the fear of...	Lebanon is unable to cope with the masses of displaced people who left their homes because of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, and many of them are staying in tents; In a poor country unprepared for such a crisis, a full-blown sectarian conflict could rip the country apart The Lebanese government estimates that over 1.2 million people have been displaced due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The country, already struggling economically, was unprepared for the massive influx of refugees from various regions and for such an extended period of time. This inability to provide adequate living conditions to everyone has only heightened existing tensions on Lebanon's streets. On Monday, Lebanese security forces clashed with refugees on Al-Hamra Street in Beirut, who were asked to vacate the Hamra Star building. Protesters responded by blocking the road with burning tires, leading the Lebanese army to intervene to restore order. The dispute over the building has been brewing for some time. Property owners have been trying to relocate displaced families, who have settled there, to alternative shelter centers, but the families are resisting eviction. The building's owners claimed days ago they 'have been cooperating with displaced families who forcibly entered the building on September 27,' and said the families were treated well. Interactions between the displaced and the local communities hosting them across Lebanon are fraught with challenges. While some found refuge with friends or relatives in safer towns and villages during the war, many did not. Numerous refugees are now sleeping in tents on the streets of Beirut, as evidenced by recent videos and photos from the city. On October 9, reports emerged of clashes between those displaced and security forces in Beirut's Ain Al Mraiseh, a coastal neighborhood in the city's north, when authorities attempted to dismantle the tents of those displaced. Addressing the war and the displacement crisis, Prime Minister Najib Mikati told Al Arabiya network, 'I hope that sectarian conflict does not arise as a consequence of the displacement.'

Harvey Weinstein has chronic myeloid leukemia	Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), NBC News reported on Monday, citing sources. Weinstein is currently undergoing treatment for CML, a type of bone marrow cancer, while in prison at Rikers Island in New York to face trial on rape charges, according to the NBC report. Craig Rothfeld, Weinstein's legal health care representative, declined comment when asked by Reuters on the status of his health, citing respect for Weinstein's privacy. Weinstein, 72, has been beset with health problems, his lawyers had earlier said. He was rushed to the hospital from Rikers Island jail in September to undergo heart surgery. Weinstein, who has denied having any non-consensual sexual encounters with anyone, was found guilty on rape charges in February 2020 in a case that provided impetus for the #MeToo movement. The New York Court of Appeals threw out the conviction in April, finding Weinstein did not get a fair trial because a judge improperly allowed testimony by accusers he was not formally charged with assaulting. He is in prison awaiting a retrial. Weinstein suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure, spinal stenosis, fluid in his heart and lungs, his representatives have previously said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjdbjsvgyl	2024-10-21T21:34:26-07:00

Death penalty for spying? A look at how Israel deals with traitor...	The uncovering of a serious espionage case linked to Iran has sparked debates over the appropriate punishment for spies, with some lawmakers urging the consideration of capital punishment The expected indictment against the Israelis at the center of the serious espionage case for Iran that was revealed on Monday could be severe according to the police, mainly due to the long period during which the seven suspects allegedly operated on behalf of Tehran, reaching two years. The indictment is set to be filed on Friday, though charges against the suspects have already been determined. In the past, the most serious espionage charges were brought against Israeli atomic technician Mordechai Vanunu, who leaked information and photos from the nuclear reactor in Dimona. He was charged with severe espionage charges and even treason, convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Israel's Penal Code divides espionage charges into five different crimes, each with distinct characteristics, severity and penalties. The serious crimes of espionage and passing information to the enemy can lead to prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. For instance, former Israeli minister Gonen Segev was charged with espionage for Iran and convicted of espionage, but not treason, resulting in an 11-year prison sentence. Amir Makhoul, who spied for Hezbollah, was similarly sentenced to nine years in prison in 2011. Journalist Anat Kamm was convicted of espionage and unauthorized disclosure of classified information, receiving a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence. The significant differences in sentencing stem from the law's clear distinction between someone who spied and gathered security information and someone who did so without passing the information to the enemy. In Kamm's case, she provided the information to Haaretz journalist Uri Blau. The treason offense, which could be linked to this case as it was for Vanunu, comprises seven serious charges, with the most severe ones carrying the possibility of the death penalty. However, these offenses are not expected to be included in the current indictment. Meanwhile, lawmakers have started calling for harsh punitive measures against the suspects, including the death penalty. 'The phenomenon of traitors who harm Israel's security for monetary gain, while we're fighting for our future, requires the use of the harshest measures, including a death penalty law,' Culture and Sports Miki Zohar wrote on his X account (formerly Twitter). 'This is the only way we can create a clear deterrent to prevent similar cases.' Interior Minister Moshe Arbel instructed the advisory committee to consider revoking the citizenship of the Israelis suspected of espionage for Iran. 'The State of Israel, as a nation that values life, will act alongside stricter enforcement against breaches of trust, to expel and denounce those who act against it,' he said. 'This is how we should act, and God willing, this is how we will proceed.'

The last person I'd suspect,' shocked neighbors say after Irania...	Haifa residents in shock after 2 neighbors, including alleged spy ring leader, arrested; officials call for revoking citizenship and imposing financial sanctions on those involved Residents of Haifa expressed disbelief upon learning that seven Azerbaijani immigrants living among them have been accused of espionage, allegedly working for Iranian intelligence. Three of the suspects, who reportedly photographed Israeli military bases targeted in Iran's ballistic missile attack earlier this month, were reportedly caught in southern Israel trailing a senior Israeli official and his son, whom they allegedly planned to assassinate. One of the suspects, Vyacheslav (Slava) Gushchin, had lived on a quiet street in Carmel. 'He lived here alone for about two years. He drank a lot of beer, smoked and worked at car wash centers. He barely had money for food,' said a neighbor from the floor above. 'He told us his wife lived in Belarus. He said she came for a short visit and was deported, and he spent a lot on lawyers to bring her back. He barely had money to live on; it's inconceivable he was involved in espionage. He didn't always pay rent on time either. 'About a month ago, he was arrested for getting into a fight with a local business owner. We haven’t seen him since, and now this affair has become known. It's unbelievable our neighbor for the past two years was involved in espionage against the state.' The convenience store owner who clashed with him said, 'About a month ago, he came here drunk. I told him to go home because he was scaring the customers. There was a scuffle, and then the police arrested him. He was spying? God, he’s the last person I'd suspect to be a spy. I'm shocked.' Another suspect, Aziz Nisanov, believed to be the cell leader, lived on the third floor of a low-income housing apartment with his son Yigal Nisan, who is also in custody for his alleged involvement with the spy ring. 'About two weeks ago, the police came here, broke into the apartment, there was a big mess, they searched all the rooms. I didn’t understand what was happening, and since then I haven’t seen Aziz and his son,' a neighbor told Ynet. Israeli security agency Shin Bet revealed the severity of the case, highlighting how the suspects had carried out intelligence missions for over two years. The information they gathered allegedly posed a significant risk to national security, with the possibility of facilitating missile attacks on Israel. 'The key to confronting this is first and foremost severe punishment that will deter. People need to understand this is treason, a breach of national security, serving the enemy during wartime,' Shin Bet officials said, suggesting administrative and economic sanctions against Israeli citizens cooperating with Iran—including revoking citizenship, confiscating funds and property. Interior Minister Moshe Arbel directed his ministry’s advisory committee to examine the possibility of revoking the citizenship of the seven suspects. 'The State of Israel, as a nation that cherishes life, will intensify enforcement against acts of treason and will also expel and condemn those who act against it,' Arbel said. 'This is the proper course of action, and with God's help, we will follow through.' Security officials noted that public awareness of Iran's intelligence-gathering efforts has grown recently following a series of much-publicized arrests of suspects linked to Tehran. 'Publications on the subject help. People understand more, suspect and report,' they said. Authorities urged the public to follow safety guidelines, including avoiding suspicious links, not corresponding with unknown individuals and ignoring unfamiliar emails. The suspects, all residents of Haifa and northern Israel, include Aziz Nisanov, his son Yigal Nisan, Vyacheslav (Slava) Gushchin, Alexander Sidikov, Yevgeny Ioffe, and two minors whose names cannot be disclosed. Prosecutors are expected to file indictments against them in Haifa District Court on Friday, charging them with serious security offenses. The group is accused of photographing and collecting intelligence on sensitive military sites, including Air Force bases in Nevatim and Ramat David, the government bunker in Tel Aviv, Iron Dome installations, the Hadera power station and other critical infrastructure. They allegedly passed this information to Iranian handlers, who provided them with maps of strategic sites, including the Golani Brigade training base, where four soldiers were killed in a Hezbollah drone strike last week. According to Shin Bet, the suspects conducted espionage missions for over two years under the guidance of two Iranian agents, known as 'Alkhan' and 'Orkhan.' They were aware that the intelligence they provided could aid Iran in targeting Israel, potentially through missile attacks. The suspects were arrested during a photography mission in southern Israel, where three of them were apprehended in the act. Police Chief Superintendent Yaron Binyamin said that the suspects carried out approximately 600 missions over two years. These included gathering intelligence on sensitive sites, military bases and potential human targets, all in service of Iran’s objectives. The suspects’ contact with Iran was through a Turkish national, who acted as a mediator. 'He received the materials from the Iranians and delivered them to Israel. He was involved in espionage cases made public in recent months,' Binyamin said. Additional arrests related to this case have been made in Turkey and Azerbaijan. This intermediary is also linked to Moti Maman, a 72-year-old man from Ashkelon, who was charged last month with contacting a foreign agent. Maman had been recruited by Iran to assist in planning the assassination of senior Israeli officials, including the prime minister, defense minister and Shin Bet chief.

IDF reveals Hezbollah cash bunker beneath Beirut hospital, housin...	Following airstrikes targeting terror group's financial network, army unveils secret money bunker, located underneath Al-Sahel Hospital in heart of Lebanese capital; 'Funds stored here could have been used to rebuild Lebanon, but instead, they are used to rebuild Hezbollah' Following a night of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah's financial network, the IDF unveiled Monday evening a massive underground bunker located beneath a main Beirut hospital, which serves as a key financial facility for the terrorist group. In a press briefing, chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari presented a 3D illustration of the underground bunker, located beneath the Al-Sahel Hospital in Beirut, which serves as a central storage site for Hezbollah’s finances. The facility, reportedly used by the group's leader Hassan Nasrallah who had been assassinated in an Israeli airstrike in late September, is alleged to contain more than half a billion dollars in cash and gold. 'Lebanon has been mired in an economic crisis in recent years, and Hezbollah has exploited this to strengthen its grip on the country,' Hagari said. 'The facilities we targeted belong to Hezbollah and are disguised as civilian sites, but their sole purpose is to bolster the organization’s terror capabilities. Hezbollah has effectively created a state within a state.' Hagari revealed that the bunker, located at 7 Daram Street in Beirut, had been under Israeli surveillance for years. 'This bunker, deliberately constructed beneath a hospital, houses at least $500 million in cash and gold. The funds stored here could have been used to rebuild Lebanon, but instead, they are used to rebuild Hezbollah,' he said. He also issued a warning: 'Our aircraft continue to monitor the site, and we will keep tracking it. We call on Lebanese citizens, the Lebanese government and international organizations—do not allow Hezbollah to store money beneath hospitals.' Hagari also reported that the Israeli Air Force struck over 20 targets overnight, most of them in Beirut's Dahieh district, a Hezbollah stronghold. One of the key targets was an underground financial warehouse used by the Al-Qard al-Hassan association, a financial institution affiliated with Hezbollah. Hagari confirmed that the facility held tens of millions of dollars in cash and gold, earmarked to fund the group's operations. Hagari further outlined how Iran funds Hezbollah through three primary channels. First, oil and money are transferred from Iran to Syria, where the oil is sold, and the proceeds are funneled to Hezbollah through Unit 4400, a Hezbollah financial transfer unit. This method generates tens of millions of dollars. Second, Iran flies cash to Lebanon under diplomatic cover, with proceeds from its Quds Force’s independent oil sales delivered directly to the Iranian Embassy in Beirut and then to Hezbollah. The third method, according to Hagari, involves promoting economic ventures backed by Iran, including gas exports to Syria and the establishment of factories in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Turkey. 'This network was managed by Mohammad Jaafar Kassir, the commander of Hezbollah's Unit 4400, who we eliminated in Beirut earlier this month. A few hours ago, we also neutralized his successor in Syria,' Hagari confirmed, referencing recent reports of a drone strike on a vehicle near a Damascus hotel.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a bid by Michael Cohen to revive a lawsuit accusing his former boss Donald Trump and various former federal officials of returning him to prison in 2020 in retaliation for penning a book critical of Trump, who was president at the time. Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer, had appealed a lower court's dismissal of his suit, which sought monetary damages from Trump, former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, federal prison officials and the federal government. Cohen's suit accused them of violating his rights under the U.S. Constitution by restricting his free speech and subjecting him to an illegal seizure and cruel and unusual punishment. Cohen's lawyer Jon-Michael Dougherty said the Supreme Court's decision 'signals a dangerous moment in American democracy.' 'In denying Michael Cohen's petition, the Supreme Court has stated that the courts will not provide any deterrent for an executive intent on incarcerating its critics in retaliation for their speech,' Dougherty said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1n0szvxkg	2024-10-21T09:48:51-07:00	
Inside Hezbollah's financial network: Iran, banks and smuggling o...	While Tehran continues to supply its main proxy with funds, the terror group has turned to criminal and civilian bodies to continue to finance its fight against Israel The Hezbollah terrorist organization receives funding in various ways, both overt and covert. Iran, Hezbollah's main patron, plays a significant role in financing the terror group. According to reports, Iran delivers hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hezbollah annually and also supplies it with weapons. Hezbollah, however, doesn't rely solely on Tehran. The organization has realized the need to diversify its funding sources for various reasons, including U.S. sanctions on Iran. It has done so successfully, mainly via money laundering, arms trading, drugs and tobacco. Hezbollah's Qard Al-Hassan banking chain, whose branches were attacked on Sunday, is considered a central financial tool for the organization — but not an exclusive one. Therefore, targeting it won't necessarily eliminate Hezbollah's funding sources. Hezbollah has over the years extended its reach into various sectors in Lebanon, learning from Iran, including finance, energy and construction. It has established connections, increasing both its influence and wealth in the country. Among Hezbollah's financial entities is Bayt al-Mal (House of Money), a financial body functioning like a bank with branches across the country. Another financial body is Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance Support Authority, responsible for fundraising for the organization. Unlike entities that indirectly raise funds and present themselves as 'innocent institutions,' this authority openly promotes campaigns to arm Hezbollah on social media. 'Raise your head to the sky and see what your support has become — a drone,' one of the authority's videos circulated online during the war read. According to Israel’s Alma Research and Education Center head Tal Beeri, Hezbollah also has a financial unit responsible for salaries, money transfers and budgets, with all its financial activities routed via the financial institutions established by the terror group. Hezbollah also profits from drug smuggling operations across the Middle East, mainly involving the drug Captagon, an amphetamine-type stimulant. A few days ago, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions against Hezbollah’s financial network involved in oil and drug smuggling. Hezbollah collaborates with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to produce and distribute drugs. The Syrian army manufactures Captagon in factories across the country. The Syrian army's Fourth Division, commanded by the president's brother Maher al-Assad, plays a central role in drug production and has even been dubbed the 'Captagon Division.' Iran established a Captagon production line for Hezbollah in the Beqaa Valley region along the Lebanon-Syria border. Hezbollah has tried over the years to deny its connection to the drug's production and smuggling, being careful to ensure that its partners don't take on central roles in transportation and smuggling. Jordan is one of the key countries facing this drug challenge, with ongoing attempts to smuggle drugs into its territory including via drones. Over the years, Hezbollah has also extended its reach into the energy and fuel sectors. Hezbollah's opponents in Lebanon are aware of the organization's pervasive influence and many blame it for the current energy crisis in the country. According to Beeri, Iran’s fuel smuggling pipeline is another way for the organization to earn funds. 'They receive fuel from Iran, it’s smuggled to Hezbollah via Syria and Hezbollah starts trading or selling it.' He added that the terror group also profits from construction companies. 'There are many construction companies that appear to be civilian but are under Jihad al-Bina (Hezbollah’s socio-economic institution). There are construction, engineering and other companies belonging to Hezbollah. You can find something linked to Hezbollah in almost every field, presented as legitimate.' Many companies operating with or under Hezbollah are regularly subject to international sanctions aimed at stopping the delivery of funds to the terrorist organization. Numerous other companies in Lebanon and abroad are part of Hezbollah's financial network, across various sectors. It's hard to tell if Hezbollah could survive economically without Iran's support, relying solely on the complex financial network it has developed over the years. The organization also receives donations from communities abroad, with charity funds found in mosques around the world designated for donations to Hezbollah. 'Hezbollah is involved in almost every criminal activity worldwide, even luxury car smuggling. They have connections with criminal syndicates across the work, wherever a Shia community is found. Crime serves them not only for terrorism but also economically. It's a global operation.,' he added.

Ex-UN soldier exposes Hezbollah dominance in southern Lebanon, hi...	Michael, a Danish soldier who served in Lebanon a decade ago, describes UN's inability to act against Hezbollah, says 'reported daily violations of Resolution 1701, but nothing happened' A former Danish UN soldier revealed in an interview that Hezbollah maintained tight control over areas in southern Lebanon where UN personnel operated, further substantiating Israeli claims that the UN has failed to prevent Hezbollah's military buildup and enforce Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Lebanon War. Michael, a retired Danish soldier who served with the UN in southern Lebanon, told the Danish newspaper BT that UN personnel were 'completely dependent on Hezbollah' and had limited freedom of movement. 'In some areas, we couldn’t even take photos,' Michael said, referring to restrictions imposed by Hezbollah on UN forces. Michael, who served with the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) a decade ago, said Hezbollah's influence over UN activities was already pervasive at that time. He recounted that UN personnel were often blocked by Hezbollah operatives when they attempted to access suspected areas of terrorist activity. 'They simply blocked the road. They weren’t openly armed, but it was clear they were Hezbollah fighters,' he said. He also noted that UN peacekeepers were prohibited from documenting what they observed. 'It wasn’t allowed to take videos or pictures. If we did, locals could confiscate our cameras. This happened to some of my colleagues,' Michael added. When patrolling near the Israel-Lebanon border, Michael said UN forces were instructed to maintain a distance from Hezbollah operatives and avoid confrontation. 'We often saw 'civilians' near Israeli military facilities taking pictures. When that happened, we pulled back and watched from a distance, as we were instructed to do,' he explained. 'I once threw an interpreter out of my car for praising Nasrallah' Michael told the Danish newspaper that fear of the terrorist group was widespread. 'Civilians who didn’t support Hezbollah, especially Christians, were afraid to speak against it,' he said. He noted, however, that there was some cooperation between Shiite Muslims and UN personnel, with some interpreters affiliated with Hezbollah. 'I once threw one out of my car for praising Hassan Nasrallah. I refused to listen to that,' he said. The ex-soldier described a 'complete lack' of enforcement against repeated violations of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which prohibits armed groups south of the Litani River except for the Lebanese army. He expressed frustration over the lack of consequences for Hezbollah’s actions. 'We reported daily violations of Resolution 1701, especially restrictions on our movement. We were instructed to report every violation, but nothing happened. We never heard back, and no action was taken. It was incredibly frustrating,' Michael explained, adding that this confirmed his experiences in other UN deployments. 'The UN is ineffective.' Despite this, Michael emphasized that he and his fellow UN personnel believed in their mission. 'We had a reason to be there, even if some of us had to come to terms with the fact that we couldn’t do anything,' he said. He also noted that some UN observers in southern Lebanon held strong anti-Israel views. 'I remember one in particular, an Irishman,' he added. Michael expressed surprise at recent Israeli discoveries of Hezbollah tunnels and underground infrastructure, which are now being destroyed by the IDF near the border villages. According to the BT report, these tunnels are located near UNIFIL bases. 'We never saw or heard any digging while we were there—I would never have hidden that. But there were several civilian homes and even so-called 'chicken farms' near the Blue Line when I was there, and of course, we weren’t allowed to inspect them,' he said, referring to a demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel. Hezbollah's hostages The former soldier revealed that during his service, Israeli forces had shown a precise understanding of Hezbollah's positions along the border. 'We often visited the Israeli side of the border to get their perspective, and they could accurately pinpoint Hezbollah's locations on the other side,' Michael said. Michael's testimony comes amid growing tensions between Israel and UNIFIL. Israel has requested that UNIFIL withdraw its positions five kilometers (three miles) north of the border, citing ongoing clashes with Hezbollah. Despite the escalating violence, UNIFIL has refused to relocate, a stance Israel argues puts the peacekeepers at risk and makes them 'human shields' for Hezbollah, which operates near their bases. The UN peacekeepers have been caught in the crossfire in recent weeks, leading to international condemnation and concern from Israel’s allies, including Italy. Israel is worried about the potential loss of international support for its military operations. Foreign Minister Israel Katz clarified Israel's position last week, saying, 'Israel places great importance on UNIFIL's mission and has no intention of harming the organization or its personnel. We view UNIFIL as crucial in the 'day after' scenario following the war with Hezbollah.' Katz accused Hezbollah of using UNIFIL as cover, saying, 'The terrorist group deliberately fires at Israeli forces near UNIFIL positions to provoke conflict. We will continue to make every effort to avoid harming UNIFIL, in full coordination with its commanders and in accordance with international law.' Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts continue to reach a political solution to the northern front, as Hezbollah signals readiness for a cease-fire, separate from the ongoing war in Gaza. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut for talks, with Western diplomats urging Israel to seize the opportunity for a settlement, including a possible expansion of UNIFIL's mandate. 'We now understand that UNIFIL's mandate was flawed, and we need to explore either an expanded or a different mandate,' a senior Western diplomat told Ynet.

Putin, vote scandal and the Israeli link: Moldova's EU referendum...	President Maia Sandu’s push for Moldova to join EU sparks accusations of vote-buying linked to Israeli businessman allegedly backing Russia; despite controversy, initial results show narrow victory for country's EU membership bid Moldova is swaying between Russia and the EU on Monday following the announcement of the results of a referendum held on Sunday, where citizens were asked to vote for or against President Maia Sandu's plan to join the European Union. Overnight results initially indicated a sensational lead for the anti-EU camp, with 57% of the vote. By midday, however, after 99.41% of the votes had been counted, authorities announced that the pro-EU camp had narrowly won with 50.39% in favor compared to 49.61% against. Regardless, the result was disappointing for Sandu. The vote in Moldova — a country of 2.6 million people that was once part of the Soviet Union but has been increasingly looking to Western Europe, especially since Russia's invasion of Ukraine — was marked by significant tension. The pro-European President Sandu accused Russia of 'unprecedented' interference in Moldova's internal affairs, claiming an attempt to disrupt the vote, distance Chisinau from the West and keep it within Russia's sphere of influence. Moldovan police conducted around 350 raids in recent months, arresting hundreds suspected of intending to interfere in the vote on Russia's behalf. The allegations included not only spreading misinformation and pro-Russian propaganda but also 'buying' approximately 300,000 votes — a quarter of the expected total electorate — in a bid to sway the results in favor of the anti-EU camp. The pro-Russian campaign was reportedly led by Israeli businessman Ilan Shor, who fled to Moscow after being accused in Moldova of attempting to destabilize the country on behalf of the Kremlin and was convicted on corruption charges. Shor headed a pro-Russian party in Moldova that was declared unconstitutional after supporting protests against Sandu's government last year, allegedly aiming to overthrow her and install a pro-Russian administration. The 37-year-old Shor is also subject to U.S. sanctions. Shor mocked Sandu on social media over her supposed 'defeat' and 'miserable failure,' when initial results of the referendum were reported on. Even as Sandu has narrowly secured victory in the referendum, it's hard to view it as a success. The 52-year-old president, a former World Bank economist who strongly supports joining the European Union, initiated the referendum to gain public credit for her policy and hoped for a resounding win. Not only was the victory achieved by a very slim margin but it was carried via an unusually high voter turnout among Moldovan citizens living abroad, a population that largely supports EU membership. This fact is likely to undermine Sandu's leadership within Moldova and the pro-European image she and her supporters have tried to project internationally. Moldova began its EU accession process this past June and according to Sandu's plan aims to complete it by 2030. The emerging results are a major disappointment not only for Sandu but also for Brussels, which, amid what appears to be Georgia's return to closer ties with Russia, hoped at least to draw Moldova into its sphere of influence in the geopolitical struggle against Russia. In a speech delivered early on Monday, Sandu said there was 'clear evidence' that criminal organizations collaborated with foreign entities hostile to Moldova's interests, channeling tens of millions of euros into the process in an attempt to distort the vote and buy hundreds of thousands of votes. She also claimed it was an unprecedented scale of fraud and vowed not to back down. 'Their objective was to undermine a democratic process. Their intention was to spread fear and panic in society... We are waiting for the final results, and we will respond with firm decisions.' The referendum took place alongside Moldova's presidential elections and the results published overnight indicate Sandu is also facing challenges in her political career. While she garnered 42% of the votes, she didn't secure the 50% needed to win in the first round, forcing her into a second round on November 3 where she will face former Attorney General Alexandr Stoianoglo who won 26% of voters. Stoianoglo, who has the backing of pro-Russian socialists, could rally support from other candidates' supporters, posing a threat to Sandu's presidency. He claims that if he comes to power, he'll pursue a 'balanced' policy, maintaining ties with all parties — the European Union, the U.S. and Russia.

According to the military, the drones were intercepted before entering Israeli airspace. Following the launch of Hezbollah's drone swarm from Lebanon, departures from Ben Gurion Airport were briefly halted but resumed within 15 minutes. The IDF confirmed there was 'no security threat at the airport.' Around 50,000 passengers are expected to pass through the airport on Monday, including 24,200 on departing flights. Hezbollah has launched multiple drone swarms since the start of the war, though incidents involving five or more aircraft have been rare. This latest drone barrage followed a heavy rocket attack on Kiryat Shmona and the Galilee Panhandle, during which 25 rockets were fired. Sirens also sounded in Beit She’an, Tiberias, Nof HaGalil and dozens of other communities. Tiberias officials reported the interception of two rockets, with no casualties or property damage. A crater was discovered near the Gilboa region’s Moshav Moledet following a rocket strike.

Gaza settlements will happen, sooner or later, Smotrich declares	Finance minister makes remarks during event near Gaza border, titled 'Practical Preparations for Settling Gaza,' attended by Likud Knesset members and ministers Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Monday that Jewish settlements in Gaza are 'inevitable' and that he has believed since the 2005 disengagement from the Palestinian enclave that Israel would eventually need to retake the territory. 'It's clear to me that there will eventually be Jewish settlements in Gaza,' Smotrich remarked at a Nachal' movement event, held on the Gaza border under the title 'Practical Preparations for Settling Gaza.' The event, which featured workshops on 'settlement preparation' near the border, was attended by several coalition members, including Knesset members from the ruling Likud Party and ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir, May Golan and Smotrich himself. Nachala movement leader Daniella Weiss announced that the movement had 'ordered and paid for 40 buildings' intended for future settlements in Gaza. 'Representatives from 700 families are here, all committed to settling Gaza,' She said. 'The only solution is to eliminate Hamas, and those wishing for a normal life should move abroad.' Opposition leader Yair Lapid condemned the event, accusing Smotrich's Religious Zionist Party of hijacking Likud and pushing for endless conflict. 'This event endangers the IDF and Israel's foreign policy, and there’s no prime minister to stop it,' he said. The event invitation, issued with the Likud logo, read: 'Preparing for settlement in Gaza with Likud's settlement cores,' and attendees were expected to declare, 'Gaza is ours. Forever!'

Mass exodus from Jabaliya: Thousands of Gazans flee for 3rd strai...	Civilians evacuate as Israeli forces escalate operations, targeting Hamas infrastructure and surrounding key shelters; military actions, aimed at separating terrorists from civilians, heighten humanitarian concerns and draw growing international scrutiny For the third consecutive day, images surfaced on Monday showing civilians evacuating en masse from Jabaliya, a northern Gaza Strip area where the IDF has been conducting intensive raids for the past three weeks. Following the elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who imposed a reign of terror in the area, IDF Arabic spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee said, 'The fear barrier of [Yahya] Sinwar has cracked,' attributing the civilian exodus to the breakdown of Hamas' control. In the last 24 hours, the IDF’s 162nd Division reported destroying key terrorist infrastructure and tunnel shafts in Jabaliya. Soldiers from the 401st Brigade, whose commander Col. Ehsan Daxa was killed in Jabaliya on Sunday, neutralized several terrorists through tank fire, close combat and air force strikes. Gazans have claimed that IDF forces intensified their operations, surrounding schools that had been sheltering displaced civilians. Residents also reported that Israeli forces ordered the evacuation of civilians from Jabaliya, including areas around hospitals, which medical teams say are struggling under the pressure of the ongoing raids. Now in its third week, the 162nd Division's incursion into Jabaliya continues. Previous IDF operations in the area occurred in November, December and May, but unlike earlier efforts, the current offensive faces the challenge of evacuating civilians from a densely populated city where Hamas operatives have rebuilt significant military capabilities. According to IDF assessments, the Jabaliya raid is expected to last several more weeks, if not months. Hundreds of terrorists have been eliminated since the operation began, and large weapons caches and re-dug tunnels used by Hamas have been discovered. Raed, a resident of Jabaliya, expressed his anguish to Reuters, saying, 'We face death from bombs, hunger and thirst. Jabaliya is being erased, and there are no witnesses to the crime here. The world averts its gaze.' Israeli officials, however, emphasized that the evacuations are aimed at separating Hamas terrorists from civilians and rejected claims that the operation is part of a broader plan to displace residents from Jabaliya or the northern Gaza Strip.

Israel strikes Hezbollah's banking arm, IDF says attacks will con...	Air Force including branches of Hezbollah's financial arm, the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association; terror group vows the depositors won't lose any money despite Israeli strikes Israeli Air Force jets launched a series of overnight and early morning strikes in Lebanon, targeting dozens of Hezbollah command posts and locations where funds used for terror operations were stored. These funds were funneled through Hezbollah's financial arm, the Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, according to the military. The strikes, which began Sunday night, are expected to continue throughout Monday. The Lebanese outlet Al-Jadeed reported that Israeli strikes hit western Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, while Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen claimed three people were killed in a drone strike on a residential building in Baalbek. Additional strikes were reported in areas including Baddnayel and southern Lebanon. Hezbollah vowed that depositors with Al-Qard Al-Hassan would not lose any money despite the Israeli strikes. Rocket fire from Lebanon also persisted, with sirens sounding in the towns of Carmiel and the Ma'alot area in Israel's Western Galilee. In his statement, the IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari warned civilians to avoid Hezbollah-affiliated sites. 'Anyone near locations used to fund Hezbollah’s terror operations should distance themselves immediately,'he said shortly before stikes on the Dahieh began. According to Saudi-based Al-Hadath, there was a noticeable movement of people fleeing the area following the Israeli warning. Sky News Arabia reported that a hospital in Baalbek was evacuated due to its proximity to an Al-Qard Al-Hassan facility. The IDF was escalating airstrikes against Hezbollah's financial networks, particularly in Dahieh, aiming to disrupt the terror group’s cash flow. According to the IDF, Hezbollah uses millions of dollars funneled from Iran to pay its members and purchase weapons. The cash, often converted from Iranian rials to U.S. dollars in Syria, enters Lebanon in suitcases, with as much as $1 billion circulating each year. The IDF said that Hezbollah has become Lebanon’s wealthiest employer amidst the country's ongoing economic crisis. The average Hezbollah operative earns around $500 a month, and the group operates 31 branches of its financial institution, Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which holds assets in cash and gold across Lebanon. The IDF indicated that Hezbollah’s financial power structure is also a prime target of the strikes. 'This will shake Hezbollah’s financial foundation, making it harder for the group to maintain stability for its members and workers,' the IDF said. 'Hezbollah has embedded its financial operations within schools and clinics, but many of these buildings will be destroyed as part of our broader strategy to cripple the organization.'

They didn't want us to see what they were doing.'

7 Israelis face charges of spying for Iran	Suspects all immigrants to Israel from Azerbaijan to be indicted on Friday for espionage and cooperating with enemies of the state; the 5 men and two minors said to photograph military bases that were then struck by Iranian ballistic missiles in Iran's October attack In one of Israel's most serious security crimes, seven Israelis, all of whom immigrated from Azerbaijan, have been spying for Iran for the past two years. They are suspected of photographing military bases some of which were then targeted by Iran's ballistic missiles in the strike on Israel on October 1. The Rishon Letzion Magistrate Court revealed on Monday that the seven, all residents of Haifa and northern Israel, will be indicted on Friday. Among them is a soldier who deserted from duty and two minors. 'This is one of the most serious security cases investigated in recent years,' the state prosecution said. The Shin Bet began investigating the matter and was joined by the Police Serious Crimes Unit, 433. The suspects: Aziz Nisanov, Alexander Sadikov, Yigal Nissan, Vyacheslav Goshchin and Yevgeni Yoffe, and the two minors, were arrested on September 19, on suspicion of espionage. The indictment will include charges of cooperating with enemies of the state, which carries a penalty of life in prison.

Ministers demand strong response to Iran	In an hours-long meeting, cabinet members accuse the military of a lax response to the drone strike on Netanyahu's home; security officials say the IDF can only take action instructed by the government Ministers in Israel's security cabinet voiced criticism over Israel's lack of response to Iran's aggressions including the drone attack that targeted the private residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday. In an hours-long cabinet meeting on Sunday, the ministers accused the military of failing to take appropriate action in response to the attack. Security officials said in response that the IDF can only take action after the government decides what Israel's response should be. The question of when and how Israel should respond to Iran's ballistic missile attack has not been brought before the security cabinet until now and would likely only be discussed after Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and senior security officials finalize the plan. Gallant was supposed to travel to Washington last week, to discuss and coordinate an Israeli strike on Iran with his counterpart but was prevented from leaving by Netanyahu who said that his trip can only take place after there was a cabinet vote authorizing the prime minister and the defense minister to decide on a plan. During Sunday's meeting, ministers discussed the consequences of the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and if it could be leveraged to reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal. The ministers expressed their hope that Qatar, a mediator in talks with Hamas could pressure the terror group to agree to Israel's terms. they also heard a briefing about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the American threat of withholding arms to Israel if aid is not delivered in sufficient amounts. In a letter sent earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin threatened to invoke a national security memorandum issued in March which set conditions for continued U.S. military support to Israel, including allowing unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid. Despite recent claims by Israel that it was not preventing aid, including the entry of 30 trucks of food into northern Gaza on Monday, the U.S. remains concerned about restrictions.

I shouted I know who it is,'' the doctor who identified Yahya Si...	Warning, this article contains graphic content: Dr. Assi Sharon-Sagi, an oral and facial reconstruction specialist at Hadassah Medical Center and a volunteer with the police forensic identification unit, says she was preparing for the day she would identify the terrorist leader Dr. Assi Sharon-Sagi’s phone rang while she was at home. In addition to her regular role as an oral and facial reconstruction specialist at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, she has volunteered for years with the dental forensic identification unit. Since the start of the war, Dr. Sharon has been tasked with identifying victims of the Hamas atrocities and fallen soldiers. That urgent call brought monumental news—Dr. Sharon was the first to confirm with a high degree of certainty that the terrorist who was killed by IDF forces in Gaza last week, was the notorious Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. His body was examined and identified at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Abu Kabir before being stored at a secret location. 'Every so often, they send me a photo and ask if I have anything to say about it or if there’s something important to note. It happens quite often,' Dr. Sharon says. 'That’s exactly what happened on Thursday last week. I was at home, received a call and some pictures, and the second I saw them, I knew who I was looking at.' Did you recognize him right away? 'Yes. While it does require sitting down, checking, and going over every detail to write an official report, I knew immediately from the first glance. I was thrilled. I hopped up and shouted, 'I know who this is!'' Dr. Sharon had been preparing for this moment for months. 'In recent months, I decided I wanted to gather information in case we received Sinwar for identification,' she shared. 'With the help of the police forensic unit and the Israel Prison Service (from Sinwar’s time as a prisoner), we collected data. At first, it was general information, numbers, and so on, but then we moved on to building a detailed file by gathering images from social media.' 'We call this an 'anti-mortem' file—a file built before death, containing all relevant information, whether it’s photos, CT scans, or other features not directly related to teeth but visible in the face and ears. Dr. Ayala Groswald-Meiri put it all together.' 'Fortunately, in Sinwar’s case, his teeth are extremely distinctive, and they appear in all the pictures. Later, we obtained information from Soroka Medical Center, where Sinwar underwent brain surgery in 2005. We retrieved three of his CT scans from the hospital. We kept this file, and every expert in the unit was familiar with its details and images. So, when I first saw the picture, I knew immediately what I was looking at.' According to Dr. Sharon, dental identification is one of three scientific methods used by the forensic unit to identify bodies. 'We rely on one of three things—or a combination of them: dental X-rays, dental treatments, or morphology—the shape of the teeth, jaw structure, and sinuses,' she explained. 'In Sinwar’s case, his front and side morphology are very distinctive—he has missing teeth and gaps between them. The moment I saw the picture, I could make the comparison. After that, we sat down and wrote up all the details to complete the identification report.' Dr. Sharon has been volunteering with the unit since 2010 and has been involved in many tragic events that claimed the lives of Israelis. 'The first one I worked on was the Carmel fire disaster. Another was the Nahal Tzafit flood disaster, which was the first time I had to identify such young and beautiful people,' she recalled. 'Over the years, there have been major car accidents and other events, but the biggest tragedy came on October 7, with the massacre of the young people at the Nova music festival.' 'We arrived on the night of October 7, and we started identification on October 8, working around the clock—24 hours a day, seven days a week. It went on like that for a long time, and later it became more focused operations. Throughout all these months, we’ve been receiving either information or bodies, conducting examinations, and working to identify or rule out victims, all in the effort to locate the hostages.' Does identifying Sinwar bring any sense of closure? 'I’m not sure yet if I feel a sense of closure because I’m waiting for something else—something happy. I’m waiting for the hostages. But I can say that it’s satisfying to have identified the man who murdered so many of the people I’ve identified during this time. It’s important for me to say that identification work is a team effort. Everyone contributes, building one layer on top of another, so we can create organized files and complete the identification process. That’s what allowed us to make this quick identification.' 'I wasn’t alone in this identification,' she added. 'Two other specialists were with me: Dr. Revital Hebert, who led the unit for ten years, and Dr. Tzipi Kahana, a forensic anthropologist. She also contributed additional details that weren’t included in the official report, which is based on dental identification, but they added to the certainty of our forensic findings.' This kind of work over such a long period must take a mental toll. 'I can’t fully describe the psychological difficulties that this role demands of us. But I can say that the best places for me to be, and the people who are easiest for me to talk to, are those who work alongside me in the unit. When I’m with them, I feel calm, and everything is fine. But when I’m in my regular job at hospitals and clinics, it’s much harder for me. It feels like such a stark contrast to the identification work. I always feel like I’m in the wrong place, like I should be helping with the identification work. But my real life is my job as a dentist and a mentor to residents.' Meanwhile, as the war in Gaza and the north continues, there’s only one thing she’s hoping for. 'I just hope as many hostages as possible return alive, so I can take them off my lists because they’ll come back on their own two feet. I’ll stay in this role and do this work as long as it’s needed from me and the unit. We’ll do everything we can to bring the murdered hostages back to their families.'

Rabbi sues Hamas, PA after wife, daughters murdered in attack	Leo Dee demands NIS 50 million in compensation after the shooting attack claiming the Palestinian Authority supports terrorism and the murder was committed by members of the Hamas terror group Rabbi Leo Dee and his family filed a lawsuit in the Jerusalem District Court against the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas terror organization, for the murder Rabbi Leo Dee's wife, Lucy, 48, and their two daughters, the late Maia-Esther, 20, and the late Rina-Miriam, 15, in a shooting attack about 18 months ago in the Jordan Valley. The lawsuit, which was filed a few days ago through the lawyers of the Shurat Hadin advocacy group organization, amounts to NIS 50 million. According to the Shurat Hadin organization, in accordance with the recent Compensation for Victims of Hostile Action Act, the court may award compensation five times as much as previously given. The lawsuit claims the Palestinian Authority 'supports terrorism' because the PA pays imprisoned terrorists, and therefore bears responsibility for the triple murder, carried out by Hamas terrorists. 'On Passover a year and a half ago, my wife Lucy and my daughters Rina and Maia were murdered by despicable terrorists. Since then our lives have changed beyond recognition,' said Rabbi Dee. 'It is unbelievable that to this day the Palestinian Authority pays rewards to the families of the terrorists, in support of the perpetrators of the damned attack.' 'This lawsuit is our attempt to do some justice, on behalf of Lucy, Maia, and Rina. The lawsuit does nothing to heal our pain or sorrow, but we continue to fight evil wherever he is. We are working at the legal level and hope to be able to damage the rewards and incentives that the terrorists have been receiving from the Palestinian Authority for decades as much as possible.' The new law to compensate victims of terrorism sets a minimum threshold of ten million shekels for the victim's next of kin, and five million shekels for each family member. 'This lawsuit joins a series of lawsuits that we are conducting these days against the Palestinian Authority and the terrorist organizations that it finances, but this time, in light of the new compensation law, we estimate that these will give some peace of mind to the victims of terrorism this time, in light of the amount of funds that will be taken,' said President Shurat Hadin organization, attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, who represents the Dee family. 'This is the time for the victims of terrorism to fight back with all their strength and bring about the economic collapse of the terrorist organizations.'

Turkish cleric accused of staging coup against Erdogan, dies in U...	Fethullah Gulen built a powerful Islamic movement; once an alley of Turkey's president before being branded a traitor he lived in exile; after the failed coup Erdogan arrested at least 77,000 people in a purge and closed down institutions linked to him The U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who built a powerful Islamic movement in Turkey and beyond but spent his later years mired in accusations of orchestrating an attempted coup against Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan, has died. He was 83. Herkul, a website that publishes Gulen's sermons, said on its X account that Gulen had died on Sunday evening in the U.S. hospital where he was being treated. Gulen was a one-time ally of Erdogan but they fell out spectacularly, and Erdogan held him responsible for the 2016 attempted coup in which rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, tanks and helicopters. Some 250 people were killed in the bid to seize power. Gulen, who had lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, denied involvement in the putsch. According to its followers, Gulen's movement - known as 'Hizmet' which means 'service' in Turkish - seeks to spread a moderate brand of Islam that promotes Western-style education, free markets and interfaith communication. Since the failed coup, his movement has been systematically dismantled in Turkey and its influence has declined internationally. Known to his supporters as Hodjaefendi, or respected teacher, Gulen was born in a village in the eastern Turkish province of Erzurum in 1941. The son of an imam, or Islamic preacher, he studied the Koran from infancy. In 1959, Gulen was appointed as a mosque imam in the northwestern city of Edirne and began to come to prominence as a preacher in the 1960s in the western province of Izmir, where he set up student dormitories and would go to tea houses to preach. These student houses marked the start of an informal network that would spread over the following decades through education, business, media and state institutions, giving his supporters extensive influence. This influence also spread beyond Turkey's borders to the Turkic republics of Central Asia, the Balkans, Africa and the West through a network of schools. Former Erdogan Ally Gulen had been a close ally of Erdogan and his AK Party, but growing tensions in their relationship exploded in December 2013 when corruption investigations targeting ministers and officials close to Erdogan came to light. Prosecutors and police from Gulen's Hizmet movement were widely believed to be behind the investigations and an arrest warrant was issued for Gulen in 2014, with his movement designated as a terrorist group two years later. Soon after the 2016 coup, Erdogan described Gulen's network as traitors and 'like a cancer', vowing to root them out wherever they are. Hundreds of schools, companies, media outlets and associations linked to him were shut down and assets seized. Gulen condemned the coup attempt. 'As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt,' he said in a statement. In a crackdown after the failed putsch, which the government said targeted Gulen's followers, at least 77,000 people were arrested and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers suspended under emergency rule. Companies and media outlets regarded as linked to Gulen were seized by the state or closed down. The Turkish government said its actions were justified by the gravity of the threat posed to the state by the coup. Gulen also became an isolated figure within Turkey, reviled by Erdogan's supporters and shunned by the opposition which saw his network as having conspired over decades to undermine the secular foundations of the republic. Ankara long sought to have him extradited from the United States. Speaking in his gated compound in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, Gulen said in a 2017 Reuters interview he had no plans to flee the United States to avoid extradition. Even then, he appeared frail, walking with a shuffle and keeping his longtime doctor close at hand. Gulen had traveled to the United States for medical treatment but remained there as he faced a criminal investigation in Turkey.

Sinwar turned down offer of safe passage out of Gaza, report	Hamas leader prepared for his death since Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's assassination; told mediators 'I’m not under siege, I’m on Palestinian soil' Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas who was killed last week by IDF soldiers in the Tel a-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah, received an offer from Egypt during the war to leave the Gaza Strip and in return allow Cairo to conduct the negotiations for the release of the hostages, but he refused, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. According to the report Sinwar began to prepare for his assassination after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli attack in Dahieh in Beirut. He informed his people that Israel would probably offer concessions after his death to end the war, but said that Hamas in negotiations is in a stronger position. Apart from that, he also advised Hamas to appoint a council to govern and manage the organization after his death. Ynet reported there is not a single definite replacement for Sinwar so far. It is possible that a council will determine Hamas' stance on a hostage deal and facilitate one in the future. On Monday, the political-security cabinet convened for a discussion regarding a hostage deal after Sinwar's death. A senior Israeli official said recently that no substantial progress or dramatic breakthrough is expected in the talks, at least until the possible Israeli attack on Iran and the potential response is not over. Sinwar's replacements are also not expected to make much progress with a deal until they see a development in the regional war. Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, traveled to Cairo on Sunday to meet the new head of Egyptian intelligence, Major General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad who replaced long-serving Abbas Kamel. The two met in an attempt to advance a deal and get the negotiations back on track. Israel and the U.S. were in discussions with the Egyptian and Qatari mediators, trying to understand if it was possible to reach a breakthrough with Hamas. Israel fears Hamas will exact revenge on the hostages, and relayed threats through the intermediaries not harm them. Israel offered free passage and a financial reward to anyone holding hostages, dead or alive, to release them or provide information about their whereabouts. Last Friday, Sinwar's deputy Khalil al-Haya confirmed that Sinwar was killed, in a recorded speech. He said the terror group would not compromise on its demands for the IDF to withdraw from Gaza and the war to end.

US says THAAD anti-missile system is 'in place' in Israel	The U.S. military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now 'in place', Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is a critical part of the U.S. military's layered air defense systems and adds to Israel's already formidable anti-missile defenses. 'The THAAD system is in place,' Austin said, speaking to reporters before his arrival in Ukraine on Monday. He declined to say whether it was operational, but added: 'We have the ability to put it into operation very quickly and we're on pace with our expectations.' President Joe Biden said the THAAD's deployment, along with about 100 U.S. soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel, which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct 1. The United States has been urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear sites and his concerns about a strike on its energy infrastructure. Responding to questions from reporters, Biden said last week he had a good understanding of when and how Israel would attack Iran. But he also said he saw an opportunity to end the two enemies' back-and-forth strikes. Austin was cautious. 'It's hard to say exactly what that (Israel's) strike will look like,' Austin told reporters. 'At the end of the day, that's an Israeli decision, and whether or not the Israelis believe it's proportional and how the Iranians perceive it, I mean those may be two different things,' he said 'We're going to do - continue to do - everything we can ... to dial down the tensions and hopefully get both parties to begin to de-escalate. So, we'll see what happens,' he added.

ICC prosecutor accused of sexual harassment, report	Woman working as a secretary in the International Criminal Court said to be brought to tears by Karim Khan's conduct but refuses to file official complaint; internal probe recommends undisclosed measures; Khan denies allegations International Criminal Court (ICC) special prosecutor Karim Khan was accused of sexual harassment by a woman working as his secretary, the Daily Mail reported on Sunday. The ICC launched an internal investigation into the claims after another employee reported to her superiors that the woman 'was so upset she was in tears.' The allegations surfaced two weeks before Khan announced he was seeking arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over their conduct in the war in Gaza. Khan also sought warrants against no slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hamas military wing chief Mohammed Deif. The ICC investigation was conducted by the Independent Oversight Mechanism (IOM) authorized to investigate claims of misconduct in the court but after the accuser refused to confirm or deny the alleged harassment or lodge a formal complaint, the IOM recommended a series of undisclosed measures 'to safeguard everyone's rights,' the Daily Mail said. Khan denied any wrongdoing and said he was a victim of a deliberate smear campaign, adding he and the court were being subjected to a wide range of attacks and threats. 'I absolutely can confirm there is no truth to suggestions of misconduct,' he said. In the IOM annual report that was published on Friday, Kahn's name was not mentioned although the accusations against him were included. According to the report, allegations of his misconduct were made on May 3 and the woman who made them was told she can bring her accusations to an outside body. 'She still refused to file an official complaint,' the report said.

Israel states demands for Lebann cease-fire, report	U. S. special Mideast envoy Amos Hochstein due to visit Beirut to discuss cease-fire; Israeli demands include IDF forces being able to operate against Hezbollah along the Lebanon-Israel border and use its airspace for attacks Israel gave the United States a document last week with its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the war in Lebanon, Axios reported on Sunday, citing two U.S. officials and two Israeli officials. Israel has demanded its IDF forces be allowed to engage in 'active enforcement' to make sure Hezbollah doesn't rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure close to the border, Axios reported, citing an Israeli official. Israel also demanded its air force have freedom of operation in Lebanese air space, the report added. On Sunday the military said it was targeting the Al-Qard al-Hassan association, Hezbollah's banks and most valued financial asset and warned civilians to move away from its branches and avoid harm. The Air Force conducted raids on the bank in Beirut's Dahieh sector, a Hezbollah stronghold on Monday after overnight strikes there, in the Bekaa Valley area and in other parts of Lebanon. The Al-Qard al-Hassan Association, which directly funds Hezbollah's terror activities, including the purchase weapons and payments to operatives in Hezbollah's military wing,' the IDF said. 'The Hezbollah terrorist organization stores billions of dollars in the association's branches, including money that was directly held under the name of the terrorist organization.' U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein was due in Beirut on Monday for talks on ending Israel's war against Hezbollah. According to reports, Israel presented its demands for a cease-fire agreement that would stop the IDF offensive on the terror group. A U.S. official told Axios it was 'highly unlikely' that Lebanon and the international community would agree to Israel's conditions. The White House could not be immediately reached outside regular business hours. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The embassies of Israel and Lebanon in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Nova massacre survivor takes own life	Shirel Golan, is found dead on her 22nd birthday; Her brother blames inadequate state support for post-trauma, calls for government action to prevent similar tragedies amid grief and mourning Shirel Golan was found dead on Sunday after taking her own life. She survived the horrific massacre at the Nova Festival on October 7 and was set to celebrate her 22nd birthday with her parents, with a plan to visit to the Western Wall and the Cave of the Patriarchs. Many well-wishers sent her birthday messages, but she did not respond. Later, she was found in the yard of her home. 'Since she survived, I noticed symptoms of post-trauma. The state did not provide her with the care she needed,' her brother Eyal said. 'On the morning of October 7, after the sirens subsided, I texted our family group, and she replied that everything was okay. My brother and I set up a command center to guide her on where to go. Initially, she got into a car with friends, but at some point, she switched to a police officer's vehicle that rescued her to Kfar Maimon.' He added, 'It later emerged that everyone in the original car was killed, 11 people. It was a ride of death.' Eyal described Shirel's struggles: 'After she survived, I saw signs of post-trauma like avoidance and withdrawal from social interactions. I urged her to seek help, but she said she only received support from the Nova association, not from the state.' He shared that she fell into depression and was hospitalized twice in a psychiatric facility in the town of Pardes Hanna because no official recognized her as a victim of post-trauma from the Nova events. 'The state failed Shirel,' he lamented. He recalled spending time with her during the Sukkot holiday, where she seemed okay. 'I asked how she was, and she said she was fine. I gave her a hug and a kiss, not realizing it would be the last.' Eyal said Shirel left no note. 'We are five siblings, and she was the youngest. The government needs to wake up. If it doesn't, there will be more cases like this. If the state had provided proper care, this wouldn't have happened. I've lost my sister, but I want to raise an outcry so others don't lose their loved ones.' 'The ministry expresses deep sorrow over the untimely death of the Nova survivor and shares the family's and community’s grief,' the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry said. 'Survivors face many complex challenges in their recovery and healing processes. Together with the National Insurance Funds and partners like the 'Nova' association, we offer support and assistance to survivors.'

After drone targets PM residence, security overhaul coming	Despite an investment of over NIS 1 million in fortifying Benjamin Netanyahu's private home in Caesarea Shin Bet to review all , residence used by his family; 'Had he been home, he would have been in danger' Following the drone strike on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, the Shin Bet is conducting a threat assessment of all government facilities, as the current security measures do not align with the growing threat posed by Iranian drones, according to a report on Sunday. A senior source commented, 'You protect one part of the body, but the blow comes somewhere else. This is a significant escalation and more effort is needed not only in interception but also in revising our fortifications.' As a result of this attempted strike, defense officials are expected to reevaluate renovation plans for the Prime Minister’s residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem, currently undergoing a NIS 45 million upgrade. These adjustments could add at least another NIS 10 million to the project. Yossi Shelley, Director-General of the Prime Minister's Office, visited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea on Sunday, accompanied by Israel Tax Authority head, Shai Aharonovich, to assess the damage caused by a Hezbollah-launched drone strike from Lebanon. Aharonovich, who replaced the director of the Compensation Fund due to personal reasons, was joined by professional teams who evaluated and documented the damages. Contrary to earlier reports, most of the damage was to the structure itself. Sources familiar with the situation stated that if Netanyahu had been home during the attack, he could have been in real danger. The villa, which underwent over NIS 1 million in fortifications in recent years, will likely undergo further security evaluations. A senior figure familiar with the situation stated, 'The narrative that Netanyahu's homes are constantly being renovated to drain public funds is false. Netanyahu is arguably the most threatened leader in the world by hostile forces. If he had been in Caesarea on Saturday, we might not have a prime minister today. Relevant security decisions will need to be made.' Netanyahu stated last night that the drone launched from Lebanon toward his private residence in Caesarea was a failed assassination attempt on him and his wife, Sara. 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me made a grave mistake,' he said.

What is Al-Qard al-Hassan association, now a target of IDF?	Bank provides Hezbollah with money laundering services and is one of the terror group's main financial assets; A 2021 data breach shows how it violated sanctions imposed in 2016, through ties with other financial institutions Al-Qard al-Hassan association that came under attack on Sunday is Hezbollah's alternative to Lebanon's banking system and was complicit in building Hezbollah's mini-state inside the country. Although it was founded as an association to aid families in need, it had become a bank in every sense of the word. The IDF said it was targeting the bank's branches to prevent funding to the Iran-backed terror group for its war. Founded in 1982, al-Qard al Hassan claimed its mission was to provide loans to all, regardless of religion or ethnicity to 'improve social cohesiveness and cooperation,' with branches spread around the country 'to save travel time.' According to the Alma Research and Education Center, it is one of Hezbollah's central financial assets. It has been under sanctions since 2016 and has more than 200,000 customers. It holds gold estimated to be in the tons, much in from jewelry given as collateral for loans and has loaned over half a billion dollars a year. Over time it became Hezbollah's main money laundering service. In 2021, the bank's data was breached and information on accounts, including those of sanctioned Hezbollah members, became public and included the bank's dealings with other financial institutions in violation of the sanctions imposed on it. Hezbollah runs infrastructure parallel to the government institutions, including in education, health, social, communication, energy and construction. These organizations provide support for the terror group's military and support its political position.

IDF targets Hezbollah's financial institutions	The Military spokesperson says Israel will reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah and its terror activities; IDF planes strike banks in Beirut's Dahieh and elsewhere around the country The IDF launched strikes on Hezbollah's financial institutions on Sunday after the military warned civilians to stay away in Beirut's Dahieh district and in the Bekaa Valley region. Panicked crowds clogged the streets and caused traffic jams in some parts of Beirut as they tried to get to neighborhoods thought to be safer, witnesses said. 'Anyone near sites used for Hezbollah's terrorist financing must evacuate immediately,' IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said and the Arabic Language spokesperson posted a similar warning on social media, shortly before the strikes began. 'In the coming days, we will reveal how Iran funds Hezbollah's terrorist activities using civilian institutions, associations, and charities as covers. We will strike these targets tonight and update on the results in the coming days,' Hagari said. The military said that infrastructure belonging to the Al-Qard al-Hassan association, linked to Hezbollah will be targeted. It has more than 30 branches across Lebanon including 15 in densely populated parts of central Beirut and its suburbs. 'A significant portion of Hezbollah's activities, funded by Iranian state budgets, is conducted through these funds, intended for terrorist activities, including armament, weapons storage facilities, launch sites, member salaries, and other operations,' the IDF said. 'We urge those inside Hezbollah-used structures to evacuate at least 500 meters away in the coming hours.' These banks, which IDF plans to attack, hold Iranian currency converted into dollars in Syria, arriving in Lebanon in suitcases—hundreds of millions to a billion dollars in cash annually, primarily for salaries and military infrastructure, according to military intelligence. The IDF said Hezbollah has become Lebanon's strongest and wealthiest employer amid an ongoing economic crisis that began in 2019. The average Hezbollah operative earns a monthly salary of $500. The economic association serving as Hezbollah's bank is subject to heavy sanctions and therefore not connected to international clearing systems. It operates 35 branches across Lebanon with ATMs. According to IDF, all of Hezbollah's financial reserves are held in cash and gold at these branches. Hezbollah's financial power centers will also be targeted. 'This will destabilize Hezbollah, preventing it from providing stability and security to its operatives and employees,' the military said. 'Hezbollah structured this as an association and system from which it financially benefits, including schools and clinics. Many buildings will fall, and assets will be targeted. The operation is part of the strategic plan against Hezbollah.'

Shin Bet chief meets new Egyptian intelligence chief to advance h...	Ronen Bar held an introductory meeting with Egypt's Hassan Rashad, while the families of hostages urge the government to push for a deal in light of Sinwar's assassination Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar traveled to Cairo on Sunday for an introductory meeting with Egypt's new intelligence chief, Hassan Rashad, to advance negotiations and move forward on discussions for a deal after the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Ahead of Sunday's security cabinet meeting, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant held a discussion on efforts to bring back hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The meeting was attended by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and other security officials. After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week, families of hostages called on the government to push for a cease-fire and hostage release deal. Several families gathered at the Hostage Families' Headquarters in Tel Aviv on Sunday, demanding progress on a deal under the banner: 'Enough excuses—it's time to bring the hostages home.' Sharon Sharabi, brother of Yossi (murdered) and Eli, said: 'Recent developments have created a real opportunity to bring the hostages back.' He said Sinwar had been the obstacle to an agreement. 'Now that obstacle has been removed, it’s time to fulfill the will of the Israeli public and act according to the moral compass that’s been ignored for a whole year. People are celebrating the impressive achievements of the IDF and security forces, but let’s not forget—the main goal has yet to be achieved. The prime minister promised to bring everyone back. It’s time to deliver.' Gilad Korngold, the father of hostage Tal Shoham, echoed this sentiment. 'There will be no victory until the last hostage returns.' He recounted that it has been '380 days since my Tal was kidnapped to Gaza from Kibbutz Be'eri, along with his whole family—my grandchildren, my daughter-in-law, her mother, her aunt, and her cousin. Victory will be measured by the supreme moral test of bringing them back. Prime Minister, it is your duty, both Jewish and state, to bring them all home.' Korngold then directly addressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: 'After the assassination, you said the main mission is to bring them back. We demand to know what you are concretely planning to do to make this happen. Their time is up. If you can’t bring the hostages back, have the courage to tell the public. If that’s not the case, use your majority to bring them home. We demand answers and action. Their time has run out, and so have your excuses.'

House speaker says is investigating leak of Israel's Iran attack ...	We are following it closely,' Mike Jonson says adding he is to be briefed on the matter; Israeli officials say incident could increase mistrust in Washington; they say they hope the leaker is found and prosecuted to prevent similar incidents The United States is investigating the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel's preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday. The documents appear to have been prepared by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, describing U.S. interpretations of Israeli Air Force and Navy planning based on satellite imagery from Oct. 15-16. They began circulating last week on the Telegram messaging app. Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic missile barrage carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, its second direct attack on Israel in six months. Israel has intensified its offensive in Gaza and Lebanon, days after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Asked about the leak of the documents during an interview with CNN, Johnson, the U.S. House of Representatives' top lawmaker, said an 'investigation (is) underway and I'll get a briefing on that in a couple of hours,' he said adding, 'We are following it closely,' Johnson added. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Pentagon said it was looking into the leak reports. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. The Pentagon did not officially confirm an investigation into the leak was underway but said they were aware of the reports. The documents appeared on a pro-Iranian Telegram channel called Middle East Spectator which had posted support for Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the regime, in the past. Israeli officials said the leak was an embarrassment for the Pentagon just one year after dozens of classified documents about the Russian war on Ukraine, were leaked by a U.S. Air Force IT technician. The leak shows how closely the Americans are watching Israel, despite the close alliance between the two nations and its revelation was the source of some discomfort and damage to the credibility of the American security and intelligence agencies. Israeli officials said they expected the leaker to be found and prosecuted so that such events do not occur but added that the leak would not prompt Israelis to hide information from their American counterparts although, it may increase some mistrust already felt against Washington.

We thank Allah for this honor,' owner of house where Nasrallah w...	I lived in this house for 15 years', says Ayman Abu Taha who left his Rafah home last May says he is proud the arch-terrorist 'achieved martyrdom' in his apartment Ayman Abu Taha, the proprietor of the apartment where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar made his last stand, recounted his departure from his Rafah home to Khan Younis on May 6. Since then, he has been in the dark about his home's condition. In a BBC interview, he stated, 'I lived in this house for 15 years with my family. We never had to leave it, not even during previous wars. Nothing forced me to leave the house except for the approaching Israeli bombings and the evacuation and displacement orders issued to all my neighbors in Rafah.' Abu Taha went on to describe how his daughter first showed him photos circulating on social media, allegedly capturing Sinwar's final moments in their home. Initially skeptical, he only believed it when his brother confirmed the house in the images was indeed his. Reflecting on this revelation, Abu Taha shared, 'I was taken aback when I saw it. I couldn’t believe my eyes. But my brother called and confirmed it was our house, and that’s when the reality hit me. I received the news in disbelief. It's still hard to undestand.' On Instagram, under the account 'gaza_sweet,' Abu Taha expressed his family's pride in what they considered the 'honor' of Sinwar dying in their home. The house, situated on Ibn Sena Street in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood of western Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, became a symbol of defiance. In his post, he shared before-and-after images of the house from the war, highlighting the sofa where Sinwar sat when a drone captured him just moments before his death. 'The purest and most respected sofa and chair in the world are in our home. May Allah have mercy on you and grant you paradise, Abu Ibrahim (Sinwar),' Abu Taha wrote. In another post, he noted, 'Our home has been elevated in honor and pride with Abu Ibrahim. We thank Allah for this bestowed honor.' In a third post, Abu Taha continued, 'On behalf of myself and the Abu Taha family, we are all proud that Abu Ibrahim achieved martyrdom in our home.' Adding his voice, his cousin Muhammad Sami Abu Taha commented on Sinwar’s demise in the apartment, writing that he 'perished there as a fighter until his last breath. We hold immense pride in him and all who have walked this path of redemption.'

Israel has no ambassador in the UAE, despite importance of post	Amir Hayek, the only Israeli ambassador to an Arab country who did not return to Israel following the outbreak of the war, completed his term last Friday, leaving one of Israel's most friendly allies in the Gulf without an ambassador Since last Friday, Israel has been left without an ambassador to the United Arab Emirates after Amir Hayek, a political appointee of the previous government, completed his term and returned to Israel. Hayek was the only Israeli ambassador posted to an Arab country who did not return home following the outbreak of the war, remaining in Abu Dhabi all year. Yossi Shelley, the director-general of the Prime Minister's Office, is expected to replace Hayek. In July, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the posting. However, Shelley has yet to assume the role, and the Foreign Ministry has not yet taken the steps to approve Shelley in the ministry. The delay is due to the government's earlier political appointments in the foreign service and the next time such a posting becomes available will be in February 2025.

The IDF on Sunday, posted warnings in Arabic to civilians in Beirut's Dahieh sector and in the Bekaa Valley region in eastern Lebanon of attacks, urging them to stay away from Hezbollah sites.

Col. Ehsan Daqsa, brigade commander, falls in northern Gaza	The 41-year-old officer was killed by an explosive in Jabaliya; 'A hero of Israel, a courageous, humble, and principled warrior,' President Issac Herzog says 41-year-old Colonel Ehsan Daqsa from the Druze city of Daliyat al-Karmel, commander of the 401st Brigade within the 162nd Division, fell on Sunday when an IED exploded in Jabaliya, in the northern Gaza Strip. Another officer was seriously hurt in the incident and two others sustained light injuries. Ehsan took up his command in June. 'I am filled with pride to receive the privilege of commanding you, a special and courageous generation of fighters and commanders who have been fighting non-stop for many months and continue to fight even at this moment as we speak,' he said when he was appointed. 'We all bear a very great responsibility: first, the clear need to perform our missions as fighters to the best of our ability, seeking engagement and decisively defeating Hamas wherever it may be found, and against any enemy required to face in other arenas and second that we be worthy of you, the brave fighters and commanders, and our heroic wounded who fight to recover, some of whom have even returned to the battlefield. And, of course, that we be worthy of the fallen and the dear bereaved families.' Ehsan is the highest-ranking officer to have fallen since the ground operation began in the Strip, alongside Colonel Yitzhak Ben-Bashat, following the loss of three other battalion commanders on October 7. During the fatal incident, Ehsan entered Jabaliya with two tanks—his own and that of the 52nd Battalion commander—reaching the forefront of the raid. From this point, four soldiers, including Ehsan, the battalion commander, and two additional officers, went on to conduct reconnaissance just 25 yards away from their tanks. At this observation point, they encountered an explosive device wired for detonation. The blast fatally wounded Ehsan, and the battalion's doctor declared him dead at the scene. The three other injured were airlifted to a hospital, with the 52nd Battalion commander seriously wounded, while the other two officers sustained lighter injuries. Investigations are ongoing to determine if they were also subjected to gunfire. According to military intelligence, Hamas, which has resumed operations in Jabaliya, was struggling to cope with the IDF operations after some 5,000 additional Gazans left the area for the south, over the weekend. In Daliyat al-Karmel, Ehsan's hometown, his death was met with profound grief. 'Daliyat al-Karmel is in mourning,' Mayor Rafiq Halabi said in a post. 'How the mighty have fallen. With sorrow, pain, and much mourning, Daliyat al-Karmel, the military, the Druze community, and the State of Israel bid farewell to one of their heroes. Today, Colonel Ehsan Daqsa fell in Gaza—a hero, brave, a warrior who became a legend, humble, and who fought since the war's onset.' President Issac Herzog called Ehsan a hero. 'Alongside all of Israel, I received with sorrow and pain the bitter news of the fall of the 401st Brigade commander, Colonel Ehsan Daqsa, who fell today in the battles in Jabaliya. Ehsan—a hero of Israel, a courageous, humble, and principled warrior—his fall is a loss to the State of Israel and all of Israeli society. I salute him and embrace his family, the community of Daliyat al-Karmel, and our brothers and sisters from the Druze community who have lost many dear sons since the beginning of the fighting, with dedication, a sense of mission, and a shared destiny.' Sheikh Muwaffak Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Druze community, said the IDF lost one of its finest. 'This is a very difficult and painful loss for the State of Israel, the military, and the Druze community. It is unfathomable that the hero destined for greatness is no longer with us. Our hearts and feelings are with the family in these unbearable moments, as their world turns upside down with the receipt of the harsh and bitter news. The Druze community continues to pay the ultimate and most precious price in the war—losing the finest sons and officers.' Forces from the 162nd Division entered the third week of their operation in Jabaliya, after previous maneuvers in November and December, and a raid by the 98th Division on its refugee camp in May. Unlike prior raids in the ongoing Phase C of the battle against Hamas, which will extend into the coming years, the military faced challenges evacuating the city's population, allowing hundreds of Hamas militants to regroup under its cover. As reported first by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, military assessments suggest this operation may last for many weeks, possibly months, despite recent reports of significant departures of Gazans from the encircled area. Forces from the 460th and 401st Armored Brigades, recently joined by the Givati Brigade, have, according to military sources, eliminated hundreds of terrorists and located numerous weapons caches, as well as combat tunnels that were destroyed and later re-dug by Hamas. Following the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Ehsan received a commendation for assisting paratroopers who called for help in southern Lebanon. 'One of the soldiers shouted over the radio that they were under heavy fire,' Ehsan recalled the battle in the village of Aita al-Shaab about a year after the incident. At that time, Ehsan, then the commander of the 'Kfir' Armored Company, went out to help the soldiers with his team. Hezbollah militants tried to hit him and his soldiers with anti-tank missiles but missed. When they reached the area of the house where the paratroopers were staying, they fired a shell at another house where Hezbollah operatives were located, and the enemy fire ceased. He then managed to make eye contact with the paratrooper company commander, who reported over the radio that one of his soldiers was killed, and four others were wounded. Then came the most challenging part of the event—Ehsan and another soldier from his tank crew rescued the paratroopers and brought them to the tank, which carried a total of nine soldiers to the border fence. 'I have no doubt I would do the same today,' he said about a year after the war. The commendation justification noted that Ehsan demonstrated 'boldness, bravery, resourcefulness, and professionalism.'

Western diplomats voice concern Israel prolonging war	Former Jordanian Foreign Minister claims Netanyahu does not want to give Harris a win by agreeing to a cease-fire; others say IDF military achievements should be leveraged to end the fighting and complain that Israel is acting alone Western diplomats expressed concern that Israel will prolong the war despite its recent military accomplishments in the combat zones of Gaza and Lebanon, and not use them to reach a cease-fire. In briefings, the diplomats praised successes —such as the elimination of Yahya Sinwar and Hassan Nasrallah, and the coordinated pager attack in Lebanon, but urged that the momentum achieved —diplomats around the globe are urging the use of this momentum to forge diplomatic agreements. 'At this stage, diplomacy alone isn't sufficient,' an Israeli official said. Several diplomats have suggested that Prime Minister Netanyahu was also factoring in how a ceasefire might influence the upcoming U.S. elections. They believe that any breakthrough in negotiations would benefit Vice President Kamala Harris and that Netanyahu prefers to engage with Donald Trump. 'There’s no reason for Netanyahu to halt his conflicts before the U.S. elections,' said Marwan al-Muasher, a former Jordanian foreign minister. 'He doesn’t intend to hand Harris any credit or gift before the elections.' President Joe Biden said on Sunday that a ceasefire in Lebanon is achievable, though it would be more challenging in Gaza. Trump on the other hand said Netanyahu was doing a good job. 'Biden is trying to hold him back when he should be doing the opposite.' the Republican candidate said adding that the Sinwar's killing will make it easier to reach peace. 'I am pleased that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to do what was necessary,' he said. A senior Western diplomat claimed that after Israel 'managed to unsettle Hezbollah and surprise them and the entire world,' it should 'seize the opportunity and pursue a settlement in Lebanon,' adding 'We were astonished by Israel’s achievements in Lebanon. These are significant intelligence and military accomplishments.' Nevertheless, discussions with this senior diplomat, along with others, reveal a deeply worrying picture—a lack of trust in Israel's plans for Lebanon. This skepticism helps explain UNIFIL's strong opposition to complying with the IDF's demand to withdraw 3 miles northward. 'There is substantial concern in the international community that Israel's ground operation will deepen, leading to casualties among Lebanese civilians and UNIFIL forces,' explained the senior diplomat. 'There is significant apprehension about getting embroiled in Lebanon. Israel spoke of an operation lasting a few days—yet it has already extended beyond two weeks and is intensifying. We fear waking up in six months to find you still entrenched in Lebanon and fighting.' He went on to say that there was a willingness within the international community to expand UNIFIL’s mandate, but negotiations were necessary for that to happen. 'Any occupation of Lebanon would be a grave mistake and would provide Hezbollah with justification to continue its activities,' he said adding he was disappointed with Israel’s approach. 'Unfortunately, they aren’t communicating with anyone, which is why UNIFIL refuses to relocate—it contradicts their mandate and would also be humiliating.' He said that despite the severe blows Hezbollah has sustained, the terrorist organization still has leadership capable of making decisions if needed. 'There is an understanding in the international community about the seriousness of the Hezbollah threat. We are at risk of entanglement, and an operation initially intended for a few days could drag on for months. 'Today, we understand that UNIFIL's mandate was flawed, and it needs to be reconsidered or replaced with another mandate,' he said. 'The international community is open to this idea. It is clear to everyone that a different solution for southern Lebanon is necessary—because the problem must not be allowed to resurface. The West needs to consider how it will contribute to the solution. Negotiations will make this possible.' He also added, 'Many Lebanese would like to see Hezbollah vanish. But an Israeli occupation in Lebanon would be a mistake, as it would give Hezbollah a pretext to act. Do not provide Hezbollah with excuses. Israel needs a mechanism to oversee and enforce an agreement. This will require forces on the ground.' He reiterated that 'Israel's lack of communication with anyone is a mistake,' asserting, 'Israel will not achieve all its objectives in Lebanon. It had success against Hezbollah, and this should be leveraged to reach an agreement.'

Jewish-American billionaire hell-bent on Trump losing presidentia...	Mark Cuban, the successful businessman and co-star of TV's Shark Tank is a one-man army against Elon Musk and other billionaires who support Trump's race for the White House by propping up his opponent VP Harris The American presidential elections will be held in 16 days, but the seven most important states that will determine the country's next four years are already voting. As of Saturday, about 12 million Americans have already voted, with the most impressive figure coming from Georgia, where more than a million people, about 9% of the southern state's population, voted. Both campaigns are recruiting all the help they can get for the final stretch. As far as Donald Trump is concerned, this is mainly a very long line of billionaires, who continue to pour huge sums into organizations that are not subjected to laws concerning donations. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, is using mainly popular names, starting with the Obamas and ending with the singers Lizo and Usher. Recently, a new and intriguing name was added to the list: Mark Cuban, a billionaire and a celebrity. Cuban who is Jewish, is a household name for his plethora of projects, assets and television appearances over the years. At one point he was the owner of the Dallas Mavericks from the NBA, and in recent years has starred on the popular reality show Shark Tank. His fortune is estimated at more than six billion dollars, and he became a multi-millionaire mainly thanks to his early technological investments. However, his best investment was the Dallas Mavericks. In 2000, he became the main shareholder in the group for $285 million, and a quarter of a century later the Mavericks are worth between four and a half billion dollars and five and a half billion. Cuban sold most of his shares in the group last year, but still holds a professional-managerial position. Shortly after Harris replaced Joe Biden as the presidential candidate, Cuban announced his support for her, as an almost one-man army, trying to debunk Trump's narrative that the Republican candidate is a successful businessman with superior economic policies. It started with a Twitter fight with Trump supporters, but last week Cuban decided to take it a step further and get on stage. On Thursday, he appeared at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, where he said Trump's trade and tariff policies would bring back inflation and crush the dreams of entrepreneurs, by making their costs impossible. Cuban was in Arizona on Saturday and is expected to appear in Michigan alongside Harris' husband, Doug Amhoff on Sunday. So far, Cuban's support for Harris does not include financial contributions, but he does coordinate with the campaign, which has moved to a very aggressive line of attack against the 78-year-old Trump's ability to function. Over the weekend, sources within Trump's campaign leaked to Politico that he cut back on appearances and canceled four consecutive interviews because he was 'exhausted.' The news quickly made headlines and Harris campaign ads. Harris' campaigns focuses on the question whether Trump to fit to serve the toughest job in the world in his condition.

Enslaved by ISIS, liberated by IDF: The story of Fawzia Amin Sido	Fawzia captured and treated as a sex slave by the Islamic State in Syria, routinely beaten, raped and forced to devour human flesh to survive, and upon arriving in Gaza, witnessed the cruelty of Hamas, eventually liberated by Israeli forces Fawzia Amin Sido, a young Yazidi woman who was abducted by ISIS as a child in 2014 and ended up in Gaza said she had endured starvation, abuse and rape. She was rescued by Israeli forces and returned to her family. In an interview with Britain's The Sun, Sido recounted the chilling events from a decade ago when she, along with other Yazidi women and girls, was forcibly taken to Tal Afar. There, they were deprived of food for four excruciating days until their captors finally fed them upon reaching northwestern Iraq. Some of the details ahead are painfully graphic. 'They cooked rice and meat and gave it to us to eat. We were so hungry that we immediately ate everything on the table,' Sido recalled. 'We knew something was wrong because the taste was strange, but we were starving. After we finished, we all had stomach aches and felt unwell. Then they told us that the meat we ate was from babies.' She described how one woman succumbed to a heart attack and died instantly. They showed us pictures of babies whose heads were decapitated and said, 'These are the children you ate.' It was very difficult, but it's not our fault. They forced it on us. It wasn't in our hands,' she said. In a chilling description, Sido added that mothers of babies cried and screamed at that moment because they understood why they were separated from their babies. 'One of them even recognized her son in the pictures they showed her.' In early 2015, Fawzia was transferred to al-Raqqa, where she was held underground for nine months in degrading conditions alongside roughly 200 other women. 'We were in darkness all the time, we didn't see sunlight,' she said. 'We did nothing, we couldn't go outside. We drank dirty water, some girls died. It was a very difficult time.' She said men occasionally entered their holding area, 'choosing a girl they fancied and taking her with them.' Fawzia herself was bought and sold five times by ISIS militants during her years in Syria. The fifth man to purchase her was a Palestinian ISIS fighter, ten years her senior. He used drugs to rape her when she was just 14, and he was 24. 'At first, I hid in the bathroom while he slept because I didn't know what he wanted from me,' she said. 'I was scared and didn't want him to do anything. When he noticed I was hiding, he gave me drugs and put me to sleep, and then he raped me.' He abused her until she was 15, and she bore him a son and a daughter. By 2018, as the Islamic State was pushed out from Syria, she lost contact with her captor. She was subsequently sent to the notorious Al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, home to ruthless ISIS militants and their families, including Western Muslims who joined them. 'ISIS women were very mean to me and forced me to work for them,' she said. 'I always did what they told me because I was so young and scared. They also tried to force me to be Muslim.' Eight months later, she learned her Palestinian captor was imprisoned in Idlib, Syria. Fearing for her children's future, she traveled to Gaza to live with his family. She was taken there via Turkey and Egypt with a forged passport, finally arriving in 2020. Along the way, she traversed an underground tunnel in Idlib, where some people died from lack of oxygen, before walking 31 hours to her next stop in Turkey. Fawzia hoped her husband's family in Gaza would respect her as the mother of his children, yet she faced humiliation there too. Regularly beaten, she was effectively imprisoned in her home under Hamas rule. Meanwhile, she was informed that her husband had been killed. Contrary to reports, she did not remarry his brother. 'I was never free to do what I wanted in Gaza. Had I been, I would have left much sooner. I couldn’t leave; I was constantly under their control. Once, Hamas members held a gun to my head when I went outside with a friend. They told me I wasn’t allowed to.' She said that, in reality, Hamas treated her like a slave. After the massacre on October 7, she was sent to work as a slave in a hospital, saying that 'all hospitals served as Hamas bases. Everyone was armed. Weapons were everywhere.' Only on October 1 this year was she finally released from Gaza after months of diplomatic efforts between the U.S., Iraq, and Israel, risking her life in the process. Following her release, Hamas claimed she lived in Gaza willingly and only wanted to leave because of the war. 'That is an outright lie,' she said. 'I was never free there. I was compelled to stay at home. When I was in Israel and knew there was no more Hamas, I was overjoyed. I could breathe again. They are very evil; they killed people and forced me to stay there. Why would I want to stay there? They claim the experiences I describe didn’t happen to me; they should have been there instead of me. There’s no difference between Hamas and ISIS. I didn’t believe I would be saved until it actually happened.' Fawzia is reluctant to discuss her children, now aged five and six, whom she hasn't seen for several months. Her lawyer mentioned, 'We don’t discuss her children much; they were taken from her long before she left Gaza. Not taking them with her wasn’t her choice. She had no option to reunite with them. She hopes to build a new life, but she doesn’t want to do it in Iraq, where she still fears. What she describes is only 15%-20% of all she endured. She needs a lot more time.'

Man arrested after spreading rumors of hostages freed on TikTok	The 33-year-old suspect posted video claiming that 30 families of hostages were informed their loved ones were rescued from Hamas captivity; suspect is accused of disturbing the peace by knowingly spreading false rumors meant to incite fear and panic The Israel Police arrested a 33-year-old man for spreading false rumors of hostage rescue from Hamas captivity in Gaza. During his interrogation, the suspect apologized multiple times, claiming he heard the news from friends and was unaware it was false. He is accused of disturbing the peace by knowingly spreading false rumors meant to incite fear and panic. 'We will not tolerate actions that harm the feelings of hostage families,' a source in the police said. The suspect was placed on house arrest for five days. Rumers of a rescue of hostages spread quickly around the country, causing false hopes and distress to the families of the captives. The IDF spokesperson made three public statements saying there was no rescue and asking the pubic not to spread unreliable news. Meanwhile, TikTok blocked the suspect's accounts. 'Spreading misinformation is prohibited on our platform,' the company said after it had faced criticism throughout the war for amplifying pro-Palestinian content while suppressing pro-Israeli material. The suspect's account called 'The Shadow 7000,' has more than 52,000 followers. On Saturday he posted a video to his followers, claiming that 30 families had been informed that their loved ones had been rescued from Hamas captivity—some alive, some dead. 'There was a very emotional rescue operation that lasted nearly three hours,' he said in the video, making him one of the main sources of the false rumors that the IDF had to publicly deny three times within 24 hours. 'Unfortunately, there are both good and less good news. This was a significant operation, and it will be remembered in history. Please, for those of you waiting anxiously for updates, continue to be patient.' Ironically, in his posts, the suspect urged his followers to refrain from spreading false information, saying it harmed the families of the hostages: 'Please don’t spread fake news or rumors. Everyone keeps sending me guesses—stop it. There are families waiting for news about their loved ones. Please be considerate.' Later, the suspect posted another video, giving false details about hostages allegedly rescued alive, even naming them. One of the hostages he falsely claimed had been freed was lookout soldier Liri Albag, whose name was also spread in WhatsApp messages. 'At around 11 pm on Saturday, there was a surge of rumors about the rescue of hostages, Liri's mother Shira said. 'We got messages from people and heard reports of something happening in Jabaliya and Rafah. There were rumors about helicopters at hospitals. We didn’t sleep all night. Things calmed down in the morning, but by noon, another wave of rumors started. People were sending us texts asking us what was going on,' she said. 'It causes unbearable anxiety, making you wait for a knock on the door. Many times when rumors spread, there was some truth to them. We called the IDF officers we are in contact with, who said they didn’t know anything, but we didn’t know if we should believe them. There were so many specific rumors at the same time. We all took calming pills just to try to breathe. We posted on Liri’s Instagram, asking people to stop doing this. 'The names were specific, but then again, they were of families already prominent in the media. We wondered if maybe it was an Iranian bot spreading these rumors as psychological warfare. We thought, 'With so much talk, something must have happened. Maybe there was a terrible event with soldiers killed?' It’s just awful.' Gal Hirsch, Israel's coordinator for POWs and MIAs, has requested that police and the Shin Bet open a criminal investigation into the source of the rumors.

France says Israeli companies welcome at Euronaval if not involve...	After deciding to ban Israeli companies from the world's largest naval weapons exhibition, organizers seemingly amend ban but in practice leave Israelis out Following the decision to ban Israeli companies from exhibiting at Euronaval, the world's largest naval weapons exhibition set to take place in Paris, the organizing body announced the companies would be allowed to participate — on the condition that they were not involved in the IDF's efforts in Gaza and Lebanon. In practice, however, there isn't an Israeli company that wasn't part of the war effort, which makes the apparent amendment irrelevant. 'The exhibition organizers acknowledge the decision of the National Defense and Security Council dated October 1, 2024, as clarified by the decision of October 18, 2024, which stipulates that Israeli companies wishing to participate in the Euronaval exhibition may do so. They may have an exhibition stand, provided that their products are not used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon,' the organizers wrote in a statement on the event’s website. The annual exhibition features hundreds of international companies that develop naval vessels and weapons and has always included numerous representatives of Israel's defense industries. Israel Shipyards is set to petition a French court in the coming days. The company was planning to showcase its Mini Shaldag vessel, a fast boat designed for patrol and interception suitable for shallow waters; the OPV45 ship, developed at the Haifa shipyard in recent years and the Reshef S80 ship, a similar model of which is set to join the Israeli Navy in the coming years. 'The boycott on Israel forces the country to rely on itself and develop a strategic, local and independent military industry,' said Israel Shipyards CEO Eitan Zucker. This marks the second time France has decided to ban Israeli companies from prestigious weapons exhibitions. In June, Israeli companies were barred from exhibiting at the Eurosatory 2024 event, with Israeli individuals being denied entry to the event. The French government appealed the decision in court following a public uproar, leading to it being overturned, though much of the damage had already been done. Twelve Israeli companies were interested in exhibiting at the naval fair, and local participation will almost certainly be blocked from the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, the crown jewel of such exhibitions should this negative trend continue. Although the event is scheduled for June, preparations start many months in advance. An Israeli source said that France has become a symbol of left-wing embargoes on Israel, noting that French companies had asked President Emmanuel Macron to ban Israeli companies for commercial reasons behind the scenes.

IDF to outsource maintenance of tanks, APCs amid increased load	Military for the first time in history will offer tenders to security industries aiming to restore and maintain armored vehicles damaged in the war The IDF, for the first time in its history, will outsource the repair and maintenance of its various armored vehicles including tanks and APCs to companies in the Israeli defense industry due to the urgent need seen in the year-long war against Hezbollah and Hamas. The repairs were previously carried out exclusively by the IDF’s Technology and Maintenance Corps. Ynet learned on Sunday that the Defense Ministry will issue the first tender on the matter in the coming months via its Department of Production and Procurement. Additionally, the department, in consultation with the IDF, will decide on whether to transfer part of the armored vehicle production, currently performed by the Technology and Maintenance Corps, to local industries. Armored combat vehicles have seen substantial wear due to the ongoing war and require maintenance and repairs to ensure continuous operational activity. The load on the IDF on this matter is extremely high. To manage routine tasks, the Technology and Maintenance Corps has even employed retirees — former professionals volunteering to assist the army. Moreover, the IDF will need to restore all its armored vehicles to full readiness once the war concludes. According to the Defense Ministry, this will require a years-long process given the vast number of vehicles and the need for a large quantity of spare parts. The IDF and the Defense Ministry have concluded that the scope of this task necessitates, for the first time, collaboration with external entities — Israeli industries that will take part in the mission. Another conclusion drawn from the war is the need to significantly expand the IDF’s fleet of armored vehicles. The relevant industries for the tender are heavy industries involved in metalwork, such as large-scale welding and machining. Among the candidates are companies like Israel Shipyards, Ahot Ashkelon Industries, Elta Systems, Nidec and others. It was also reported that the Defense Ministry has already held preliminary talks with these companies, which have shown a willingness to participate in the tender and invest in the necessary equipment to integrate into the military’s system. 'So far, we haven't had an industry for restoration and assembly,' A Defense Ministry source told Ynet. 'The increased procurement needs of the IDF and the necessity to restore existing equipment required us to think differently.' The war highlighted the critical need for Israel’s independence in all supply aspects for the IDF and strengthening local industries, partly due to difficulties in acquiring ammunition and equipment from abroad, as some countries don’t allow certain components to be exported to Israel. The Israeli munitions industry (including Israel Aerospace Industries, Israel Military Industries, Elbit Systems, etc.) has doubled and even tripled its production capacity, based on the IDF's promise to maintain a steady stream of orders even after the war, making the investment worthwhile.

Former Sodastream CEO offers Gazans $100K for living hostages	Daniel Birnbaum offers to reward Gazans for taking 'responsibility for their lives and guarantee a better future for them and their families' by October 24; He gave the names of the respondents to the IDF for authentication After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the residents of Gaza to return hostages to Israel in the wake of the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, and promised that Israel would allow those who do so to leave the Gaza Strip safely, the former CEO of Sodastream is also joining the effort to bring them home. In a video published on Saturday, Daniel Birnbaum offered a cash reward of $100,000 to whoever returns Israeli living hostages. 'This is a message for the good people in Gaza. I have an offer for you. My name is Daniel Birnbaum, and I was CEO and chairman of Sodastream International, a Nasdaq-traded company acquired by PepsiCo,' Birnbaum said in the video. 'This year was a terrible year. It's time to wrap things up. It's time to move on.' 'A few days ago, Benjamin Netanyahu promised free passage and immunity to anyone who delivers an Israeli hostage to Israel. I would like to add to that a financial reward. Anyone in Gaza who returns a living Israeli hostage , will receive $100,000. That would be paid either by cash or by Bitcoin, as you prefer,' he offered. 'Don't wait. This offer is valid until Wednesday midnight, October 24, just a few days. Reach out to this number by Telegram or Whatsapp in confidence and I will make the appropriate connections to assure your free passage and reward money so don't wait. It's time for you to take control of your life, to build a future for yourself, for your family, and for your community,' he added. Birnbaum told Ynet he is receiving a flood of calls, including calls from Gaza, but their reliability is still unclear. He is passing the calls to an IDF official who will verify their authenticity. In the video, he chose to speak in English because he thought that maybe an American would be believed more than an Israeli. Birnbaum is ready to pay the required amount from his pocket even if reliable information about dozens of hostages arrives. He said that the payment is his contribution to the release of the hostages. In his years as CEO of Sodastream, Birnbaum empowered and promoted Palestinian workers in the company as a long-term goal. He believed in cooperation and cared for their well-being in a way that was hardly seen elsewhere. On several occasions, Birnbaum held communal Ramadan Iftar meals (meals for breaking the daily fasts) for Jewish and Muslim employees, promoting friendship and peace. Birnbaum said in response to the question of whether he still believes in coexistence, for which he worked with all his might, that he is holding on to twigs of hope and optimism to continue believing in coexistence. It is very difficult for him, he says, because the world proves otherwise, but according to him we don't have a choice. Right now, Birnbaum says there is a time to love and a time to hate and a time to fight and a time for peace and now, in the last year, it is the time for war. He said that In times of war, you have to fight and at some point, you have to change the track, but we don't change the track until we return the hostages. He knows Israel will not heal as a people and will not be able to move on unless the hostages return. Birnbaum, who served as CEO and chairman of the Sodastream company before it was sold to PepsiCo, is said to be an 'expert in aligning global trends and values ​​with business interests.' During his successful tenure, Sodastream went public and was sold to PepsiCo in 2018 for $3.2 billion. For the sale, he was promised a $34 million bonus in exchange for staying with the company for another three years. He later was accused of giving inside information to a company employee, and was sentenced to a month in prison as part of a plea deal. Finally, he spent 22 days in prison after being pardoned by President Isaac Herzog.

Nova survivor and rescued hostage return to the festival	A year after the Nova festival massacre, Yannai Eliyahu and his cousin Shlomi, who was rescued from Hamas captivity, achieve closure on Yannai's 24th birthday: 'It took me back but it was important to me' On October 6, 2023, right before the October 7 massacre, Shlomi Ziv, his wife's cousins Aviv Eliyahu and his younger brother Yannai went south to the Nova music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Shlomi, who worked in security for the party, went to work together with Aviv, the security director for Nova. Aviv was murdered, Shlomi was kidnapped and Yannai survived. A year later the two men returned to the field of horrors. Yannai came to the festivalhang out with friends. All three relatives who grew up together were in daily contact and involved in each other's lives. The Hamas attack on the Western Negev that began on October 7 at 6:29 a.m. brutally separated the three. Aviv was killed by Hamas terrorists. Shlomi was kidnapped to Gaza and was rescued in August in Operation Arnon. Yannai managed to hide and escape from the carnage. Friday marked Yannai's 24th birthday and, for the first time since the October 7 massacre, the two surviving relatives managed to put the past behind them. Yannai asked Shlomi to join him at the party to celebrate with him. Despite the difficult scenery and the accompanying memories, this time they celebrated life and the fact that they returned safely home. 'On Thursday and Friday before the party, it was difficult for me,' Shlomi, 40, told Ynet. 'The whole situation took me back there. To travel to the south again, to return to the party again. But it was important to get closure. Both for me personally and for Yannai, to be truly happy with him, so he would enjoy himself, and also to commemorate Aviv with dance and joy. It was amazing.' Did you manage to dance and feel happy? 'Yes, very much. There were other freed people there and more survivors from that horrible Saturday. Maybe they also wanted to achieve closure. I kept looking at the clock. I wanted to pass 6:29 a.m. without sirens and without all the bad things that happened. The original producers of the Nova festival organized the party. They are doing amazing things as part of the commemoration efforts.' Miran, Shlomi's wife, added, 'Yannai is like our little brother. He is my favorite. He was in the third grade when we got married and I always told him that I would bring down the moon for him. He came to the Nova party last year on Friday night, a day after Shlomi and Aviv. Amid all the unfolding events, he hid and took care of the wounded. He tried to contact Aviv who told him to go to a trailer.' 'In retrospect, Yannai was already on the escape route so it's a good thing because the whole area was attacked and he might not have survived. At some point, Aviv stopped answering him and he passed out. He realized that something very bad had happened. He jumped into a car together with friends and they drove toward a base. When they shot at them, they changed direction and managed to reach Netivot,' she added. How did you feel when they went to the party, again? 'I was worried, it set me back. But I took a breath and calmed down. I said to myself, let them go, have fun, let them get it out of their system. I trust Shlomi completely. I understood him and supported him. The photo of Shlomi and Yannai is one of our great victory photos. They passed 6:29 a.m. and saw the sunrise that they couldn't see a year ago,' Miran said.

Trump: 'Bibi wouldn't listen to Biden', Harris doesn't deny Gaza ...	U.S. presidential candidates make outlandish and appeasing statements two week prior to elections in final bid to grow voter base Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. president Donald Trump said during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania overnight between Saturday and Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him he 'wouldn’t listen' to U.S. President Joe Biden in a phone call that took place close to the event. 'Bibi called me today and he said, it's pretty incredible, but he wouldn't listen to Biden because if he did, they wouldn't be in this position,' Trump said, using the prime minister's nickname. Talking about U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, Trump said at the rally: 'She’s worse than him [Biden], she’s not as smart as him. And I’m not saying he’s the smartest — but she’s not as smart as him.' Meanwhile, Harris was filmed agreeing with a pro-Palestinian protester who accused Israel of committing 'genocide' in Gaza during an event with students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. This marked the first time Harris referred to the situation in Gaza by using the term. During the event, which took place last Thursday, Harris said, 'I am so invested in all of you, in every way' – at which point the pro-Palestinian student interrupted, asking, 'And in genocide, right? Billions of dollars in genocide. Billions of dollars in genocide.' ' I respect your right to speak. I’m speaking right now. I know what you’re speaking of. I want the cease-fire,' Harris said in response. The keffiyeh-wearing protester proceeded to shout: 'But what about the genocide?' and added as he was escorted out, '19,000 children are dead, and you won’t call it a genocide. Israel is committing genocide.' 'What he’s talking about, it’s real,' Harris told the audience after the man was escorted out. 'That’s not the subject that I came to discuss today but it’s real, and I respect his voice.' 'The statements made don’t reflect the position of the Biden-Harris administration or the vice president’s stance,' Harris’ representative later told Ynet. Her campaign sources added that Harris didn’t agree with the protester, and 'when security escorted him out, she made a general statement about the need to end the war, and expressed empathy for the genuine feelings that the issue evokes in many people after he left.' 'However, she didn’t agree with defining the war as a genocide, and she has not expressed such a stance in the past, as this is not her position,' the statement added. The statements of both Harris and Trump come a little over two weeks before the U.S. election on November 5, against the backdrop of the Biden administration's threats of a weapons embargo on Israel if it continues to block the transfer of American humanitarian aid to Gaza. Harris faced a setback last week after the American-Arab political lobby AAPAC announced it wouldn’t endorse any presidential candidate for the first time since its establishment in 1998, citing that 'both candidates blindly support Israel.'

Still functioning like an army': IDF turns Hezbollah's strength ...	The IDF Military Intelligence Directorate begins implementing new tool gathering real-time intelligence on organized Hezbollah cells in Lebanon, leading to fast and safe eliminations The IDF’s fighting in southern Lebanon highlights one of Hezbollah’s new key strengths, which it developed alongside the Russian military during the war in Syria over the last decade and a half. The IDF is now starting to exploit this strength, turning it into a vulnerability for the Shiite terror army. As daily clashes with IDF soldiers increase, the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate has observed just how disciplined Hezbollah is, maintaining a strict military hierarchy even in areas where only small terror cells remain. Two and a half weeks into the ground operation, the military identified two main trends in the daily combat patterns of the IDF divisions operating along the border to combat the terror group. Hezbollah hasn’t launched significant company or platoon-level attacks against Israeli forces. Instead, it operates with small cells remaining in the frontline villages where the IDF is present, alongside anti-tank, rocket and mortar fire. Hundreds of Hezbollah operatives near the border are doing so under a structured operational pattern. They haven’t yet resorted to independent guerrilla warfare, as Hamas did in Gaza when the ground maneuver against it was bolstered. This means Hezbollah has, in some ways, given up on its frontline villages as launch points for a possible invasion of Israel. It keeps most of its tactical manpower – tens of thousands of armed operatives – in areas safe from a ground invasion in southern and central Lebanon, following the heavy blows delivered by the IDF during the opening strikes of Operation Northern Arrows. By doing so, Hezbollah is acting similarly to Hamas by conserving forces and capabilities for a protracted war, with a limited scale and varying pace. Former IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi described the evolution of Hamas and Hezbollah from terrorist organizations to 'terror armies,' with battalions, brigades, special units, operational headquarters and force-building. Now, the signs of this evolution are clear: The IDF has observed that even small terror cells, composed of three to six armed operatives remaining in the border area, operate under a command hierarchy, even after most of the local company and battalion commanders have been eliminated. 'When they become completely disconnected, we'll see phenomena similar to the one in Gaza, where cells organize on their own and independently carry out attacks against IDF forces,' military sources said. 'It’s harder to operate against that, both from an intelligence and operational standpoint. For now, the fact they're still functioning like a military is beneficial for us.' Now, a new IDF operational intelligence tool is being used for the first time in Lebanon – FIU (Field Intelligence Units), which focuses on real-time, hourly intelligence tracking, targeting terror cells and organizations to support the forces on the ground. The intelligence officers and soldiers in these FIUs, most of them reservists, are stationed at a home front IDF Military Intelligence Directorate base but maintain an open line with battalion commanders, brigade commanders and their intelligence officers fighting on the Lebanese front. Each FIU unit, such as the one assigned to the Golani Brigade currently operating in Lebanon, has representatives from all areas of military intelligence: signals intelligence and eavesdropping, visual intelligence, human intelligence and other sources. They receive round-the-clock information from thousands of IDF sensors covering the village where the Golani Brigade is active. They rapidly process this information using advanced technologies and intelligence analysts, quickly generating alerts for the troops on the ground. According to the Military Intelligence Directorate, these real-time operational and intelligence mechanisms streaming from FIUs to the soldiers have led to the daily elimination of dozens of Hezbollah operatives, mainly airstrikes. 'We can now identify an ambush against an IDF force in southern Lebanon, which includes an anti-tank cell preparing to fire from 5 km away, followed by a barrage of rockets being set up 12 km away and possibly even an explosive they’ll try to detonate remotely,' military sources explained. 'The FIU teams immediately report this to the force on the ground, allowing the troops to prepare, protect themselves and counterattack the threat. These events have been happening daily in southern Lebanon over the past two weeks,' they added.

Sinwar's wife enters tunnel with luxury bag worth thousands of do...	IDF spokesperson in Arabic publishes online post showing Samar Abu Zamar with her husband, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, on the night before October 7 carrying $32,000 handbag IDF spokesperson in Arabic, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, published a post on his X account on Saturday targeting Samar Abu Zamar, the wife of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The tweet claimed she was seen alongside her husband a day before the October 7 massacre carrying a Birkin bag from Hermes worth thousands of dollars. 'Did Sinwar's wife enter the tunnel with him on October 6 carrying a bag estimated to cost around $32,000?! I'll leave the answer to you,' Adraee wrote in the caption of a picture showing Abu Zamar holding the bag inside the tunnel where she and her husband took refuge the night before the massacre, alongside an image of the luxury bag from the company's website. 'While the residents of Gaza lack enough money for tents or basic supplies, we see many examples of Yahya Sinwar and his wife's unique love for money,' he added. To purchase the bag named after actress Jane Birkin, one must contact Hermes, which sells the coveted bags, in order to join a long waiting list. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed on Saturday footage of Sinwar and his family entering a Gaza tunnel before the start of the October 7 attack. 'On the night before the massacre, Sinwar was focused on his own survival and that of his family. In the video, you can see him and his family slipping into an underground bunker beneath their home on October 6, just hours before the attack,' he said. 'For hours, Sinwar and his son are seen moving supplies – food, a flat-screen television, mattresses –keeping the operation secret to minimize exposure,' Hagari added. Abu Zamar was born in Gaza in 1980 and holds a master's degree in religious studies from the Islamic University in the city, where she also worked as a lecturer until her marriage. Sinwar's wife belongs to a well-known and respected tribe among the Palestinians. Her family, the Abu Zamar family, is a religious family known for supporting 'popular resistance' (the Palestinian term for terrorist organizations) and actions against Israel. The family's roots are deeply embedded in the struggle against Israel. According to estimates, all of her family members have been recruited to Hamas, some of them to the terror group’s elite Nukhba unit. Abu Zamar and Sinwar got married on November 21, 2011, less than a month after he was released from Israeli prison as part of the deal to free kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011. Samar was 31 at the time of their wedding, an age considered quite old for marriage among women in Gaza, where the average marriage age for women is 20. Sinwar was 49 at the time, but the 18-year age gap didn’t seem to bother his intended. She understood it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to marry a significant and influential man in Gaza. Sinwar himself mentioned in a previous interview that he wasn't really involved in choosing his wife. 'While I was in the Holy Land (Saudi Arabia) performing the Hajj, my four sisters managed to find me a bride,' he said.

Libyan ISIS supporter planned attack on Israeli embassy in Berlin	Libyan asylum seeker, 28, arrested at his home in Berlin following information from a foreign intelligence service; Israeli ambassador to Germany: 'Further proof that we are on the frontline of the political battlefield' The German newspaper 'Bild' reported Saturday night that a Libyan national was arrested on suspicion of planning an attack on the Israeli embassy in Berlin. Special police forces stormed the house where the suspect lives in the city of Bernau north of Berlin in the state of Brandenburg. Security sources told the newspaper that the suspect, a 28-year-old Libyan national who is identified as an ISIS supporter, allegedly wanted to attack Israel's main diplomatic mission in Germany. It is still unclear if he was armed, and if he had access to weapons or explosives. A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office said information about the planned attack was received from a foreign intelligence service. 'A suspect of membership in a foreign terrorist organization was arrested in Bernau. At the same time, witnesses were questioned in the city of St. Augustine near Bonn,' he said. Israel's ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, said following the young man's arrest: 'Muslim antisemitism has long been not only hateful rhetoric, but has led and encouraged terrorist activities around the world. This is another example of how Israeli embassies are on the frontline of the political battlefield. I wish to congratulate the law enforcement authorities in Germany who work around the clock to ensure the safety of the official representatives of the State of Israel.'

Israel cool to US renewed push for cease-fire after Sinwar's deat...	Biden and other US officials meet to discuss possible efforts to complete a hostage deal, taking advantage of the window of opportunity following the killing of Sinwar; Senior Israeli official: 'No substantial progress in talks until we finish with Iran' U.S. President Joe Biden held a meeting over the weekend on the issue of the Israeli hostages in Gaza and efforts to renew a deal following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The meeting was attended by U.S. officials including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, CIA Director William Burns, Biden's envoy to the Middle East Brett McGurk and others. McGurk spoke with the families of the hostages with U.S. citizenship following the meeting and informed them of the administration's strong determination to reach a 'breakthrough' and make progress in negotiations for a deal to free the hostages. The U.S. sees the elimination of Hamas’ leader as a golden opportunity to renew cease-fire talks and the Biden administration is committed to doing everything possible on this matter despite the political timetable of the November presidential elections. Both the U.S. and Israel are engaging in talks with mediators from Egypt and Qatar, trying to determine if negotiations with Hamas for a deal can continue at this time. Israel has expressed serious concerns about Hamas retaliating against the hostages for Sinwar’s death and has sent strong messages to the terror organization, warning them not to harm the captives. Despite the U.S.’s determination, however, it seems nothing significant will take place until Hamas is clear on its plans for Sinwar’s appointed successor. One option is that a committee of senior officials, rather than a single person, might take over, which could make negotiations for a deal easier. U.S. officials have said an agreement won't be reached if both sides remain firm on their conditions. However, a senior Israeli official claimed there won't be any significant progress or dramatic breakthrough in the hostage deal negotiations until the Israeli retaliation against Iran and its possible fallouts are through, as Sinwar's successors are unlikely to push for a deal before they’re sure a regional war won’t break out. Moving forward, actions could lead to a larger regional arrangement that would also consider the issue of the hostages. Mossad chief David Barnea is leading a proposal that calls for a cease-fire and a political resolution on the northern border to include the hostage issue as a term. Sinwar’s replacement does present an opportunity, as the mediators have openly said his elimination could provide a chance for positive change and facilitate a deal. However, an agreement won't happen until the situation between Israel and Iran is resolved.

US investigates leak of Pentagon documents on Israel’s plans to a...	Pentagon's classified documents were posted publicly online over the weekend and deal with Israel's preparations for an attack against Iran; 'The leak is very worrying,' an American official told CNN, which confirmed the documents are authentic The U.S. has opened an investigation into the leak of the Pentagon's classified documents that deal with Israel's preparations for an attack against Iran, three sources familiar with the details told CNN. One of them also confirmed to the network that the leaked documents are authentic. 'The leak is very worrying,' an American source told CNN. The documents were first published on Telegram, and at the end of the week they were posted online. According to the documents, dated October 15 and October 16, the Israeli Air Force recently conducted exercises and 'rehearsals' in preparation for an attack against Iran. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency (GNA) and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents do not contain details or an overall picture of the targets of the attack, but rather general preparations for a long-range attack by the Air Force, which the intelligence professionals and the Revolutionary Guards Air Force could have assessed for themselves using the basic intelligence they already have. One of the documents states that, according to the analysis of various images, the Air Force conducted exercises with with air-launched ballistic missiles (ALBM), including at least 16 'Golden Horizon' missiles and 40 'Rocks' or ISO2 missiles. The documents also discuss 'covert drone activity' and extensive deployment drills. It also reports on 'secret UAV activity,' and claims that the Air Force conducted a 'second large-scale deployment exercise' between October 15 and 16. The report also states that, during those days, activity related to air-to-surface missiles (ASM) was observed at the Ramat David and Ramon Air Force Bases. Another leaked document, which allegedly contains an analysis by the NGA, reports that the IDF 'probably' also conducted an aerial refueling exercise on October 16, and contained a side note stating Israel's apparent ability to use UAVs in order to gather intelligence in Iran and 'across the region.' A U.S. official said that the investigation will examine who had access to the documents. CNN noted that the procedures state that any such leak immediately leads to an investigation by the FBI, along with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies. This could be a deliberate leak from the Pentagon, perhaps with the aim of fending off criticism from the progressive camp in the Democratic Party of the Biden administration for having no influence on Israel, and to show the American public - and also Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - that the U.S. actually has good control over the details. The leak also lends credibility to the statement Biden made in Berlin, that he has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran.

Military and political moves coordinated as Hezbollah strongholds...	Another reserve brigade goes into action Sunday; Senior IDF official believes that within 'days to weeks' the mission in southern Lebanon will be completed, and notes several positive developments for Israel The IDF is working 'vigorously and quickly' with the aim of finishing the work in the area near the border in southern Lebanon, as well as the plan to attack Hezbollah's fire and command and control arrays 'within days to weeks.' No more. 'We strive for a situation where our planned military closing moves will be conducted in parallel with the progress of the diplomatic processes that will lead to a settlement,' a senior military official told Ynet. The political processes have already begun, and the official noted the following developments, all of which are positive from Israel's point of view: 1. Hezbollah and the Iranians want a cease-fire as soon as possible in order to preserve as much of their remaining capabilities as they can, and so that they can quickly reestablish themselves as a military-political force within Lebanon. 2. In the last few days, there was a rare public gathering of central political leaders and heads of sects in Lebanon: Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, who until recently was coordinating positions with Hezbollah; the leader of the Shiite Amal movement and the Speaker of the Parliament Nabih Berri; and the Sunni prime minister Sunni of Lebanon, Najib Mikati. Everyone called for a cease-fire and a political settlement without mentioning Hezbollah's demands and demands. 3. Mikati even came out publicly against Iran's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, which he would not have done when Hezbollah and Nasrallah were in their usual position of power. On Sunday, an additional reserve brigade is entering southern Lebanon to complete the clearing of the villages and fortified areas where Hezbollah's Radwan force prepared its logistical infrastructure and bases for infiltration into Israel. Every house in the village that had weapons in or under it will be destroyed, the senior military official said, and this will leave a great deal of destruction in the Shiite villages near the border.

IDF soldier succumbs to wounds sustained in southern Lebanon comb...	Sergeant Major (res.) Yishai Netanel Greenbaum critically wounded in battle on October 9; 'The world lost a precious soul today,' his widow Hadas says The IDF reported Saturday night that Sergeant Major (res.) Yishai Netanel Greenbaum, 38, a platoon sergeant in the 288 Brigade's 5030th Battalion, from Lod, has succumbed to wounds sustained in combat in southern Lebanon. Greenbaum was critically wounded on October 9. Earlier, the IDF reported that Staff Sergeant Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and Sergeant Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, both of the 401st Brigade's 52nd Armored Battalion, were killed in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the war, the IDF's death toll has reached 748, with 355 fatalities during the ground operations in Gaza. Greenbaum was also a social worker who specialized in treating trauma-affected soldiers, a role he continued during his reserve service as a combat soldier. In the battle where Greenbaum was wounded, fellow reservist Sergeant Major (res.) Ronny Ganizate was killed. Before the official IDF announcement, Greenbaum’s wife, Hadas, shared the news on social media, writing, 'With a broken and shattered heart, I must announce the passing of my beloved and heroic husband, Yishai Greenbaum. Yishai fell in defense of the homeland he so loved. The world lost a precious soul today. Thank you to the family and all who have supported us with your thoughts and prayers.' In a note reflecting on his reserve duty earlier this year, Greenbaum described balancing his dual roles as platoon sergeant and social worker during 150 days of service. 'Like many other reservists, I was called up on October 7 to serve in a battalion tasked with defensive missions in the north. The tension, the risks and the long days added another undefined role for me,' he wrote. Greenbaum recounted how he switched between military and social work duties, offering both operational leadership and emotional support. 'As a sergeant, I checked on wet gear during rainy nights. As a social worker, I ensured each soldier had a blanket and emphasized that every buddy checks on his friend. After mortar fire, as a sergeant, I led the troops to safety. As a social worker, I provided water and encouraging words to everyone.' He concluded his reflection by noting, 'The period ended, but the war continues. My reserve duty left me thinking about the place of both roles in my life. It seems the whole country needs more of the social worker’s role—strengthening our forces and healing from trauma.' 'An extraordinary individual' The Ramat Gan Hesder Yeshiva, where Greenbaum studied, mourned his death, describing him as having 'fallen a hero in battle in Lebanon.' In a statement, the yeshiva added, 'May we witness the vengeance for the blood of Your servants.' Yeshiva head Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira said, 'Yishai was a leader, both strong and gentle. He was a kind, compassionate person, an amazing father who spent quality time with his family, and a social worker who helped soldiers prepare for hardships. He was both gentle and steadfast, an extraordinary individual. We pray that his sacrifice for the nation will hasten redemption and that his soul will rest near the divine throne.' Lod Mayor Yair Revivo noted that Greenbaum worked in the city's welfare department, saying, 'Yishai loved this land, and his sole desire was to defeat the enemy so that we could live securely in Israel. We embrace his wife, Hadas, and their children, and we will provide any support they need. City staff have been supporting the family since his injury and even more so after his passing.' The Welfare Ministry expressed deep sorrow over Greenbaum's death, saying, 'Yishai was a dedicated social worker in the Lod municipality and a reservist who went to defend the residents of northern Israel and all the citizens of the country. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Hadas, his children, family, colleagues at the social services department, and all who loved him.'

Radwan forces fled and we’re in their houses, destroying them at...	In a vast underground command center, real-time footage tracks IDF operations in Lebanon; while communication systems relay multiple incidents along the border, personnel inside the bunker remain calm and composed A little caption appeared on one of the screens at 12:11 p.m. reading, 'Kiryat Yam, Kiryat Haim and Shmuel, Haifa – Bay.' This was followed by a string of further alerts in Kiryat Motzkin, Kiryat Bialik, Haifa – West, Haifa – Carmel, the Home Front Command sending automated messages online and onto apps. This is a great drama for those suddenly hearing the sirens wailing, quickly getting themselves to shelters and hearing explosion blasts, interceptions and crashes. But here, in the earth’s belly in the Northern Command pit, this is yet one more incident occurring in tandem with several dozen others. The wall facing dozens of people sitting deep within Mount Canaan is covered with a huge screen divided into dozens of squares, with something going on in each square. Remotely manned aircraft escorting the ground forces in Lebanese territory are broadcasting the live, up-to-date picture. Each force has its own aircraft escorting it in the sky, so you can simultaneously view several broadcasts from different battle sites. The digital map displays the forces’ locations and movements, and on the adjacent screen, a real-time update of the evacuation of wounded soldiers from inside Lebanon, bringing them for medical treatment in Israel. What’s going on on the home front, another piece of the puzzle - a piece for which the Home Command is responsible. A few hours later, at one of the crash sites in Kiryat Yam, you realize the huge discrepancy between the calm composure required in the bunker in Safed, a site protected from attack allowing people down there to carry on running the war, and the fear and anxiety that comes with hearing the sirens outside. There’s a little screen in the command pit broadcasting a Hebrew TV channel, the channel switching every few minutes. It’s on mute, and you just see the pictures from the crash site, interviews with dazed residents and the images of the damage and destruction. On another screen, an Israeli Air Force (IAF) aircraft follows a vehicle traveling on a dirt path somewhere in southern Lebanon, driving though orchards, turning left and carrying on straight. And the black and white picture, constantly homing in on it , momentarily making you forget about the drama that very moment in the Haifa Bay. Only when we see the little small shopping center on the corner of Jerusalem and Jabotinsky Boulevards, and with our own eyes, see the torn blinds, shattered windows and air-conditioning units torn off buildings, do we understand what happened here. A rocket that landed on the roof of Birkat Moshe bakery, has torn a hole through a layer of concrete and iron bars. Dozens of windows are shattered, and air-conditioning units torn off three buildings above the shopping center. The bakery owner, Eliran Assouline, says that he heard three consecutive sirens. 'Our safe room is at the back, inside the kitchen. We all got in. As soon as the sirens stopped, instead of waiting for ten minutes, I went out to check, and then I heard a huge explosion followed by a blast and I was hurled into the air.' Meir Ohayon, who owns the Beshem Ha’omanut tattoo parlor, a smiley guy with Rastafarian locks and a big tattoo of Salvador Dali on his arm, saw Assouline go flying. 'What’s that flying? I saw him hit by the biggest blast ever. He was like a meter into the air and two meters back. Like in the movies, he left the ground and went flying. I was just running to the shelter when the missile hit the roof and there was a massive explosion. Everything went black, the concrete went flying, bits of plaster were flying around. There was loads of smoke. It was crazy I tell you.' Haka's hill Not far from the pit, stands a battered old Willys jeep that served Maj. Gen, Yitzhak (Haka) Hofi, commander of the Northern Command in the Yom Kippur War. The base commander was then stationed in the fortress building in Nazareth (which now serves as the police’s northern HQ), too far away from the IDF’s battles staving off Syria’s surprise invasion of the Golan Heights. Back then, there weren’t any LED screens or planes remotely controlled from a hundred miles away from the front, broadcasting pictures of the war. Hofi had to jump into the jeep and find a position from which he could see the Golan Heights, and manage the front from there. Mt. Canaan above Safed was the perfect spot. Brig. Gen. (res.) Shuki Shahrur, 67, was only a 16-year-old boy at the time, but later enlisted and advanced in the army, serving as an operations officer, staff wing officer and the Northern Command’s chief of staff. In the past 20 years, he’s spent more time at the command base in Safed than at home. Following the 1973 war, it was decided to transfer the command headquarters from Nazareth to Mt. Canaan,' he says. 'I watched all the work setting up the command pit. They dug deep down into the mountain, and inserted kilometers of electric cables, air and water pipes. They started in 1979 and finished 11 years later. I had the honor of being the first to operate the pit as the command’s operations officer. Knowing this pit extremely well, I can say that it’s constantly undergoing the most advanced technological adjustments.' 'Down there, there’s a dining room, a gym, a clinic, a synagogue and barracks. These are huge spaces, interconnected by corridors and in the central areas, you can see the side of the mountain into which this the complex was dug. There are independent energy centers allowing for command continuity if, Heaven forbid, the whole business above ground is out of use.' None of this guarantees anything, certainly not winning the war. Impressive as this place might be, it’s a merely a technical matter allowing for ongoing management of this long war, with no end in sight. Almost all of the Hezbollah leadership has been assassinated. Radwan, Hezbollah's offensive force, has been severely hit, and the IDF is attacking from the air in Beirut and Bekaa, and on the ground in Lebanon. Four divisions have been assigned to the limited ground operation in southern Lebanon - a huge force of 11 brigades including six reservist brigades. And still, when we went down into the pit, sirens were sounding across the Galilee. Hezbollah is keeping up its missile and rocket firing capabilities, averaging 200 launches per day, enough to completely disrupt daily life. Fighter jets on standby We were asked to wait in a side room. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was just arriving for a visit. He sat down in front of a wall of screens, waited for his team to set up a camera who then filmed a video clip, later disseminated to all news outlets. 'Hezbollah is an organization with no head,' he said as those present watched the screens. 'Nasrallah has been assassinated, probably his successor too. A year into the war, and Hamas has been taken apart, Hezbollah a battered organization.' Two hours later, over 100 rockets were launched at Haifa and the bay area. But at the end of the day, when we put aside these boisterous statements, the technology and this impressive installation, we’re left with people. People keeping up a calm professional atmosphere, even with a firestorm raging outside. When one of the forces encounters a Hezbollah cell in a village in Lebanon, Lt. Col. Yuval Mazuz, the command’s operations officer, oversees managing the incident. We have two terrorists killed, and two of our forces wounded, requiring immediate evacuation. 'Immediate evacuation' means that the injury’s severity is moderate and up. A tank covers the evacuation while a remotely controlled aircraft covers all of this from the air. There’s also a combat helicopter not far, in case they need to launch a missile, and at the upper level there’s also a fighter jet ready to drop heavier munitions. Mazuz assumed the position in July 2023. Just before going down into the command pit in Safed, he passed the command baton for the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion onto his colleague, the late Lt. Col. Tomer Greenberg. 'Passing over the role between two battalion commanders is a very intimate matter' he says. 'You sit down with your successor for hours on end, sharing commitments about personnel scheduling, dilemmas and your experiences commanding the battalion. We had plenty of meetings talking about the complexities around family life, about how you’re hardly home.' Then came October 7. The war caught the 13th Battalion in operations in the Gaza border region, where the Nahal Oz outpost is located. The battalion lost 41 officers and soldiers in Hamas’ surprise attack and the battles they fought reconquering the outposts and communities. The battalion wasn’t broken, and Greenberg prepared it for ground operations inside Gaza. Greenberg was killed in Shijaiyah just before 6 p.m. on December 12. Nine more officers and soldiers fell alongside Greenberg, including two company commanders from the brigade. At the time, Mazuz was in the command pit in the north in consultations with the general. 'I left my phone above, so I couldn’t be contacted. It then turned out that the brigade had been trying to get hold of me. They also called my wife to find me and she sent me loads of WhatsApp messages for me to get back to her,' he said. Mazuz was in Gaza by midnight of that day. His temporary appointment as company battalion carried into two and a half months, in which time he fought in Shijaiyah and the refugee camps in central Gaza. When appointed as permanent battalion commander after Greenberg was killed, he asked to focus on the fighting in Lebanon. 'This is what I’m dealing with right now' he says. 'Defeating our enemy.' Thirty seconds to get to a shelter As these lines are written, the north is still being bombarded. A little after one o’clock in the afternoon, sirens are again sounding in Haifa and the bay area. Shortly thereafter, the IDF spokesperson announced that two civilians were killed by a rocket in Kiryat Shmona. The command base has also been struck. Last February, a rocket hit the base, killing lookout Staff Sgt. Omer Benjo. There were almost daily sirens in Safed. The city itself is of no interest to Hezbollah. Their target is the command center. Improbable as it may sound, despite the city being targeted in the Second Lebanon War by Hezbollah’s efforts to hit the Northern Command base, Safed is not prepared for rocket fire, and most of the homes do not have safe rooms. 'If you’d have told me before that this is how much Hezbollah manages to fire, while the IDF is conducting ground operations in its territory, killing its men and severely damaging its infrastructure, commanders and arsenals, I’d have said you were on drugs.' Yitav Haddad, whose home is on the command fence on Netz Street, lives in a home with a wife, three children and no safe room. The neighborhood bomb shelter is over 30 seconds’ run away with three toddlers. 'We live over the pit,' he says, pointing at the home’s floor. 'No one thought to protect us. The Home Front Command toured the neighborhood and one of the officers said that we deserve three mobile shelters. That was over a month ago. As you see, this road hasn’t been given even one mobile shelter. I invite you to come stay with us and wait for the siren. Maybe a rocket or fragments from an interception will crash down, and then you’ll feel how our house shakes, nearly falling down from the force of the blasts.' Mazuz explains about proportion. 'I’m not playing down 200 rockets fired a day. This is clearly serious, and we can’t reconcile ourselves to it. But we must remember what the predictions were for a war with Hezbollah. Our estimates were for much more massive, broader and deeper fire. If you’d have told me before that this is how much Hezbollah manages to fire, while the IDF is conducting ground operations in its territory, killing its men and severely damaging its infrastructure, commanders and arsenals, I’d have said you were on drugs.' Maj. Gen (res.) Annan Abbas, control wing chief in the command pit, wants us to take some air for a moment. We met him after he’d finished managing an incident in which a Hezbollah drone hit a border outpost in the Margaliot sector, injuring four soldiers. 'Listen, carefully,' he says. 'I live the area. I was born and raised here and, as a local, I know how much the residents by the border area are afraid of Hezbollah’s capabilities. Whenever the army sends up flares suspecting an infiltration, the local people panic. Every incident on the fence makes the local people panic. The Radwan Force has put out propaganda videos, done stunts on motorbikes and threatened to conquer the Galilee. In practice, the very opposite has happened. Radwan forces fled, retreated from the confrontation line and we’re in their houses, destroying them at every altercation.' 'Commander, this is Dad' Abbas certainly is a character. The guy’s a Sphynx. He sits at the central post in the pit with special sports glasses protecting his left eye, injured during his service in the Druze Special Forces. Not a muscle in his face moved as the communication systems simultaneously relayed a series of different dramatic incidents in various sectors along the border fence. He's 51, from Peki'in. His wife, Layla, is the village high school’s prinicpal. Their eldest son, Gideon, was a squad commander in the elite Egoz Unit and was discharged following a severe training injury. He has since been serving as a reservist with his father in the command pit. His middle son Jamal served commanding the Paratroopers’ 101st Battalion’s 3rd company. He’s an impressive, good-looking guy. His father proudly shows me pictures on his phone. On the eve of the war, Jamal surprised his family, coming home for short leave. He went out with his friends to Tiberias on Friday night and stayed over to sleep at one of their homes. The following day, when Hamas took Israel by surprise on the Gaza border, Annan, the father, quickly donned his uniform and rushed to the command pit in the north. 'That’s my go-to response in an emergency,' he says. 'Putting on my uniform, and going down to my post in the command pit.' He didn’t get a chance to see his son come home, pack his bags and rush down south where he joined the battles fighting Hamas terrorists. Just before he set out, the young, 17-year-old daughter, Mirelle photographed him. Standing at the doorway, she caught him arranging his bag on his back. He’s already got his gun on him. The mother, with her back to the camera, is watching him get ready. Moments later he was in his car and off. Three weeks later, the evening before going into Gaza, on October 29, Jamal called his father. 'It was 1:30 a.m. I’d just come back from the command center,' the father says. 'Jamal sounded excited. He said they were about to go in, and that he’s sending a message to the soldiers’ parents telling them this is a just war, and that he’ll do everything to protect their children, his soldiers. He told me something that rings is my head to this day. 'Dad, this is an existential war for the country, and in existential wars people get killed, and maybe I won’t return from this war. And if I don’t come back, you must be proud of me.' I’m having this conversation at 1:30 a.m. after a long day in the pit. 'I answered. 'Forget your nonsense. Take care of yourself and of your soldiers. There are a lot of tunnels beneath your feet in Gaza. Don’t be reckless,' I said to him. 'Don’t be reckless' because I know him. He had no fear. My boy was a galloping horse, a spirited fighter. He calmly answered, 'Dad, I understand the situation. I have a D9 and I have tanks. I have dogs and I have the Air Force. We’ll do everything slowly. I’ve promised their parents to bring their children back healthy and in one piece.' The days passed, and reports of the bitter battles in the Gaza Strip at the start of the ground operations wracked the father’s nerves. He tried getting hold of Jamal on Vered Harim, the IDF’s encrypted phone, but he wasn’t answering. He tried contacting his son’s command post by walkie-talkie – to no avail. They made contact on November 15, Wednesday evening. 'I was just about to leave the pit for home with my son Gideon, and two guys suddenly call me. ‘Hang on, one minute, we’ve got a surprise for you. You’re now going to talk to Jamal on the walkie-talkie.’ He was in some hole in Gaza and we were in a bunker underneath Safed. The conversation was published a few days later, by which time the family was in mourning. Annan: 'Commander, this is Dad.' Jamal: 'Continue.' Annan: 'Dad and Gideon send you their love. You are the fighters’ spearhead. Take care of yourselves. Strike Hamas. Destroy them. Fight fiercely, and wisely. Respond faster than the enemy. Stay there inside as long as it takes, until victory. We miss you and love you very much. Come back in peace. We, the Northern Command and your family, support you. Look after yourselves. Come back in peace. We’ll see you.' Jamal: 'Thank you very much.' Annan: 'Thank you, thank you. Take care of yourself. We’ll be in touch.' Jamal: 'No problem, dear father.' Three days passed and, on Saturday, during a shift in the pit, the Northern Command chief Ori Gordin’s secretary came in and asked him to accompany her. 'I was in my spot,' he says, pointing at his post in the pit – the control officer’s position. 'She comes in and says to me, ‘The general wants you to go up to his office.' It’s one floor above us, here in the pit. She said he wanted to consult with me. ‘I don’t know what it’s about.’ When I went into his room, he immediately got up, came up to me and hugged me saying, ‘I’m sorry to tell you that Jamal was killed in clashes in Sheikh Ijlin in Gaza.’' We stood at his position in the pit in silence. What’s left to say in such a situation? The screen was displaying a big slide reading 'situation picture.' A tear drew out of his healthy eye. The screen to the side read '12:45 – Kiryat Bialik Industrial Zone.'

IDF releases footage of Sinwar slipping into tunnel before Octobe...	Clip shows Hamas leader and family transporting supplies into tunnel before attack on southern Israel; 'Hamas leaders prioritize their own survival over the lives of Gaza’s residents,' Hagari says The IDF on Saturday released video footage showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar the night before the October 7 massacre, carrying supplies to a hideout. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed new details about the pursuit of Sinwar, who was killed last Wednesday, including how close he was to Israeli hostages during the manhunt. 'This evening, we are sharing footage from the IDF and Shin Bet’s pursuit of Yahya Sinwar,' Hagari said. 'We tracked his actions in the hours leading up to the massacre to understand his escape route. On the night before the massacre, Sinwar was focused on his own survival and that of his family. In the video, you can see him and his family slipping into an underground bunker beneath their home on October 6, just hours before the attack. For hours, Sinwar and his son are seen moving supplies—food, a flat-screen television, mattresses—keeping the operation secret to minimize exposure.' Sinwar, Hagari said, had constructed an underground fortress in Khan Younis, where he hid and directed the attack. 'In February, IDF forces entered Khan Younis and located the path where he had been hiding. We found an underground complex with living quarters, showers, beds, safes and uniforms. Several times, our forces were just moments away from catching him.' The hideout was fully equipped, with televisions, food, sofas and communication devices. 'We knew he had been there because we found his DNA on a tissue he used,' Hagari said, adding that the hideout was just a few hundred yards from the tunnel where six hostages were executed in late August. 'Sinwar spent most of his time underground between Khan Younis and Rafah, only emerging to flee.' Hagari also provided details on Sinwar’s final moments. 'IDF and Shin Bet forces continued their operations above and below ground to capture Sinwar until he made a mistake. In the incident last Wednesday, forces engaged terrorists, who began fleeing to two nearby buildings. Sinwar escaped alone into one of them. Our forces fired at the building you see in the footage. This was the first time Sinwar, who had been hiding underground for a year, faced Israeli forces—and it was the moment he was killed.' The operation marked the conclusion of a relentless pursuit of Sinwar, whom Hagari described as the architect of the brutal October 7 massacre. 'Tonight’s revelations once again demonstrate that Hamas leaders, wherever they are, prioritize their own survival over the lives of Gaza’s residents. Sinwar was a wanted terrorist who hid while war raged around him.' When asked if Sinwar's death improved conditions for a potential hostage deal, Hagari said, 'Our mission is to create the conditions for the hostages’ return. There’s no doubt that Sinwar’s elimination aids that goal.' Regarding Israel's objectives in Gaza and humanitarian aid distribution, Hagari added, 'We operate under political directives, including facilitating the entry of 250 trucks into Gaza, and we will continue as instructed.'

Driver killed by Hezbollah rocket near Acre identified as Alexei ...	Victim, 50, reportedly pulled his car to the side of the road and was critically injured by shrapnel to his upper body; his passenger, who ducked and shielded his head, sustained only minor injuries The driver killed on saturday by Hezbollah rocket shrapnel on Highway 22 near Acre has been identified as Alexei Popov, 50, from Kiryat Haim. Popov sustained injuries to his upper body, while a friend traveling with him in the car was lightly injured. Hours after the incident, police officers arrived at Popov’s home to notify his wife of his death. A family friend noted that Popov had no other relatives in Israel, and his two children live in Ukraine. Neighbors told Ynet that Popov had been returning from grocery shopping when he was killed. 'I heard screams and crying from their apartment upstairs and realized they had informed his wife of his death,' said Maria, a neighbor. 'They were a wonderful couple, always together. She had recently traveled to Ukraine to visit her new grandchild, and he missed her terribly, waiting for her to return.' Popov was pronounced dead at the scene. 'We arrived and saw a car on the side of the road, heavily damaged by shrapnel. The windows were shattered, and nearby stores were also damaged,' Magen David Adom paramedic Alex Motskin said. According to the paramedic, Popov's friend recounted that they had pulled over when the siren sounded, but the explosion occurred before Popov could exit the vehicle. 'The passenger ducked down and shielded his head. He emerged from the car fully conscious, with a minor shrapnel wound near his ear. Unfortunately, the driver was critically injured in the upper body, and we pronounced him dead shortly after.'

US wants to see Israel scale back some of Beirut strikes, Austin ...	The United States would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Saturday. 'The number of civilian casualties have been far too high,' he told reporters at a G7 defense gathering in the Italian city of Naples. 'We'd like to see Israel scale back on some of the strikes it's taking, especially in and around Beirut, and we'd like to see things transition to some sort of negotiation that will allow civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes.' Tens of thousands of people have fled Beirut's southern suburbs - once a densely populated zone that also housed Hezbollah offices and underground installations - since Israel began regularly targeting the zone approximately three weeks ago. On Saturday afternoon, Israel carried out heavy strikes on several locations in the city's southern suburbs, leaving thick plumes of smoke wafting over the city horizon throughout the evening. The strikes came as Hezbollah fired salvos of rockets at northern Israel, with one drone directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's holiday home, his spokesman said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sy5wm0011eyl	2024-10-19T10:58:15-07:00

This will not stop me or Israel from continuing our fight for security,' PM says; property damage assessors evaluate damage at Netanyahu's residence following drone strike Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran-backed forces of attempting to assassinate him and his wife Sara after a drone launched from Lebanon targeted his private residence in Caesarea on Saturday. 'Iran's proxies who tried to assassinate me and my wife today made a grave mistake,' Netanyahu said. He vowed that the incident would not deter Israel from its mission. 'This will not stop me or Israel from continuing our fight for security,' he said. 'I say to Iran and its partners in the axis of evil: anyone who harms Israeli citizens will pay a heavy price. We will continue to eliminate your terrorists, bring our captives home from Gaza, and secure the north. We will achieve our war objectives and change the security reality for generations. Together we fight, and with God's help, together we will win.' A preliminary investigation revealed that the helicopter that detected the drone failed to identify it, leading to sirens being activated only in military areas and not in Caesarea. The drone, which was recorded on social media, struck a building near Netanyahu's home. Following the strike, security forces, bomb squads and emergency teams rushed to the scene, including property damage assessors from the Israel Tax Authority. Hezbollah launched three drones toward Netanyahu's residence, with two intercepted. The third was not detected until it hit the building, without triggering alarms. Netanyahu and his family were not at the residence at the time, and according to his office, the prime minister had not been there for the past week. However, neighbors reported seeing a convoy leaving the compound earlier in the day.

IDF names 2 soldiers killed in battle in northern Gaza	SST. Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and SGT. Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, both of the 401st Brigade's 52nd Armored Battalion, fell fighting in Jabaliya; IDF death toll in war reaches 747 The IDF reported on Saturday evening that Staff Sergeant Ofir Berkovich, 20, from Modi'in Maccabim Reut, and Sergeant Elishai Young, 19, from Dimona, both of the 401st Brigade's 52nd Armored Battalion, were killed in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. Another 52nd Battalion officer was seriously wounded in the same incident. Additionally, another officer from the 53rd Battalion of the 188th Brigade was seriously wounded earlier Saturday by a drone strike in northern Israel. Since the beginning of the war, the IDF's death toll has reached 747, with 355 fatalities during the ground operations in Gaza. The IDF's ground campaign in Jabaliya is ongoing, as part of efforts to prevent Hamas from regrouping. IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee shared footage of Gazan civilians evacuating the Jabaliya area, attributing the exodus to the 'breaking of the fear barrier of Yahya Sinwar,' the elusive Hamas leader eliminated by Israeli forces on Thursday. He said that 'hundreds of civilians have begun to evacuate, with the IDF ensuring their safe passage through designated routes.' Adraee also reported the capture of several terrorists in the area, some of whom were found with weapons magazines, while one carried a letter expressing his desire to die as a martyr. Reuters reported on Saturday that Israel has 'tightened the siege' around hospitals in Jabaliya. Local residents and medical sources claimed that Israeli forces were 'bombarding homes and blocking the entry of medical and food supplies.' Earlier, the IDF announced that Givati Brigade combat teams had joined the 162nd Division in operations in the Jabaliya area. According to the IDF, division forces eliminated several terrorists in close-quarters combat, with the support of air force strikes. In central Gaza, the 252nd Division directed airstrikes that destroyed military sites used by Hamas for sniper attacks and the placement of explosives. In Rafah, Nahal Brigade combat teams, under Gaza Division command, eliminated two terrorist cells threatening Israeli forces. Additionally, IDF units from the Bislach Brigade combat team engaged and killed armed terrorists during an exchange of fire.

Hezbollah leadership filled with unknown figures, report says	Israeli official tells New York Times terror group promoted lower-ranking operatives to lead new command center coordinating rocket and drone attacks; IDF resumes strikes in Beirut’s Dahieh, destroys Radwan force underground base Hezbollah has replenished its ranks of commanders and key leadership positions with operatives whose names were previously unknown to Israel, an Israeli official told The New York Times on Saturday. In an in-depth report, the official explained that these individuals were once lower-level commanders, which has allowed Hezbollah to continue fighting Israel despite heavy losses. The Lebanese terrorist group, which has faced a series of major blows since September, scored notable successes this week, including a deadly drone strike on a Golani Brigade training base, the launch of a drone toward the residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea and the killing of five Golani soldiers in southern Lebanon. The group also carried out rocket barrages on the Haifa area, resulting in one civilian death. Another incident involved an attempt to abduct an IDF commando, highlighting Hezbollah’s gradual recovery on the battlefield. While these actions fall short of Israel's pre-war expectations, they signal a troubling shift after Hezbollah's diminished capabilities in recent months. According to a Reuters report last week, Hezbollah is preparing for a protracted war of attrition in southern Lebanon. The group's military leadership has been nearly wiped out, but a new command structure has taken over, directing rocket fire and combat operations. Sources within Hezbollah also told Reuters that the group still possesses a significant stockpile of weapons, including precision-guided missiles that have yet to be deployed. Western diplomats have expressed concern that Israel’s limited operation in Lebanon may escalate into a prolonged war, urging Israel to leverage its successes to secure a deal that distances Hezbollah from the border. Following the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's Dahieh district, Hezbollah established a new operations center within 72 hours, enabling terrorists in southern Lebanon to continue rocket launches and combat under direct orders. A Hezbollah field commander said the group’s fighters are acting 'according to front-line capabilities,' with the new leadership operating in complete secrecy. The commander described the current command structure as a 'small circle' with direct contact with the battlefield. In response to Hezbollah's actions, the IDF resumed airstrikes on Beirut’s Dahieh district on Saturday, marking the first strikes since Wednesday, after a six-day halt reportedly at the request of U.S. President Joe Biden. The attacks followed evacuation warnings issued to certain buildings, with extensive damage reported. The IDF also targeted the previously untouched town of Jounieh, north of Beirut, where a strike on a vehicle killed two people, one of whom was identified by Arab media as a 'military commander in Hezbollah intelligence.' Since the Israeli ground operation in southern Lebanon began, IDF forces have cleared several villages, engaging Hezbollah terrorists in close combat. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi estimates that approximately 1,500 Hezbollah fighters have been killed so far, describing the figure as a 'conservative estimate.' The IDF also announced on Saturday that it destroyed a central underground command post of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force using over 100 tons of explosives. The operation involved 8th Brigade forces and the Combat Engineering Corps' elite Yahalom Unit. The facility contained weapons storage, living quarters and other resources for prolonged occupation. 'We stand on the ruins of a Hezbollah tunnel that was intended for an attack on Galilee communities,' Galilee Division Commander Brig. Gen. Shai Klaper said after the operation.' 'The 8th Division, 91st Division and the Yahalom Unit did outstanding work here, leaving no trace of the tunnel. This area is completely devastated. In the nearby village, which has been transformed into a military stronghold, it is now uninhabitable. Wherever Hezbollah attempts this, we will destroy them to the end.' Thousands of rockets and more than 1,000 drones According to Ynet military correspondent Ron Ben-Yishai, Hezbollah still retains a significant arsenal of thousands of short- and medium-range rockets and missiles, including precision-guided ones, posing a persistent threat to Israel. However, the group may feel it is nearing the limit of what it can achieve through these means. In contrast, the potential of explosive-laden drones—essentially small cruise missiles—remains largely untapped. While Hezbollah has spoken about deploying 'drone swarms,' it has yet to launch more than five drones simultaneously against a single target. We can expect Hezbollah to ramp up its use of explosive drones, as they are harder to detect and intercept when flying low over the terrain, and they offer greater precision. Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea is a relatively easy target for Hezbollah, given its known and publicized location. A drone flying low over the sea from Lebanon could potentially reach it without being detected, and even if spotted, it would be difficult to intercept. In Saturday morning's attack, Hezbollah’s drone operators were accurate in their planning, but fortunately, the drones did not hit or come close to Netanyahu’s family, who were not at their Caesarea home at the time. This wasn't a matter of luck but rather a reflection of Hezbollah’s operators and intelligence failing to execute effectively. Given Hezbollah’s capacity to learn and adapt, we must be better prepared for the next attempt. This incident also highlighted a new phenomenon: sirens in certain areas without simultaneous alerts from the Home Front Command app. This is part of a new policy aimed at addressing the increased use of drones by Hezbollah, as well as by Shia militias from Iraq and Syria. The policy involves issuing warnings in areas with potential military or civilian targets even if the drones pose no immediate danger but might follow a projected flight path toward these locations. This shift came after the deadly strike on the Golani base, where the drone evaded interception attempts by planes, helicopters and Iron Dome systems. The downside of this policy is the increased frequency of alerts, which forces residents in affected areas to seek shelter more often. On the bright side, there are promising developments in the pipeline for better detection, interception and the ability to strike drones at their launch sites.

Memory as his weapon: The inspiring story of Matan, blinded in Ga...	A year after losing his sight from critical injuries near Gaza, Matan Levy fulfilled his dream of becoming a lawyer; now interning at the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office, he says, 'I can’t fight on the battlefield, so I fight crime in the courtroom' This is the remarkable story of Matan Levy, an IDF soldier who lost his sight but refused to give up. Today, he is fulfilling his dream of serving his country as a legal intern at the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office. On the morning of October 7, Levy, from the town of Oranit in central Israel, received a call from his reserve unit, the 5th Brigade’s 8111st Battalion, instructing him to report immediately to the Gaza border. At the time, Levy was completing an internship at a private law firm, having recently finished his law degree. But in the Gaza border region, his life changed forever. 'We were tasked with clearing the area of terrorists,' he recalled. 'There were tough encounters and intense events. After a few days, we transitioned to providing security for the artillery and tank units preparing for the ground offensive.' On October 14, while stationed near Kibbutz Nirim, a mortar barrage launched from Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun hit his unit. 'I was critically wounded, and my friend, Israeli hero Omer Bitan, was killed by the mortar,' Levy recalled. For two weeks, Levy lay in the ICU at Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Shva, hovering between life and death. 'After two weeks in a coma, I woke up and quickly realized I was blind,' he said. 'But the pain was so intense that I didn't focus on the blindness. The pain was so severe that I can't even describe it—it terrified me.' Levy underwent extensive rehabilitation at Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, spending nine months in the hospital. As the pain subsided, he began to process the reality of his blindness. 'I had to relearn everything—how to walk, how to navigate a world I couldn't see. Simple daily tasks became monumental challenges. It's a difficulty someone who can see wouldn't understand.' Despite his ordeal, Levy was determined not to give up on his dream of becoming a lawyer. 'During my rehabilitation, I decided I would continue to fight for the country, and I wanted to do my legal internship at the State Attorney's Office.' The matter reached the state attorney himself, who requested the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office (Criminal Division) to consider his candidacy. Levy was invited for an interview, preparing for it while still in rehab. 'It was the first time I dealt with legal materials without being able to see them, thanks to my amazing brother, who continues to help me.' 'While others can read through the material multiple times, I rely on my memory. My assistants read the material to me once or twice, and I memorize it.' Levy’s family—his parents and brother—were devastated by his blindness, but his mother, who had immigrated to Israel from Argentina for Zionist reasons, was a pillar of strength. 'My family was crushed, but my mother, a true lioness, reminded us all that nothing is stronger than life itself. The fact that I survived is a miracle, and that message stuck with me,' he said. His persistence paid off. He was accepted into the office and joined a team dealing with serious crime under Attorney Assaf Shavit and his mentor, Attorney Simi Yafit Deri. Levy is the first blind legal intern at the State Attorney’s Office, which equipped him with special software and provided two National Service assistants to help him. Daphna Vaknish, the head of interns at the Tel Aviv District Attorney's Office, emphasized that Levy was accepted based on merit. 'He is treated like any other intern, required to meet the same targets, and he does so successfully.' 'Judges are amazed when Matan argues on behalf of the state and demonstrates his full command of the material,' Attorney Deri praised Levy's work. 'For example, we appeared in 23 different hearings before the parole board, and Matan handled it all flawlessly from memory, overcoming the challenges of working without written documents. He inspires everyone at the office.' Levy's work requires deep familiarity with complex legal documents, which he manages by listening to them rather than reading. 'While others can read through the material multiple times, I rely on my memory. My assistants, Yair and Ben, read the material to me once or twice, and I memorize it. I write legal opinions, argue in court, and appear before parole boards, handling everything like any other prosecutor,' he says. 'Most of my cases are in district courts. I feel like I’m living my dream. I can’t fight on the battlefield in Gaza or the north, but I’m fighting serious crime for the country in the courtroom. No terrorist can diminish my motivation or take away my smile.' October 14 marked the anniversary of Levy's injury. 'For me, it’s not the day I was wounded—it’s the day I survived. As long as I’m alive, I live with my head held high. I’ve decided to live a full and meaningful life despite my blindness. During my recovery, I met my partner, who is now both my eyes and my heart. Life is a blessing, and every moment is a gift.'

Fallen warrior? Gaza’s heroic portrayal of Sinwar's death	Though IDF reports Hamas leader hid, fled and killed by Israeli forces, Gazans portray him as a hero; in resurfaced video, Sinwar declares, 'I prefer to die as a martyr than die ‘just because' While Israel celebrated the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, with international headlines labeling him a 'rat in a hole,' many in Gaza are hailing him as a hero. Footage of his final moments, where he appears masked, wounded and covered in soot has reinforced the narrative in Gaza that he 'fought until the very end.' Hours after the official announcement of his death, a video of Sinwar circulated in Gaza. In the footage, filmed during a 2021 interview, Sinwar said, 'The greatest gift the occupation can give me is to murder me.' He added, 'I would rather die as a martyr than from COVID, a stroke or a car accident. At this age (then 59), I am closer to that promise. I prefer to die a martyr rather than die ‘just because.’' Footage revealed by IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari showed Sinwar in his final moments, sitting alone in a corner of a room, covered in soot. The drone footage that captured him showed Sinwar holding a stick, which he weakly attempted to throw at the drone in an unsuccessful effort to bring it down. He did not return fire and likely realized his death was imminent. Unlike the meticulously planned assassinations of figures like Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif or Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah over the war, Sinwar's death occurred by chance, following a prolonged search in the area. 'Sinwar was hiding in an area our forces had surrounded for a long time. We didn’t know he was there, but we continued to act decisively. Our forces found Sinwar with a vest, a pistol and 40,000 shekels in cash. He tried to flee, and our forces eliminated him,' the IDF said. Despite his death, Gazan media quickly spread AI-generated images and cartoons portraying Sinwar in a heroic light. One image shows him leaning on the same stick he had thrown at the drone, accompanied by the caption, 'Defending the entire world to eradicate Zionist terrorism.' Another image, showing him standing with a vest and firing a weapon that was not in his possession at the time, depicts the gunshot wound on his head as only a small cut. Another cartoon depicted the chair Sinwar sat on in a famous image taken after the 2014 Operation Guardian of the Walls. While Sinwar himself is absent from the cartoon, the gun he held in the original photo remains on the chair, symbolically waiting for his successor, reinforcing the notion that 'leaders change, but the idea remains.' Conversely, another cartoon highlighted Iran's loss following Sinwar’s death, depicting him as a puppet whose strings had been cut, signaling that Iran may no longer control Gaza as before. Additionally, a photo of Sinwar from his release during the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange was recirculated. Gazan photographer Khaled al-Safi, who captured the image at the Rafah crossing, wrote, 'That was his reunion with freedom, and today was his reunion with martyrdom. You were blessed with life and became a sacred martyr.' Meanwhile, Hamas senior official Mahmoud Mardawi, perhaps in an effort to maintain the narrative of Sinwar as a 'heroic leader,' said that selecting a successor 'will not take long, it’s a natural process.' He also emphasized that 'our conditions for cease-fire negotiations will not change after Sinwar’s death,' further suggesting that 'the idea remains.'

Turkey says Israel pushing Iran to take 'Legitimate Steps'	Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan speeking in Istanbul during a visit of his Iranian counterpart says Israel is opening new fronts and drawing Iran into the war Israel's attacks in Lebanon and Gaza are pushing Iran to take 'legitimate steps', Turkey's foreign minister said Saturday in a joint press conference in Istanbul with his Iranian counterpart. 'Israel's aggressive stance is forcing Iran to take legitimate steps,' Turkey's Hakan Fidan said alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was 'constantly opening new fronts in the region' and 'trying to draw Iran into this war,' he said. 'The risk of war spreading to the entire region should not be underestimated.' Iran backs the Hamas terror group in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, whose top leaders have been killed by Israel in the widening Middle East crisis. Iran also backs Houthi rebels in Yemen and Shiite militias in Iraq, as well as Syria's armed forces. Tehran collectively calls these proxies and militias an 'axis of resistance' against Israel. On October 1, Iran launched a barrage of around 200 missiles in retaliation for the September 27 killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and the July 31 killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel, which has vowed to strike back at Iran for that barrage, on Wednesday in Gaza killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7 massacre that triggered the current war and escalating regional crisis. Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) have warned they would hit Israel 'painfully' if it attacks Iranian targets. Iran hosted naval drills on Saturday, with the participation of Russia and Oman and observed by nine other countries began in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, Iran's state TV said. The exercises, dubbed 'IMEX 2024', are aimed at boosting 'collective security in the region, expand multilateral cooperation, and display the goodwill and capabilities to safeguard peace, friendship and maritime security', the English-language Press TV said. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, said anyone with information on Israel's pending strike on Iran is accountable. 'Anybody with knowledge or understanding of 'how and when Israel was going to attack Iran', and/or providing the means and backing for such folly, should logically be held accountable for any possible causality,' he said in a post on X referring to the U.S. after President Joe Biden said he has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran. He declined to elaborate.

Some Lebanese Americans endorse Harris, expect more Lebanon suppo...	In a letter, the signatories write they were reassured that their concerns about the violence in Lebanon and the need for economic and political reforms would be supported if Harris won the elections; Trump avoids any specifics about plans for the Middle East Some prominent Lebanese Americans on Friday endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for president, saying in a letter that the U.S. had been 'unrelenting' in its support for Lebanon under the Biden administration and they expect additional backing if Harris wins in November. Signatories include former members of Congress Donna Shalala and Toby Moffett, former President Barack Obama's onetime transportation secretary Ray LaHood, academics, CEOs and investors. The endorsement came amid ongoing Israeli attacks on Lebanon. According to the Lebanese health ministry, more than 1.2 million people have been displaced. The Hezbollah terror group has also fired on Israel killing soldiers and civilians. On Saturday, over 150 rockets targeted Israel, killing at least one man and wounding others. A number of Arab Americans and Muslims are abandoning the Democratic Party over the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war with Hamas. Some Arab Americans and Muslims have declined to endorse Harris, while others are backing her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, or third-party candidate Jill Stein of the Green Party. The letter was organized by Ed Gabriel, president of the American Task Force on Lebanon, a Washington policy group, in his personal capacity. Gabriel is one of several Arab American and Muslim leaders who met with Harris when she visited Flint, Michigan, on Oct. 4. The signers wrote they had been reassured that their concerns about the violence in Lebanon and the need for economic and political reforms would be supported if Harris won the Nov. 5 election. Her views stood in 'stark' contrast to Trump, they wrote, without elaboration. 'This year has been very difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon.' Harris said on a visit to Michigan, home to the largest Arab American community in the United States. She said the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar 'can and must be a turning point.' 'Everyone must seize this opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, bring the hostages home and end the suffering once and for all,' she said. Trump's campaign had no immediate comment, but a source close to the campaign said it planned more outreach events in Michigan next week. Trump also stopped by a campaign headquarters in Hamtramck, a suburb of Detroit, on Friday. Trump, meanwhile, avoided any specifics about his plans for the Middle East, but he said he didn’t think the Arab American community would vote for Harris 'because she doesn’t know what she’s doing.'

Netanyahu says he is undeterred after drone targets his home	The prime minister and his wife were not at home during the drone attack on their private residence, the PMO says; Netanyahu says nothing will deter him and the war is to continue until victory Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday posted a clip filmed in Jerusalem saying nothing will deter him, just hours after a drone attack targeted his private residence in Caesarea. The Prime Minister's Office confirmed that the drone attack launched in Lebanon targeted his private residence in Caesarea adding that the family was not at home during the attack. The drone landed on another resident but caused no injuries. No sirens were activated, causing residents of the affluent community to voice their anger. 'There was a buzzing sound before the drone hit,' one resident said. 'It was unclear where it came from but then the explosion occurred.' 'I live nearby,' another man said. 'the explosion was louder than we were used to. At first we thought this may be an Iranian attack and could not understand why no sirens were activated. Can we feel safe? Once again a drone manages to evade low flying choppers and intercepts and this time it hit a house here.' 'The day before yesterday, we eliminated arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar. I said we were in our war of revival,' Netanyahu said. 'We are carrying on to the end. I am proud of our soldiers, our commanders and the citizens and nothing will deter me,' he said. Netanyahu's neighbors in Caesarea said they observed a convoy leaving the community in the early morning, before the drone strike but according to his office, he has not been in the home for over a week.

IDF soldier investigated for war crimes in Belgium	Probe launched after Palestinian journalists' investigative report into elite IDF unit, claiming civilians were executed; Belgian Justice minister says Israel has the right to self-defense but that does not excuse it from following international law Belgium prosecution was investigating a man with dual Israeli-Belgium citizenship who fought in Gaza, for war crimes. Israeli officials said an investigation was launched after Palestinian groups lodged a criminal complaint, but no proceedings have been put into place. According to Belgium's prosecution, the investigation centers around a 22-year-old citizen of the country who served as a sharpshooter in an elite unit of the IDF. It followed an investigative report by Palestinian journalist Younis Tirawi who accused the unit of 'the brutal execution of unarmed civilians.' Tirawi said he received his information from an American who also serves in the unit and who provided evidence that civilians were being targeted although they posed no danger. The unit which was operating in Gaza since October, is made up of 21 soldiers, among them three American nationals, two Frenchmen, a German, an Italian and a citizen of Belgium who is now being investigated. Belgium's Justice Minister Paul Van Tigchelt said on Friday that the investigation hoped to uncover whether the report was true. 'Israel has a right for self-defense but that does not excuse its duty to respect international humanitarian law,' he said.

A drone launched in Lebanon hits a building in the affluent community where prime minister's private residence is located; rockets fall into the Sea of Galilee Haifa, its surrounding areas and central Israel came under attack on Saturday after an explosion was heard in the affluent community of Caesarea, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence is located when an attack drone crashed into a building. No injuries were reported, and security and emergency teams were dispatched to ensure there was no danger from shrapnel or explosives. Drone infiltrations and rocket attacks began in the early morning hours targeting Tiberias and surrounding areas. Rockets were seen falling in to the Sea of Galilee, causing no injuries. The incident came shortly after sirens were activated in the Haifa Bay area, warning of an infiltration of hostile drones. Earlier still, sirens in the Emek Hefer region nearby warned of a hostile aircraft which the military then said was the result of a false alarm. In Tel Aviv and areas to the north of the city, sirens were also heard, warning of a drone strike although no explosions were heard there. 'During the past hour, three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory,' the IDF said in a statement. 'One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea. No injuries were reported. During the incident, sirens were activated in the Glilot military base. The presence of additional hostile aircraft in the area has been ruled out.' The military also said a projectile crossed the border from Lebanon and fell in an open area in the Haifa Bay region. There too, no injuries were reported.

Herzi Halevi says even Iran may not fully grasp what’s happening to Hezbollah, and the IDF continues to deliver significant blows and wipe out local leadership; Hezbollah fires over 75 projectiles from Lebanon into Israel and 6 UAVs intercepted by the IAF IDF Chief of Staff, Herzi Halevi said Friday that some 1,500 Hezbollah operatives were killed in the ongoing ground operation in Lebanon. Halevi held a situational assessment with top Northern Command commanders, and added, 'We are determined to strike Hezbollah as hard as possible.' We’ve taken out their entire senior command and are wiping out their local leadership.' 'Their entire chain of command is collapsing. Hezbollah is hiding casualties, including dead commanders. Our conservative estimate is that 1,500 operatives have been killed, likely more, given the scale of the strikes.' 'These are significant achievements,' he continued, 'Their willingness to surrender speaks volumes about their morale and self-confidence, as well as the combat capabilities you've demonstrated.' 'Even Iran may not fully grasp what’s happening to Hezbollah, its main proxy. Every day we’re delivering tough surprises, and you’ll continue bringing them—achieving victories while preventing the enemy from doing the same.' Meanwhile, on Friday over 75 projectiles fired by Hezbollah crossed from Lebanon into Israel. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported that the Israeli Air Force intercepted six UAVs throughout the day. The IAF has also struck dozens of launchers, Hezbollah infrastructure, command centers, and operatives in the area. IDF troops are conducting targeted raids in southern Lebanon, eliminating roughly 60 terrorists in air and ground operations. The troops dismantled rockets, anti-tank missile launchers, and large stockpiles of weapons, including explosives, mortars, and RPGs.

Israel’s elite rescue unit 669: 'We have no fear, ready to return...	The daring rescues under heavy fire, soldiers arriving at the helicopter with no pulse and surviving, and the nightmare moment when they lost friends in Gaza chopper crash; 6 elite Unit 669 soldiers, who juggle between reserve duty and working as doctors at Soroka Medical Center, explain why, even with some now grandparents, leaving the unit is unimaginable On the first night of the Gaza ground operation, the wounded young armored corps soldier that Sgt. Maj. (Res) Dr. Y. was treating, died in his arms. 'We were at a base in southern Israel,' says Y.' At 2am, we were called to treat armored corps guys who’d been hit by an anti-tank missile. His mother is the first thing I think about in such situations. Someone’s son is now lying wounded somewhere in Gaza, waiting for us to come get him out of there. If his mother knew what was happening, what wouldn’t she do to save him?' The helicopter landed in southern Gaza. 'We landed in the dark. The doors opened, and I saw the guys treating him running toward us. I couldn’t make out their faces. They were all covered in dust, but you know that whoever’s running toward you now is your best friend. Under different circumstances, you’d hug one another and drink coffee together. Now, they were shouting out the treatment they’ve given him. We took off back to Israel. We had three, men from this incident: One severely wounded, one in critical condition, and the other was relatively okay.' Dr. Y. says that choosing who to treat is simply a game of roulette. There’s nothing you can change. You’ve been given a wounded soldier. Now he’s yours. This was the situation on that flight. 'I could hardly see a thing' he says. 'It was dark and we were flying with no lights. I put my hands on his chest and face and couldn’t feel anything. I hooked him up to the machines and realized that he was in a very bad way.' 'I did everything I could to save him. I administered artificial respiration and gave him a blood transfusion. I only saw the severity of his injury as we turned on the helicopter lights on entering Israeli territory. I didn’t for a moment think he was dead. I also didn’t stop. We treated him until landing at Soroka. I’ve never been so happy to see the hospital lights.' The helicopter landed, and Y. rushed to the medical team with his wounded man. 'I ran with him into the trauma center, panting and shouting ‘low blood pressure, no vital signs’. My friends at the hospital weren’t moving. No one approached us. No one was helping me. With a sad look on their faces, they just took the ventilator from me.' 'I kept telling them what his condition was. And 30 people were just looking at me, realizing he’d already died. I hadn’t gotten it yet. Then it hit me. I asked ‘What? That’s it?’ And they nodded. The deputy hospital director patted me on the shoulder and the anesthesiologist gave me a kiss. I started crying. It was such a blow. I believed in what I was doing, in the treatment I was administering on the way. And he’s not with us anymore.' In his journal, Y. describes the terrible moment he parted from the young soldier he tried to save. 'I’m no longer his medical caregiver. I’m a citizen for whom he died. I lean in toward him, looking at his beautiful face, one hand tightly clasping his hand, the other on his shoulder. I begged his forgiveness. The mother was echoing in my head. God help us. If only she knew, she’d tear out her heart and switch it with his.' This is how the IDF’s most combat doctors sound. They’ve been in action for a year, saving lives on the battle field and in the safe and familiar hospital setting. They respond to any call to any injury or military altercation, land in the warzone, invariably under heavy fire, and evacuate the wounded to Israel. Just so that soldiers may come back to life, recover, and get back to themselves and to their families. Unit 669, or as it’s officially known, the 'Tactical Unit for Special Rescue' is a special IDF elite unit. Its role is to evacuate the dead and wounded from war and disaster zones. Unit combatants whose names cannot be published show up at evacuation zones in helicopters and on foot to evacuate those demanding medical treatment. Since the war began, the unit has conducted 800 rescue flights within the Gaza Strip, evacuating over 1,800 wounded to trauma centers across the country, providing them with urgent, lifesaving medical care on the way. In the current war, some are also operating on foot alongside infantry forces inside Gaza. For this article, we interviewed six Soroka doctors serving in 669: Maj. (Res) Dr. S (58); Sgt. Maj. (Res) Dr. Y. (35). Lt. Col. (Res) Dr, A (58); Maj. (Res) Prof. Y. (48), Maj. (Res) Prof. A. (52) and Maj. (Res) Dr. L. (50). They’re all married with children. Some have grandchildren. This is an extraordinary, elite team of people who, for the past year, have been dividing their time between routine work in the busy southern trauma center that treated the wounded on October 7, and has since treated hundreds of wounded soldiers, saving lives in Gaza, and risking their lives on every mission. They’re called to the danger epicenter at every hour, day or night, fight for the lives of the wounded, even if it seems hopeless. They hail from varied professional medical backgrounds. They’re surgeons, intensive care specialists, anesthesiologists and orthopedic doctors. Some are young, setting out on their medical careers. Others are senior doctors, including department heads in their 50s at top of their profession. Their age and hospital positions have long released them from reserve duty, but they adamantly refuse surrendering the right to save lives. 'We get to the field, with all our hearts in it, knowing we have to reach them as quickly as possible and bring them in for medical care' says. Prof. Y. 'The number of wounded can sometimes hinder you. Lots of evacuations are conducted under fire. There’s a lot of shelling and artillery fire, but you show up with a clear goal: finding the wounded as quickly as possible, and bringing them back alive into Israeli territory, to a hospital that will treat them. This makes the difference between life and death. Emotions come later.' 'Two weeks ago, they turned from doctors to patients. Operations of this small secret unit, the identity of whose members cannot be published, that’s usually conducted in the shadows, were recently exposed to the public. Due to poor terrain conditions, a Yasur helicopter on a routine mission evacuating a soldier shot in southern Gaza, crashed a few seconds before landing. Two combat soldiers Sgt. Maj. (Res) Daniel Alush and Sgt. Maj. (Res) Tom Ish-Shalom were killed in the incident, and eight more were injured, some severely, including the male and female pilots flying the helicopter, and two airborne doctors. Conditions of all injured have since greatly improved and they’re now out of danger. 'I got a call from the unit in the middle of night, telling me there was an extraordinary incident' says Lt. Col. Dr. A. 'Before leaving the hospital, I asked myself what should I be wearing now – Soroka scrubs or my army uniform? I went for the uniform, thinking that my friends, lying in beds as 'wounded,' would feel safer in the company of brothers in arms. The incident’s severity soon became clear. 'This wasn’t my first time in war finding myself treating people I know' says A. But the large number of wounded meant I needed to deal with it differently. I was not only helping treat them. I also had to brief the unit, whose people were extremely concerned.' 'My work demands I separate my mind from my heart. The work becomes technical. It was impossible in this case. These are people I’ve known for years: The pilots and the helicopter mechanic with whom I’ve flown so many times. They’re all very close friends. You could call them family. In recent months, I’ve spent more time with them than at home. We’ve been together in extremely dangerous situations. Together we’ve saved lots of soldiers’ lives.' How do you deal with such situation, the difficulty of treating the people closest to you? 'Our accrued experience demands we behave in a certain way. Otherwise, the treatment result won’t be as good. It sinks in later. We felt we had to represent our friends to their families and make them feel they’re in the safest possible place that we’d provide them with the best treatment possible. It’s very important for me to support people who aren’t from the medical profession – pilots, mechanics and their families, giving them the feeling that everyone’s with them, in the same boat.' All this as everyone in the unit know that, under different circumstances, on a different day, it could have been them there, lying in the trauma center bed 'We subconsciously know that this is an incident that could occur. The team involved in the incident had replaced me on my standby shift. Our tasks are completely identical. The chances of my lying there on the bed are exactly the same as theirs. If circumstances were different, they could be treating me.' Maj. Prof. A, also a senior hospital and unit doctor, chose to deal with the incident differently. 'I’ve developed the ability to block out things that interfere with my functioning' he says. 'The injured need me as a doctor, and I function as such. A few hours after the incident, the doctors in the WhatsApp group were talking about the incident, writing about how sad it was. I wrote, ‘Guys, we need to be strong. Our next wounded are waiting for us’.' 'Through the years, we take risks. As soon as a helicopter takes off, there are risks from both above and below. It’s no secret. I’m sure if before taking off in the helicopter, you were to tell those who fell in the course of duty, that it may crash that day, they’d stay on that helicopter.' And what about you? You’re part of the unit not just in medical terms, but also in the fighting. You’re exposed to its dangers. Does this kind of incident scare you? Dr. A. 'I’m going back to reserve duty today. The soldiers need me. I have to give them everything I can. I spoke to the pilot. We told him that we completely trust him and what they’re doing, and that we’re not afraid. We’re going out into the field again tomorrow.' Protocol for treating the wounded on the battlefield has changed during this war. Rather than trying to save them with daring and dangerous operations demanding time and space, the wounded are stabilized and evacuated to the hospital as quickly as possible. In more urgent or severe, imminently life-threatening cases, they’re taken to Soroka, a ten-minute flight from the Gaza Strip. Maj. Prof. A says: 'We do our best not to do anything we don’t have to. We stabilize the patient while we’re on the move and only do what we must to save him - giving him blood transfusions, opening veins. We less administer respiration and tracheal intubation (inserting a tube into the trachea windpipe). The helicopter is a substitute for the hospital. We’re guided by getting to the hospital as quickly as possible to provide the patient with the best care.' 'The most critical decisions are those taken in the first minute of treatment. Whatever’s decided in those moments can often determine whether the patient lives or dies. It’s an enormous responsibility. I think we do this extraordinarily well. You have seven or eight minutes before reaching the hospital to prepare everything you need. You can’t delay getting him into the trauma center even for a second after the helicopter has landed.' 'There are days we fly almost non-stop' says Prof. Y. 'We land in the field near the wounded man and get him to the hospital as fast as we can. The injuries from this war aren’t just from guns. There are lots of shrapnel and explosive devices too. The team also knows that, even after one of our patients dies, we have to carry on working. More wounded men are waiting for us in the field. We draw our strength from our success stories.' And, thankfully, there’s no shortage of these stories. 'In the war’s first week, we were called to rescue wounded men' says Prof. A. 'One of them, we were told, was in a stable condition. His condition, however, quickly deteriorated on the helicopter. We started giving him blood transfusions and administered artificial respiration. He had head injuries and had been hit on the arms and legs. We brought him to Soroka where we opened his chest to massage his heart muscles. He underwent a series of operations, and gradually regained consciousness. When I came back from the army, I carried on treating him. He spent a month with us and then onto rehabilitation. When I tell my team about this case, it really makes their day.' Maj. Dr. L. has recently joined the unit after serving as a combat pilot. In recent months, he’s been serving alongside the ground forces. 'I’m totally an infantry soldier' he says. 'All the unit’s doctors come from the core medical professions. They’re all experienced in treating the wounded in war conditions. Having experienced doctors with them, gives the forces on the ground a great sense of safety.' 'Treating the wounded in the field is very different from how we treat them in the helicopters' says L. 'I feel an enormous sense of duty and mission. You reach the wounded on the battlefield minutes, sometimes less, after the injury, armed up like the unit’s combat soldiers. You’re invariably getting shot at and you shoot back if you have to. My purpose as a doctor isn’t killing terrorists, but rather getting to the wounded at any cost, even when they’re firing at my head.' Haven’t you asked yourself what the hell you’re doing there, running around the alleyways of Gaza with a gun? Is this what you studied medicine for? 'My eldest son is 22. Spending time with the ground forces, with the guys from infantry and the armored corps, who are mostly his age, generates collaboration and brotherhood. Being able to sit together in Gaza and do whatever necessary together, not just fighting or treating the wounded, creates an amazing sense of unity.' Is closure, knowing what happens to the wounded you’ve treated, important for you? Prof. Y. 'Getting feedback about what happens is very important. The unit’s team know I’m from Soroka. Lots of them say to me, ‘We brought you a wounded soldier. What’s with him?’ They need to know that everything that’s done is done for the best. Even when a wounded soldier dies, it’s important for us to know. It’s closure of sorts.' 'During evacuation, we’re all determined to carry out the mission at its very best' says Dr. Y. 'Afterwards, on the landing pad, some cry, others hug. What we do is very rewarding. We’ve brought in soldiers in critical condition, at death’s door, and they survived. We had a soldier from central Gaza in a severe state of shock due to blood loss. When we brought him to the helicopter, he was as white as snow, with blood Oxygen saturation level of 38, the normal level being close to 100. The doctor with me thought that was the end of him. We suddenly saw him slightly gesturing. We said ‘Yallah, let’s go.’ We inserted blood through a hole in the bone and saved his life. His mother’s still in touch with us.' He says that they do remember the joyful success stories, but that they mainly remember the soldiers they don’t manage to save. 'I remember their faces. I have a list of all the soldiers I’ve evacuated. Who survived, and who was killed. It’s not easy. After every mission, everyone looks for their own wounded man, so see what happened with him. It doesn’t always end well. Some die, others have brain damage. We’re still in touch with some of them. We’re invited to their weddings. Changing from my army to uniform to my Soroka scrubs, and meeting people I’ve saved from the hell of Khan Younis, and I see them doing well, is a dream come true.' The medical team in the field and helicopters fight for the lives of every wounded man, how severe their condition. 'It’s important to convey this message to everyone, including the soldiers, families, brother, sisters, wives and girlfriends' says Dr. S. 'We have the most professional people in the army and medical profession in this unit. We treat the wounded in the most professional way. If we show up, they can relax. We’ll do whatever needed to save their loved ones.' 'We don’t give up' says Prof. A. 'Despite the standard approach in trauma being not resuscitating anyone with no signs of life following severe trauma, we’ll often keep trying fighting for these guys, both in the helicopters and at the hospital. How can we give up on them? They went to protect us, and we just give up? In the trauma center, they open the chest and massage to heart muscle to save them. The battle for their lives is to the bitter end.' This desperate and heroic medical care invariably demands unconventional means. 'We’ve developed lots of systems that don’t appear in the literature. Medical treatment in the field is very quick, and the wounded that used to die during evacuation, are now reaching the hospital alive. I open a vein with a very broad catheter that allows me to give him blood transfusion within one minute. You get a body, and a few minutes later, after four or five doses, he comes back to life. I’ve no idea how many of these we’ve seen. Patients we were told we couldn’t save have come back to life and recovered. We fight for them until the very last moment.' To save these wounded, Prof. A. tells us, you need to make decisions very quickly. 'What helps in these situations is experience, which we have, along with the medical profession we routinely practice. We can get a wounded man who’s relatively okay, and then he can suddenly decline. You need to make a thousand decisions to save him.' What’s going on with the injured guys when all this is happening? Can you talk to them, to calm them down, under all this pressure? Can you explain what’s about to happen? 'Generally, what they care about at that moment is what’s going on with their friends. Amidst the helicopter noise, with our helmets on, we shout, ‘Everything’s okay, you’ll live. We’ll be at the hospital in five minutes’. It’s very important to calm them, and we do that. At the hospital, the first thing we ask anyone who’s conscious, is their parent’s or wife’s telephone number. We give him a minute before respiration to exchange a few words with his family and explain what’s happened.' 'These soldiers, who survive injuries, will often develop post-trauma. I’m sure those minutes you spend calming them down, telling them ‘Everything’s okay. We’re going to save you and you’ll go back to living as you were before you were injured’ are critical in averting post trauma. What happens when, as a doctor, it’s already clear that what you’re promising isn’t going to happen? 'I lie. And there’s a very good chance he won’t even remember what went on there, under the influence of the painkiller and sometimes anesthetic medication. I believe this lie is for the best.' 'Evacuations aren’t always tragic' says Dr. Y. 'You also get magical, even comical moments. We had an American lone soldier who was psyched that we’d come to rescue him in a helicopter. He stared out of the window, stunned that he was in a Black Hawk. Midflight, he took an exercise book out of his pocket and started documenting the evacuation. Another soldier rolled up a cigarette in the helicopter.' There’s no shortage of success stories, some miraculous. 'We had a wounded man with no signs of life' says Prof. A. 'We could tell by the color of his skin, that he was dead, or in a very deep state of shock. We began resuscitating him and his breathing was agonal, i.e., terminal. We administered artificial respiration while infusing blood through two veins. A few minutes later, and he wasn’t breathing at all. We intubated him and he suddenly opened his eyes and started breathing. By the time we got to the hospital, his condition was relatively okay, breathing just with the aid of a mask. I’ve seen lots of amazing things in my work as a doctor. I’d never seen anything like that. I’ve had other very strange cases that, with all my professional experience, I’d say just couldn’t have happened.' Lt. Col. A. tells us, 'We do everything for every injured man, until nothing more can be done, to the point you declare him dead. We don’t give up even on a guy who’s dead when he’s brought into helicopter or lying on the ground. These soldiers are my son’s age. I can’t see myself giving up on a kid like this. I might be asked why we do all of this. After all, there’s no chance of saving him. But we’ve seen wounded men, who we thought there was no chance of saving, who recovered.' And when it doesn’t work? 'It hurts like hell. Real pain inside. It’s very hard to see media reports with pictures of guys I’ve tried to save who didn’t survive. Our mission is that they should live. Even when you know it’s not your fault, and you know you didn’t fail, it’s a terribly disappointing feeling.' On the morning of October 7, when it still wasn’t clear who was fighting whom and what exactly was going on in the south, the unit’s fighters were called to help evacuate wounded people from the Gaza Periphery. Some were taken straight to the hospital where they’d reported for duty as soon as the sirens went off. It was only when they were in the air that they understood the magnitude of the horror. Maj. Dr. L. started his reserve duty in the unit two days earlier. When they took off at 6:30, he was on a shift at the base. 'We were in the air half an hour later, and by 8 o’clock, we were evacuating the wounded from the Gaza Periphery. We were on the first Sikorsky (helicopter) in the field. What did you see from above? 'The skies were clear and calm where we were, but what was on the ground, looked very different. As a combat pilot, I’ve lived much of life with headphones, but I’ve never heard noise like on that terrible day.' L. tells us that 30 hours of non-stop evacuation started there. 'We’d evacuate the wounded, land, get new medical equipment, and take off again, over and over and over again. We didn’t have time to go to the bathroom or eat properly. We obviously didn’t sleep either.' 'You can’t imagine such a thing and you’ve no way of mentally preparing for it. As a pilot, you like having a back-up plan for every unforeseen eventuality. This was outside all of that.' How did you know where to fly to? 'It took us time to understand what was going on. On a Sikorsky, you don’t have TV, and we weren’t getting reliable information from outside and the communication systems were very busy. We constructed a picture on our own, throughout the day. We reached the first wounded using Google Maps, via friends and forces on the ground sending us locations. In the first evacuation, we were told, ‘Take the injured guy and take off. There are lots of terrorists around.’ We had severely wounded cases that we rushed to evacuate. Again and again. We gradually understood that this incident was like nothing else.' 'In the afternoon, we were sent to a Golani outpost with dozens severely wounded soldiers. The helicopter took off as soon as we got out as it was being shot at. We planned leaving with the wounded, but the gunfire exchange meant the helicopter couldn’t return. We reached late afternoon, and it didn’t look like we were getting out of there. At some stage, we got an Apache that fired at the terrorists from the sky as we loaded lots and lots of people onto the little helicopter and flew away. After dropping them off at Soroka, we got back into the field to carry on evacuating the wounded. In the huge chaos of that day, Soroka’s trauma center was like coming home after a hard day. You know you’ve brought the wounded to the right place.' Unlike hospital corridors where the department head is God, and the senior doctors his deputy, here at 669, everyone’s equal. The collaborative work, under fire, with the one and only purpose of saving our soldiers, turns the unit’s doctors and soldiers into a single body. Thus Dr. Y., the most junior of the team who started his residency less than a year ago, a mere week before the war broke out, found himself working shoulder to shoulder with his department head, with no hierarchical pretenses. 'All the senior doctors at Soroka are my friends from the unit. People at the hospital sometimes don’t know how to take it. We’re always hugging in the corridors and slapping one another on the back.' 'The professor is a special kind of guy. On the outside, he seems rather stern, but inside he’s as sweet as can be. At 2am October 7, I met him at a base in central Israel with a sandwich in his hand, and he asked me if I wanted a bite. He’d just evacuated dozens of severely injured people, and needed a hug himself. One day, I went to sleep and woke up to find cookies placed next to my bed and note reading, ‘Take care of yourself’.' And the love seems to be mutual. 'He’s an amazing guy. I’ve known since joining the unit' the department head says of his young resident. 'I’m proud he’s doing his residency with me. Being his supervisor is an honor.' This past year’s intensive work has created a special, almost family, bond between the two. 'At the end of the day, the unit has made us who we are' says Sgt. Maj. Y. 'I’ve become a totally different person since joining 669. Each person here is better than the next. ‘Salt of the Earth’ doesn’t cover it. We have people with an amazing desire to give. No one asks questions. No one thinks twice. We’re all addicted to the task and to the work. The chances of being part of this group are super low. The unit is super small and intimate. We all feel lucky to be part of it.' They all say that, after the mission itself, deep friendship is perhaps the most important part of their service. So, despite dealing with ongoing danger, no one was prepared for administering urgent medical care to their professional and unit colleagues. Dr. S., the oldest of the group, grandfather to a little granddaughter born during the war, was also injured evacuating wounded from Gaza. 'It was the second sortie that day' he says. 'The second incident was very hard and complex, with people killed and severely wounded. After initial assessment, I took the most severely wounded soldier who’d been hit by an explosion and was unconscious. At the Soroka landing pad, when we took him out and ran, taking him to the trauma department, I suddenly slipped and fell on the grass. I got up and fell again. I felt I couldn’t control my leg, so I told the guys, 'Run, I’ll be okay.' I was taken to the trauma department, where, once again, I got up and fell down. Only then did I understand that something had happened.' But this rather dry story doesn’t give the full picture. Dr. Y. who was there with him tells us, 'S. had torn his thigh muscle, which is excruciatingly painful. He was screaming in pain, louder than the noise the helicopter makes, but he adamantly refused that we treat him. He said, 'Guys, don’t touch me. Treat the soldiers.' Everyone admits that, despite their great and sacred task, the double lives they’ve been leading for the past year, of demanding work both at the hospital and in the unit, comes at a heavy cost. Most are still serving in the reserves, dividing their time between the hospital and the unit. 'Its geographical location means that most are evacuated to Soroka' says Dr. Y. 'It’s my second home. After long, hard hours in the field, I’ll go into the trauma department and all my friends welcome me with a smile and a hug. You get a love-boost and you have the strength to carry on. And yet, being away from the family is hard. The hardest thing was parting from my wife October 7 when she was in her final trimester. I left her alone in the house with non-stop sirens and rumors of terrorists infiltrating Beersheba. She’d started packing my bag when I called her from the hospital to tell her I was no my way to the unit.' L's firstborn daughter was born three months later, and he received short leave from the unit, after which he immediately returned to the unit. 'It was hard leaving the house before. After the birth, it was so much harder. I felt I was abandoning my wife and daughter. Amidst the death we were seeing all around, my daughter was the source of great joy. She’s saving the situation. I’m a very blessed father.' 'Those weeks of fighting were very intense for me and my family.' I’ve already done 250 days of reserve duty this year. My wife keeps asking when it’ll all be over. She didn’t imagine this is what I’d be doing at the age of 50. But this is me. I have one clear purpose to what I do - saving lives. That’s why I joined the unit. It’s enormously important. Every hour of every day, if they need me, I pack my things and go out to them. That’s where I belong.' Haven’t you thought of stopping? Telling yourself you’ve given enough, and that now others can give? 'I never say enough. Definitely not now. I have no dilemmas.' 'Leaving has never crossed my mind' says Prof. Y. 'We’re doctors, but we’re soldiers just like our friends with us in the helicopters. Despite our differences in age and background, we’re a group, like fingers on a hand. You can’t punch with one finger missing.' Dr. S., still rehabilitating from the injury, is counting days until he can save lives in the air again. 'I’m dying to get back to the unit' he says. 'Just don’t tell my wife.'

Biden sees opportunity to potentially end Israel-Iran fighting 'f...	Biden says US has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday there was an opportunity to deal with Israel and Iran in a way that potentially ends their conflict in the Middle East for a while. Speaking to reporters at the end of a visit to Berlin, Biden also said he has an understanding of how and when Israel was going to retaliate against missile attacks by Iran. He declined to elaborate. Tensions have been high in the region with Israel planning a response to the Oct. 1 missile attack carried out by Tehran. 'There's an opportunity in my view and my colleagues agree that we can probably deal with Israel and Iran in a way that ends the conflict for a while. That ends the conflict, in other words, that stops the back and forth,' Biden said. Biden added that he believed there was a possibility of working towards a ceasefire in Lebanon but that such efforts would be harder in Gaza.

IDF: 60 terrorists killed in southern Lebanon; 2 drones intercept...	The IDF Spokesperson's Unit reported Friday that in the past 24 hours, some 60 terrorists were eliminated in southern Lebanon, and numerous targets were struck from the air and ground. Additionally, it was reported that earlier, the Israeli Air Force successfully intercepted two drones approaching from Lebanon outside Israeli territory. During the operation, forces located and destroyed rockets and munitions in areas from which launches into Israel occurred. They also identified and dismantled anti-tank missile launchers prepared for firing alongside rockets and other weaponry stored in a facility.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byukjgelke	2024-10-18T10:30:42-07:00

The butcher from Khan Younis - How Sinwar became an arch-terroris...	With a name like Sinwar—a combination of 'Sin' and 'War'—what could one expect? Yahya Sinwar, the man who orchestrated the October 7 massacre, embodied a life filled with violence, brutality, and conflict Yahya Sinwar’s dark legacy began with his family’s displacement from Ashkelon (then Al-Majdal Asqalan) during the 1948 war, driven by a desire to fulfill the Nakba's vision. Raised under Israeli control after the 1967 Six-Day War, Sinwar attended school and university, but his hatred only grew. He particularly resented Egypt for its peace treaty with Israel, which he saw as a betrayal. At university, Sinwar became a disciple of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Hamas’ co-founder, whose extremist ideology—advocating for jihad against Israel—shaped Sinwar’s worldview. However, he earned the nickname 'Butcher of Khan Younis' not for killing Israelis, but for brutally torturing and killing Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. His enthusiasm for such acts cemented his grim reputation. In 1988, Sinwar was sentenced to four life terms in Israeli prison for orchestrating abductions and killings of Israeli soldiers and suspected collaborators. He spent 22 years in prison, continuing his reign of terror by torturing fellow inmates. While some described him as fearless and brutal—often killing with his bare hands—others saw him as a coward, manipulating others into violence while keeping himself safe. During his time in prison, Sinwar learned Hebrew, read Israeli newspapers, and studied the culture, preparing for psychological warfare. He even wrote a novel, 'Thorns and Carnations,' an autobiographical tale. His stay in Israeli prison came at a significant cost to Israel—$612,000 over 22 years, which included life-saving surgery for a brain tumor by Israeli doctors. Ironically, one of those doctors later pleaded with Sinwar after his nephew was kidnapped by Hamas, only to find out the next day that his nephew had been killed. Sinwar’s brother, Muhammad, was instrumental in the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, which ultimately led to Sinwar’s release in the 2011 prisoner exchange. After his release, Sinwar swiftly rose through Hamas’ ranks, seizing power in Gaza by 2017 through eliminating rivals, often via public executions or throwing opponents off rooftops. One of Sinwar’s early moves as Hamas leader was to cosmetically amend the organization’s charter, replacing the word 'Jews' with 'Zionists' and 'jihad' with 'Free Palestine.' Yet, his ultimate goal—the destruction of Israel—remained unchanged. Sinwar kept his personal life largely hidden, but recent footage showed him walking through a tunnel with his wife and children. Rumors of his brutality in his personal life linger, though details remain unclear. He frequently acted independently of Hamas leadership, including launching the October 7 attack without waiting for Hezbollah or Iran to coordinate, choosing to rely on fear. His plans unraveled—Hezbollah didn’t attack, Israeli Arabs didn’t rise up, and Iran stayed out of the fight. On October 16, 2024, Sinwar was killed by the IDF, marking the end of his violent reign. His plan to destroy Israel failed, and even Palestinians are growing tired of the devastation his leadership has brought to Gaza. Now, the question is where to go from here. This moment—the fall of the 'Butcher'—offers a chance to restore hope and normalcy to the region. It’s time to focus on freeing the hostages. Offering high sums of money to Gazans who return hostages alive could create an incentive for change. With international support, there is an opportunity to help Gazans form a leadership committed to peace and rebuilding alongside Israel. Amid the chaos Sinwar left behind, there is a rare chance to restore stability and dignity. But we must remember, there are more Sinwars—particularly his brother, who may be eager to continue the violence. One of the promises Israel made after October 7 was to bring the innocent hostages home. These hostages do not receive the privileged treatment Sinwar received in Israeli jail. They are deprived of medical care, food, and held only for the crime of being Jewish. Noam Dan from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum shared the following after Sinwar’s death: 'The elimination of Yahya Sinwar is an important achievement. However, true victory in this war hinges on the return of the 101 abductees still held in Gaza. While Sinwar’s death is a blow to Hamas, it brings mixed emotions for the families whose loved ones remain trapped in Hamas tunnels. Prime Minister Netanyahu must now act with the same determination and ensure the swift release of the abductees. Sinwar is no longer an obstacle—the responsibility lies squarely with Netanyahu to decide if he will be the leader who abandoned them or the one who brought them home.'

Russia is ready to help seek compromises between arch-foes Israel and Iran, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday, saying these would be difficult but possible. 'We are in contact with Israel, we are in contact with Iran. We have quite trusting relations. And we would very much like this endless exchange of blows to be stopped at some point. And for such ways to resolve the situation to be found that would satisfy both sides,' Putin told reporters.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjtw2exx1g	2024-10-18T08:17:39-07:00	
New details of Sinwar's assassination and the fighting that conti...	IDF says the military's actions cornered Yahya Sinwar, preventing him from escaping from the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood and setting the stage for his elimination For weeks, IDF troops from the Nahal Brigade and the 828th (Bislamach) Brigade have been fighting in Rafah, closely cooperating with the Shin Bet. The Bislach combat team operating in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood identified several suspects, and during the ensuing battle, they discovered they had killed the notorious Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. On Friday, IDF forces encountered two terrorists around the house where Sinwar was located, one possibly part of the group that accompanied Sinwar in his final hours. A preliminary IDF investigation revealed that on Wednesday morning, around 10 am, a soldier from the 450th Battalion spotted two suspicious figures moving between the ruins of the neighborhood. He reported the sighting, and Battalion Commander Lt. Col. Ran Canaan advanced with infantry and armored forces. He observed three suspicious individuals—two walking ahead, wrapped in blankets, and a third trailing behind, wearing a combat vest and armed, with a hood covering his head. Initially, there was concern that the two figures could be hostages, and the commander opened fire at the third individual, identified as a terrorist, hitting his hand. At this point, no one realized the terrorists was Sinwar. Contrary to earlier claims, Sinwar did not lose his hand. 'He’s no Trumpeldor,' IDF officials remarked. At that moment, the terrorists split up. Two entered a nearby house, while the third, later confirmed as Sinwar, fled to another. The two fired back at the IDF forces, critically wounding a soldier from the 450th Battalion, who was airlifted to the hospital and has since improved. The battalion commander called in reinforcements to check the house where Sinwar had fled. Bloodstains were found on the stairs, and the commander realized it was fresh blood. Sinwar threw two grenades from a window, one of which exploded but caused no injuries. The IDF forces shelled the building with tank fire, missiles, and machine guns, still unaware of Sinwar’s identity. After the first shelling, a drone was sent inside and captured footage of Sinwar, wounded, sitting on a couch and throwing a stick at the drone. By this point, it was 4 pm—six hours after the operation had begun. A second shell was fired, along with heavy machine-gun fire, which ultimately killed him. The unit continued its heavy bombardment until part of the building collapsed. Later that evening, another drone was sent into the building and spotted a body, though it couldn’t yet be identified. The decision was made to wait until daylight to enter. Around midnight, another terrorist was spotted in a lookout post and was killed. By Thursday morning, when another drone was flown inside, the forces noticed the body bore a resemblance to Sinwar. Photos were sent to the Southern Command headquarters, and a senior officer shared them with his counterpart at the Shin Bet’s operations division, asking, 'Do you recognize him?' Shin Bet operational teams arrived at the scene and began forensic tests to confirm Sinwar’s identity. When Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman arrived on-site and saw the body with his own eyes, he immediately realized it was Sinwar. According to the IDF, 'This operation followed several months of fighting during which the IDF, in cooperation with the Shin Bet and led by the 162nd Division, fought against the Rafah Brigade and the Tel al-Sultan Battalion, eliminating hundreds of terrorists. These actions cornered Sinwar, preventing his escape and setting the stage for his elimination.' Southern Command Chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman praised the soldiers, saying, 'Your persistence, patience, analysis of the terrain, vigilance, and pursuit of contact—engaging them and opening fire—made a significant impact. Your determination, systematic searches, and refusal to give up finding each of them one by one, led to this moment. When the opportunity came, you acted with operational alertness, engaged, took them down, and quickly closed the circle. This is how it should be. Here in Rafah, in Tel al-Sultan, we did it, and we’ll continue to do so everywhere. You have earned great respect for that.'

Some 1,500 Hezbollah operatives killed' IDF chief says	IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said Friday that the military estimates some 1,500 Hezbollah operatives were killed since the ground operation in Lebanon. 'We estimate around 1,500 Hezbollah operatives were killed, and that’s a conservative figure. We are determined to hit Hezbollah as hard as possible.

Outrageous': Lebanon and Iran see rare disagreement over UN reso...	Lebanese government is outraged after Iranian official says in interview Tehran was willing to negotiate the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 A rare confrontation between the Lebanese government and Iran took place on Friday after a senior Iranian official said Tehran was willing to negotiate the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 from 2006, which brought an end to the Second Lebanon War and stipulated Hezbollah terrorists would not be allowed to operate south of the Litani River. The unusual statement, viewed in Beirut as a violation of its sovereignty, was made by Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro. In the interview, Ghalibaf also said that France could serve as a mediator between Hezbollah and Israel. 'There’s no such thing as Israel, only a Zionist regime, which is an armed wing of the U.S. and not worth negotiating with,' he said, but added, 'We see a faint light at the end of the tunnel, a light that indicates Iran is willing to negotiate with France, a country that has traditionally defended Lebanon, regarding the specific conditions for implementing Resolution 1701.' Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati expressed his outrage over the remarks and ordered the Iranian embassy chargé d'affaires to be summoned following the statement (the ambassador himself was injured in September’s pager attack and was evacuated to Tehran). 'We’re surprised by the Iranian Parliament Speaker’s statements. This declaration is an outrageous interference in Lebanon's affairs and an attempt to establish unacceptable control,' Mikati said. 'We informed the Iranian Foreign Minister and the Parliament Speaker during their recent visits to Lebanon that the Lebanese situation must be understood, especially since Lebanon is facing unprecedented Israeli attacks, and we’re working with all of Lebanon's allies, including France, to pressure Israel to a cease-fire,' Mikati added. 'The issue of negotiating the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 is managed by the state of Lebanon, and everyone is required to support it in this direction rather than impose new mandates, which are unacceptable from every national and sovereign perspective,' he added. Mikati has been heading a caretaker government for a long time due to his country’s prolonged political crisis. Although his government is weak and impoverished, some hope to strengthen it as part of a future settlement that could potentially end the conflict in the north based on the implementation of the UN’s resolution. Iran attempted to clarify Ghalibaf's remarks following Mikati’s response. A source close to the Iranian Parliament Speaker told the Hezbollah-affiliated network Al-Mayadeen, 'Ghalibaf's position affirms that Iran will support whatever the Lebanese government and Hezbollah support regarding a cease-fire. Cooperation with Europe aims to assist in reaching a cease-fire agreement that both the Lebanese government and Hezbollah will endorse.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjk00ja1xjl	2024-10-18T05:38:50-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/18/S1JEuo1xke/S1JEuo1xke_0_0_1000_567_0_small.jpg
Hamas says leader Yahya Sinwar killed	Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the group's cross-border raids in 2023 that became the deadliest day in Israel's history, was killed in combat, Khalil Al-Hayya, deputy Gaza Hamas chief and the group's chief negotiator, said on Friday. Sinwar's death, which follows Israeli assassinations of other Hamas leaders and commanders, will deal a huge blow to the Islamist group which has faced relentless air strikes since it attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqi801gkg	2024-10-18T05:38:38-07:00

Harvard sees biggest downtrend in donations in a decade	Donations to the prestigious Ivy League institute nosedive 15% in the last year against the backdrop of pro-Palestinian protests and president's resignation Harvard University experienced its most significant drop in donations in a decade, with a decrease of about $151 million compared to last year — marking a nearly 15% downtrend. This marks the largest decline since 2015, reflecting a turbulent period for the Ivy League institution. The main reason for this decline is the campus protests following the war in Gaza, which led to prominent university donors halting their funds, and the resignation of former president Prof. Claudine Gay, who faced harsh criticism regarding her handling of antisemitism on campus. The university's annual financial report indicated that Harvard received $1.17 billion in donations for the year ending in June 2024, a significantly lower number than the $1.38 billion received year-on-year. The greatest impact was on its endowment fund, which saw a 34% cut in donations, totaling a $368.1 million loss. Harvard's new president, Prof. Alan Garber, expressed his disappointment with this year's fundraising results, noting concerns they could signal future challenges in fundraising efforts. He stressed that some previous commitments still continue to support the university, but the financial report highlights the decline in donation revenue and the complex economic situation that created significant uncertainty regarding continued funding. The pro-Palestinian protests on campus, sparked by the university's response to the Hamas attack on October 7, led several key donors including the Ofer family, hedge fund mogul Ken Griffin and investor Len Blavatnik to withhold their contributions to Harvard. Despite the drop in donations, the university remains the wealthiest in the world, with an endowment fund valued at $53.2 billion, which yielded a 9.6% return over the past year. The financial report said the fund contributes about 37% of the institution's annual revenue, generating $2.4 billion that supports funding for professors' salaries, scholarships and research. University expenses continued to rise, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits, but Harvard managed to end the year with a budget surplus of around $45 million. Despite this, Prof. Garber and the university's administration stressed the need for cautious financial management in the future, given that expenses continue to outgrow revenue. Harvard is the second Ivy League university to report a drop in donations this year following a wave of protests across campuses. New York’s Columbia University York, which spearheaded pro-Palestinian demonstrations on U.S. campuses, recorded a nearly 30% drop in donations during its annual giving day.

Sinwar's body relocated to Israeli site after autopsy	The former Hamas leader's body reportedly delivered to secret site in the country after inspection of his body was completed following his elimination The body of former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was eliminated in Gaza on Thursday, was delivered to a secret facility in Israel following the completion of its autopsy, Ynet learned on Friday. At this stage, it's unclear what will be done with his body and whether it will be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations, which may also include a hostage deal to return the 101 Israeli hostages still held in the Gaza Strip. The autopsy revealed Sinwar was shot in the head and his body showed indication of bullet wounds. His body weight was normal. The results of the toxicology report, which will determine whether he was under the influence of drugs or psychoactive substances, have yet to be received. Sinwar was eliminated two days ago following an accidental encounter, without prior intelligence, with IDF soldiers in Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan refugee camp — the same area where the tunnel in which six Israeli hostages were executed at the end of August. The IDF later released drone footage following Sinwar’s encounter with the soldiers. IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari confirmed Thursday night that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in Tel Sultan by IDF soldiers the day before. 'For months, the IDF and Shin Bet gathered intelligence to eliminate Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre. He was hiding in the area, and we didn’t know he was there. We identified Sinwar as a terrorist inside a building, found him with a vest, a pistol and 40,000 shekels. He was on the run, and we eliminated him. No hostages were with him.'

Berlin pushes for cease-fire after death of Hamas leader Sinwar	The death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar must lead to a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of all remaining hostages, spokespeople for the German government said on Friday.

Hezbollah says it will escalate war with Israel after Hamas leade...	Iran-backed terror group says Sinwar's death will strengthen its operative to launch new, stronger offensive against Israel amid Gaza war Lebanon's Hezbollah terror group said on Friday it was moving to a new and escalating phase in its war against Israel while Iran said 'the spirit of resistance will be strengthened' after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar, a mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war, was killed during an operation by IDF soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long war. Western leaders said his death offered an opportunity for the conflict to end, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would go on until the hostages seized by Hamas militants were returned. 'Today we have settled the score. Today evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed,' Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement after the death was confirmed on Thursday. 'To the dear hostage families, I say: This is an important moment in the war. We will continue full force until all your loved ones, our loved ones, are home.' Sinwar, who was named as Hamas' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades. He was killed during a gun battle in southern Gaza on Wednesday by IDF troops who were initially unaware that they had caught their country's number one enemy, Israeli officials said. The military released a drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building. Hamas has not made any comment itself, but sources within the terror group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed by Israeli troops. 'Chief obstacle' Despite Western hopes of a cease-fire, Sinwar's death could dial up hostilities in the Middle East where the prospect of an even wider conflict has grown. Israel launched a ground campaign in Lebanon this month and is now planning a response to an October 1 missile attack carried out by Iran, an ally of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah. But the demise of the man who planned the attack last year in which fighters killed 1,200 people in Israel and captured more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, could also help push forward stalled efforts to end the war in which Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. U.S. President Joe Biden, who spoke to Netanyahu by phone to congratulate him, said Sinwar's death provided a chance for the conflict in Gaza to finally end and for Israeli hostages to be brought home. The U.S. wants to kick-start talks on a proposal to achieve a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, calling Sinwar the 'chief obstacle' to ending the war. 'That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can’t predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,' he said. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said. Iran indicated no sign the killing would shift its support. 'The spirit of resistance will be strengthened' following the death of Sinwar, its mission to the United Nations said. Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing 'the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel'. The IDF said on Friday it had also killed Muhammad Hassin Ramal, Hezbollah’s commander of the Tayibe area in southern Lebanon. No comfort, no compromise Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was a significant achievement, it would not be complete while hostages are still in Gaza. Avi Marciano, the father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that 'the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell.' 'A little justice, but no comfort,' he said. 'There will be comfort only when Naama, Liri, Agam, Daniela and Karina, our girls' friends, return home.' In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, a displaced Palestinian named Thabet Amour told Reuters the Palestinian fight would continue. 'This is resistance that does not disappear when men disappear,' he said. 'The assassination of Sinwar will not lead to the end of the resistance or to a compromise or surrender and raising the white flag.'

Court indicts Jerusalem man of planning to carry out attack in Te...	Jerusalem District Court charges Ibrahim Al-Ramadi with conspiracy to murder and incitement to terror after he planned to attack hostages' family protest The Jerusalem District Court on Friday indicted Ibrahim Al-Ramadi, a 22-year-old resident of East Jerusalem of planning to carry out a terror attack alongside Hamas terrorists in Tel Aviv during a hostages’ families’ protest in the city. According to the indictment, submitted by Attorney Pua Ben Tov from the Jerusalem District Prosecutor’s Office, the man intended to carry out a terrorist attack against Jews with two other individuals. To this end, he met with a Hamas member and a member of another West Bank terror group to enlist their help. The three planned to conduct an attack using a timed explosive and discussed the best way to carry out an attack that would harm as many Jews as possible. The indictment added that the three considered various options for the attack: placing an explosive at a demonstration advocating for the return of hostages in Tel Aviv, a shooting attack on a bus in the Jordan Valley, kidnapping Jews and placing an explosive on a Jewish bus. At some point, one of the group members decided to back out of the plan and the suspect brought in another person to finalize the details, having decided to carry out the attack in Tel Aviv during a demonstration for the return of the hostages. Detectives from the Israel Police’s Central Unit Jerusalem District Police arrested the man at his home on September 17 following Shin Bet directions. The charges added the suspect incited terrorism, expressed support for a terror organization and made several social media posts praising, sympathizing with and encouraging acts of terror. On October 9, 2023, two days after Hamas’ attack, he posted an image of Hamas terrorist with the caption, 'God, grant victory to Islam and Muslims.' The indictment charges the young man with terrorism charges including conspiracy to murder, expressing support for a terror organization, incitement to terrorism and contact with a foreign agent. The prosecution has requested that the defendant be remanded in custody until the end of the legal proceedings against him. 'The investigation revealed that at some point the man, a supporter of the Jenin Brigades and Hamas, decided to conspire with others from the West Bank to assist in his murderous plots. With their help, he planned to purchase weapons and explosives to carry out terrorist attacks against security forces and civilians,' the Israel Police and Shin Bet said in a joint statement. 'The joint investigation revealed that the terrorist had already written a will, created a social media group called 'Soldiers of God,' and was preparing to execute his plan to attack participants in the protest,' the statement added. 'Fortunately, however, he didn’t manage to acquire the weapons he had planned to use for the attack, as he was arrested by the Shin Bet and the police, thwarting his intentions. He declared that he still intended to carry out an attack even after his arrest, saying, ‘I would have carried out an attack and killed a large number of people if I hadn't been arrested.''

The deputy or a 'strawman': Sinwar's potential heirs in Hamas	The former Hamas leader's sudden elimination leaves the terror group without strong leadership and could shift the center of power abroad; these are his possible replacements Former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s elimination in Gaza on Thursday is sending the Gazan terror group into freefall with speculation about his possible successor. The list of potential Hamas successors includes various senior figures within the terror organization — most of whom reside in Qatar or other countries. While one of the leading candidates is originally from Gaza, the rest are senior members of the terror group’s politburo, indicating Sinwar’s death could shift the power back to leaders overseas. This marks a change after years where the balance of power leaned toward senior Gazan figures. 'Decisions will be returned to Hamas’ branch abroad, which may help push negotiations for a cease-fire forward,' Hamas sources told Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat. 'Sinwar was a true leader — he would promote and remove figures in the movement at his discretion,' A source close to the terror organization's leadership claimed. 'He took control of decision-making in an extreme manner, which was evident from the moment he became head. Communication with him was difficult, complicated and often disrupted.' Sinwar's potential successor will need to be accepted by the terror group’s leadership abroad and likely have some ties to Iran as well. These are the terror group’s possible candidates: Khaled Mashal One potential contender is Khaled Mashal, considered one of the most powerful figures in Hamas's politburo, although his views have differed from Sinwar's — especially regarding ties with Iran. Mashal currently serves as the leader of Hamas’ foreign branch, and headed its politburo for 21 years, from 1996 to 2017, before deciding to step down. In 2021, he was re-elected as the leader of Hamas’ foreign branch in an attempt to return to the Palestinian political arena. In 1997, he survived an assassination attempt in a botched Mossad operation in Jordan. Khalil al-Hayya Khalil al-Hayya, Sinwar's deputy, left the Gaza Strip before October 7, 2023, and has since been one of the senior figures leading negotiations for a cease-fire and a hostage deal on behalf of the terror organization. Al-Hayya also maintains strong ties with Iran, where he traveled following the terror group’s former politburo member Ismail Haniyeh's assassination to attend his funeral. The New York Times reported that al-Hayya was part of the 'closed military council' Sinwar convened over two years to plan the October 7 attack and acted as a special envoy for classified discussions on the matter with Iran and Hezbollah. According to a Gazan source, al-Hayya is seen as having a strong chance of being appointed head of Hamas’ politburo. 'Sinwar groomed him for the role and brought him closer to Iranian elements that support Hamas,' the source said. 'Al-Hayya's power within the group’s politburo is evident today. He’s considered one of the few Sinwar trusted.' Mousa Abu Marzook Mousa Abu Marzook, who served as Haniyeh's deputy when he was head of Hamas' politburo and is regarded as one of the senior figures in the organization's political wing, lived in the U.S. for many years and has since moved between various Arab capitals. Over the past year, he held a series of interviews worldwide, including one where he said that the tunnels built in Gaza were intended to protect Hamas, not the residents of the Strip. 'It's the UN's responsibility to protect them,' he said. Abu Marzouk also played an important role in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. Unlike Mashal, he isn’t not considered a charismatic or influential 'threat' and was often given a platform and spotlight by Haniyeh on various occasions. A 'strawman' candidate? In August, following Haniyeh’s assassination, Saudi networks reported that the person expected to take over as head of Hamas's political bureau was Muhammad Ismail Darwish, who serves as the head of Hamas' Shura Council. It was later revealed that Darwish wasn’t chosen, with Sinwar taking the role instead. Nevertheless, Hamas released a photo of its Shura Council head meeting with Islamic Jihad leader Ziyad al-Nakhalah last August, about two weeks after Sinwar's appointment as head. One figure less likely to take over Hamas' politburo is his brother, Mohammed Sinwar, who has already likely taken over as head of the terror group's armed wing.

Mohammed Sinwar: The ruthless brother who 'came back from the dea...	People would look at the ground when he walked by,' Gazans say of younger brother of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar; rising through the ranks by earning trust and loyalty, he survived numerous assassination attempts, with rumors of his death falsely circulated in the past In December, a brief video from a 4-kilometer-long (2.5-mile-long) mega-tunnel revealed, for the first time, an image of one of Gaza’s most wanted figures: Mohammed Sinwar, the younger brother of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Since the deaths of senior Hamas military commanders, including Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa, Mohammed Sinwar has emerged as the de facto second-in-command of Hamas’ leadership in Gaza, propelled by the unwavering support of his brother. Mohammed Sinwar, 49, was born in Khan Younis and was among the earliest recruits to Hamas, participating in acts of terror during the First Intifada. He was imprisoned in Israel for nine months and later spent three years in a Palestinian Authority prison, escaping in 2000. A Gaza source noted that Sinwar grew up under the ideological influence of Hamas co-founder Abd al-Aziz al-Rantisi. The Sinwar brothers share much in common, including the nickname 'Abu Ibrahim,' given to both after their first sons, named after their father, Ibrahim. Mohammed Sinwar became a trusted confidant of Yahya, one of the few who knew his whereabouts during nearly a year of war. His family ties provided him with a smooth path to the top of Hamas, with no suspicions from within the organization of disloyalty. Mohammed Sinwar’s role was first revealed by Hamas in 2005 when the group broke from its tradition of secrecy and disclosed the identities of seven commanders leading attacks against Israelis and IDF forces. Sinwar was named among them as the commander of the Khan Younis Brigade. At the time, Israel reportedly made three assassination attempts on him—through sniper fire, a double airstrike on his home and an explosive device in the wall of his house, which he uncovered. One of Sinwar's most significant operations was orchestrating the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006, an event that eventually led to the prisoner exchange deal in which his brother Yahya was freed. At the time of the abduction, Mohammed Sinwar served as the commander of the Khan Younis Brigade, conditioning Shalit’s release on the freedom of his brother Yahya, who would later rise to lead Hamas before his death. Loyalty over ability 'Mohammed became a significant player in Hamas' military wing. When Yahya Sinwar was in Israeli prison, he trusted that Mohammed had control over Shalit. Today, it’s clear that Mohammed’s status within the military wing grew due to his proximity to Yahya—who believes in specific people,' said Dr. Yuval Biton, former head of the Intelligence Division in Israel's prison service who knew Yahya well. 'Yahya doesn’t look at abilities; he looks at loyalty, and that’s what drove Mohammed’s rise in Hamas.' Biton explained that Yahya Sinwar likely sought to consolidate power by surrounding himself with trusted figures in the leadership, allowing him to make decisions without opposition. 'As we approached the Shalit deal, the Sinwar brothers opposed it—even though Yahya’s name was at the top of the release list. Yahya pushed Mohammed to convince the leadership to reject the deal, but Saleh al-Arouri and Khaled Mashal supported it and ultimately overruled the Sinwars,' Biton said, referencing a historical moment that led to Yahya’s eventual leadership of Hamas following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. Israel has made repeated attempts on Mohammed Sinwar’s life over the years. His home was bombed during Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, and again in Operation Protective Edge in 2014, though he was not there. During the latter operation, rumors circulated that Sinwar had been killed, with images claiming to show his dead body. However, Sinwar remained elusive, and his name faded from public view until May 2022. Al Jazeera reported that he had not attended his father’s funeral in January 2022, leading some media outlets to refer to him as 'the one who returned from the dead.' In May 2022, Sinwar reemerged in a brief 30-second interview with Al Jazeera, appearing as a silhouette—a technique used for years by Mohammed Deif. 'When we issue warnings to the occupation or send a message, we mean every word, and every letter has weight and impact on the ground,' Sinwar said. 'Precise and focused efforts have been made to establish this, and important equations have been set. When we say this, we know how to identify the occupation’s soft spots and how to press them. We have succeeded in setting important equations, and the enemy calculates its actions accordingly.' 'People would look at the ground when he walked by' Mohammed Sinwar, often referred to as 'the man who returned from the dead,' has instilled fear among Gaza’s population on multiple occasions. Known for his charismatic yet harsh and intimidating persona, Sinwar commands respect but also terror. 'He’s feared as a man capable of killing without hesitation. This family is known for its hot temper, and Mohammed, in particular, is a frightening figure,' said a source in Gaza. After his brother Yahya was released from Israeli prison in the 2011 Shalit deal, Mohammed’s influence grew. 'Yahya only understands power, and that’s Mohammed’s legacy too. He has been involved in numerous executions of collaborators, as well as brutal interrogations and torture in Hamas prisons,' the source added, describing the Sinwar brothers’ role in internal purges before the current war. 'When Mohammed scolds someone, they are paralyzed with fear. No one in Gaza dares to cross him.' The source noted that people were so terrified of Mohammed Sinwar that they avoided eye contact with him. 'People would look at the ground when he walked by, afraid of how he might interpret even a glance.' Mohammed Sinwar is also accused of overseeing harsh torture in Hamas prisons, along with his brother Yahya. One high-profile case involved the former Hamas commander of the Zeitoun Brigade, Mohammed Shetawi, who was executed in February 2016 for moral offenses. Shetawi was reportedly suspected of collaborating with Israel, potentially providing information that led to an assassination attempt on Mohammed Deif. Another version of events, presented by a different Hamas operative, suggests that Shetawi was executed after he criticized Yahya Sinwar in a security report for operational mistakes that led to the deaths of Hamas leaders. Shetawi was later accused of having relationships with the widows of those killed. Either way, Shetawi was executed under the Sinwar brothers' orders after enduring brutal torture. Inside Hamas' mega-tunnel Mohammed Sinwar played a key role in orchestrating Hamas’ October 7 surprise attack on Israel, making him one of the most wanted figures in Gaza. Considered one of the architects of the massacre, Sinwar has now likely succeeded Mohammed Deif, further sharpening the target on his back. In December, two months into the war, the IDF released rare footage showing Sinwar traveling in a jeep with bodyguards through a massive tunnel network, discovered just hundreds of yards from the Israeli community of Netiv HaAsara and the Erez crossing. He was reportedly receiving a briefing from a team of engineers and tunnel diggers, brought in from Khan Younis for the ambitious tunnel project, and toured the tunnel’s twists and turns. In response, the IDF distributed flyers in Gaza, offering a $300,000 reward for information leading to Sinwar’s capture—$100,000 less than the bounty on his brother Yahya. The flyer also featured Rafa Salama, the Khan Younis Brigade commander, and Mohammed Deif, both killed in Israeli airstrikes in July. Salama had a $200,000 bounty on his head, while Deif's was $100,000. In February, IDF forces raided and completely destroyed Mohammed Sinwar’s office at the Al-Qadisiyah post in Khan Younis. Mohammed Sinwar’s current status remains unclear. While IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has not named him among the top Hamas leaders, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant did publicly single him out, alongside his brother Yahya, during a visit to the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza last month. 'We will eliminate Hamas, and we will reach Mohammed Sinwar, as well as Yahya Sinwar. We will get to all of these people, these cursed terrorists,' Gallant declared. 'For anyone who thinks otherwise, look at Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif. They thought they were invincible, and they are no longer with us. They made their mistake, and he will make his too. We will complete our mission.'

Sinwar’s death: A victory tainted by fears for hostages’ fate	Analysis: Hamas leader's unexpected elimination may trigger unforeseen consequences; potential successors, internal uprisings, a Hamas-Iran rift and shifts in Israel’s military strategy are all on the table Shin Bet pressed the IDF to continue operations in the area where Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed, near the tunnel where six hostages were executed in Rafah. Intelligence suggested senior Hamas leaders were hiding in the sector, sometimes even above ground. This assumption ultimately proved correct. While there is satisfaction and even celebration over Sinwar's elimination, Israeli officials are aware that the new reality could bring risks, particularly for the remaining hostages held by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and other terrorist groups in Gaza. Careless moves or premature announcements by Israel at this sensitive time could endanger the hostages. The fact that Sinwar was killed in a direct confrontation with Israeli forces, rather than by an airstrike, may offer some solace to his fanatic supporters, potentially affecting their treatment of hostages. However, the loss of a charismatic religious leader like Sinwar could also incite retaliation and spur desperate acts of revenge, especially from Gaza residents who saw him as a symbol or even a messianic figure. The immediate concern is for the hostages, who are held by unpredictable factions. Their captors’ reactions to Sinwar’s death remain difficult to anticipate. The successor The future dynamics of Gaza, both in the short and long term, will largely depend on who succeeds Sinwar as Hamas leader in the Palestinian enclave and as head of the organization’s political bureau. A key challenge is finding a figure in Gaza with communication channels open to all factions, particularly the Hamas terrorists holding Israeli hostages, and whose decisions are accepted by the various groups involved. If Sinwar’s brother, Mohammed Sinwar, takes over, it is likely that he will be familiar with his late brother’s communication methods with Hamas leadership abroad, particularly in Doha, Qatar. This could enable Egypt and Qatar to establish contact with him. However, Mohammed Sinwar may not command the same authority as his brother, making it harder for him to prevent the 'privatization' of hostage control by families, organizations and armed groups in Gaza. Each of these groups may have its own ideas on how to use the hostages as leverage for their own interests. Another potential successor is Az al-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’ Gaza Brigade. One of the few surviving senior leaders of Hamas’ military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, Haddad is known for his charisma and having survived several Israeli assassination attempts. If Haddad replaces Sinwar, his influence on the fate of the hostages could differ. As a native of northern Gaza, Haddad is considered a commander of the region, including Gaza City, which is under heavy attack and siege by the IDF. He may be more open to negotiations involving easing conditions for northern Gaza residents in exchange for progress on hostage talks. This contrasts with Mohammed Sinwar, former Khan Younis commander, who is known for his ruthlessness and unwavering loyalty to his brother. However, it is unclear whether Haddad has the same lines of communication with Hamas' external leadership as Sinwar did, or whether the various groups holding hostages would listen to him, viewing the hostages as their own 'property.' On the other hand, Yahya Sinwar’s death could potentially work in favor of the hostages if their captors realize that their fate could mirror Sinwar’s unless they reach a deal with Israel. The Gaza question Sinwar’s killing has raised questions about how it will impact the achievement of Israel's war objectives and whether it will hasten the end of the war under conditions that ensure security for southern Israel. Sinwar’s death is expected to deliver a major blow to Hamas’ morale and, in the medium term, significantly reduce the terrorist group’s motivation to continue fighting. Sinwar was seen as a mythic Islamic figure, and the loss of such a leader often dampens the resolve of his followers. Historical precedent suggests that the elimination of charismatic figures has long-term effects. For example, PIJ struggled for a decade following the assassination of its leader Fathi Shaqaqi in Malta in the 1990s, carrying out few attacks during that time. Similarly, the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Iraq led to a retreat of ISIS terrorists from many areas they had controlled. Sinwar’s removal could also embolden many displaced Gazans, now living in dire conditions along the coast in al-Mawasi, to rise up against Hamas, which has diverted humanitarian aid to fund its operations. Both the reaction of Gaza’s population and Hamas terrorists' motivation will depend on who succeeds Sinwar. His brother, Mohammed Sinwar, known like his sibling as 'Abu Ibrahim' after their father, is feared and brutal but lacks his brother’s charisma. Though he was once mentioned as a possible successor to Mohammed Deif after he was killed alongside the Khan Younis brigade commander, Mohammed Sinwar lacks the public authority of other potential leaders, such as Haddad. It is unclear if either of them will be able to assert their authority over Gaza in a way that allows Hamas to maintain its civilian control over large parts of it. If Sinwar’s successor cannot impose order in Gaza or manage humanitarian aid distribution, the Palestinian enclave could descend into chaos, resembling the 'Somalization' of Gaza, where power falls to whoever can assert the most force. Such a scenario would pose a challenge to Israel and a threat to IDF forces, but it might also present an opportunity for Israel to step in, fill the power vacuum and dismantle Hamas’ control in Gaza once and for all. Iranian influence Sinwar was only recently appointed head of Hamas’ political bureau following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. His death leaves behind a critical question: Will Hamas maintain its close relationship with Iran’s mullahs in his absence? During the Syrian Civil War, tensions ran high between Hamas, a Sunni Islamist group, and the Shiite leadership in Tehran, as well as Syria’s Alawite leader, Bashar al-Assad, who is aligned with Shiite Islam. Hamas was expelled from Damascus, where Khaled Mashal led the political bureau, after refusing to support Assad, who had provided refuge to Hamas’ leadership. One of the top contenders to succeed Sinwar as political bureau chief is again Khaled Mashal, currently in Doha. Mashal has long opposed deepening ties with Iran, which could signal a shift in Hamas’ alliances, potentially distancing the group from Tehran and its so-called 'Axis of Resistance.' If Mashal reclaims the leadership role, Hamas may no longer align as closely with Iran’s network of proxies. The uncertainty over Hamas’ leadership could also influence Israeli decision-making regarding potential retaliatory strikes on Iran. While theoretical chances of renewed negotiations might delay action, Israeli officials believe that waiting too long could undermine the legitimacy of a strike, as international attention may quickly fade from Iran’s October 1 missile attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the defense establishment argue that momentum should be seized and suggest that Sinwar’s elimination could actually accelerate plans for a strike. Meanwhile, speculation grows over who might be the next target—perhaps Iran’s Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami or even Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei himself. The Palestinian Authority Negotiations are currently underway between the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Hamas' overseas leadership to explore the possibility of establishing civilian governance in Gaza, as an alternative to Hamas' rule. Sinwar’s vision had been for the PA, under Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, to return to Gaza after being ousted by Hamas in the 2007 coup. Under this arrangement, the PA would manage civilian affairs such as health, education and infrastructure, while Hamas would focus on rebuilding its military power to prepare for future attacks against Israel. If Hamas now fully relinquishes its armed control over Gaza, it could present a significant dilemma for the Israeli government. Netanyahu, along with key political allies like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, are ideologically opposed to PA control in Gaza, fearing it could lead to the establishment of a unified Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Much depends on whether Hamas can appoint a new leader to replace Sinwar, and who that leader will be. Only after this is clear can realistic predictions be made about the future. For now, the news of Sinwar’s death is tempered by concerns for the fate of Israeli hostages and uncertainty over how, if at all, his death will impact the course of the war in Gaza.

Regional states signal increased involvement in post-war Gaza fol...	Foreign leaders note increased willingness to engage in Gaza’s rehabilitation and establishing alternative authority to Hamas; IDF confirms Sinwar tried fleeing north; Biden, Netanyahu agree Sinwar’s killing presents opportunity to advance hostage talks Israel received messages Thursday from several regional countries expressing a stronger interest and motivation to be involved in the post-war governance of Gaza following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Sinwar’s elimination, seen as a major obstacle, could affect not only hostage negotiations but also future plans for Gaza’s reconstruction and governance. Throughout Thursday, Israeli officials held talks with foreign leaders, including those in the Middle East, noting increased willingness to engage in Gaza’s rehabilitation and in establishing an alternative authority to Hamas. Various Middle Eastern countries have been linked to discussions about Gaza’s future. In May, The New York Times reported that senior aides to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explored a post-war plan involving shared control of Gaza with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the U.S., in exchange for normalization with Saudi Arabia. However, in September, UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed cast doubt on the plan, saying his country would not support post-war efforts in Gaza without the establishment of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, Israeli officials believe Hamas' overseas leadership has now become the central player in the hostage negotiations, making the pressure from mediators more effective after Sinwar’s death. The U.S. views Sinwar’s killing as an opportunity to expedite the war’s conclusion and facilitate a hostage deal. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the matter with his Qatari counterpart. One of the key questions following Sinwar's death is what will be done with his body. Israel has yet to make a decision, but officials familiar with the matter suggested that if required during hostage negotiations, Israel would be willing to return Sinwar’s body as part of a deal. Israeli officials speculated that Sinwar may have been planning to flee to Egypt, pointing to forged passports found at the location where he was killed. There had been significant concern in Israel over the possibility of Sinwar being on the run and disconnected from his organization. However, in a statement, the IDF confirmed that Sinwar had been 'in flight and trying to escape north.' In a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, it was revealed that U.S. President Joe Biden called Netanyahu from Air Force One to congratulate him on the successful operation. Biden reportedly praised the IDF's efforts, and the two leaders agreed on the importance of seizing this opportunity to secure the release of the hostages, committing to work together toward that goal.

Biden heads to Germany for talks on Ukraine, Middle East	U.S. President Joe Biden took off for Berlin on Thursday for a short visit to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine with the leaders of Germany, France and Britain as Kyiv urges its Western allies to take immediate action to end the fighting. The conflict in the Middle East is also expected to be high on the agenda in talks between the leaders, as the Biden administration hopes Israel's killing of Hamas official Yahya Sinwar could bring a ceasefire in Gaza closer to fruition. Biden had originally been scheduled to convene a broader meeting of Ukraine's military supporters at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany last week during a planned three-day state visit to the country that would have been the first in nearly 40 years. He canceled that trip to focus on dealing with Hurricane Milton but is making up for it with the quick visit this week. The Ramstein meeting will be held virtually in November, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. The president now will land late on Thursday in Berlin and hold bilateral talks on Friday morning with Germany's president and chancellor, before a planned meeting with the leaders of Germany, France and Britain.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1y1keyeje	2024-10-17T13:09:59-07:00	
US to kickstart Gaza cease-fire talks after Sinwar's death, State...	The United States wants to kickstart talks on a proposal to achieve a cease-fire and the release of hostages in Gaza, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Thursday, after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, which he called a 'seismic event.' Miller told a regular press briefing that Sinwar had been the 'chief obstacle' to reaching an end to the war, which began when Sinwar orchestrated an attack on southern Israel in which Palestinian terrorists killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. The Biden administration has worked unsuccessfully for months with mediators Qatar and Egypt to try to reach a deal that would see Israel cease operations in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas in the attack just over a year ago. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said. 'That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can't predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a cease-fire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one,' he said. Washington would now 'redouble' its efforts and try to push forward the cease-fire proposal 'that has been on the table for some time,' Miller said, without detailing the proposal.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1t00ry1ekl	2024-10-17T13:08:41-07:00

Sinwar’s desperate last moments: Tried to down drone with stick b...	IDF forces identify 3 terrorists in Rafah, opening fire as Hamas leader flees to nearby building and hides on second floor; his body found during sweeps day after; Bislach soldier severely wounded in incident WARNING: This article contains graphic images. The encounter that led to the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Wednesday was part of the IDF’s ongoing efforts to locate and destroy tunnels in Rafah. Sinwar was killed after the building he was in collapsed on top of him, as well as shrapnel from two types of munitions: a Merkava Mark 4 tank shell fired by the 460th Brigade and a Matador missile made by Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The incident began around 10 a.m. when a 450th Battalion soldier spotted a suspicious figure entering and exiting a building, alerting his commander, who ordered fire in response. At 3 p.m., IDF forces, using a drone, identified three figures leaving the building, attempting to move from house to house. Two figures were covered with blankets, walking ahead of Sinwar to clear the way. The 450th Battalion commander opened fire on the group, causing them to scatter. Two terrorists fled into one building, and Sinwar into another. Sinwar moved to the second floor of the building, and the IDF responded by firing a tank shell at it. As the IDF Infantry Commanders School (Bislach) unit began to sweep the building, two grenades were thrown at them—one exploded, the other did not. The troops pulled back and sent a drone, which detected an injured figure, face covered, sitting in a room and attempting to knock the drone out of the air with a stick. The next sweep of the building occurred at dawn, when troops discovered a body with recognizable features, leading to the identification process, which was completed in the evening. 'We knew Sinwar’s estimated location for a while despite the high level of secrecy Hamas maintained around him,' said an IDF official. 'We knew he had been in Rafah, and we focused on uncovering the underground infrastructure there to find him.' The IDF also revealed that 'a few weeks ago, in a similar underground operation, we discovered a room with evidence suggesting Sinwar had been in the same complex. Even yesterday, we weren’t sure if Sinwar had escaped to Khan Younis. This is a significant achievement that should translate into a strategic one.' The IDF is still investigating the identity of the two terrorists who were with Sinwar, and it remains unclear whether one was a Hamas battalion commander. 'Hamas continued operating even when Sinwar was out of contact,' the army official noted. 'There are other senior figures within Hamas, and they have a structured chain of command. There’s Hamas abroad, and Sinwar's brother, Mohammed.' The Bislach commander who led the sweep and identified Sinwar was wounded at the beginning of the war when he joined the fight at the Gaza border, losing soldiers in the same battle. During Wednesday's encounter that led to Sinwar’s death, a soldier from the 450th Battalion was severely injured by gunfire from the two terrorists who escaped into a nearby building. The wounded soldier, a resident of a Druze village in northern Israel, was evacuated to Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva, where he is currently in intensive care. His condition is stable, with a gunshot wound to his upper body. His father said the soldier's commanders had briefed the family on the events. 'My son was the first to engage, and they attacked him. He was later struck by a bullet. He’s not speaking yet but communicates with us using his hands,' he said. The soldier's uncle called him 'a hero of Israel' and said, 'For a year they hunted Sinwar, and now they’ve got him.' Earlier Thursday, the IDF officially confirmed Sinwar’s killing in Rafah’s Tel Sultan neighborhood. 'The leader of the Hamas terrorist organization, responsible for the October 7 massacre, has been eliminated,' a statement read. 'Sinwar orchestrated and executed the deadly attack and promoted his murderous ideology throughout the war and beforehand, making him responsible for the murder and abduction of many Israelis.' The IDF and Shin Bet highlighted that 'Sinwar was killed after a year of hiding within Gaza’s civilian population, both above ground and in Hamas tunnels. The dozens of operations carried out by the IDF and Shin Bet over the past year, and particularly in recent weeks, restricted Sinwar’s movement and led to his elimination.' In a recorded statement following Sinwar’s killing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, 'The man responsible for the worst massacre in our people's history since the Holocaust has been killed. We have settled the score with him. Evil has taken a hard blow, but our mission is not yet complete.' Addressing Gaza’s residents and the terrorists holding hostages, he added, 'Sinwar destroyed your lives. He told you he was a lion, but in reality, he hid in a dark den—and he was killed while fleeing in panic from our soldiers. His elimination marks an important milestone in the downfall of Hamas' reign of evil.'

Cash, UNRWA ID, weapons—and Mentos: The items found on Sinwar’s b...	IDF forces discover large sums of cash, identification documents and numerous weapons alongside bodies of slain Hamas leader and senior terrorists killed with him during Rafah operation Large amounts of cash, an UNRWA ID card and various weapons were discovered alongside the bodies of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and senior terrorists killed with him in Rafah’s Tel Sultan neighborhood, the IDF confirmed Thursday. Also found at the scene were Mentos candies. The IDF officially confirmed Sinwar’s killing after his body was identified. In the statement, the IDF said, 'Sinwar orchestrated the October 7 massacre and promoted his murderous ideology both before and during the war, making him responsible for the murder and abduction of many Israelis.' According to the IDF and Shin Bet, Sinwar had been hiding for a year among Gaza’s civilian population, both above ground and in Hamas tunnels. Numerous operations by the IDF and Shin Bet over the past year, particularly in the weeks leading up to his death, restricted his movements and eventually led to his elimination. Unlike other high-profile assassinations during Operation Iron Swords, such as those of Mohammed Deif and Hassan Nasrallah, Sinwar’s killing resulted from an unplanned encounter. Soldiers from the Infantry Commanders and Combat Training School (Bislach), conducting a counterterrorism sweep, identified and killed three terrorists in a booby-trapped building, unaware that one of them was Sinwar. Ynet military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai reported that Shin Bet had insisted the IDF continue operations in Tel Sultan, suspecting Hamas leaders might be present, sometimes even above ground. An earlier airstrike had targeted a tunnel in the area where the IDF believed Sinwar was hiding, but he was not found there. The bodies of the terrorists were first examined using drones due to the presence of explosives. One body resembled Sinwar, leading soldiers to suspect they had killed the Hamas leader by chance. To confirm Sinwar’s identity, soldiers took photographs of the body, which were sent to the police forensic unit. As first reported by Ynet, Sinwar’s identity was confirmed through dental records, with fingerprint analysis later corroborating the identification. Another key indicator of Sinwar’s presence was the identity of one of the terrorists killed alongside him, who was known to be close to the Hamas leader. According to reports from Gaza, the two other terrorists killed were Sinwar’s bodyguards, one of whom was also a teacher for UNRWA, while the other was a senior official in Hamas' National Security Office. It was later reported that one of the terrorists might have been Muhammad Shabana, the commander of Hamas' Rafah Brigade.

Trump blames Ukraine's Zelensky for starting war with Russia	Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump on Thursday blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for helping start that nation's war with Russia, a comment that further suggests Trump is likely to radically shift U.S. policy toward Ukraine if he wins the Nov. 5 election. The former president has frequently criticized Zelensky on the campaign trail, repeatedly calling him 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for having solicited and received billions of dollars of U.S. military aid since the war broke out in 2022. Trump has also slammed the Ukrainian leader for failing to seek peace with Moscow, and he has suggested Ukraine may have to cede some of its land to Russia to make a peace deal, a concession Kyiv considers unacceptable. Trump's comments on the PBD Podcast on Thursday with Patrick Bet-David went a step further than his previous criticism. He said Zelensky was to blame not just for failing to end the war, but for helping start it, even though the conflict broke out when Russia invaded Ukrainian sovereign territory. 'That doesn't mean I don't want to help him because I feel very badly for those people. But he should never have let that war start. The war's a loser,' Trump said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r10we1jx1g	2024-10-17T12:09:15-07:00

'Justice has been served,' Harris told reporters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 'Sinwar was responsible for the killing of thousands of innocent people, including the victims of October 7 and hostages killed in Gaza.' 'This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,' Harris said. 'Today I can only hope that the families of the victims of Hamas feel a sense and measure of relief.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjzckyjgkx	2024-10-17T12:06:47-07:00	
IDF names 5 Golani commandos killed in fierce battle in southern ...	Maj. Ofek Bachar, Capt. Elad Siman Tov, Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder, Staff Sgt. Yakov Hillel and Staff Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom, all of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, reportedly ambushed by terrorists while sweeping building for terror infrastructure Five elite Golani Brigade soldiers were killed on Wednesday during an intense firefight in a southern Lebanese village near the Israeli border, the IDF reported on Thursday. Among the fallen, all of the Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, were Maj. Ofek Bachar, 24, a company commander, from Nes Ziona; Capt. Elad Siman Tov, 23, a platoon commander, from Tzofim; Staff Sgt. Elyashiv Eitan Wieder, 22, a squad commander, from Jerusalem; Staff Sgt. Yaakov Hillel, 21, from Jerusalem; and Staff Sgt. Yehudah Dror Yahalom, 21, from Hebron. According to an initial IDF probe, the Golani Reconnaissance Unit entered a multi-story building in a Lebanese village near the western sector of the border at around 5 p.m. The mission was based on intelligence reports indicating the presence of terrorist infrastructure. As the unit approached, the building came under aerial fire. Roughly 30 minutes into the search, during which the soldiers discovered several weapons caches and underground positions, gunfire erupted from a stairwell. Four Hezbollah terrorists, who had concealed themselves in the building, opened fire at close range. The ensuing firefight resulted in the deaths of the five soldiers, including the company commander. The Golani troops returned fire, killing the terrorists. Three soldiers were pronounced dead at the scene, while two others later succumbed to their injuries at the hospital. Five additional soldiers were wounded, including the company's deputy commander, with three sustaining serious injuries. Air support provided cover fire, allowing medevac helicopters to extract the casualties to a hospital in Israel within an hour. The IDF is now investigating how the Hezbollah terrorists evaded detection during the building sweep, despite the soldiers' professional conduct. Golani Brigade forces have been operating in southern Lebanon for two weeks, initially in the village of Maroun al-Ras before expanding to other areas to neutralize Hezbollah's Radwan forces, which pose an invasion threat to northern Israel. The troops have uncovered and destroyed advanced Hezbollah weaponry near the border and killed more than 10 Hezbollah militants in recent days. In separate incidents, a soldier from the Golani Brigade's 12th Battalion and a reservist officer from the 6th Brigade's 8173rd Battalion were seriously wounded in fighting in southern Lebanon. Two additional reservists from the 8173rd Battalion were also wounded.

Netanyahu: Sinwar's killing marks 'beginning of day after Hamas'	In video statement, PM calls Hamas leader's death turning point in war and urges Gaza residents to release hostages or face consequences, declaring collapse of Hamas rule imminent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday evening called the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar a pivotal moment in the ongoing war and the 'beginning of the day after Hamas.' 'Sinwar ruined your lives,' he said in a video statement, addressing Gaza’s residents. 'Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. This is the beginning of the day after Hamas. 'The mastermind behind the worst massacre of our people since the Holocaust, a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands of Israelis and the abduction of hundreds, has been eliminated by our heroic soldiers.' He reassured the families of the hostages, saying, 'This is an important moment in the war. We will continue with all our strength until your loved ones, who are also our loved ones, are brought home. This is our highest commitment.' Netanyahu called on Gaza’s residents to release the hostages. 'Sinwar’s elimination marks a significant milestone in the collapse of Hamas’ rule,' he said. 'To the terrorists, I say: Your leaders are fleeing, and they will be eliminated. I call on anyone holding our hostages—lay down your weapons and return them, and you will be allowed to leave and live. But if you harm our hostages, you will be held accountable, and your fate will be sealed.' Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, speaking at the Gaza border, also called on Gaza residents to surrender. 'Sinwar ended his life beaten, hunted and fleeing, not as a commander but as someone who only cared for himself,' he said. 'This is a clear message to the families of the fallen and the hostages, as well as to Gaza residents: the man who brought disaster upon you is gone. Now is the time to release the hostages and surrender. Israel has closed a long-standing account with Sinwar—a vile murderer who planned and executed the October 7 massacre.' President Isaac Herzog commended the IDF, Shin Bet and security forces for the killing of Sinwar. 'Sinwar, the mastermind behind the deadly October 7 attack, has for years been responsible for heinous acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians, citizens of other countries, and the murder of thousands of innocent people. His evil endeavors were dedicated to terror, bloodshed, and destabilizing the Middle East,' he said in a statement. 'Now, more than ever, we must act in every way possible to bring back the 101 hostages who are still being held in horrific conditions by Hamas terrorists in Gaza.' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar visited the site in Gaza where Sinwar was killed, accompanied by Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, Operations Directorate head Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk and Gaza Division commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram. Halevi praised the soldiers, saying, 'Your professionalism and determination led to this—one year later [after the October 7 massacre], we have settled the score with Sinwar.' Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also praised the IDF for the killing of Sinwar, saying, 'Congratulations to the IDF and the entire nation of Israel for eliminating the mass murderer. Now the IDF must ensure that every resident in Gaza knows Sinwar is dead, while intensifying military pressure and offering safe passage and financial incentives to those who return the hostages and lay down their arms.' National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called it a 'historic elimination in Rafah' and urged the continuation of the offensive 'until total victory.'

IDF confirms Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in Gaza operation	Military and Shin Bet confirm arch-terrorist killed on Wednesday in clash with Israeli forces in southern Gaza where operations intensified based on intelligence pinpointing whereabouts of senior Hamas leaders The IDF and Shin Bet confirmed Thursday that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in an operation in southern Gaza the day before after a year-long manhunt. Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre and responsible for the abduction and murder of numerous Israelis, was eliminated by IDF soldiers from the Southern Command. According to a statement, Sinwar had evaded capture for the past year, hiding among Gaza's civilian population and within Hamas’ underground tunnel network. His operational movement was increasingly restricted by a series of IDF and Shin Bet operations, leading to his eventual elimination. In recent weeks, IDF and Shin Bet forces, under Southern Command, intensified operations in southern Gaza based on intelligence pinpointing the whereabouts of senior Hamas leaders. Soldiers from the IDF’s 828th Brigade encountered and killed three terrorists during the operation. After identifying the body, officials confirmed that one of the terrorists was Yahya Sinwar.

Israeli shekel surges on reports of Sinwar's death	Reports of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing led to an immediate strengthening of the Israeli shekel against foreign currencies on Thursday evening. Two days after a negative inflation report reduced the likelihood of the Bank of Israel raising interest rates, the shekel gained strength without any rate hike. The dollar dropped by nearly 0.75% in after-hours trading, settling at around 3.73 shekels compared to the earlier official exchange rate of 3.7630 set before the Sukkot holiday, which had seen a 0.4% increase. Against the euro, the shekel strengthened even further, rising by approximately 1.4% to trade at around 4.03 shekels, compared to the official rate of 4.0956 shekels set before the holiday, which had seen a 0.2% increase. The shekel's rise follows news that IDF forces killed three terrorists in Gaza during a surprise encounter, including Sinwar, the leader of Hamas.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/r1gzj6rk1e	2024-10-17T09:45:28-07:00

Hamas leader reportedly hid in same tunnel as hostages Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov before they were killed by captors in August; IDF investigating whether hostages murdered during Sinwar’s escape Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was likely killed in an IDF raid Thursday, had been in a Rafah tunnel with six Israeli hostages—Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Carmel Gat and Alex Lobanov—who were executed by their captors in late August. Israeli authorities have evidence placing Sinwar in the tunnel where the hostages were held, though it remains unclear when he left. The IDF is investigating whether the hostages were killed during his escape. The bodies of the six hostages were discovered with gunshot wounds to the head and other parts of their bodies, with signs of mistreatment. Some bore indications of prior injuries from their initial capture that had been treated. One of the hostages showed signs of being tied up, and the condition of the bodies suggested they had been neglected for an extended period. Sinwar's death came during a surprise encounter in Gaza, where IDF soldiers killed three terrorists, initially unaware that one of them was Sinwar. His identity was later confirmed, and his body is being transported to Israel. Michal Lobanov, the widow of Alex Lobanov, reacted to the news on Instagram, writing: 'Keeping such a huge secret inside, knowing he surrounded himself with you, our angels—he chose you, he killed you, he destroyed our lives. My love, now my circle is complete. Nothing will ease the pain, but now you can celebrate up there. Celebrate, it's over. But please, let the hostages come home. This victory isn’t sweet without them.' Gil Dikman, cousin of Carmel Gat, added: 'The account isn’t settled until the last hostage is returned.'

Sinwar’s body identified by dental records: Meet the soldiers who...	Without prior intelligence, IDF Bislah troops encounter and kill 3 terrorists during counterterrorism operation, later realizing they may have eliminated Hamas leader and October 7 massacre mastermind WARNING: This article contains graphic images. The soldiers responsible for what is likely one of the most significant Israeli military achievements in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war are from the IDF's Infantry Commanders and Combat Training School, commonly known by its Hebrew acronym Bislah. While clearing a terrorist stronghold, the troops identified and eliminated three terrorists in a booby-trapped building, which had previously been partially demolished by the IDF. IDF forces discovered large amounts of Israeli cash and identifying documents on the terrorists' bodies. Due to the presence of explosives and grenades, drones were initially used to examine the bodies. One of the terrorists bore a strong resemblance to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, leading troops to believe they may have killed him unintentionally, without prior intelligence. The exact location of the raid remains undisclosed for security reasons. To confirm Sinwar’s identity, soldiers photographed the body and sent the images to the Israeli police’s forensic unit. Assistant Commissioner Aliza Raziel, head of the unit, confirmed that the teeth in the photos matched Sinwar's dental records from his time in Israeli custody. 'We had Sinwar’s dental data on file, and the match was clear,' Raziel said. 'This was one of the most significant moments this year, allowing us to quickly provide critical information to the field.' Further evidence suggesting Sinwar’s death included the presence of a senior Hamas commander known to frequently accompany him. Reports from Gaza indicated the other two terrorists killed were Sinwar’s bodyguards, one of whom worked as a teacher for UNRWA and the other a high-ranking official in Hamas’ National Security Office. The IDF confirmed the killing of three terrorists and is investigating whether one was Sinwar. The military clarified that, despite rumors, the terrorists’ identities have not yet been officially verified and that no hostages were found at the site. Senior Israeli officials later said that the chances Sinwar was killed were 'very high.' A spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that families of the hostages had been informed that no hostages were present at the scene. 'Sinwar was likely killed, and Israel remains committed to pursuing all those responsible for the October 7 attacks,' a senior official added. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant posted a brief message on X (formerly Twitter), quoting the Bible: ''You will chase your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.' Leviticus 26:7.' The post was accompanied by images of senior terrorist leaders Mohammed Deif and Hassan Nasrallah marked with an X, and another image of an X on a black background—an apparent reference to the potential killing of Sinwar.

Reports of Sinwar’s death cause confusion in Arab media	Despite no official confirmation, Arab media outlets quick to declare Hamas leader dead; terror group yet to respond to reports; while some Palestinians celebrate online, others remark he likely died above ground, not in tunnels Reports of the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Tuesday have left Arab media in confusion. While speculation grows that Sinwar was killed, Israeli officials have yet to confirm it officially. However, some Arab outlets, citing unnamed sources, quickly published claims that Sinwar had been killed, with several relying on photos from the scene. Hamas has so far declined to comment or confirm whether Sinwar was among those killed. Social media users in Gaza and across the Arab world reacted with skepticism to the reports, especially those from Israeli media. Some expressed hope the identification was wrong, with one post reading, 'God, let it not be him, may he remain a thorn in the filthy occupier's throat.' Others admitted that the resemblance between Sinwar and the body in the circulated images was undeniable, saying, 'It seems to be him.' On Arab social networks, some praised Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre, for reportedly dying in battle rather than hiding in tunnels. 'Sinwar became a martyr in combat, not in a tunnel,' one post read. Arab media outlets primarily echoed Israeli reports, with Asharq Al-Awsat noting that the Israeli military was investigating whether Sinwar had been killed by chance, while Sky News Arabia went further, reporting, 'A source confirmed to Sky News Arabia that Sinwar was killed in a clash with Israeli forces in Rafah.'

Yahya Sinwar: The end of the October 7 massacre mastermind	Sentenced to hundreds of years for murdering Palestinians, he spent 22 years in Israeli prison, where he had brain surgery; released in the 2011 Shalit deal, he quickly rose through Hamas' ranks; Now, Israel believes the arch-terrorist is likely dead For 22 years, Yahya Sinwar was imprisoned in Israel, where he underwent a life-saving surgery. Released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange deal, Sinwar quickly rose through Hamas' ranks in Gaza. In 2017, he was elected to lead Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and just months ago, he was appointed head of the terrorist group's political bureau. Now, Israeli military and intelligence forces are investigating whether Sinwar—the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre—was killed during an IDF operation in Gaza. Israeli officials estimate the likelihood of his death as 'very high.' Born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in October 1962, the same camp as senior Hamas commander Mohammed Deif, Sinwar co-founded Hamas' internal security wing, Majd, responsible for identifying Palestinian collaborators with Israel. As a 'successful' hunter of collaborators, Sinwar personally executed over 10 Palestinians suspected of working with Israeli authorities. It was these murders, rather than the killing of Israelis, that led to his arrest and 1989 sentencing to five life terms in prison—earning him the nickname 'The Butcher of Khan Younis.' In 1987, Sinwar received a tip that a man named Rasmi Salim had 'abandoned Islam.' He sought permission from Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to kill Salim, then tracked him with other operatives, kidnapping him at knifepoint. Under violent interrogation by Sinwar, Salim allegedly confessed to collaborating with Israel and acting against Islamic principles, after which Sinwar and his associates executed him. In 2008, while in Israeli prison, Sinwar underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor. He was released in 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit exchange, and upon returning to Gaza, his rapid rise to power began. In a speech following his release, Sinwar called on Hamas’ military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, to continue kidnapping Israeli soldiers to secure the release of more Palestinian prisoners. 'The release of prisoners will only be achieved through the kidnapping of Jews and swapping them,' he said, predicting that such exchanges were much closer than expected. Sinwar quickly consolidated power in Gaza, gaining support and becoming Hamas' most powerful figure in 2017, eclipsing Ismail Haniyeh. Under his leadership, Hamas in Gaza overtook Hamas' external leadership, shifting the center of power within the organization. Earlier this year, following Haniyeh’s assassination in late July, Sinwar was elected head of the entire Hamas movement. In 2018, Sinwar gave a rare interview with Italian journalist Francesca Borri, saying, 'War is not in anyone’s interest, certainly not ours. Who wants to confront a nuclear power with slingshots? War achieves nothing,' while adding, 'I won’t say I won’t fight again, but I don’t want more wars. I want the siege to end. My first commitment is to my people—to defend them and their right to freedom and independence.' Sinwar is also believed to have orchestrated the deadly October 7 terror attacks. Earlier this month, it was revealed that for over two years, he convened senior Hamas officials in a special 'military council' where they meticulously planned the attack. The New York Times reported that the protocols of these meetings, which were captured by the IDF in a tunnel Sinwar had used to escape, detailed Hamas’ preparations and deception campaign aimed at misleading Israel about its intentions. Since the attack, Israeli forces have been hunting Sinwar. In February, IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari revealed footage of Sinwar, uncovered by Israeli ground forces in Gaza, showing him three days into the war alongside his brother Ibrahim, one of his wives and children. Presenting the video, Hagari said, 'This footage is a result of our pursuit of Sinwar. The manhunt will not stop until we capture him, dead or alive. We are determined to get him.' Sinwar’s younger brother, Mohammed, 48, founded Hamas’ security apparatus and was behind the 2006 kidnapping of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. During Shalit’s captivity, Mohammed reportedly swore to his associates in Khan Younis, 'If I don’t bring Yahya back to our mother, there will be no deal.' Mohammed Sinwar remains one of Hamas’ top officials in Gaza today.

Western diplomats warn against prolonged Lebanon war	Envoys say UNIFIL mandate in the 2006 UN resolution must be amended and ask Israelis not to give Hezbollah an excuse to remain a major player in Lebanon by occupying territory there; say many hope to see the back of the terror group Western diplomats voiced concerns that the fighting in Lebanon could turn into a prolonged war. They expressed distrust of Israel's claims that the offensive in South Lebanon was a limited one, which could explain the fierce opposition of UNIFIL to remove its forces from the fighting. The diplomats agreed that the peacekeepers' mandate was insufficient and said it would have to be amended in a future agreement. They said that despite the severe blow inflicted on Hezbollah recently, the terror group has a leadership that can make decisions. 'There is an understanding in the international community of the severity of the threat from Hezbollah. There must clearly be a different solution in South Lebanon and the situation cannot return to what it was. The West must examine how it can contribute to negotiations.' The diplomats said many in Lebanon would be happy to see the last of Hezbollah but an Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory would only justify Hezbollah's position to act. 'Don't give them excuses,' they said. 'Israel needs a system to enforce a new deal, that includes boots on the ground,' they said adding that Israel is wrong not to be in dialogue with allies and cannot achieve all of its goals in Lebanon. 'Israel had successes and must use them as leverage to reach an agreement.'

Netanyahu says France should stand by Israel in fight for joint v...	PM says Israel and France should work together to return stability to Lebanon, asks how many Hezbollah missiles UNIFIL managed to prevent and slams Macron for distorting history Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said France should change its position and stand by Israel so that the two countries can work together to bring stability back to Lebanon. Netanyahu spoke with the French daily Le Figaro after French President Emmanuel Macron criticized the Israeli leader in a closed government meeting, saying that Israel was created by a UN decision and thus cannot disregard UN resolutions. In response, Netanyahu's office issued a statement criticizing Macron's remarks and evoking the French government's collaboration with the Nazis occupation during World War II. Netanyahu told Le Figaro that Israel does not receive weapons from France and expects its nearing allies to support its fight against the terror of Iran and its proxies. He said the fight against Hamas, Hezbollah and the Iranian regime is a fight for the values Israel and Europeans share. The prime minister also said Macron had distorted history in his remarks and said the United Nation's recognition of the right of the Jewish people to a homeland did not create the state of Israel. 'The Jewish people were connected to the land of Israel for 3,500 years and the state was established by those who fought for its independence including Holocaust survivors. He repeated his position that Israel must maintain security control from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu also said Israel was not opposed to the presence of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon but claimed Hezbollah used the peacekeepers' positions to for protection as they launched missiles against Israel and had dug underground tunnels and fortifications where large amounts of the newest Russian-made weapons were stored. He told the French publication that since the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon war, and the security council's vote to pass resolution 1701, it was not enforced at all. 'How many Hezbollah missiles had UNIFIL prevented? Zero,' he said. Netanyahu told Le Figaro that a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia was possible and could come earlier than expected.

German warship shoots down drone off Lebanon	corvette Ludwigshafen am Rhein deployed with UNIFIL peacekeepers; German defense ministry says drone parts being taken out of the sea for inspection A German warship operating as part of the UNIFIL peacekeepers mission on Thursday shot down a drone off the coast of Lebanon, the Defense Ministry in Berlin said. 'The corvette brought an unidentified unmanned aerial vehicle into the water in a controlled crash,' the spokesperson said, reporting no damage to the German vessel or its crew. 'The corvette Ludwigshafen am Rhein is continuing its duties,' he added. Germany's DPA news agency reported the incident and said the ship's defense systems shot down the unidentified unmanned aircraft. This was the first time the corvette was involved in a military incident in years and also the first reported incident of a drone being shot down by anyone other than the IDF. According to the report, the drone was shot down northeast of the Lebanese border town of Al Naqoura, at some distance from the shore, and at a close proximity to the German ship. Parts of the drone were retrieved from the sea and were being examined. There are 60 German crew members and additional soldiers onboard the vessel. The incident comes as Israel faces international outrage after incidents of shots fired by the IDF at peacekeepers in South Lebanon. Israel denied targeting the UNIFIL troops and said it repeatedly asked the forces to withdraw from the area where fighting against Hezbollah was underway, to avoid harm. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hezbollah was using UNIFIL positions as cover for their attacks against Israel. Italy's defense minister said on Thursday that the U.N. peacekeeping mission to Lebanon is vital to ending the war in the region and needs to be strengthened and not withdrawn from combat zones as Israel has demanded. 'Israel needs to understand that these (U.N.) soldiers are not working for any one side. They are there to help maintain peace and promote regional stability,' Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told parliament on Thursday. He said the resolution establishing the UNIFIL mandate was last revised in 2006 and needed updating. 'UNIFIL is a complex mission with a mandate that is difficult to implement, has inadequate rules of engagement and forces that are not equipped for the current conflict,' he said. Crosetto has called on the United Nations to update its operational capacity, including creating a rapid deployment force to enhance UNIFIL's freedom of movement and give them more firepower. 'The practical disconnect between the assigned mission and the capacity to implement it makes it more necessary than ever to rethink and strengthen UNIFIL,' Crosetto said. Italian President Giorgia Meloni was due to visit Beirut on Friday.

Arqchi reportedly prepares visit to Egypt of Iranian president; officials in Jerusalem concerned after long-serving Abbas Kamal leaves mediator role during crisis in Israel-Egypt relations Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi arrived in Cairo on Thursday to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his counterpart Badr Abdelatty. This was the first official visit to Egypt by a senior Iranian minister in a decade. The president's palace said the meeting focused on regional developments, with al-Sisi reiterating Egypt's call to avoid the expansion of conflict and the need to halt escalation to prevent a full-scale regional war. 'Araqchi emphasized the importance of continuing efforts to explore prospects for mutual development of relations between the two countries,' the statement added. Araqchi arrived for 'important talks with Egypt's high-ranking officials that will be held tomorrow,' Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said in a post on X on Wednesday, after stops in countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq and Lebanon. The Qatari Al Araby al Jadeed reported that the minister was preparing a visit by Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian. Relations between Egypt and Iran have generally been fraught in recent decades but the two countries have stepped up high-level diplomatic contacts since the eruption of the Gaza crisis last year as Egypt tried to play a mediating role. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty traveled to Tehran in July to attend the country's presidential inauguration. The visit comes just one day after the announcement in Cairo that al Sisi decided to replace his long-time Intelligence chief Abbas Kamel who was an active participant in the mediation efforts to secure a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. Israeli officials said they were concerned about the move. Kamel who has been head General Intelligence agency since 2018, was a well-known and respected figure in Jerusalem who had strong ties to Israeli and American security officials. Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar met Kamel in Cairo earlier in the week. Kamel who had recently asked to delegate some of his heavy workload after suffering health problems, according to reports, will be appointed an advisor to the president and is to be replaced by Major General Hassan Mahmoud Rashad who had previously been his deputy. Rashad is not known in Israel and he is stepping into his new role at a time when Israeli-Egyptian relations are in crisis over the war in Gaza and the Israeli insistence to control the Gaza-Egypt border and the Philadelphi Corridor that runs along it. Negotiations to bring a cease-fire in the Gaza war have also stalled and according to the Qatari prime minister, there has been no discussion with the parties to the conflict in over three weeks. 'Basically in the last three to four weeks, there is no conversation or engagement at all, and we are just moving in the same circle with the silence from all parties,' Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday.

How Israel-Norway relations crashed| 'Since the Oslo Accords, we'...	From strong affinity and alliance, Norway's positions shift to support of Hamas, an arms embargo and international arrest warrants for Israeli leaders although some in the Jewish community insist government positions differ from public sentiments It wasn’t always this way. The collapse of Israel-Norway relations - as illustrated in recent months with Norway’s recognition of a Palestinian state and Israel’s diplomatic blitz against Norway – is reminiscent of an ugly divorce, each partner taking out their years of pent-up anger and resentment on the other. It began as a love story between two countries who found common ground, caring for one another and optimistically trying to bring peace to the Middle East. Three decades later, the experiment blew up in dissolution. 'I think Norway’s unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state is an admission of failure,' says Hilde Henriksen Waage (65) of Oslo University, a leading expert on Israel-Norway relations and the Oslo process in Norway. 'After the Cold War, in Norway, there was a desire to build up an image to make it stand out and remind the US that we’re here, that we’re more than a border with Russia and that contrary to our geographical location, we’re in the middle of the action. It was decided we’d offer the world peace. And it’s failed. Not only is there no peace, but things have gotten much worse. And the finger’s being pointed entirely at Israel’s current government.' Norway’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andreas Kravik views Norway’s unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state somewhat differently: 'We did it to advance peace and recognition between Israel and Palestine. This is something we’re committed to,' he says. 'We saw that the Oslo Accords took negative directions that have created a lack of security for both Israelis and Palestinians. So, we were forced to think differently about how to embolden the moderate elements, weakened in this brutal conflict. Both sides deserve peace, but there’ll be no peace without a two-state solution. And as the war in Gaza rages on, we have to preserve the two-state solution alternative.' Norway took another step against Israel when it supported an arms embargo against Israel at the UN, while most European countries (including Sweden) abstained. Until the mid-'70s, the Norwegian public, along with the country’s political organizations, were clear Israel supporters. Norway transferred two tons of heavy water to Israel for peace purposes, despite it's real use being clear to all. 'We identified with Israel because, like Norway, it was a small country formerly ruled by others, and it had the image of a socialist paradise,' says Waage. The first cracks began appearing following the 1967 Six-Day War with hints of whispers from Palestinian refugees on the streets. Then in July 1973, Mossad assassinated Ahmed Bouchikhi, a Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer, mistaking him for arch-terrorist Hassan Salameh who had participated in the Munich massacre. 'I remember as a child, sitting around the table with my parents’ friends' recalls Waage. 'My parents were devout, Israel-loving, Christians. They were friends with a socialist couple from the radical left who openly supported Palestine before it was acceptable. When they started talking about Israel, they told me and my sister to go to the other room and then we heard yelling. My sister and I looked at each other and asked ‘Who are these crazy people and what’s making them lose their minds?’ When it came to choosing an MA thesis topic, this was my obvious choice.' The real change came in 1978-82. Journalist Odd Karsten Tveit first traveled to the region after The Litani Operation and has since written over a dozen books on the subject. The most recent published last September was a bestseller. 'When I got to the Middle East, there were already thousands of Norwegian soldiers serving as part of UNIFIL forces, he says. 'These aren’t men from the radical left. These are conservatives who signed up for the role 100% supporting Israel. When they finish, almost 100% of them are against Israel.' Why? 'Because they’d been fed a fairytale and it turns out that Israel is the strong, occupying side. They witness IDF operations in Lebanon. Also, thousands of nurses, midwives and doctors volunteered in the West Bank, and they all come back to Norway telling their friends and family what they’ve seen, and the narrative begins to change.' 'Norway had a soft spot for Israel. When Mossad needed Norwegian passports for operations in the Soviet Union, they knew they could talk to someone here but, gradually, it started changing. The First Lebanon War and the invasion of Beirut and [the Christians' massacre] in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, changed the public discourse and opinion and began influencing the politicians. Now we see that Israel is reacting more harshly toward Norway than it is toward Spain and Ireland, who have also unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state. What’s the difference? 'One difference is the emotional connection due to the Oslo Accords. We’re also not in the EU, so it’s easier to attack us.' Tivet is referring to Foreign Minister Katz’s 'retaliatory measures' against Norway: Israel rescinded the diplomatic status of eight Norwegian Embassy personnel working in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority, and Norway consequently closed its office in the West Bank. 'We had, and still have, deep friendly relations with Israel and Israeli citizens, but the extreme and unacceptable steps taken by the current government have proven to us that it is actively disrupting the two-state solution, the only solution for peace,' says Deputy Foreign Minister Kravik. 'Norway isn’t hostile to Israel, it’s a friend. But friends need to be honest and talk about policies they don’t agree with.' Leif Knutsen (63) is a member of Oslo’s Jewish community. Shortly following the October 7 massacre, he started publishing an almost daily newsletter offering an alternative to what the average Norwegian was getting from the country’s mainstream and social media. 'Since Oslo, the Norwegians have become obsessive about Israel. The collapse of the accords means that in politics, academia, the media, or on any platform influencing public opinion, everything about Israel is negative. This has led to the demonization of Israel among the Norwegian public, 50% of whom, when surveyed, responded that Israel is indeed doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to the Jews.' Facing a community of 2,000 Jews, we have a quarter of a million Muslims in Oslo alone. This dictates the Norwegian narrative and politics. We also have a sharp increase in crime rate, and as this is statistically connected to certain minority communities here, we also see antagonism toward the Muslim minority and to the Pro-Palestinian demonstrations.' Do you feel antisemitism here? 'We have antisemitism-based violence. People spit and curse and there are places - mainly in the big cities – where you wouldn’t identify as a Jew or as an Israeli. This comes primarily from the Muslims, who do the locals’ legwork for them. Although the locals have been brainwashed with antisemitism, claiming that Israel is conducting genocide and murdering children, they’re horrified when accused of antisemitism, as it’s not part of how they see themselves. During this year’s International Women’s Day march, the organizers initially allowed Jewish women to march with signs protesting rape committed on October 7. When they showed up, however, other demonstrators blocked them shouting 'No Zionists on our streets.' This act crossed the line for the public and the Norwegian prime minister also wrote a letter protesting the incident.' 'Since October 7 and the ensuing war, we’ve witnessed an increase in antisemitism toward Jews in Europe, sadly including Norway,' says Deputy Foreign Minister Kravik. 'The prime minister and foreign minister are in contact with the community and we’ve increased security. The Jews in Norway aren’t responsible for Israel’s policies and we’ll never accept antisemitism. Since October 7, we’ve fiercely condemned the Hamas attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself within international law and have stressed the immediate need to unconditionally release all the hostages.' Knutsen also explains internal factors contributing to the deteriorating discourse regarding, and hostility toward, Israel: 'This government is operating badly and may be on its way to elections next year. Following October 7, a new foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, came in from a humanitarian, rather than diplomatic background. Since assuming his position, he’s been under pressure from his party, demanding he take more drastic and aggressive measures against Israel.' Eide blames Israel alone and has freely accepted Hamas’s versions of events and its casualty figures. His inexperience means he has said things to the media that would ordinarily get diplomats fired. (For example, the Israeli Embassy only learned of Norway’s recognition of Palestine through newspaper headlines). Even before this, the government prevented the King of Norway from conveying his condolences to Israel following the massacre, claiming that this was the government's job, and sent off a particularly lukewarm message of condolence. Norway also refuses to recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization. The message is clear to the Norwegian public: the failing minority government is dependent on two left-wing parties and has dragged Norway to a clear anti-Israel stance, including, in August supporting the issue of arrest warrants for Benny Gantz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'Here’s another example,' says Knutsen. 'Just before the Passover holiday, the foreign minister ordered the state retailer responsible for the sale of alcohol, to remove all the wines from the West Bank and the Golan from the shelves. So, there wasn’t enough wine for the community. They wouldn’t dare do such a thing to any other minority. But what can we Jews do? Write a letter of complaint? ' 'On the other hand, a survey conducted by The Norwegian Center for Holocaust and Minority Studies,' says John Arne Moen, chairman of Norway’s second largest Jewish community, in Trondheim, 'shows that there’s a much better attitude toward Jews than toward Muslims.' The discrepancy between the government's hostility to Israel and the public’s attitude was also demonstrated by Norway’s public vote in the Eurovision semifinal, awarding Eden Golan a perfect score. But across Oslo and other big cities, we’re seeing horrific exhibitions about the 'genocide' Israel is conducting, including cuffed Gazans being led by Israeli soldiers to their execution, cheerful celebrations of the murder of Israelis at the Allenby Bridge and trampling on Israeli flags on the outskirts of the king’s palace. However, as Israel flexes its muscles to rescind the status of diplomats operating in the West Bank, Norway closed its offices near Ramallah and accused the Israeli government of extremism. Part of this, an Israeli official told us, is about the Norwegian’s arrogant character. 'They can do everything better than everyone else, even bringing about peace. They don’t have the capacity for soul-searching.' Foreign Minister Barth Eide is a contributing factor to the crisis. He has compared Israel to Russia, claimed Israel is conducting war crimes, and has demanded other countries not sell arms to Israel so as not to be accused of war crimes. Norway, alongside Spain, Ireland and France, went back to financing UNRWA and spoke out against other countries who had frozen their UNRWA funding after it was revealed that 12 of its employees had taken part in the October 7 massacre. Eide claimed that 'for 12 rotten apples, you don’t stop funding a whole organization.' A senior Labor Party representative on Norway’s Committee of Foreign Affairs and Defense recommended UNRWA for the Nobel Peace Prize. Leading newspapers reported that 'Israel started a war against Hamas.' The ruling Labor Party youth movement summer camps have been boycotting Israel for years. At the most recent summer camp, the teenagers were photographed in keffiyehs and holding signs accusing Israel of genocide. 'It’s very hard to persuade my students in lectures that Israel’s policies, even the very state, are right,' says Prof. Waage. 'There’s a generation with no sympathy for Israel or knowledge of the Holocaust. I can give long lectures, and then they’ll ask me why I’m against boycotting Israel.' Prof. Waage is Norwegian academia’s good and bad girl. She’s good at her job, and so has more access to material than other scholars. She’s bad as what she finds there, are things the government is trying to conceal. She learned Hebrew a decade ago so as not to depend on her (settler) research assistant as she rummages through the archive in Jerusalem. To her surprise, she found all of the Norwegian government’s secret Oslo documents there. 'The Oslo process actually began in 1979,' she says. 'The Iranian regime fell and the US asked us to supply Israel with oil. Norway went to ask Arafat if that was okay by him, so as not to endanger Norwegian soldiers in Lebanon. He agreed, but asked Norway to mediate between him and the Israelis, as Israel viewed Norway as a friend.' 'We now understand how wrong we were. We were desperately trying to create this jewel for our image and were drunk on our own success. We’ve been telling ourselves this fairytale for 30 years, gracing the salons of, London Brussels and Washington. Until now, it’s been important for us to maintain friendly relations with Israel, but recognizing this failure has given us free rein to criticize Israel. Israel’s reaction, though, is simply insane. All this makes me concerned and really sad.'

Gilat brings joy amid war through interactive theater	The Gilat Foundation uses therapeutic theater to uplift disabled and injured children in hospitals across Israel following year-long fighting The children’s smiles lit up the popular restaurant in Jerusalem, a rare sight after months of multifront war in Israel. These children face daily struggles, whether born with disabilities, injured in attacks, or affected by ongoing conflict. Pitmaster restaurant hosted an event to raise awareness and support for the Gilat Foundation, which uses theater to bring joy to sick children. Founded in 2023 after the October 7 massacre, the Gilat Foundation launched its program in Israel and is now active in four hospitals: Shaare Zedek Medical Center, ALYN Hospital, Shalva National Center, and the Kerem Institute. Around 4,000 children have participated, and four more hospitals, starting with Hadassah after Sukkot, are set to join this year. The Gilat Foundation was established in memory of Gilat Eisenmann, who passed away in 2008 at age 11 after spending much of her life in the hospital. Gilat’s cousin, Shlomi Eisenmann, told The Media Line, 'What’s truly remarkable is that despite those years of sorrow, her parents found the strength to create something positive. They started an organization to help kids just like her.' He explained why therapeutic theater became a central part of the initiative: 'Theater was Gilat’s passion. Even though she was physically impaired, mentally, she was sharp as a knife. She was always aware of everything going on around her. People would visit her, and she’d say, ‘Why are you sad? Be happy. Everything is fine.’ That was her thing. Even in the face of her challenges, she lifted everyone around her.' When the war in Israel began, Shlomi said Gilat’s parents felt compelled to act. 'They rushed to Israel because they realized it was necessary. Many kids were injured or became clinically ill from the attack, and others, already sick, had to be moved to the center of Israel. These children, already in vulnerable situations, had to deal with even more upheaval. It’s tough. That’s why offering them therapeutic theater every week, giving them a space to feel like normal kids, is so vital.' He emphasized the program’s measurable impact: 'One of the heads of education at Alyn Hospital told us that in just two months since the start of the war, she saw an 80% increase in the children’s well-being. That’s a real, measurable result.' Shlomi described the unique power of theater: 'Theater is medicine no doctor can prescribe. You can’t buy it in a supermarket or a pharmacy. We organize everything—bring the kids out of their rooms, even when they don’t feel like moving. Once they come to the show, it changes everything. It’s an hour where they can forget their struggles, and that’s something invaluable.' Tali Eisenmann, president of the foundation and Gilat’s mother, told The Media Line that she had wanted to be a doctor since childhood, which later influenced her decision to become a medic. 'But it didn’t work out. My father said to me, ‘It’s not a study for a religious girl,’ and I was used to listening to him, so I didn’t do it—and I regret it.' 'After Gilat passed away, I still thought maybe I’d be a doctor because I saw how important it is, but I didn’t do it. It was too much; I couldn’t handle it. When we came to Israel, I thought, ‘I want to be a medic.’ So in that, she didn’t really play a role, but what she does play a role in is my approach to people,' Tali shared. 'I’ve learned it’s very important to approach not only the patient but also the people surrounding them because when someone is chronically ill, it’s not only the patient who suffers—it’s the whole family,' she explained. 'I also learned that just because someone is in a wheelchair or disabled, it doesn’t mean they can’t answer, can’t think, or that they’re not normal. You should approach the person directly, even if they have learning difficulties or are mentally disabled—they’re still a person and deserve to be treated like one,' Tali said. Yossi Zecharia is a father of four. His 8-year-old son, Lior, was born with a leg malformation—one leg is shorter than the other. Yossi told The Media Line that Lior has already undergone eight surgeries and will require additional ones nearly every year until he turns 18. The theatrical performances raise Lior’s spirits and give him a moment to forget he has a disability. Lior looks forward to when the actors come to ALYN Hospital to perform. It makes him happy they come to perform, particularly when the children are involved in the play. Mahdi Haruv has worked in ALYN Hospital’s rehabilitation department for five years as a teacher and playroom coordinator. Haruv speaks with passion and pride about the impact of the Gilat Theater on children from all backgrounds. As an Arab Israeli from the Shuafat neighborhood in East Jerusalem, he sees the Gilat program as not only a way to empower patients but also as a place where they learn values and gain a broader understanding of the world. 'The children learn about themselves, get a more positive sense of self, they learn how to be more patient with themselves, with their families, so they can see and be seen in a positive manner. Gilat shows them what they can do in order to be part of society,' Haruv told The Media Line. According to Haruv, many children experience anxiety attacks during their recovery process. Rehabilitation helps them understand their emotions, and the interactive theater program teaches them how to cope with distress and reduce long-term stress. 'Most importantly, theater brings happiness to their faces,' he said. These children are also learning about the world beyond the hospital, with the program teaching them about countries on every continent. The restaurant was packed, and Gilat’s name appeared on large TV screens, placemats, and goody bags. The video playing showed Gilat, a confident young child of 11, who beamed. The joyful atmosphere gave way to the somber reality of war, reflecting the heart-wrenching emotions many have experienced. Zvi Steinfeld, a partner and chef at Pitmaster, is known for captivating guests with his culinary skills. The Gilat videos on screen suddenly turned to Ben Shimoni and Gaya Chalifa, who had worked at the Petach Tikvah branch. Steinfeld told The Media Line that they were at the Nova Festival on October 7. Shimoni managed to escape three times, each time bringing others to safety. On his third escape, he took Chalifa and three others with him. On their way out, they were ambushed by terrorists and killed, Steinfeld shared. 'I worked together with both for nearly two years. We spent many afternoons and nights working side by side. After the services, we would often sit to catch our breaths, discussing anything that evening service to our lives and future plans. They were both incredible young, beautiful people who had a bright future ahead of them that was taken too soon,' Steinfeld said. While the war has heightened stress nationwide and deepened the divide between Israelis and Arabs, Haruv remains hopeful. 'Gilat has taught values and respect to the patients and families who come together during the performances,' says Haruv. 'They are all treated equally, no matter if they are religious or secular, Jew or Arab.' 'At this critical time of war, Gilat gives something important to the state that will help the entire country. It’s an opportunity for peace,' he says. 'If sick kids can play together during war, and then their parents come together, it’s a recipe all can learn from.'

Assad restricts pro-Iran militias in Syria, Strike on Latakia att...	A UK-based Syrian opposition site claims Damascus regime fears being dragged into war, prevents attacks on Israel with the help of Russians At least two people were injured early on Thursday in an overnight strike on the Syrian port of Latakia, which was attributed to Israel. Syrian state media said the attack on the port caused a fire, while other reports claimed the target was a weapons storage facility at the entrance to the port city and that serious damage was caused to homes in the area. Hours earlier, Syrian President Bashar al Assad had imposed restrictions on Iran-backed militias' activities in his country, according to a report in the UK-based Syrian opposition site the Observatory for Human Rights. According to the report, the restrictions were imposed fearing Israeli attacks. The site reported that Assad fears the break-out of war with Israel after previously limiting the scope of their operations along the Syrian-Israeli border on the Golan Heights. It claimed the Damascus regime issued military orders, 'in agreement with the Russians,' to limit Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian militias in villages near Damascus and Homs including the Homs desert that could be used to launch drones at Israel. Unnamed sources quoted in the report claimed the regime was inspecting cars with Lebanese license plates and surveying people arriving from Lebanon, out of concern that Syrian territory would be used to attack Israel. The Observatory said thousands of pro-Iranian militias, including Hezbollah were in Syria and that Israel may take advantage of their presence to strike and to drag Syria into a war it has no interest in. The sources also said that the Syrian military's 4th division, under the command of Assad's brother Maher, issued strict orders not to attack the Golan Heights and 'ignite' conflict with Israel. They said roadblocks were keeping regime forces some 15 kilometers (9 miles) away from the border with Israel and Russian forces were positioned at 17 points along the border to reduce friction while pro-Iranian militia sites were being patrolled by joint Syrian and Russian forces in a number of locations around Syria, to keep an eye on them.

U.S. B-2 stealth bombers strike Yemen in message to Iran	Attack targets Houthi underground weapons stores; 'unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified' Austin says The United States conducted precision strikes on Wednesday against five underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' Austin said in a statement. 'The employment of US Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere.' According to reports the use of strategic bomber, in the unprecedented attack, was meant to indicate their possible use to strike Iran's nuclear facilities if and when the United States chooses to do so. 'We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks,' he said. Sources told CNN on Thursday that several of the stealth bombers were used in the strike on the Iran-backed Houthis hitting stores of 'advanced weapons' and in response to attacks on US and military vessels as well as commercial ships in the Red Sea. According to the Hezbollah-Affiliated Al Mayadeen network in Lebanon, the UK also participated in the strike on targets near the Yemeni capital of Sanaa and in the northern Saada governorate. A Houthi spokesperson said the attacks were 'a failed attempt to protect Israel,' and to deter the Houthis from supporting Gaza and Lebanon. 'To the Americans and British we say, our abilities are great, and our response will come.' Last month, the IDF attacked the Houthi-controlled Hodeida Port and other strategic targets in Yemen some 1,800 kilometers (1118 miles) away, in response to a Houthis surface-to-surface missile launched at at Tel Aviv. 'The airstrikes focused on key military infrastructure in the Ras Issa and Hodeidah regions, including power stations and a port used for importing oil. These facilities were being used by the Iranian-backed Houthi regime to transfer weapons and military supplies, including oil, to their forces,' the IDF said in a statement.

Focused on his personal needs': New details on alleged Iranian s...	Document details how Vladimir Varkhovsky, suspected of being recruited to kill an Israeli scientist by Tehran, was involved in financial struggles; these are characteristics Iran looks for in an agent A document compiled on Vladimir Varkhovsky, who was charged with a series of security offenses on behalf of Iranian intelligence and agreed to assassinate an Israeli scientist for $100,000, had previously sought 'quick and easy financial solutions without exercising judgment,' Ynet learned on Wednesday. The document came following his involvement in a credit card fraud case. Varkhovsky made aliyah to Israel from Ukraine eight years ago and worked as a security guard in a building and was unarmed. 'At the time of the offense, he was focused on his personal and immediate needs, exercising short-term judgment,' the document from 2017 read detailing the man’s entanglement following financial difficulties shortly after his arrival in Israel. 'His behavior indicates problematic patterns of conduct and coping.' He was ultimately convicted in the case and served community service. 'They [Iranians] usually tend to recruit people with limited means. Not necessarily of foreign origin, but those born and raised here have more nationalism, making it harder to recruit them to act against their own country. People who recently moved here — have less national affiliation on the face of it, making them targets or at least a starting point,' said M., who previously worked at the Defense Ministry. However, he also pointed to 'vulnerabilities' among native Israelis: 'Lower socio-economic status, urgency to pay a criminal body or a criminal record — because they've already broken the law before.' 'For young people, like the couple from Ramat Gan who don't have children, there's less to lose,' he added. 'Their families aren't in the country, and it's harder to reach them. Unfortunately, many young people spend a lot of time on social media without realizing what they're getting into.' 'You can't easily send them to buy weapons, but rather to film locations and spread malice — it's important for parents to monitor what their kids are doing online,' he explained. Dvir Kariv, who served in the Shin Bet for 22 years, said, 'The idea is to harm Israel from afar —using innocent people in exchange for money. They (the Iranians) will approach people with a criminal past, those who have already broken the law, or innocent, desperate individuals. The guy from Petah Tikva agreed to kill a scientist after a series of bad turns.' 'There are people who wanted to be like James Bond and join intelligence agencies but ended up as security guards. They get drawn into becoming enticing agents from abroad, which gives them a taste for life. You get money, dabble in intelligence and life seems like a Hollywood movie — until you find yourself in an abyss at some point,' he added. Iranian recruitment efforts are conducted via through various ads — some on Facebook — or offers for translation services in different languages, with payments of thousands of shekels per page. This is how the Iranians try to lure numerous residents. 'The Iranians want to retaliate quickly for what we've done to them. Many of us 'live' on social media since the COVID-19 pandemic and technological development. Iranian agents operate on two levels — either personal or broad approaches. If it seems too good to be true, it isn't,' Kariv said. 'They filter out unsuspecting people who think they can make easy money from home. These innocent people enter their details and that’s where the fall begins.' Varkhovsky’s espionage case wasn’t the only one uncovered this week. Vladislav Victorsson, 30 and Anna Bernstein, 18 who were recruited by an Iranian intelligence operative on Telegram, were initially asked to spray graffiti, then to distribute flyers and later set cars on fire — with the ultimate goal being to assassinate a high-ranking Israeli official. Varkhovsky was similarly asked to spray graffiti, plant tracking devices and finally, collect a gun. 'It escalates and deteriorates,' Kariv said. 'At some point, they ask for a picture while carrying out the mission and only pay after they receive it. This serves as leverage.' Adi Carmi, who served in the Shin Bet for 28 years, explained, 'Moti Maman — an Ashdod businessman — who was caught after being in Iran, has a completely different profile from those caught this week, who supposedly had no ties to the state.' 'He was recruited because businessmen operating outside the country's borders have more face-to-face access and the ability to exploit them is more present. When you post a random, intriguing ad on Facebook, thousands respond and a few remain who don't realize what they're getting into. It's like a honey trap — they start getting entangled and then they begin to fear being blackmailed,' he added. In a typical year, the Shin Bet foils around 500 attempts of severe attacks within Israel's borders. Since the war in Gaza began, 1,200 attacks have been thwarted according to the intelligence agency. Most civilians targeted were identified by agencies before the attacks, but concerns still exist that not all can be stopped in time. 'The working assumption is that you don't expose them all — because the more complex recruitments worry the Shin Bet as they're conducted more slowly and cleverly. The technological foundation is much deeper and more intricate,' Kariv explained.

Starvation': UN Security Council criticized Israel in emergency ...	International community in meeting on humanitarian situation in the Strip accuse Israel of 'policy of starvation' amid IDF operations in the area and US threats of an arms embargo The UN Security Council convened this for an emergency session on Wednesday on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, amid recent IDF operations in the northern part of the Strip over the past week and against the backdrop of U.S. threats to impose an arms embargo on the country if it fails to deliver humanitarian aid and fulfill its commitments. The session saw unprecedented criticism of Israel, in a language not heard even in the past year of the ongoing war. The discussion was initiated at the request of several countries, including the UK, France and Algeria. Israel's isolation was evident during the session, where all speakers mentioned the harrowing images of Palestinians burning to death at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah following an IDF strike executed Sunday overnight. Responsibility for the incident was placed on Israel, which was also accused of starvation tactics, cutting off food supplies to northern Gaza and systematically displacing Palestinians who had already been uprooted from their homes. While Western representatives did mention the hostages held by Hamas, the majority of the speeches reflected positions critical of Israel. The United States is watching to ensure that Israel's actions on the ground show that it does not have a 'policy of starvation' in the northern Gaza Strip, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council on Wednesday. She told the 15-member council that such a policy would be 'horrific and unacceptable and would have implications under international law and U.S. law.' 'The Government of Israel has said that this is not their policy, that food and other essential supplies will not be cut off, and we will be watching to see that Israel's actions on the ground match this statement,' Thomas-Greenfield said, in a ratcheting up of the U.S. posture toward its longtime ally. The United States has told Israel that it must take steps in the next 30 days to improve the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave or face potential restrictions on U.S. military aid, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. 'Food and supplies must be surged into Gaza, immediately. And there must be humanitarian pauses across Gaza to allow for vaccinations and the delivery and distribution of humanitarian aid,' Thomas-Greenfield said. A deadly attack on southern Israel by Palestinian Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023, triggered Israel's retaliation in Hamas-run Gaza, sparking a humanitarian crisis in the besieged enclave. Authorities say more than 42,000 people have been killed and almost the entire population of 2.3 million displaced. Israel's Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon told the council that the issue in Gaza was not a lack of aid, saying more than 1 million tons had been delivered during the past year. He accused Hamas of hijacking the humanitarian assistance. 'Israel, along with our international partners, continues to flood Gaza with aid, but it will never reach all those in need as long as Hamas remains in power,' he said. 'Hamas has weaponized the humanitarian situation.' Hamas has repeatedly denied Israeli allegations that it was stealing aid and says Israel is to blame for shortages. ‘Unconscionable’ The UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. The UN said no food aid entered northern Gaza between October 2 and October 15. 'Given the abject conditions and intolerable suffering in north Gaza, the fact that humanitarian access is nearly nonexistent is unconscionable,' acting UN aid chief Joyce Msuya told the council. On Wednesday, the IDF unit that oversees aid and commercial shipments to Gaza said 50 trucks carrying food, water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment provided by Jordan were transferred to northern Gaza. Danon cited the recent medical mission as an example of Israel's 'comprehensive' humanitarian efforts, adding that 'as always, we acted in accordance with international law, going above and beyond our obligations.' Danon also spoke about the start of a second round of polio vaccinations on Monday by the UN children's agency UNICEF and the World Health Organization, targeting 590,000 children under the age of 10 during area-specific pauses in fighting. Algeria's UN Ambassador Amar Bendjama questioned Israel's humanitarian efforts. 'How is it possible that we can vaccinate these children yet we cannot feed them?' he said. 'The inevitable conclusion is that this is not ... collateral damage, but a deliberate calculated Israeli policy of starvation.'

US's threatening letter to Israel could spell trouble at The Hagu...	Blinken and Austin's letter warning Jerusalem of a weapons embargo if aid fails to reach Gaza could provide ammunition for ICC prosecutor in bid to issue warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant The U.S.’s threat of a weapons embargo against Israel conditioned in the supply of humanitarian aid into Gaza could spell trouble for the country at the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague after ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan applied for arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The letter, issued by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demanded that Israel take concrete steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within 30 days. In addition to ensuring regular aid transfers, the U.S. also calls on Israel to allow Red Cross visits to Palestinian detainees and to halt Knesset legislation that would prevent the Palestinian aid agency UNRWA from operating in Israel. Since Israel’s assurances in March and a subsequent letter in April, which had led to improvements in aid delivery, the amount of assistance entering Gaza has dropped by over 50%, according to the letter. Aid deliveries in September were reportedly the lowest in a year. The letter could serve as strong circumstantial evidence for Khan’s claim that Israel did arbitrarily block the delivery of humanitarian aid — at least until March 2024. Otherwise, there would have been no need for the assurance letters issued in March and April, as revealed in the letter. The Americans aren’t disconnected from what’s happening at The Hague and the letter’s leak might alter the opinions of the judges who are set to decide on the prosecutor's request to issue urgent arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant due to allegations of prolonged starvation offenses. US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council on Wednesday that Israel’s operations in the Gaza Strip proved it doesn’t have a 'policy of starvation,' across the enclave and specifically in its northern sector. 'The Government of Israel has said that this is not their policy, that food and other essential supplies will not be cut off, and we will be watching to see that Israel’s actions on the ground match this statement,' she stressed. French President Emmanuel Macron's words against Israel also bolster the ICC’s French judge — one of the three judges on the pre-trial panel. Blinken and Austin effectively accuse Israel of allegedly blocking the entry of aid trucks to northern Gaza. Khan is required to prove that this constitutes an 'organized policy,' and that those against whom warrants are sought acted in line with this policy — to establish a crime against humanity. The leaked letter aids in substantiating this claim, which is often hard to prove as it’s rare to find documents that indicate a criminal plan. The letter, coupled with the growing international sentiment against Israel, especially amid the war in Lebanon and reports of the blockade on northern Gaza, could expedite the court's decision to issue the warrants. There has been no substantial change in Israel's policy regarding humanitarian aid to Gaza, according to Israeli officials. They attribute the harsh letter to the U.S. administration's lack of confidence in Israel's intentions. U.S. officials reportedly feared that Israel was planning to starve Gaza, in line with the so-called 'General's Plan' proposed by retired IDF Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, which involves isolating northern Gaza. Israel has repeatedly announced in recent days it was allowing aid into northern Gaza. According to Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), responsible for facilitating aid into Gaza, 50 aid trucks entered the Strip on Wednesday, 12 on Tuesday and 30 on Sunday.

UK mulls placing sanctions on Ben-Gvir, Smotrich	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer tells parliament country is looking into the move following 'abhorrent' comments made by both ministers since outset of the Gaza war UK Prime Minister and the country's Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said on Wednesday his country is considering imposing sanctions on National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. 'We are looking at that,' he said in the parliament after being asked about remarks made by the two. He described their statements as 'abhorrent' and called on Israel to increase the quota of humanitarian aid entering the northern Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, the UK announced sanctions against seven Israeli settler groups 'involved in the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.' One of the organizations is the 'Amana' movement, which is 'involved in the construction of illegal settler outposts and threatening and perpetrating acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank.' Other organizations include the 'Od Yosef Chai' yeshiva, 'Hashomer Yosh,' and 'Torat Lechima.' Ben-Gvir responded to the UK's potential actions, saying, 'Just as the British attempted to thwart the establishment of Israel prior to its rise, they are now continuing to do so amid a war for survival. The sea is the same sea and the British are the same British.' 'The British need to understand that the days of the Mandate are over. In any case, they don't scare me and I will continue to act solely in accordance with the supreme national interests of the State of Israel and for the residents of the state, our soldiers, police officers and prison guards. Down with the White Paper!' he added. Smotrich also responded to Starmer's statement, saying, 'The British Mandate has ended, and with it, the White Paper, but the one-sidedness and hypocrisy remain. God willing, I will continue to do everything in my power to advance a policy of eliminating the Nazi terror from Gaza, Lebanon, and Iran and to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian terror state that would threaten the existence of the State of Israel and the security of the Jewish people.' 'No threat will prevent me from doing what is right and moral for the citizens of Israel and if the British want to wrinkle their noses at my Zionist policies, then so be it,' he added. The UK isn't the first to announce it was considering imposing sanctions on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. The European Union also considered the issue headed by an initiative by EU Foreign Minister Josep Borrell but didn't have majority support among the member states to approve the move.

How Israel’s bulky pager fooled Hezbollah	An invisible detonator and wafer-thin plastic explosives turned batteries into bombs The batteries inside the weaponized pagers that arrived in Lebanon at the start of the year, part of an Israeli plot to decimate Hezbollah, had powerfully deceptive features and an Achilles' heel. The agents who built the pagers designed a battery that concealed a small but potent charge of plastic explosive and a novel detonator that was invisible to X-ray, according to a Lebanese source with first-hand knowledge of the pagers, and teardown photos of the battery pack seen by Reuters. To overcome the weakness - the absence of a plausible backstory for the bulky new product - they created fake online stores, pages and posts that could deceive Hezbollah due diligence, a Reuters review of web archives shows. The stealthy design of the pager bomb and the battery’s carefully constructed cover story, both described here for the first time, shed light on the execution of a years-long operation that has struck unprecedented blows against Israel's Iran-backed Lebanese foe and pushed the Middle East closer to a regional war. A thin, square sheet with six grams of white pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) plastic explosive was squeezed between two rectangular battery cells, according to the Lebanese source and photos. The remaining space between the battery cells could not be seen in the photos but was occupied by a strip of highly flammable material that acted as the detonator, the source said. This three-layer sandwich was inserted in a black plastic sleeve, and encapsulated in a metal casing roughly the size of a matchbox, the photos showed. The assembly was unusual because it did not rely on a standard miniaturized detonator, typically a metallic cylinder, the source and two bomb experts said. All three spoke on conditions of anonymity. Without any metal components, the material used to trigger detonation had an edge: like the plastic explosives, it was not detected by X-ray. Upon receiving the pagers in February, Hezbollah looked for the presence of explosives, two people familiar with the matter said, putting them through airport security scanners to see if they triggered alarms. Nothing suspicious was reported. The devices were likely set up to generate a spark within the battery pack, enough to light the detonating material, and trigger the sheet of PETN to explode, said the two bomb experts, to whom Reuters showed the pager-bomb design. Since explosives and wrapping took about a third of the volume, the battery pack carried a fraction of the power consistent with its 35-gram weight, two battery experts said. 'There is a significant amount of unaccounted for mass,' said Paul Christensen, an expert in lithium batteries at Britain’s Newcastle University. At some point, Hezbollah noticed the battery was draining faster than expected, the Lebanese source said. However, the issue did not appear to raise major security concerns - the group was still handing its members the pagers hours before the attack. On Sept. 17, thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded in the southern suburbs of Beirut and other Hezbollah strongholds, in most cases after the devices beeped, indicating an incoming message. Among the victims rushed to hospital, many had eye injuries, missing fingers or gaping holes in their abdomens, Reuters witnesses saw, indicating their proximity to the devices at the time of detonation. In total, the pager attack, and a second on the following day that activated weaponized walkie-talkies, killed 39 people and wounded more than 3,400. Two Western security sources said Israeli intelligence agency Mossad spearheaded the pager and walkie-talkie attacks. Reuters could not establish where the devices were manufactured. The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which has authority over Mossad, did not respond to a request for comment. Lebanon’s Information Ministry and a spokesperson for Hezbollah declined to comment for this article. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed a role. The day after the attacks Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant praised Mossad's 'very impressive' results in comments that were widely interpreted in Israel as a tacit acknowledgment of the agency's participation. U.S. officials have said they were not informed of the operation in advance. The weak link From the outside, the pager’s power source looked like a standard lithium-ion battery pack used in thousands of consumer electronics goods. And yet, the battery, labeled LI-BT783, had a problem: Like the pager, it did not exist on the market. So Israel's agents created a backstory from scratch. Hezbollah has serious procurement procedures to check what they buy, a former Israeli intelligence officer, who was not involved in the pager operation, told Reuters. 'You want to make sure that if they look, they find something,' the former spy said, requesting not to be named. 'Not finding anything is not good.' Creating backstories, or 'legends', for undercover agents has long been a core skill of spy agencies. What made the pager plot unusual is that those skills appear to have been applied to ubiquitous consumer electronics products. For the pagers, the agents deceived Hezbollah by selling the custom-created model, AR-924, under an existing, renowned Taiwanese brand, Gold Apollo. Gold Apollo’s chairman, Hsu Ching-kuang, told reporters a day after the pager attack that he was approached about three years ago by a former employee, Teresa Wu, and her 'big boss, called Tom' to discuss a license agreement. Hsu said he had scant information about Wu’s superior, but he granted them the right to design their own products and market them under the widely distributed Gold Apollo brand. Reuters could not establish the identity of the manager, nor whether the person or Wu knowingly worked with Israeli intelligence. The chairman said he was not impressed by the AR-924 when he saw it, but still added photos and a description of the product to his company’s website, helping give it both visibility and credibility. There was no way to directly buy the AR-924 from his website. Hsu said he knew nothing about the pagers’ lethal capabilities or the broader operation to attack Hezbollah. He described his company as a victim of the plot. Gold Apollo declined to provide further comment. Calls and messages sent to Wu went unanswered. She has not given a statement to the media since the attacks. ‘I know this product’ In September 2023, webpages and images featuring the AR-924 and its battery were added to apollosystemshk.com, a website that said it had a license to distribute Gold Apollo products, as well as the rugged pager and its bulky power source, according to a Reuters review of internet records and metadata. The website gave an address in Hong Kong for a company called Apollo Systems HK. No company by that name exists at the address or in Hong Kong Corporate records. However, the website was listed by Wu, the Taiwanese businesswoman, on her Facebook page as well as in public incorporation records when she registered a company called Apollo Systems in Taipei earlier this year. A section of the apollosystemshk.com site devoted to the LI-BT783 put emphasis on the battery’s outstanding performance. Unlike the disposable batteries that powered older generation pagers, it boasted 85 days of autonomy and could be recharged via a USB cable, according to the website and a 90-second promotional video on YouTube. n late 2023, two battery stores came online with the LI-BT783 listed in their catalogs, Reuters found. And in two online forums devoted to batteries, participants discussed the power source, despite its lack of commercial availability: 'I know this product,' a user with the handle Mikevog wrote in April 2023. 'It’s got a great datasheet and a great performance. Reuters could not establish the identity of Mikevog. The website, the online stores, and the forum discussions bear the hallmark of a deception effort, the former Israeli intelligence officer and two Western security officers told Reuters. The websites have been scrubbed from the web since the pager bombs wreaked havoc in Lebanon, but archived and cached copies are still viewable. Ruing the day they bought the pagers, Hezbollah leaders said they had launched internal investigations to understand how the security breach could happen and identify possible moles. The group had shifted to pagers at the start of the year after realizing that cellphone communications were compromised by Israeli eavesdropping, Reuters previously reported. Hezbollah's investigations have helped uncover how Israeli agents used an aggressive sales tactic to make sure Hezbollah’s procurement manager chose the AR-924, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The salesperson who conveyed the offer made a very inexpensive proposition for the pagers, 'and kept bringing the price down until he was pulled in,' the person said. Lebanese authorities have condemned the attacks as a serious violation of Lebanon's sovereignty. On Sept. 19, in his last public speech before he was killed by Israel, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the device blasts could amount to a 'declaration of war' and vowed to punish Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire since Oct. 8, 2023, when the militant group began launching rockets at Israeli military positions in solidarity with its Palestinian ally Hamas. In the wake of the device attacks, Israel has launched a full-on war on Hezbollah, including a ground invasion of southern Lebanon and airstrikes that have killed most of its top leadership. The internal investigation, still underway, suffered a setback on Sept. 28: Eleven days after the pager attack, the senior Hezbollah official tasked with leading the procurement probe, Nabil Kaouk, was himself killed by an Israeli airstrike.

The majority of the projectiles were intercepted and fallen projectiles were identified in the area. Magen David Adom reported following the alarms in the Karmiel area that medics and paramedics went a number of scenes where reports were received, and in one of them they located two wounded people, about 45 years old, who were hit by shrapnel and are being treated at the scene. Their condition is described as light. In addition, a direct hit was made on a home in Majd al-Krum.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkxf00qpyjx	2024-10-16T04:52:21-07:00	
Retired banker or scientist? Tel Aviv family caught in Iranian sp...	Iranian handler sends Israeli recruit photo of Tel Aviv resident, instructing him to knock on man’s door just days before allegedly obtaining gun for assassination; 'My father is over 80 and has no connection to any security matters,' son says The indictment filed Wednesday against Vladimir Varkhovsky, 35, from Tel Aviv, details a series of security-related offenses allegedly carried out at the behest of Iranian intelligence. The indictment describes how Varkhovsky arrived at a building in the city's L neighborhood, at the request of a foreign agent with whom he was in contact, and knocked on the door of an apartment on the fifth floor. Shlomi, the son of Emanuel, who lives in the apartment, told Ynet he was shocked by the revelations. 'My father is a retired Bank Hapoalim employee—he has no connection to security matters,' he said. The indictment, submitted to the Lod District Court, alleges that Varkhovsky was instructed to obtain a gun intended for the assassination of an Israeli scientist. The foreign agent, posing as an Israeli citizen living in Canada named 'Eli,' promised Varkhovsky $100,000 and offered to help smuggle him to Russia after the murder. Varkhovsky allegedly traveled by taxi from Tel Aviv to Modiin, where he collected a bag containing a handgun, a matching magazine and 15 bullets. Upon returning to his home, he was arrested by security forces. Days earlier, the foreign agent had asked Varkhovsky to locate a person living on Borla Street in Tel Aviv, providing a photograph for identification. According to the indictment, on September 19, Varkhovsky went to Borla Street, trying to find the individual. He entered the building and, at the agent's request, photographed the mailboxes and apartment doors. Later, he asked the agent which apartment to target, and the agent specified a particular number. Varkhovsky spoke with neighbors on the first floor, showed them the photo and asked if they knew the person. They said they did not. He then proceeded to the fifth floor, knocked on the door, but received no answer. For this and other actions, Varkhovsky was paid via cryptocurrency. Shlomi, whose father Emanuel resides in the apartment Varkhovsky visited, expressed disbelief. 'I imagine they knew who they were looking for. My father is over 80, and this has nothing to do with him. It’s absurd that they photographed the building. I’m not worried; my father has no connection to any security matters.' Neighbors in the building were also shocked to learn their residence had been implicated in the indictment. 'I hope there's nothing more to this. It’s unsettling to know that people were photographing our building. I don’t know what to do—it's scary. Anything could happen at this point, but this is very strange,' one resident said. 'The elderly man who lives here has been around for years; he's very nice. It’s frightening to think people were taking photos here,' another neighbor commented. 'A few days ago, people knocked on my door asking if I live alone. They looked like police officers,' a different neighbor added. 'I feel very uncomfortable knowing strangers were taking pictures of my building,' a fourth resident said. The indictment charges Varkhovsky with contact with a foreign agent, possession and transportation of a weapon and conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism. It states that Varkhovsky, who immigrated to Israel from Ukraine eight years ago, maintained contact with the foreign agent via the Telegram app and carried out several tasks for him between August and September 2024. Among these tasks were spraying anti-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu graffiti around Tel Aviv, placing plastic containers with tracking devices near Segula Cemetery in Petah Tikva and sending videos from protests in Tel Aviv in an attempt to contact another demonstrator. Varkhovsky was paid in cryptocurrency for all these activities. The indictment further notes that during the 'period of contact,' Iranian intelligence operatives communicated with Varkhovsky through several Telegram profiles. The foreign agent, calling himself 'Eli,' asked Varkhovsky if he wanted to earn money. When Varkhovsky agreed, the agent sent him $10 via a cryptocurrency wallet. Several days later, the agent instructed Varkhovsky to spray graffiti with the word 'LEHI' in English and Hebrew. Varkhovsky complied, spraying the message at four locations: Barzilai Street, a Tel Aviv train station parking lot, the area between Nahmani and Tiomkin Streets and near Nahalat Binyamin. For each instance of graffiti, the foreign agent transferred $30 to Varkhovsky’s wallet. After completing this task, the agent asked Varkhovsky if he wanted to earn more money. Varkhovsky agreed, and the agent requested that he use a different mobile phone. Varkhovsky complied, and some of their communications were carried out using a Xiaomi device in his possession. In exchange for switching devices, the agent transferred $200 to Varkhovsky. At the end of September, the foreign agent instructed Varkhovsky to purchase two empty 10-liter plastic containers and hide them, along with a tracking device, in bushes behind a bus stop near Segula Cemetery. Varkhovsky followed the instructions, photographing the hiding place and sending the exact location to the agent. For this action, Varkhovsky was paid $100. Taking part in anti-government protests Later, the foreign agent asked Varkhovsky to spray more graffiti, this time with the message 'Netanyahu=Hitler.' Varkhovsky agreed and sprayed the message multiple times on walls and ATMs. Additionally, the agent requested that he film protests in Tel Aviv. Varkhovsky complied, sending a video he had recorded several days earlier, which showed a man throwing wooden planks into a bonfire. In the request to extend Varkhovsky's detention until the end of legal proceedings, authorities noted, 'The prosecution holds substantial evidence supporting the defendant’s guilt, including detailed confessions made during interrogations by the Shin Bet and Israel Police, in which the defendant admitted to the actions described in the indictment, though he claimed he never intended to carry out the assassination of the scientist. 'The prosecution also has Telegram correspondence between the defendant and the foreign agent that aligns with his confession, along with photos and videos documenting some of the tasks he was assigned.' The defendant has a prior conviction, though details were not provided. 'The war between the Shin Bet and Iran is intensifying,' the agency said in a statement. 'The series of cases that have been exposed, and those yet to come, clearly illustrate Iran's relentless efforts to recruit, activate, and carry out attacks within Israel. The Shin Bet's ability to preemptively thwart these attempts prevents Iran from achieving its goal of assassinating Israeli targets. Recruitment efforts through social media are widespread, targeting diverse groups, and some individuals fall into their trap. Those who choose, in times of war, to work for Iranian intelligence in exchange for payment will face severe consequences.'

Iran says attack on nuclear sites improbable	The probability of an attack on Iran's nuclear sites remains low but any potential damage would be 'quickly compensated,' state atomic energy agency spokesperson Behrouz Kamalvandi said on Wednesday, according to semi-official Nournews. After Iran's missile attack on Israel on Oct. 1, there has been speculation that Israel could strike Iran's nuclear facilities, as it has long threatened to do. 'We have always taken these threats seriously,' Kamalvandi said. Kamalvandi told Nournews that any attack on Iran's nuclear sites remained improbable and that if this happened, the damage was likely to be minimal and quickly repaired by Iran. 'We have planned in a way that if they commit any stupidity, the damages would be minimal,' Kamalvandi said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1mb6m6j1x	2024-10-16T04:02:17-07:00	
US officials who resigned over Biden's Gaza policy form new PAC	Two U.S. officials who resigned last year in protest over President Joe Biden's policy on the Gaza war have launched a lobbying organization and a political action committee to advocate for a revamp of Washington's long-standing stance on the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. Josh Paul, a former State Department official and Tariq Habash, who used to work as a policy advisor at the U.S. Department of Education, said the American public is no longer in favor of unconditionally sending U.S. weapons to Israel but that elected officials have lagged behind. Their PAC, called 'A New Policy', would support candidates whose position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict center on aligning U.S. policies with human rights and equality and would ensure U.S. arms transfers to all countries in the Middle East including Israel comply with both U.S. and international law.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1eo3ftj1g	2024-10-16T04:00:45-07:00

IDF distributes 'tactical sukkahs' to troops for holiday	Hundreds of compact sukkahs, designed according to Jewish law, were distributed to IDF troops, as well as special holiday kits; But are soldiers even obligated to sit in a sukkah according to Jewish law in time of war? The IDF has introduced the latest innovation for the Sukkot holiday - the tactical sukkah. This compact sukkah unveiled on Tuesday at first may look like it was assembled incorrectly – it stands just about one meter in height, length and width, barely large enough for an adult to sit inside. But that's precisely the point: These sukkahs are designed according to Jewish Law, while keeping a low profile and reducing the risk that a bullet or an anti-tank missile might hit soldiers sitting inside. In addition to the traditional s'chach roof covering, the kit includes an easy-to-assemble metal frame and three elastic straps that make the sukkah’s walls kosher according to Jewish law, without the need for fabric walls. The Logistics Corps of the IDF's Military Rabbinate emphasizes that per the guidelines approved by the chief military rabbi, 'building a sukkah in Gaza or other high-risk areas requires the explicit approval of a commander ranked lieutenant colonel or higher, ensuring that the sukkah poses no security or safety risks.' Along with distributing sukkahs and sets of the four species to all IDF units, the Military Rabbinate has also provided holiday kits to soldiers in southern Lebanon, along the border, and in Gaza and its surrounding areas. Northern Israel received 260 tactical sukkahs and 15,000 pocket-sized prayer books for the holiday season. Interestingly, many sukkahs in northern Israel from last year weren’t dismantled, as Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel immediately after the October 7 attack. As a result, many were damaged or worn out, prompting the recent distribution of tens of thousands of replacement parts for sukkahs. Additionally, 4,000 sets of the Four Species and 5,500 holiday law booklets were distributed. For soldiers in Gaza and the surrounding region, 140 tactical sukkahs, 2,500 compact prayer books, more than 2,400 Four Species sets, and 4,200 holiday law booklets were provided. Wives of reservists wanted to know if their husbands, returning from combat after weeks of reserve duty, were required to sleep in the sukkah The obvious question is whether soldiers are even obligated to sit in a sukkah. Many have recently asked Rabbi Yosef Zvi Rimon, rabbi of the Gush Etzion Regional Council, for clarification. He responded: 'Soldiers in Gaza, Lebanon, or in combat in the West Bank are exempt from the obligation of sitting in a sukkah. These soldiers aren’t just travelers; they’re engaged in a mitzvah and, as the Talmud teaches, 'one who is occupied with a mitzvah is exempt from another mitzvah,' especially in a defensive war. Soldiers staying at the base, who aren’t in combat, should make an effort to sit in a sukkah, except those in high-alert or stressful situations. In all cases, it’s best to consult with the military rabbi.' For soldiers able to sit in a sukkah but who haven’t received the proper equipment, the rabbi reminds them that a sukkah must be at least '10 handbreadths' high, between 80 cm and 96 cm (2.6 feet and 3.1 feet), depending on different rabbinic opinions, and at least 'seven by seven handbreadths' wide, 56 cm by 56 cm (1.8 feet), or 70 cm by 70 cm (2.3 feet) for those more stringent. When necessary, he notes, 'it is permissible to make a sukkah using car doors, with both doors open, and place schach above them. However, make sure the gap beneath the doors isn’t more than 24 cm. You can fix this by placing stones or something stable under the doors, or by parking the car so the doors are above a curb. The third wall can be made by adding a partition or parking another car nearby.' One sensitive issue has arisen in inquiries from the wives of reservists. They wanted to know if their husbands, returning from combat after weeks of reserve duty, were required to sleep in the sukkah, or if, according to Jewish law, they were allowed to sleep with their wives instead. 'The Talmud states that one must not sleep outside the sukkah,' Rimon replied, but he emphasized: 'Rabbi Moses Isserles justified those who are lenient. He said that since one is supposed to sleep with their spouse as they would at home, and since a wife generally cannot sleep in a sukkah, the husband is also exempt. While this reasoning is considered leniency, and many were hesitant to sleep in the sukkah outside Israel, in Israel, we should strive to have a proper, comfortable sukkah and sleep in it whenever possible. However, in cases of great discomfort – such as when being apart causes distress – this can exempt one from the obligation. For reservists returning home after a long period, it is clearly appropriate and permissible to sleep with their wives.'

Can Israel really destroy Iran's nuclear program?	Experts warn an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites could push Tehran closer to developing a nuclear weapon, potentially backfiring; diplomacy is seen as a safer path, since any military action risks wider regional conflict Could Israel destroy Iran’s nuclear program if it wanted to? And if Israel chose to attack Iranian nuclear facilities, would it be effective? Several experts say the outcome may not be what the Israeli public hopes for. An attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities could strengthen Iran’s resolve to acquire a nuclear weapon rather than eliminate its capability, says James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'They play, you play,' said Tel Aviv University Professor Eyal Zisser. 'You try not to cross a line. When the line is crossed, it’s total war. We have to consider what the repercussions would be.' Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon, but it has operated a civilian atomic energy program for over five decades. Analysts believe Iran could produce enough enriched uranium and the necessary components to build a nuclear weapon in a relatively short time. However, this doesn’t mean Israel can –or should – target Iran’s nuclear program the way it did with Iraq or Syria. Iran’s nuclear program relies on centrifuges rather than nuclear reactors, which are used to enrich uranium, James Acton explains. These are the same types of centrifuges that fuel power reactors. Centrifuges are small, about 20 centimeters to 30 centimeters in diameter, and one meter to two meters tall. Acton says Iran has at least a few thousand of these at two main sites: Natanz and Fordow. This situation is very different from Israel’s attacks on Iraq’s Osirak reactor in 1981 and Syria’s reactor in 2007. In those cases, the nuclear weapons programs were concentrated in a single, large facility centered around one reactor, which had required significant resources and investment to build. As a result, destroying those reactors effectively dismantled the entire nuclear program. The Osirak strike set Iraq’s nuclear ambitions back by at least a decade, while Syria, due to its ongoing civil war, has not been able to rebuild. Acton explains that Iran would likely respond by relocating any new facilities deeper underground or even hiding centrifuge operations in regular, unmarked industrial buildings in plain sight. As a result, Israel would have to continuously track and detect these sites, potentially launching new strikes every year or two. 'While an Israeli strike can dent its capabilities in the short term, it can’t remove those capabilities in the long term,' according to Acton. Regarding the two known facilities – though there may be additional clandestine sites – Natanz consists of a large underground facility housing around 50,000 centrifuges and a smaller facility at ground level. Acton estimated that the underground facility is no more than 10 meters deep. In contrast, the Fordow facility is buried within a mountain, likely 60 meters to 80 meters underground. Given this, there is considerable evidence suggesting that Israel lacks the capability to destroy Fordow. Acton explains that Israel would need the U.S.-developed Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) for such a mission. However, even if the U.S. were willing to provide Israel with the weapon, there would only be a practical way to deliver it to Iran with U.S. assistance. The MOP, over 20 feet long, is much larger than other bunker busters and penetrates deeper than any conventional alternative. Professor Hooshang Amirahmadi, president of the American Iranian Council and a professor at Rutgers University, suggested an alternative: using an Azerbaijani airbase near western Iran to get closer to the target. However, despite Israel’s strong ties with Azerbaijan, the country has never publicly agreed to such a plan, and Amirahmadi doubts it would allow Israel to do so. As such, unless Israel can carry out a cyberattack or find another method to disrupt Fordow, it will likely have to hold off without full US support. Even if attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities were possible, it might not be the best course of action, according to Acton. Although U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in June that Iran could produce enough fissile material for a weapon in 'one or two weeks,' the country would still need to take additional steps to turn this material into a functional weapon. Acton explains that he believes Iran is aiming to have the capability to build a nuclear weapon quickly but has not yet decided to actually produce one. 'An Israeli strike makes it much, much more likely that it will make the decision to do so,' Acton says. He added that if Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, it would feel significantly more emboldened. 'One can imagine an Iran more willing to strike Israel and target civilians with ballistic missiles, potentially in larger numbers,' and using its proxies more openly,' he says. 'I think a nuclear-armed Iran is a pretty bad prospect for Israel.' Both Acton and Amirahmadi agree that diplomacy is a better option and likely the one the US would prefer over a risky military response. Israeli action without U.S. support could strain the relationship between the two countries. 'The U.S. has already said it does not like the idea of Israel attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities because it thinks it can stop enrichment in Iran through negotiations, just like they did last time,' according to Amirahmadi. In 2015, Iran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. However, the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018. Acton believes another deal could be reached – perhaps not as sophisticated as the original JCPOA, but one that could still verifiably keep Iran short of developing a nuclear bomb. Acton notes that the U.S. would likely need to lead such an initiative, though another country could publicly take the lead while the US provides sanctions relief as part of the deal. He also expressed concern that diplomacy might be abandoned altogether if former President Donald Trump returns to office. On the other hand, he is 'not optimistic' that Vice President Kamala Harris, if elected, would prioritize such a deal, although she is 'temperamentally much more inclined to reach an agreement. ' Alternatively, Israel could choose to target Iran’s oil infrastructure, which might have an even greater impact, Amirahmadi said. 'What Iran is really concerned about is not that Israel will hit its nuclear program,' Amirahmadi explained. Instead, he said, a strike on the country’s oil supply and shipping infrastructure 'will certainly escalate this conflict' and could even lead to regime change because it would 'stop Iran from functioning economically.' However, he cautioned that if such a strike were to happen, 'you could not control Iran because Iran will feel very lost.'

Israel's long and winding road to achieving its war goals	Analysis: Israel’s strategy hinges on IDF military successes in Gaza and Lebanon, aiming to push adversaries toward a diplomatic resolution on Israeli terms; while the army has made progress, the political echelon has yet to take the necessary steps Israel has a clear strategy guiding both the military and political leadership in its current multi-front war. This is the impression gained from conversations with senior defense and intelligence officials, as well as field visits in Gaza and Lebanon. A note of caution: this strategy is not designed, nor does it aim, to deliver a 'total victory' in the war, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may have hoped while still in shock from the horrors of the October 7 attacks. However, it is capable of significantly improving the national security of all Israeli citizens and making a substantial positive impact on the personal safety of residents in the Western Negev and the Galilee—especially the 80,000 Israelis who have been displaced from their homes. The foundation of this strategy is the war's objectives, as formulated and approved by the Cabinet. These objectives, while intentionally vague due to political and coalition considerations, have been translated by the IDF into concrete terms. For each front, the IDF established its 'strategic purpose,' as understood by the top generals based on the Cabinet's decisions. From this, the IDF determined the specific missions, resources and combat methods. While the tactics and means have evolved over the past year of fighting, the strategic purpose for each front has remained consistent. The core principles of Israel’s political-security strategy are clear: the IDF will achieve military gains in Gaza and Lebanon that will compel the enemy on each front to seek, or even request, a diplomatic settlement to end the fighting on terms favorable to Israel and aligned with the Cabinet’s war objectives. In the other five theaters, including Iran, the goal is to restore and strengthen the strategic deterrence that was severely eroded on October 7. The transition from military success to a diplomatic resolution will be decided by the political leadership, specifically the prime minister, with Cabinet approval. In the other five theaters, including Iran, the goal is to restore and strengthen the strategic deterrence that was severely eroded on October 7. The aim is to reestablish a situation where Israel's adversaries, as well as those sitting on the sidelines, see Israel as a power not worth confronting—and, if possible, one worth cooperating with. Favorable terms in Lebanon This strategy is advancing more quickly in Lebanon than in other theaters, with the IDF nearing a point where diplomatic negotiations for a cease-fire may soon be possible, according to defense sources. Preliminary talks have already begun with intermediaries and relevant parties. This progress is largely due to the military achievements on the ground. The IDF has reportedly neutralized two-thirds of Hezbollah’s long-range missile capabilities and a significant portion of its short-range firepower. Hezbollah and Shiite leaders in Lebanon have expressed willingness to agree to a cease-fire in southern Lebanon without linking it to the ongoing war in Gaza. Additionally, Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force and other terrorists have been pushed 5 to 8 kilometers (3 to 5 miles) back from the border, with some forces retreating north of the Litani River. As a result, Hezbollah and Shiite leaders in Lebanon have expressed willingness to agree to a cease-fire in southern Lebanon without linking it to the ongoing war in Gaza. While the IDF believes there is room to further deepen its gains, the military has already submitted a proposal to the political leadership outlining Israel’s conditions for a potential agreement. The defense establishment hopes a diplomatic resolution in Lebanon will include the following: the removal of Hezbollah’s Radwan Force and its direct fire capabilities beyond the Litani River; restrictions on Lebanese civilians approaching the border; an internationally backed arms embargo on transfers from Iran to Lebanon; the deployment of the Lebanese Army to the south, strengthened and equipped by the U.S. and European nations under close supervision; and most crucially, ensuring that Israel retains freedom of military and intelligence operations within Lebanon to enforce any cease-fire. Unlike Gaza, the conditions in Lebanon are more conducive to a resolution. Lebanon has a government—albeit dysfunctional—with which negotiations are possible. Unlike Gaza, the conditions in Lebanon are more conducive to a resolution. Lebanon has a government—albeit dysfunctional—with which negotiations are possible, and there is support for a settlement from key international players, including the U.S., France, Saudi Arabia and other moderate Sunni nations. These countries are willing to fund Lebanon’s reconstruction and push for political reforms. Even Iran, Hezbollah’s patron, is reportedly interested in halting the fighting to allow Hezbollah time to regroup and rebuild its forces. Additionally, Hezbollah has been weakened, and both the Shiite community and broader Lebanese population, including over a million internally displaced people, are eager for a diplomatic settlement. Far from a settlement in Gaza Israel remains far from achieving its strategic objectives in Gaza, despite significant military advances. While Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have been largely dismantled as conventional military forces, both groups retain some active guerilla capabilities, and key elements of their infrastructure, including tunnels, remain intact. Hamas continues to recruit terrorists and rebuild command centers in areas vacated by the IDF. More concerning, the group has not relinquished its civilian control over Gaza and is using international humanitarian aid as a tool of governance, distributing it selectively and even selling supplies to fund its operations. There is no external force with enough influence over Hamas to secure the release of hostages or force the group to fully cede control of the Gaza Strip. Despite mediation efforts by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has so far refused to engage in negotiations, leaving both Israel and Gaza’s residents at an impasse. The military operation focused on Jabaliya has not achieved its full objectives. IDF officials admit that pressure on Hamas is insufficient and suggest that additional forces may be required to clear the remaining civilians. The IDF recently launched an operation in northern Gaza, led by the 162nd Division, with Hamas claiming it is an attempt to implement the so-called 'Generals' Plan' devised by retired IDF Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland. The plan aims to push northern Gaza residents southward, followed by a blockade that would cut off humanitarian aid to those remaining, whom Israel could classify as combatants under international law. Although Israel has not officially confirmed this plan, it has not denied it either. Currently, the military operation focused on Jabaliya has not achieved its full objectives. IDF officials admit that pressure on Hamas is insufficient and suggest that additional forces may be required to clear the remaining civilians and force Hamas into negotiations, possibly over hostages and an end to the fighting. The primary challenge, however, remains finding an alternative to Hamas’ civilian rule, which the group clings to as the key to its survival and ability to rebuild. Hamas' grip on power is reinforced by its control over humanitarian aid distribution. Israel is exploring options to wrest control of aid from Hamas, including the possibility of using a U.S. civilian company, under IDF protection, to deliver and manage aid distribution. Various proposals are under consideration, but the defense establishment has made it clear that IDF troops will not be directly responsible for humanitarian aid distribution, to avoid risking soldiers' lives. While not officially endorsed by the Cabinet, Israel’s undeclared war objective is to restore its strategic deterrence against the entire Shiite axis led by Iran. The IDF strikes on Hezbollah and Hamas have largely rebuilt much of the deterrence lost after the October 7 attacks. However, Iran—the 'head of the snake' driving the ring of fire around Israel—remains neither fully deterred nor significantly weakened. As for a formal alternative civilian government in Gaza, Israel acknowledges it does not want to assume control of the Palestinian enclave. Netanyahu’s office has also ruled out the Palestinian Authority (PA) as a potential governing force, not only due to opposition from far-right coalition partners Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, but also because the PA, under Mahmoud Abbas, is seen as too weak to assert control over Hamas. Israeli officials believe the PA would, at best, manage civilian affairs—such as education, healthcare and infrastructure—while allowing Hamas and PIJ to continue operating as armed factions, similar to the situation in Lebanon with Hezbollah. For Israel, this scenario is unacceptable. Despite military successes, such as dismantling Hamas and PIJ’s armies and securing strategic corridors in Gaza, Netzarim and Philadelphi, Israel has no clear plan for dismantling Hamas' civilian control, which remains one of the key war objectives. The situation requires creative and flexible solutions that the current government, under Netanyahu, has yet to produce, largely due to political and personal constraints. Deterring Iran While not officially endorsed by the Cabinet, Israel’s undeclared war objective is to restore its strategic deterrence against the entire Shiite axis led by Iran. The IDF strikes on Hezbollah and Hamas have largely rebuilt much of the deterrence lost after the October 7 attacks. However, Iran—the 'head of the snake' driving the ring of fire around Israel—remains neither fully deterred nor significantly weakened. Although it has also taken hits, and the combined losses of Hamas and Hezbollah, along with Iran's missile attack failures, have sharply increased Israel’s deterrence, the goal is still not fully achieved. Much now depends on the impact of Israel's response to the Iranian missile strike on October 1. A key factor in Israel’s deterrence, and its ability to achieve its war aims, is its relationship with the U.S. and international legitimacy. With the U.S. election race in full swing, Netanyahu—who, along with Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, is navigating Israel’s U.S. relations—must tread carefully. While Netanyahu has made no secret of his hope for a Trump victory, he understands that Vice President Kamala Harris has a strong chance of winning, and thus must maintain good relations with her as well. This explains why, according to The Washington Post, Israel informed the U.S. that it does not intend to target Iran’s oil or nuclear facilities in its retaliatory strikes. It also explains why Israel, at the request of the U.S. and France, has significantly reduced its airstrikes in Beirut to avoid harming American civilians. The bottom line: Israel has a strategy that the IDF is implementing with some success, but the real challenges lie ahead in the coming months. There may be results by the end of the year, but a note of caution is warranted—Israel’s current government and coalition are unpredictable and could become an obstacle to a diplomatic resolution that would secure most of the war’s objectives.

Canada suffers 670% jump in number of antisemitic incidents	Report by the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism shows a dramatic increase in hate crimes against Jews in Canada since war broke out in Israel. The most recent incident reported: a shooting outside a Jewish girls' school in Toronto during Yom Kippur Canada has experienced a dramatic 670% increase in the number of reported antisemitic incidents since October 7, 2023, compared to the same period last year, according to a report by the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism released on Tuesday. This increase includes violent incidents such as shootings at Jewish institutions, and arson attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and other community institutions. Although Jews make up only 1.4% of the Canadian population, they are the victims of 70% of the hate crimes committed on religious grounds in Canada. In the city of Toronto, 19% of all hate crimes in 2023 were aimed at Jews, a figure that jumped dramatically in the last quarter of the year, at the same time as the growing tensions in the Middle East. In the latest incident, Toronto police have opened an investigation into a suspected hate crime following a shooting outside a Jewish girls' school on Yom Kippur. No casualties were reported, but damage was done to the school, including a window that was shattered by bullets fired at the school building. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau commented on the incident and wrote: 'Antisemitism is a dangerous and ugly form of hatred, and we will not allow it to pass in silence.' Pro-Palestinian protests have contributed significantly to the rise of antisemitism in Canada, particularly among campus activist groups and leftist organizations, with many doing so while connecting anti-Israel sentiments with broader revolutionary ideas. This led to increased expressions of support for terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah, alongside incidents of violence that occurred during demonstrations in major cities such as Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto, as well as prominent universities such as McGill. In the Israeli report, for example, a number of 'Prominent Antisemitic Generators and Influencers in Canada' are cited, including Sarah Jama, a provincial member of parliament in Ontario. Jama publicly blamed Israel for the massacre of approximately 1,200 Israelis by Hamas on October 7, 2023, leading to her condemnation in Ontario's provincial parliament. On November 25, 2023, at a rally in Ottawa, Jama called for the destruction of Israel using the slogan 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.' Jama publicly denied documented atrocities committed by Hamas in the October 7 terrorist attack, including the rape of Israeli women, claiming there was no actual evidence of it. She is associated with groups such as the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), the BDS movement and other anti-Israel groups. She expressed support for the pro-Hamas encampment at the University of Toronto, which was part of a broader movement on North American campuses to promote anti-Israel rhetoric and harass Jewish students. Another influencer in the report is Laith Marouf, of Lebanese descent, a former consultant funded by the Department of Canadian Heritage. Marouf made a number of explosive antisemitic comments on social media, including referring to Jews as 'bags of human feces' and declaring that they deserve a 'bullet to the head.' Despite his history of hate speech, Marouf's organization, the Community Media Advocacy Center (CMAC), has received over $500,000 in Canadian government contracts. When his antisemitic comments came to light, it sparked outrage in Canada. In 2022, after Marouf's statements were revealed, the Canadian government suspended a $133,000 contract with CMAC, and the Department of Canadian Heritage took legal action to recover the funds. Another body linked to hatred of Israel is the Samidoun organization, which the United States and Canada have already announced sanctions against due to its support for terrorism. The Canadian branch of the organization is a pro-Palestinian network established in 2011. Its stated goal is to 'support Palestinian prisoners and advocate for the Palestinian struggle against Israel' through rallies, conferences and demonstrations. Samidoun has already been outlawed in Israel and Germany for its open support of Palestinian terrorism and ties to groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Other names that appear in the report are those of Brandon Taylor Moore, a Canadian-American real estate broker who is active on social media - his comments blame Jews for global issues, promote antisemitic myths, and suggest Jewish complicity in the Holocaust; and Samira Mohyeddin - an independent Canadian journalist and influencer, a former host on CBC Radio in Canada and currently host of the 'On the Line' podcast. She promotes anti-Zionist and antisemitic content on her platforms, particularly in reference to Israel's alleged genocidal intentions. The Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: 'The current reports produced by the ministry allow us to closely follow and monitor the state of antisemitism in each country. In the past year, the Jewish community in Canada has faced a reality it had not known before: a dramatic increase in the scope of antisemitic events, verbal and physical attacks in the public sphere and discourse. We are working together with the Jewish community on this issue, and this coming November the ministry will hold a course for 30 rabbis and community leaders from Canada, which should give Canadian Jews a significant boost during this difficult time. We are closely following the perpetrators of antisemitism and delegitimization against the State of Israel, and are constantly working together with the various authorities to narrow their steps and outlaw them.'

Preparing to attack Iran: Guarantees to US, Russian pressure and ...	It's been two weeks since Iran attacked Israel and there has been no response yet; US received guarantees that Iran's oil and nuclear facilities will not be the targets, at least this time; Russia is also pressing for a limited retaliation; Gallant: 'Our response will be precise, painful and surprising' Two weeks have passed since Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, and there is still no Israeli response. The United States believes that they have received guarantees from Israel that this response will not include Iranian oil or nuclear facilities, but those assurances do not extend to future attacks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to hold a limited consultation regarding the response on Friday, and on Sunday the political-security cabinet will convene. After the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal reported that Netanyahu informed the Biden administration that he planned to attack Iranian t recent attack. military targets and not oil or nuclear facilities, the New York Times also reported on the decision, but emphasized that the decision only refers to the response to the most recent attack. According to the report, a final decision has not yet been made, and the Israeli response attack could still be large in scope, which may lead to several rounds of attacks. Two sources familiar with the matter said that 'Israel's assurances to the Americans touched on the upcoming attack, which means that Israel can still hit more ambitious targets in future rounds of attacks against Iran.' The Biden administration believes that sending the THAAD air defense system, with about 100 soldiers to operate it, is expected to somewhat alleviate Israel's fears of the Iranian response. Reports from the past few days indicate that the arrival of that battery - components of which have already landed in Israel - is considered part of the coordination between Israel and the U.S., and possibly is a return that Israel received in exchange for responding to U.S. requests to refrain from attacking nuclear facilities. Still, the Associated Press reported that U.S. officials warned that the assurances received by the United States 'are not set in stone and the circumstances may change.' They said that Israel had a 'mixed past' regarding keeping promises, and that more than once internal politics led to change. Meanwhile, pressure is also coming from Russia. The Russian President's special representative for the Middle East and African countries, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, said that Moscow maintains contacts at various levels with Israel, and conveyed Russia's concerns regarding a possible Israeli response to Iran. 'We are in contact with the embassies, our ambassador also maintains contacts through other channels, and they are conducted daily,' the deputy minister noted. In an interview with the Arabic-language Al-Hurra network, IDF spokesman Brigadier General Daniel Hagari was asked about Israel's response plan to Iran and said that Israel 'knows how to protect its citizens.' He was asked if the same THAAD system that Israel received from Washington is an indication of an imminent Israeli attack and answered: 'Israel knows what to do at the time and in the manner it chooses.' Hagari did not explicitly answer the question of whether Israel would coordinate the response with other countries, emphasizing that Israel is not fighting Iran or the Iranian people, but the regime. In preparation for that Israeli attack, and Iran's expected response, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant convened the Supreme Military (Emergency Economy) Committee. In the discussion, Gallant insisted on the readiness of the various systems, with an emphasis on the health, energy and communication systems, to deal with a scenario of widespread rocket fire at the State of Israel. 'After defending Israel about two weeks ago from a vicious Iranian attack of 200 ballistic missiles that were fired at us, we have no intention of putting up with a violation of our sovereignty and an attempt to harm Israeli citizens and infrastructure without reacting' Gallant said. 'The response against Iran will be precise, painful and surprising. ... The meaning of such an action could also affect other places. We have seen examples of this.' 'We have no interest in opening additional fronts and additional operations,' Gallant added. 'I am involved in preparing the security system, together with The Chief of Staff, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. All in all, we are all seeing things eye to eye, both in relation to the need for a response and the essence of the response.'

US delivers 'harshest message in decades,' officials say after ar...	While France, Italy and others have imposed arms embargoes on Israel, Blinken-Austin memo stands out; officials say urgent steps needed to increase Gaza aid and avoid munitions crisis; US calls for Red Cross visits to Palestinian inmates and freeze on anti-UNRWA legislation France, Italy and other European countries have already imposed arms embargoes on Israel, but the new U.S. threat to impose a similar embargo if humanitarian aid is not delivered to Gaza is particularly unusual. Israeli officials said Tuesday night that this is the harshest letter the United States has sent to Israel in decades, particularly with the threat to cut off the supply of weapons. Israel will soon have to take significant action to increase humanitarian aid to avoid a crisis with the U.S. There has been no substantial change in Israel's policy regarding humanitarian aid to Gaza, according to Israeli officials. They attribute the harsh letter to the U.S. administration's lack of confidence in Israel's intentions. U.S. officials reportedly feared that Israel was planning to starve Gaza, in line with the so-called 'General's Plan' proposed by retired IDF Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, which involves isolating northern Gaza. Israel has removed the private sector from the distribution of aid and closed crossings in northern Gaza, leading to a significant reduction in the number of aid trucks entering the Palestinian enclave. This raised suspicions in Washington that Israel was deliberately limiting aid. Recent discussions about having the IDF manage aid distribution did little to alleviate those concerns. The backdrop to this situation is the growing crisis of trust between the White House and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Notably, the letter from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was addressed to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, bypassing Netanyahu. The letter demands that Israel take concrete steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within 30 days. In addition to ensuring regular aid transfers, the U.S. also calls on Israel to allow Red Cross visits to Palestinian detainees and to halt Knesset legislation that would prevent the Palestinian aid agency UNRWA from operating in Israel. The deeper implication of the Blinken-Austin letter is that if Israel does not address the humanitarian crisis in northern Gaza within 30 days, it could face a severe arms crisis, as the U.S. continues to delay shipments of heavy bombs. Failure to meet the U.S. demands could jeopardize the continuation of military aid, which requires approval from both Blinken and Austin. The letter cites Section 620i of the Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibits military aid to countries that block U.S. humanitarian assistance. It also references a national security memorandum issued by President Joe Biden in February, requiring the State Department to report to Congress on Israel’s compliance with U.S. and international law in its use of American weapons. Senior officials said the letter was no surprise, as the U.S. had been warning Israel for weeks that it was heading in this direction. They described it as a 'wake-up call' for Israel to comply with U.S. legislation, noting that the administration’s ability to provide munitions could be constrained. In their letter, Blinken and Austin emphasized that the U.S. State and Defense departments are required to continuously evaluate Israel's adherence to its commitment to 'facilitate and not arbitrarily deny, restrict or otherwise impede, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance and U.S. government-supported international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance' to Gaza. 'We are now writing to underscore the U.S. government's deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory,' the American officials wrote. 'Despite the July transition from combat operations to Special Counterterrorism Operations in the Gaza Strip, multiple evacuation orders have forced 1.7 million people into a narrow coastal strip from Muwasi to Deir al-Balah. Extreme overcrowding has put these civilians at risk of lethal contagions,' according to the letter. The letter is a 'wake-up call' for Israel to comply with U.S. legislation 'We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza,' the letter also said. Since Israel’s assurances in March and a subsequent letter in April, which had led to improvements in aid delivery, the amount of assistance entering Gaza has dropped by over 50%, according to the letter. Aid deliveries in September were reportedly the lowest in a year. The U.S. letter outlined a series of demands, including allowing at least 350 trucks of aid into Gaza daily, instituting humanitarian pauses across the Strip, permitting civilians in Muwasi and the humanitarian zone to move east before winter, canceling evacuation orders where no operational need exists, speeding up World Food Program efforts, removing dual-use items from restricted lists and creating an expedited aid route through Ashdod port. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the Biden administration had made similar requests regarding humanitarian aid in April and had received a positive response from Israel. 'This letter comes following a decrease in the amount of humanitarian aid getting into Gaza, which we have been very worried about since the beginning of the conflict,' he told a press briefing. 'Why was the letter sent? Because there was a drop in humanitarian aid. It's not that we didn't convey these concerns to the Israelis. 'There is a sense of urgency regarding the desperate need for aid in Gaza. President Biden has consistently raised this issue with the Israelis. He has been fully aware of the efforts to communicate these concerns, both verbally and in writing, and it has come up in his talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu.' 'The weapon may lead to a violation of international law' Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron called for an end to the transfer of weapons to Israel that might be used in the war in Gaza. This followed his support for a September 18 resolution initiated by the Palestinians at the UN General Assembly. Relations between France and Israel reached a nadir on Monday evening when Macron criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a closed session with his ministers. 'Netanyahu must not forget that his country was established by a UN resolution; he cannot disregard his obligations to those resolutions,' Macron reportedly said according to French newspaper Le Parisien. Netanyahu later rebuked the French leader's remarks in a phone call. On Tuesday evening, the French government decided to ban Israeli companies from participating in Euronaval, the world’s largest naval weapons fair, scheduled to be held next month in Paris. Twelve Israeli companies had planned to exhibit at the event. If this negative trend continues, it will likely also prevent Israeli participation in the Air Salon in Le Bourget, the crown jewel of defense exhibitions. Britain has already announced the suspension of around 30 arms export licenses to Israel out of roughly 350. The decision was made by the Labour government, which emphasized that it was not an arms embargo. It explained that an inspection had found a 'clear risk' that the weapons could lead to 'a significant violation of international law.' Meanwhile, Germany has begun rejecting Israeli requests to purchase various weapons and is effectively operating a 'silent embargo' on Israel. Italy halted arms transfers on October 7, 2023, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her country’s parliament. 'We have frozen all contracts,' she said. Referring to an incident in which the IDF fired at a UNIFIL post in southern Lebanon, Meloni added that she would visit Beirut.

Tel Aviv man arrested for allegedly spying for Iran, planned assa...	Vladimir Varkhovsky, 35, allegedly agreed to assassinate scientist for $100,000 and had acquired weapon for task; suspect reportedly promised assistance in fleeing to Russia following assassination Israeli authorities have arrested a Tel Aviv resident on suspicion of carrying out missions for Iranian intelligence, including graffiti, distributing flyers and gathering information on Israeli targets, Israeli Police announced Wednesday morning. According to officials, Vladimir Varkhovsky, 35, allegedly agreed to assassinate an Israeli scientist for $100,000 and had obtained a weapon for the task. The Shin Bet said communication with his handlers was in English. He is expected to appear in Lod District Court for a remand hearing later Wednesday. The indictment accuses Varkhovsky of contacting a foreign agent, illegal possession of a weapon and conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism. According to the indictment, Varkhovsky communicated with an Iranian agent via the Telegram messaging app and carried out several tasks for the agent between August and September 2024. These included spraying anti-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu graffiti around Tel Aviv, placing plastic containers with tracking devices near Segula Cemetery in Petah Tikva and filming protests in Tel Aviv in an attempt to connect with another demonstrator. Varkhovsky was reportedly instructed to retrieve a pistol intended for the assassination of the Israeli scientist. The foreign agent promised him $100,000 and assistance in fleeing to Russia after the murder. Varkhovsky collected the gun and matching magazine at a pre-arranged location as part of the plot. He received payment for his activities in digital currency. In his remand request, prosecutors noted that 'the defendant committed serious security offenses while Israel is engaged in one of its most challenging wars, with Iran among the adversaries. The defendant knew the agent represented a hostile entity and continued cooperating with him. His actions were thwarted thanks to the efforts of Israeli security forces, who arrested him before the assassination plan could be completed.' The intelligence network that led to Varkhovsky’s arrest was uncovered through a joint investigation by the Shin Bet and the Israeli police’s serious crime Lahav 433 unit, often dubbed 'the Israeli FBI.' 'Varkhovsky documented some of the tasks he carried out and received payment for them. His communication with Iranian agents was conducted in English, and he was instructed to purchase a dedicated phone for these interactions,' the Shin Bet said in a statement. The Shin Bet and police warned that Iranian intelligence has used social media platforms to recruit unsuspecting Israelis for various tasks. 'While some assignments may initially seem harmless, they pose a genuine threat to national security. Many Israelis who received suspicious outreach did not respond and alerted the authorities,' the statement added. Superintendent Maor Goren, head of the security division at Lahav 433, added: 'This case is part of a series of serious investigations where Israeli citizens were recruited by foreign agents. However, this case stands out due to its severity and boldness: the defendant had already armed himself with a pistol, magazine and bullets, after agreeing to carry out the murder of a scientist for $100,000 and planning to flee the country with the foreign agent’s help to Russia immediately after the attack.' The indictment follows a similar case just days earlier, in which a couple from the nearby city of Ramat Gan was charged with contacting an Iranian agent and agreeing to assassinate Israeli officials.

North Korean state media said on Wednesday around 1.4 million young people had applied to join or return to the army this week, blaming Seoul for a provocative drone incursion that had brought the 'tense situation to the brink of war.' The fiery rhetoric comes after North Korea last week accused Seoul of sending drones over Pyongyang that scattered a 'huge number' of anti-North leaflets. It then blew up inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the border on Tuesday, and warned that the South would 'pay a dear price.' The young people, including students and youth league officials who had signed petitions to join the army, were determined to fight in a 'sacred war of destroying the enemy with the arms of the revolution,' the official KCNA news agency said. Photographs published by KCNA showed what it said were young people signing petitions at an undisclosed location.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1wyi0ny1l	2024-10-15T23:23:52-07:00	
After 6-day lull, IDF strikes Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut	Israeli fighter jets strike Hezbollah weapons cache stored in underground facility in Dahieh district, days after request from Biden to reduce military actions in Lebanese capital Israeli fighter jets struck a Hezbollah weapons cache stored in an underground facility in Beirut's Dahieh district early Wednesday, the IDF said, marking Israel's first strike on the Hezbollah stronghold in six days. Sky News Arabia reported explosions in Dahieh shortly after IDF Arabic-language spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee issued a public warning, calling on residents of specific buildings in the Hezbollah-controlled suburb of the Lebanese capital to evacuate immediately, claiming that they were near Hezbollah facilities targeted for destruction. 'This is an urgent warning. You are located near Hezbollah facilities the IDF will strike soon. For your safety and the safety of your families, you must leave,' Adraee wrote on X. The military said extensive precautions were taken to minimize civilian casualties, including prior warnings to the local population guided by intelligence from the IDF’s Intelligence Directorate. The strike came after a brief lull in Beirut attacks, which coincided with a request from U.S. President Joe Biden to reduce military actions in Lebanon’s capital. In addition to the Beirut strikes, the IDF carried out extensive airstrikes in southern Lebanon, including in the city of Nabatieh. Earlier, the IDF reported that 98th Division forces had killed dozens of terrorists in southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours in clashes and airstrikes. The forces also discovered a massive cache of weapons, including firearms, grenades, rocket launchers and anti-tank missiles aimed at northern Israeli communities. The IDF also revealed that, with guidance from the Northern Command, more than 140 Hezbollah targets were hit across 50 locations in Lebanon. These strikes targeted weapons depots, rocket launchers, military sites and terrorist squads. In one instance, 91st Division troops spotted terrorists firing at them and directed an Israeli Air Force aircraft to eliminate the attackers. Overnight Wednesday, Hezbollah launched a heavy barrage of rockets at Safed and surrounding areas in northern Israel. The IDF reported that around 50 rockets were fired from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted. Several rockets hit the area, including one that landed in a residential yard. Shrapnel caused damage to a building, and two civilians were lightly injured while seeking shelter and were taken to a hospital. Meanwhile, in Gaza, Israeli airstrikes, in coordination with the 454th Fire Division, killed Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, commander of Hamas' drone operations in northern Gaza. Al-Mabhouh had overseen drone launches aimed at Israel and IDF forces. In Jabaliya, 162nd Division troops eliminated terrorists in close-quarter firefights and airstrikes. Additionally, in the Rafah area, Nahal Brigade soldiers, operating under the Gaza Division, used drones to target and neutralize an armed terrorist cell planning an attack.

IDF raids Hezbollah strongholds from Mount Dov, operates special ...	Forces from the Heharim Brigade, including the special mountain infantry Alpinist Unit, carried out targeted raids in dense terrain within Hezbollah’s Radwan Force compounds Forces from the 810th Heharim (Mountain) Regional Brigade, including the special mountain infantry Alpinist Unit, have been conducting targeted raids from the Har Dov area into dense terrain in southern Lebanon over the last week. These operations, under the command of the 210th Division, aim to strike Hezbollah's terror infrastructure and prevent its entrenchment in the area. So far, the brigade has carried out several focused raids on Hezbollah’s Radwan Force compounds, which were used by terrorists to launch terror activities. Alongside the Alpinists, the forces also include the 9204th Infantry Battalion and the 8130th Armored Battalion of the HeHarim Brigade. They have successfully located and destroyed weapons caches, surveillance equipment and military infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah. In one abandoned Hezbollah compound, soldiers found a solar panel that had been providing the terrorists with electricity, enabling them to remain there for extended periods. Among the items destroyed were technological devices and additional weaponry. Footage from the site revealed batteries at the entrance and a Star of David imprinted on the ground – likely trampled by the terrorists. 'This was a massive complex meant to sustain them for a long time without outside support,' said one soldier in a video. 'In the past two weeks, we’ve been operating inside Lebanon to locate and destroy the enemy’s infrastructure and weaponry, which they’ve accumulated over a long period to use against us when the time came,' Colonel Liron Appleman, commander of the Heharim Brigade, said. ' We prepared for this day, trained our troops, and we’ll do whatever it takes to complete the mission. We will change the security situation here and bring the residents of the north back to their homes quickly and safely.' The Alpinist Unit consists of reservists who served in elite infantry units during their regular service. During normal times, regular infantry units patrol the upper Hermon Ridge in the summer, but as winter approaches, only the Alpinists are called up, as they are the only ones trained to operate in the heavy snow.

Murder, drugs and arms smuggling: Meet Maher al-Assad, Iran's man...	Syrian president's brother and commander of the elite Fourth Division plays a key role in advancing Tehran’s influence within the regime; even his sister-in-law accuses him of being equally complicit in crimes against the Syrian people On Sunday, Sept. 29, Israel reportedly launched an airstrike on a villa in the Yafour area on the outskirts of Damascus, according to Arab media reports. The villa is said to belong to Syria's elite Fourth Division, commanded by Maher al-Assad, the brother of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition-affiliated war monitor, reported that senior Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard officials frequented the villa. No casualties were reported in the strike. The group also claimed that Assad had been warned that any transfer of weapons from the Fourth Division’s stockpiles to Lebanon would make them a target of future Israeli strikes. It described Assad as a key figure in Iran’s influence within the Syrian regime and someone closely aligned with Hezbollah. Although rumors circulated about Assad’s fate following the attack, Syrian sources said he was not present at the villa at the time. Over the years, there have been multiple unconfirmed reports of Maher being injured or killed, but none have been verified. Following the villa strike, additional airstrikes were reported in Syria in the following days. Israel has long aimed to disrupt Hezbollah’s weapons supply routes through Syria, which are part of the broader Iranian-Shia axis. On Oct. 3, just days after the villa strike, another Israeli attack reportedly targeted a site linked to the Fourth Division near Yafour. According to Qatari newspaper The New Arab, an Israeli drone hit the division's site west of Damascus. Opposition-linked Syrian outlet Voice of the Capital added that Israeli drones were targeted in interception attempts around the Yafour, Dimas and Jadida Al-Shibani areas in Damascus’s suburbs. While strikes on the Fourth Division are nothing new, the recent escalation raises questions about the intensity of the attacks and the prominent role of Maher al-Assad, who oversees everything from above. Succession hopes derailed by fiery temperament Maher al-Assad, born on Dec. 8, 1967, is the youngest son of Syria’s late President Hafez al-Assad and his wife Anisa Makhlouf. He grew up largely out of the public eye as his father assumed power, and later studied at Damascus University. Following his studies, Maher joined the Syrian military, following in the footsteps of his older brother, Bassel al-Assad. After Bassel’s death in a car accident in 1994, Maher was considered a potential successor to his father, but the role ultimately went to his brother Bashar, despite Bashar’s lack of military experience. Reports suggest Maher’s fiery temperament played a role in him being passed over. Maher is married to Manal Tawfiq Jadaan and has two daughters and a son. Assad is known in Syria as a ruthless military commander, holding a rank equivalent to major general and leading the elite Fourth Division of the Syrian army, one of the most loyal divisions to the Assad regime. In recent years, the Fourth Division has also become an economic powerhouse, overseeing the production and smuggling of drugs, particularly the stimulant Captagon, which is trafficked from Syria to other countries in the region. Some reports link Assad to the leadership of the Republican Guard, an elite unit tasked with defending the regime and Damascus from external threats, although other sources dispute his involvement. Assad has faced opposition from within his own family. His sister-in-law, Majd Tawfiq Jadaan, aligned with the Syrian opposition, has publicly denounced him, describing him as being like his father, Hafez, in 'malice, cunning and crimes.' In a past interview, she accused Assad of playing a central role in the destruction of Syria and the genocide of its people, saying he bears as much responsibility as his brother Bashar. In 2011, Assad was targeted by U.S. sanctions imposed on his brother's regime. Then-President Barack Obama signed an executive order sanctioning Syria’s intelligence agency and two of Bashar’s relatives, including Maher, in response to the brutal crackdown on the popular uprising that spiraled into the country's more-than-a-decade-long civil war. The other relative sanctioned was Atef Najib, a cousin of the president.

IDF chief: Hezbollah hides its dead as Israel tightens the noose	Halevi says military will 'apply more pressure as Hezbollah faces growing distress'; army spokesperson Hagari presents graphic of top Hezbollah leaders killed, noting fate of Nasrallah's successor and intelligence chief remains unclear Israel's military chief said on Tuesday that Hezbollah’s decision to withhold information about its casualties shows the terrorist group is in a difficult position. 'Hezbollah is hiding its casualties while fabricating losses on our side, There is a gap that shows the organization is in a difficult situation,' IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said during a security briefing. 'We need to widen this gap, protect our forces, strike their operatives and apply more pressure as Hezbollah faces growing distress.' Halevi’s remarks come as Hezbollah has reportedly stopped publishing its daily list of casualties since Israel launched its Operation Northern Arrows, which opened with a spree of exploding pagers and walkie-talkies that killed dozens of Hezbollah terrorists and maimed thousands and continued with airstrikes on Beirut and a ground incursion into southern Lebanon. While the group has also refrained from disclosing the names of its senior commanders killed in the fighting, Israel continues to target key figures. Meanwhile, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari highlighted on Tuesday during an interview with the U.S.-based Arabic-language channel Alhurra the list of top Hezbollah commanders killed since the start of the war, including Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. Hagari presented a graphic showing other high-ranking figures, such as Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah’s expected successor, and Hezbollah intelligence chief Ali Hussein Hazima, though their deaths remain unconfirmed. Among the confirmed slain leaders are Ibrahim Muhammad Qubaisi, head of Hezbollah’s missile and rocket division; Ali Karaki, southern front commander; and Ibrahim Aqil, head of operations. The list also includes Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah’s top military commander, Nabil Qaouk, head of Hezbollah's preventive security unit, and several others responsible for arms transfers and air defense. Hagari reiterated that Hezbollah initiated the hostilities last year and emphasized that the Israeli military would continue targeting locations where the group stores weapons. 'Any home containing Hezbollah weaponry will be struck,' he said, adding that Lebanon’s borders would remain under close surveillance to prevent arms smuggling. 'We are not at war with the state of Lebanon or its people,' Hagari said, clarifying that Israeli operations are focused on Hezbollah’s use of southern Lebanese villages as military bases. 'Our actions are limited to targeting the villages Hezbollah has turned into terror hubs near our border.'

Hezbollah fighters targeted for capture as IDF applies Gaza tunne...	8th Armored Brigade reservists, at deepest point of Israel’s southern Lebanon offensive, uncover underground terror base, highlight physical challenges of navigating tough terrain and finding weapons caches and tunnels unknown even to intelligence While regular IDF brigades like Golani and the Paratroopers fight in southern Lebanon border villages, reserve brigades are tasked with deeper missions as part of Israel’s ground operation to eliminate Hezbollah's Radwan Force threat to the Galilee. Now in its third week, the mission focuses on clearing the border region of this invasion threat. Reservists from the 8th Armored Brigade, who until a few weeks ago were expanding the Beit Hanoun corridor and conducting raids in northern Gaza neighborhoods like Zeitoun and Al-Rimal, now find themselves fighting in one of the northernmost points of Israel's ground operation in southern Lebanon—reportedly the farthest from the border, according to a senior officer. On Monday, the 8th Armored Brigade uncovered Hezbollah’s largest combat tunnel found by the IDF in Lebanon. Located on the outskirts of a major village in the eastern sector, the tunnel was designed to launch hundreds of Radwan fighters toward Kiryat Shmona. The concealed underground complex, stretching about 800 meters (0.5 miles), included sleeping quarters for long-term stays, designed to withstand airstrikes. It featured a fully equipped kitchen, showers, motorcycles, off-road vehicles and hundreds of advanced weapons, including Kornet anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft systems and personal firearms. Fresh food indicated that Radwan operatives had been present until recently. Soldiers identified a terrorist attempting to exit one of the shafts through a nearby apartment and eliminated him from the air. The discovery of this large underground base was attributed to ground searches conducted by soldiers rather than specific intelligence. The tunnel was demolished within three days of its discovery, a result of lessons learned from the fighting in Gaza. At the start of the ground incursion against Hamas, it took Israeli forces weeks to inspect and destroy tunnels due to fears of booby traps and ambushes. However, thanks to improved combat tactics, new methods and advanced technologies developed in Gaza, this process has been significantly shortened to just a few days, sometimes less. Operations against tunnels now proceed more efficiently, often involving IDF tracker dogs or specialized drones to scan underground areas before troops enter. The need to stretch resources across multiple fronts has kept IDF soldiers on duty throughout the holiday period, with the ground operation in southern Lebanon relying heavily on the Northern Command's reserve brigades, alongside younger regular forces from the 36th and 98th Divisions. Despite years of neglect, the confidence that reservists have instilled in the General Staff and political echelon over the past year is paying off. Soldiers in their 30s and 40s from the 8th Armored Brigade crossed into southern Lebanon, covering challenging terrain and marching miles to reach their objectives. 'The soldiers marched all night to reach their targets and quickly received supplies and reinforcements along the logistical routes we opened,' the IDF said. 'Only a few soldiers reported feeling unwell, so we deployed the brigade’s tanks.' Troops were also briefed on how to avoid being captured by Hezbollah, a key objective for the terror group. Additionally, a primary directive was emphasized: capture Hezbollah terrorists and Lebanese suspects as high-value operational and intelligence targets.

The Biden administration believes it has won assurances from Israel that it will not hit Iranian nuclear or oil sites as it looks to strike back following Iran's missile barrage earlier this month, two U.S. officials said Tuesday. The administration also believes that sending a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel and roughly 100 soldiers to operate it has eased some of Israel's concerns about possible Iranian retaliation and general security issues. The Pentagon on Sunday announced the THAAD deployment to help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran's ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October, saying it was authorized at the direction of President Joe Biden. However, the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic discussions, cautioned that Israel's assurances are not ironclad and that circumstances could change. The officials also noted that Israel's track record on fulfilling pledges in the past is mixed and has often reflected domestic Israeli politics that have upended Washington's expectations.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkvb6nhjkx	2024-10-15T12:06:48-07:00

Radwan Force fled after Nasrallah’s assassination, captured Hezbo...	Detained fighter, shown in footage emerging from southern Lebanon tunnel, claims all local commanders scattered, plan to invade Galilee scrapped following arch-terrorist's killing; IDF forces nab 3 more Radwan fighters holed up in underground tunnel Three Hezbollah operatives from the terrorist group’s elite Radwan Force were captured by IDF Golani Brigade soldiers in southern Lebanon, the army announced Tuesday evening. In footage from the interrogation of a Hezbollah terrorist, identified as Waddah Younis, he claimed that Hezbollah fighters fled following the assassination of their leader Hassan Nasrallah last month and that senior commanders in the sector had abandoned their posts early in the fighting. Younis was the first Hezbollah fighter captured since Israel's ground operation began. According to the military, soldiers discovered an underground tunnel in a building used by Hezbollah terrorists. After surrounding the site, Younis surrendered and was taken into custody for interrogation, where he described the Radwan Force as unmotivated and primarily interested in financial gain. He also said their plan to advance into Israel’s Galilee was scrapped after Nasrallah’s death. Two more Hezbollah fighters were later captured when Israeli forces uncovered another underground tunnel in the same area. The operatives, along with a large cache of weapons, surrendered after being surrounded. All three captives are currently being held and interrogated by Israel's Unit 504, which specializes in intelligence gathering and field interrogations. Unlike in the Gaza Strip, Unit 504’s intelligence network in Lebanon has been extensive and deeply established over the years. The use of agents in Lebanon has provided invaluable intelligence, playing a key role in the IDF’s recent operations across the country. Much like in Gaza, Unit 504 operatives are embedded directly with combat units, working alongside soldiers to guide them to targets and conduct field interrogations. Captured terrorists are then transferred to specialized facilities, where professional interrogators focus on extracting critical information to aid ongoing military efforts.

Israel's demining near Golan signals wider front against Hezbolla...	Sources say move may allow strikes on Hezbollah from east, targeting supply routes from Syria and tightening pressure on terror group from multiple fronts In a sign Israel may expand its ground operations against Hezbollah while bolstering its own defenses, its troops have cleared landmines and established new barriers on the frontier between the Golan Heights and a demilitarized strip bordering Syria, security sources and analysts said. The move suggests Israel may seek to strike Hezbollah for the first time from further east along Lebanon's border, at the same time creating a secure area from which it can freely reconnoiter the terrorist group and prevent infiltration, the sources said. While demining activity has been reported, sources who spoke to Reuters — including a Syrian soldier stationed in south Syria, a Lebanese security official and a UN peacekeeping official — revealed additional unreported details that showed Israel was moving the fence separating the DMZ toward the Syrian side and digging more fortifications in the area. Military action involving raids from the Golan and possibly from the demilitarized zone that separates it from Syrian territory could widen the conflict pitting Israel against Hezbollah and its ally Hamas that has already drawn in Iran and risks sucking in the U.S. Israel has been trading fire with Tehran-backed Hezbollah since the group began launching missiles across Lebanon's border in support of Hamas after its deadly attack on southern Israel triggered Israel's military campaign on Gaza. Now, in addition to Israeli aerial strikes that have caused Hezbollah significant damage in the past month, the group is under Israeli ground assault from the south and faces Israeli naval shelling from the Mediterranean to the west. By extending its front in the east, Israel could tighten its squeeze on Hezbollah's arms supply routes, some of which cut across Syria, Lebanon's eastern neighbor and an ally of Iran. Navvar Saban, a conflict analyst at the Istanbul-based Harmoon Center, said the operations in the Golan, a hilly, 1,200 square km (460 square mile) plateau that also overlooks Lebanon and borders Jordan, appeared to be an attempt to 'prepare the groundwork' for a broader offensive in Lebanon. 'Everything happening in Syria is to serve Israel's strategy in Lebanon - hitting supply routes, hitting warehouses, hitting people linked to the supply lines to Hezbollah,' he said. Israel's mine removal and engineering works have accelerated in recent weeks, according to a Syrian intelligence officer, a Syrian soldier positioned in southern Syria and three senior Lebanese security sources who spoke to Reuters for this story. Fortifications The sources said the demining had intensified as Israel began ground incursions on Oct. 1 to fight Hezbollah along the mountainous terrain separating northern Israel from southern Lebanon around 20 km (12 miles) to the west. In the same period, Israel has ramped up strikes on Syria, including its capital and the border with Lebanon, and Russian military units — stationed in Syria's south in support of Syrian troops there — have withdrawn from at least one observation post overlooking the demilitarized area, the two Syrian sources and one of the Lebanese sources said. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss their monitoring of Israel's military operations in the Golan, most of which was seized by Israel from Syria in 1967. The Syrian soldier stationed in the south said Israel was pushing the fence separating the Golan and the demilitarised zone (DMZ) further out and erecting their own fortifications near Syria 'so there would not be any infiltration in the event this front flares up.' The soldier said Israel appeared to be creating 'a buffer zone' in the DMZ. A second senior Lebanese security source told Reuters that Israeli troops had dug a new trench near the DMZ in October. One senior Lebanese security source said the demining operations could allow Israeli troops to 'encircle' Hezbollah from the east. The DMZ has been home for the last five decades to the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), mandated to oversee the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian forces after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. A UN peacekeeping official in New York said that UNDOF had 'recently observed some construction activity being carried out by Israeli military forces in the vicinity of the area of separation,' but did not have further details. Russia leaves overlook point Asked about the demining, the IDF said it 'does not comment on operational plans' and it 'is currently fighting against the terrorist organization Hezbollah in order to allow for the safe return of northern residents to their homes.' UNDOF, Russia and Syria did not respond to requests for comment by Reuters. A report to the UN Security Council on the activities of UNDOF, dated Sept. 24 and seen by Reuters on Oct. 4, cited violations on both sides of the demilitarized zone. Russian troops, meanwhile, have left the Tal Hara outpost, the highest point in Syria's southern Daraa governorate and a strategic overlook point, according to the two Syrian sources and one of the Lebanese sources. The Russians had left because of understandings with the Israelis to prevent a clash, a Syrian military officer said. Syrian authorities, whose country is part of Iran's so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' have sought to remain out of the fray since regional tensions soared after Hamas' Oct. 7 assault last year. Reuters reported in January that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had been discouraged from taking any action in support of Hamas after he received threats from Israel. Hezbollah too had 'steered away' from building up any forces in the Syrian-held Golan. Syria's army has not made additional deployments, the Syrian military intelligence officer told Reuters.

In call with French leader, PM stresses Israel’s efforts to aimed at eliminating Hezbollah threat and secure return of northern residents, following Macron’s criticism that Israel, created by UN decision, cannot disregard UN resolutions Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday that he opposes a unilateral cease-fire in Lebanon. Netanyahu emphasized that Israel’s actions aim to eliminate Hezbollah’s threat and ensure the safe return of northern residents. The phone call followed a report in French newspaper Le Parisien that claimed that Macron criticized the Israeli leader in a closed government meeting, saying that Israel was created by a UN decision and thus cannot disregard UN resolutions. Earlier this month, Macron urged a halt to arms deliveries to Israel, which has come under scrutiny over its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza and mounting civilian death toll. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,' Macron told broadcaster France Inter. 'France is not delivering any,' he added during the pre-recorded interview. Macron reiterated his demand for a cease-fire in a call with Netanyahu the next day. Following the conversation, Netanyahu's office responded by emphasizing that, given Iran's backing of terror groups, Israel expects its allies to support its efforts, not impose restrictions that would ultimately bolster 'Iran's axis of evil.'

Israeli couple tied to Iranian assassination plot faces scrutiny ...	Indictment against Vladislav Victorsson and his partner, Anna Bernstein, for allegedly carrying out tasks for Tehran resurfaces troubling stories from their past, including sexual offenses against minors and alleged animal abuse The indictment of Vladislav Victorsson, 30, and his partner, Anna Bernstein, 18, for their involvement in an Iranian plot to assassinate Israeli officials has brought renewed focus on Victorsson's vast criminal history. The Shin Bet and Israeli police revealed their alleged connection to the plot on Monday, sparking a wave of social media reactions, particularly regarding Viktorson’s disturbing past. In 2015, Victorsson, who had since changed his last name to McLoughlin, was convicted of multiple sexual offenses against minors. At the age of 20, he was sentenced to two years in prison after being charged with statutory rape, sodomy and indecent acts involving six girls aged 12 to 14. The prosecution, led by the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office, accused Victorsson of exploiting the vulnerability of minors, meeting them in public places like the Dizengoff Center in Tel Aviv and through social media. In one case, he was accused of assaulting a girl in a parking lot, continuing the attack despite her protests, telling her 'I know you like it.' Victorsson also distributed explicit images of his victims he took or asked them to take for him without their consent, a detail that resurfaced online in recent days. During his remand hearing, prosecutors presented a confrontation between Victorsson and one of his victims, in which she described how he forcibly performed a sexual act on her, saying, 'After I said no six times, he finally stopped.' Victorsson reportedly responded, 'I always stop after two.' During his interrogation, Victorsson admitted to most of the acts attributed to him but denied forcing himself on any of the minors. When questioned about why he engaged in sexual relations with underage girls and whether he knew it was illegal, he replied, 'I knew it was wrong, but I didn’t know what the consequences would be.' In another instance, he remarked to investigators, 'I got to stop meeting minors.' Upon his release, Victorsson was arrested again in 2019 for violating his probation terms by contacting minors via social media. 'There is an evidentiary foundation and a reasonable suspicion that the suspect committed sexual offenses against minors. In recent days, it emerged that the suspect made contact with several minors through social networks. He then met with them and performed sexual acts on them. The investigation also revealed that the suspect photographed the minors naked,' his detention order stated. His connections to Tel Aviv’s gothic youth subculture earned him notoriety, with multiple individuals recalling past encounters with him. After his conviction and time in prison, acquaintances posted the allegations against him on social media. 'I remember this story, they talked about how he would lure girls to the underground parking lot at the [Dizengoff] Center and then rape them there,' wrote one Facebook user named Jack. 'I was one of the complainants who stood against him,' another user wrote in 2022. 'I was the one who exposed his second phone, where he distributed pictures and videos of the girls, including sexual acts he filmed without their knowledge. The number of Facebook accounts and family name changes he’s made won’t help him hide his face unless he gets plastic surgery.' A third user wrote: 'I knew someone who was part of the investigation back then, and she said he told the investigator, 'I usually stop after the third no.'' Another user wrote: 'I didn't know him, and now I found out he's part of the kink community and even participated in parties. I'm shaking.' Victorsson, for his part, denied any connection to the allegations and wrote in a past Facebook post. 'I heard a rumor that people are trying to frame me, spreading nonsense about my time at the Center and calling me a rapist,' he wrote. 'It's true that I spent two years in prison, but not for the reasons they are trying to pin on me. I was sentenced back then because, in the distant past, I was too kind to people who didn’t deserve it.' Following the announcement of his involvement in the espionage case, many of his former acquaintances resurfaced their accounts on social media. 'Remember Vlad from 2015? Now he's an Iranian agent. I’m shocked,' wrote one acquaintance. 'He was looking for work in the [Revolutionary Guard] Corps,' joked another user named Sergey. Bernstein, also implicated in the Iranian plot, is a model from Petah Tikva and is listed on Facebook as engaged to Victorsson. Her personal life came under scrutiny after a TikTok video surfaced showing her dog convulsing, allegedly after consuming a cannabis-laced cookie. Victorsson defended her, claiming the incident was accidental.

UK sanctions target Israeli settler outposts in West Bank	Britain takes action against 7 settler groups accused of inciting violence against Palestinians and calls for end to settler expansion Britain on Tuesday sanctioned Israeli settler organizations that it said had sponsored violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank, and called on Israel to 'stop settler expansion on Palestinian land.' The sanctions target seven settler outposts or organizations involved in facilitating, inciting, promoting or providing support for activity that amounts to serious abuse of the human rights of Palestinians, Britain said. 'The inaction of the Israeli government has allowed an environment of impunity to flourish where settler violence has been allowed to increase unchecked,' British foreign Minister David Lammy said, noting settlers had also targeted schools and families with young children. 'The Israeli government must crack down on settler violence and stop settler expansion on Palestinian land,' he added. The latest sanctions, which impose asset freezes on the organizations, represent the third set of measures against persons involved in settler violence in the West Bank, Britain said. Most countries deem Jewish settlements built on land Israel captured in the 1967 Six-Day War as illegal, and their expansion has for decades been among the most contentious issues between Israel, the Palestinians and the international community. Israel cites biblical, historical and political ties to the area.

US warns Israel Gaza aid must resume or military assistance could...	Washington conditions further arms provisions to Israel on entry of American humanitarian aid into Gaza within 30 days; components of THAAD missile defense system arrive in Israel, with US troops set to operate it U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have warned Israel that if it does not allow the transfer of American humanitarian aid to Gaza within 30 days, the U.S. may halt military assistance. The message was delivered to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer through an official document. The American officials threatened to invoke a national security memorandum issued in March which set conditions for continued U.S. military support to Israel, including allowing unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid. Despite recent claims by Israel that it is not preventing aid, including the entry of 30 trucks of food into northern Gaza on Monday, the U.S. remains concerned about restrictions. Washington has demanded concrete steps from Israel within 30 days, warning that failure to comply could impact future military aid. This comes as the U.S. continues to delay shipments of heavy bombs to Israel. However, the Pentagon confirmed that components for the THAAD missile defense system began arriving in Israel, with U.S. troops expected to operate the system as part of preparations for a potential Iranian response to future Israeli strikes. Pentagon Press Secretary Pat Ryder said that the THAAD system will be fully operational soon, but did not provide a specific timeline due to security concerns. The deployment follows Israel’s request for additional U.S. military assets to bolster regional security. Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni announced in parliament that Italy has frozen all arms and munitions contracts with Israel since October 7. This follows an incident where Israeli forces fired at a UNIFIL position in southern Lebanon, wounding two people. Italy's defense minister called the attack a 'war crime,' prompting IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi to speak with his Italian counterpart, Gen. Luciano Portolano, about the security situation and Hezbollah’s use of positions near UNIFIL posts for terrorist activities.

Police officer killed in Highway 4 shooting attack named	Authorities identify slain cop as First Sgt. Adir Kadosh, 33, who was set to get married next month; attacker identified as Gaza resident who had been living illegally in the West Bank in recent years Israeli authorities identified the police officer killed in Tuesday morning's shooting attack on Highway 4 near the Yavneh interchange as First Sgt. Adir Kadosh, 33. Kadosh, a member of the Traffic Division since 2022, was shot while trying to engage the terrorist who had infiltrated Israel from the West Bank. The attacker, identified as Muhammed Dardounah, 28, a resident of Jabaliya in Gaza who had been living illegally in the West Bank, was later shot and killed by an armed civilian at the scene. Kadosh, who joined the police in 2013 after serving in the Border Police, is survived by his parents, two siblings and his fiancé, with whom he was set to marry next month. His funeral will take place at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Holon cemetery. The civilian who neutralized the attacker had recently received his firearm as part of a reform led by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. 'I saw the terrorist shooting, stopped my car and fired back,' the man said. 'Thanks to the minister’s reform, I was able to carry a weapon, and lives were saved today.' In addition to Kadosh, a 42-year-old man was moderately injured, and two others sustained minor injuries. The wounded were transported to Assuta Hospital in Ashdod and Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot. An investigation revealed that the assailant approached on foot from the sandy areas near Palmachim and opened fire on a police vehicle parked along the roadside. The attacker continued shooting at passing vehicles before being neutralized by the civilian between Holot and Yavneh interchanges. Ben-Gvir and Police Commissioner Daniel Levy arrived at the scene, receiving a briefing from Central District Commander Maj. Gen. Yair Hetzroni. Ben-Gvir praised the civilian’s actions, saying, 'This reform is proving its worth time and again—armed citizens are saving lives.' Commissioner Levy added, 'A police officer paid with his life. We are doing everything to ensure officers respond swiftly in such incidents to protect civilians.'

The World Health Organization said on Tuesday it had been able to start its polio campaign in central Gaza and vaccinate tens of thousands of children despite Israeli strikes in the designated protected zone hours before. As part of an agreement between the Israeli military and Hamas, humanitarian pauses in the year-long Gaza war had been due to begin early on Monday to reach hundreds of thousands of children. WHO spokesperson Tarik JaÅ¡areviÄ‡ told a Geneva press briefing that over 92,000 children, or around half of the children targeted for polio vaccines in the central area, had been inoculated on Monday. 'What we have received from colleagues is that the vaccination went without a major issue yesterday, and we hope It will continue the same way,' he said. Other humanitarian agencies have previously voiced concerns about the viability of the polio campaign in northern Gaza, where an Israeli offensive is under way. Aid groups carried out an initial round of vaccinations last month, after a baby was partially paralyzed by the type 2 polio virus in August, in the first such case in the territory in 25 years.

My brother's keeper: Study finds deep psychological impacts on si...	Hebrew University study explores the 'unrecognized grief' of sibling loss during, after October 7 events, highlighting unique needs of those left to cope with loss; Findings challenge assumptions about grief dynamics, urging tailored responses for those affected by prolonged national crises Pioneering Research on the 'Emotional Toll of Sibling Loss During October 7 Events: A groundbreaking study' from the Hebrew University explores the psychological aftermath faced by 444 adults grieving siblings killed during the events of October 7 and subsequent war. Led by Captain (Res.) Masada Buchris, under Professor Anat Zeira’s mentorship, the research honors Buchris' brother, Major Chen Buchris, the deputy commander of the Maglan unit, who was killed in battle at Kibbutz Nahal Oz, and his close friend, Major Ariel Ben Moshe, a company commander in Sayeret Matkal (IDF's Delta Force equivalent), who also fell on October 7 at Kibbutz Re'im. 'Hani led the first force into Kibbutz Nahal Oz on that dark Saturday, sacrificing himself for his mission –saving lives and leading troops on the ground,' Buchris reflected. 'Losing my brother is a heavy cloud that shadows me constantly. Every word in my academic work echoes his presence. My pain intertwines with his bravery, pushing me to overcome darkness and conquer sorrow.' Approximately 10% of study participants lost more than one sibling during the October 7 events and the Gaza war. About 30% reported the death of another close person, such as a parent, spouse or friend, during these events. Although no significant differences related to birth order were found, deeper analysis revealed complex dynamics between birth order and coping strategies. Siblings who suffered the death of an eldest sibling experienced more psychological distress and sought less support, likely because the eldest often serves as a key support figure. Conversely, those who lost younger siblings tended to seek more help. Exposure to distressing videos intensified the psychological burden Interestingly, no differences emerged between siblings who lost members in security forces versus those who did not, challenging the societal belief that losing a sibling in heroic acts eases grief. However, those whose siblings served in security forces reported higher levels of negative self-thoughts, possibly due to guilt and helplessness. Many felt abandoned by security forces, believing their siblings were 'left to die.' Uncertainty about their siblings' fate and exposure to distressing Hamas videos exacerbated their distress. Moreover, women reported higher levels of emotional distress (anxiety, depression, somatization) compared to men, and were more likely to seek help, social support and connection with the deceased. Siblings living in attacked areas reported higher emotional distress, negative thoughts and help-seeking behaviors compared to those in safer regions. 'There aren't many studies, either in Israel or globally, examining the impact of sibling loss on adults, perhaps because it's often seen as less significant and classified as 'unrecognized grief,'' Buchris said. 'The findings highlight the need to raise awareness of bereaved siblings' unique needs and develop tailored responses during prolonged national crises.'

In blow to Harris campaign, Arab lobby withholds endorsement beca...	In 1st, Arab American Political Action Committee declines to endorse a presidential candidate, claiming both Harris and Trump 'blindly support the criminal Israeli government'; This could encourage Arabs and Muslims not to go to the polls, which could cost Harris dearly in the Michigan vote and give Trump the victory in the election The U.S political lobby AAPAC, or the Arab American Political Action Committee, announced Tuesday morning that it had decided not to support either of the two major party candidates in the presidential race and would not endorse Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. The lobby announcement is another signal of the danger facing Harris, who as a Democratic candidate is the more natural choice for Muslims and Arabs, and largely needs their support. It is customary in the U.S. that, as the election date approaches, labor unions, political lobbies and also major newspapers endorse the candidate who, after examining the facts, they think is the most suitable to serve as president. In its announcement Tuesday morning, AAPAC said that it had decided to refrain from giving such an endorsement to any of the candidates for this election. 'Both candidates have endorsed genocide in Gaza and war in Lebanon,' AAPAC said in its statement. 'We simply cannot give our votes to either Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump, who blindly support the criminal Israeli government.' This is the first time since the establishment of the lobby in 1998 that it has refrained from declaring support for a presidential candidate. The PAC usually endorses Democrats. Arab and Muslim Americans overwhelmingly backed President Joe Biden in 2020 but have been vocal opponents of U.S. support for Israel, especially the Biden administration's support since October 7, which has eroded their backing of Democrats. Trump has historically had low approval from that community due to past statements and his policy of a travel ban targeting Muslim-majority nations when he was in office. Like Harris and Biden, Trump has also been a vocal supporter of Israel. During the Democratic primaries at the beginning of the year, an Arab-Muslim protest movement against Biden took shape and, at its peak, Muslims who came to the polling stations in Michigan voted uncommitted, as a sign that if the Biden administration continued on its way in support of Israel - that the voting bloc would will abstain and not vote for him in the elections in November There is particularly great significance: in the state of Michigan, which divides 15 electors in the elections, and where there is a large Muslim population. Since the battle there is quite close (according to recent polls, Harris leads by less than a percentage point, deep within the range of sampling error), if they do not go to the polls they could hand Trump the victory in the state and possibly in the U.S. as a whole. Trump has historically had low approval from that community due to past statements and his policy of a travel ban targeting Muslim-majority nations when he was in office. Like Harris and Biden, Trump has also been a vocal supporter of Israel. Not gaining AAPAC's support is not surprising to the Trump campaign and is not expected to cause and changes. On the other hand, other Arab organizations have recently called on Arab and Muslim voters to vote for Harris despite their displeasure with her conduct, arguing that Trump's rise to power would be even worse for them.

Israel's economy grew slower in the second quarter than previously thought, data showed on Tuesday, as Israel's war in Gaza against the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas continued to weigh on growth.

The economy was supported by gains in consumer and state spending and in investment in fixed assets, while exports fell. Last week, the Bank of Israel trimmed its Israeli economic growth estimate in 2024 to 0.5% from a prior estimate of 1.5%.

Italy demands security guarantees for its troops in Lebanon	Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni demanded security guarantees on Tuesday for all her country's troops deployed in Lebanon, where U.N. peacekeepers have come under fire during the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Italy has troops deployed in the U.N. peacekeeping mission known as UNIFIL and in a separate mission known as MIBIL which trains local armed forces. There are over 1,000 Italian troops in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. 'We believe that the attitude of the Israeli forces is completely unjustified,' Meloni said, describing it as a 'blatant violation' a U.N. resolution on ending hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. In an address to Italy's Senate, she said Israel's actions were not acceptable and that she had expressed this position to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Asked whether she was considering a trip to Lebanon, Meloni told reporters: 'Yes.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hkyw003sjyg	2024-10-15T02:40:48-07:00	
Terrorist cell responsible for Tel Aviv suicide bombing apprehend...	Israeli security forces dismantled a Hamas-linked terror cell responsible for the Tel Aviv bombing in August, arresting eight operatives; The international plot, orchestrated from Turkey, included additional explosives and funding, underscoring Hamas' strategic reach and intent to escalate regional tensions Two months after the explosion that rocked southern Tel Aviv, which a suicide bomber set off injuring a 33-year-old man, Israel Police and the Shin Bet revealed that they apprehended the cell that orchestrated the attack. In a synchronized operation, Tel Aviv’s Central Unit and the Shin Bet detained eight terrorists, along with the driver who drove the suicide bomber from Shu'afat refugee camp to the Tel Aviv explosion site. Indictments are set for a military court on Tuesday. Investigations traced the cell’s roots to a Hamas network operating along the Nablus-Turkey corridor. Under the guidance of Hamas leadership in Turkey, the cell executed the attack, targeting a bustling area. During the probe, two ready-to-use explosive devices, each weighing 8.8 lbs., were surrendered, planned for further attacks in Israel. Following the August evening's powerful blast, extensive police forces, including explosive ordinance disposal units and forensic teams, scoured the scene. Shin Bet and police identified the bomber as Ja'far Muna, a Hamas operative from Nablus. The investigation exposed a terror infrastructure, directed by a Hamas commander in Turkey, aiming to carry out suicide attacks in Israel. Simultaneously, the Shin Bet and IDF apprehended Hamas operatives from Nablus, who led the infrastructure and coordinated with Abada Bilal, a senior Hamas figure in Turkey, released in the deal that brought Gilad Shalit back from Hamas captivity in 2011. Under his direction, the suicide bombing was executed. The investigation uncovered that one operative traveled to Turkey multiple times, securing funds for explosives and receiving bomb-making training from Hamas personnel. Eight terrorists were arrested on suspicions of executing and planning the attack. At the investigation's conclusion, a prosecutor's statement was filed against them, and the military prosecution will continue with terror-related indictments on Tuesday. An additional indictment is expected for an East Jerusalem resident from Beit Hanina, who transported the suicide bomber from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. In a joint statement, Shin Bet and police declared: 'The investigation clearly highlights the entrenchment of Hamas' command in Turkey and the extensive efforts by Hamas' overseas leadership to inflame the region and carry out suicide bombings in Israel.'

Former Stasi officer sentenced to 10 years for 1974 murder of Pol...	Martin Naumann becomes first former Stasi agent convicted of murder, a historic verdict with 'great symbolic significance' for Germany's atonement efforts An 80-year-old former Stasi officer, Martin Naumann, was sentenced to ten years in prison by the Berlin Regional Court on Monday for the murder of Polish citizen Czesław Kukuczka at the Friedrichstraße border crossing on March 29, 1974. The court found it proven that Naumann shot Kukuczka, 38, in the back from a distance of two to three meters during his escape attempt at the busiest border checkpoint between East and West Berlin. The judges had no doubt about the defendant's guilt, reaching an 'unequivocal conviction' that he was the perpetrator. Judge Bernd Miczajka stated, 'It was not the act of an individual for personal reasons, but planned and executed ruthlessly by the Stasi,' emphasizing the broader operation behind Kukuczka's killing. The Berlin public prosecutor's office had requested a 12-year prison sentence, but the court decided on a 10-year sentence instead. The verdict can still be appealed, and the 80-year-old defendant does not have to go to prison until it is legally binding. Naumann remained silent throughout the trial, which began in March 2023, choosing to remain silent as a defense strategy. His lawyer, Andrea Liebscher, requested acquittal, arguing that it was not proven that he was the shooter, despite the prosecutor requesting a 12-year prison sentence. The case dates back to March 29, 1974, when 38-year-old Polish firefighter and father of three, Czesław Kukuczka, stormed the Polish embassy in East Berlin with a fake bomb, demanding to be allowed to pass to the Western sector of the divided city. Embassy officials pretended to agree to his demands but alerted the East German authorities about the threat. The Stasi, the secret police of the former communist East Germany, made Kukuczka believe that his departure had been accepted, luring him into a trap with a forged permission. Kukuczka was escorted by Stasi officers to the Friedrichstraße station, known as the 'Palace of Tears,' where he passed through several checkpoints without incident. Believing he was safely crossing with authorization, he was shot in the back from close range by Stasi agent Martin Naumann while heading towards the tunnel leading to the West Berlin subway. The shooting was carried out on behalf of the East German secret police during a Stasi operation in the transit area of Berlin-Friedrichstraße station. The killing was witnessed by several schoolgirls waiting in line at the border crossing. These schoolgirls, now adults, were summoned to testify during Naumann's trial in Berlin. One of the witnesses, a then 10th-grade student, saw a man in a long coat and tinted sunglasses shoot Kukuczka in the back. After being shot, Kukuczka collapsed and was taken to a secret police prison hospital, where he died soon after from multiple gunshot wounds. An investigation later revealed that he did not have a bomb in his bag and was unarmed at the time of the incident. For his role in the killing, Naumann received a decoration, a 'Kampforden,' and was regarded by his superiors as an 'exemplary' communist and secret policeman, displaying 'ruthlessness' and 'constant loyalty to the leadership of the party and state.' The archived document states that Naumann 'carried out this task carefully, courageously and resolutely and was able to neutralize the terrorist by using a firearm.' The case remained unresolved for decades. Initial investigations into Kukuczka's death in the 1990s did not yield significant results, and the case was closed in 2005. In 2016, new information found by two historians in Stasi archives linked Naumann to the death of Kukuczka, leading to new potential witnesses. This decisive piece of information emerged from the Stasi's voluminous archives, including a list of twelve names, one of which was Naumann. In 2021, Poland issued a European arrest warrant for Naumann, prompting the German justice system to reopen the case. The trial, which began in March 2023, is seen as the culmination of decades of investigations that had been started and then stopped, described as one of 'outstanding historical significance.' The trial has forced Germany to relive the Cold War era, a period when the country was divided by the Iron Curtain between East and West. The conviction of Naumann is considered a landmark ruling, reflecting the gravity of the crime and marking the first time a former Stasi officer has been found guilty of murder for a homicide committed on duty. Historians and officials have emphasized the great symbolic significance of this verdict for Germany's efforts to atone for the injustices of the communist dictatorship. Maria Nooke, Brandenburg's state commissioner for addressing East German injustice, welcomed the court's decision regarding the Kukuczka case, stating, 'It is in line with the historical assessment of the case.' She further stated, 'The trial demonstrates the importance of the legal and social reassessment of the injustices of the GDR up to today.' The defendant's lawyer maintained that there was no proof that Naumann fired the fatal shot and that Kukuczka's death constituted involuntary manslaughter, which is subject to statutes of limitations. However, the court disagreed, ruling that the act was a treacherous murder and that Naumann acted 'ruthlessly,' establishing his guilt 'beyond doubt.' Prosecutor Henrike Hillmann claimed that other, 'milder' means of 'neutralizing' Kukuczka could have been used, such as incapacitation or arrest. The verdict highlights the difficulties in prosecuting Stasi-related cases, as most defendants received light sentences or were acquitted due to lack of evidence or testimony. Until now, all convictions related to Stasi crimes have been for manslaughter or aiding murder, and those who have been convicted have largely faced the lesser sentence of manslaughter, assuming that they were acting on orders of the Stasi. Czesław Kukuczka was a 38-year-old Polish builder, firefighter, and father of three, who had grown up near Limanowa, a town 30 miles southeast of Krakow. His children—a daughter and two sons—and sister appeared as co-plaintiffs in the trial, demanding a conviction for murder, which they pursued for fifty years. The victim's lawyers emphasized that their clients were never seeking a specific punishment or revenge, but rather truth. Lawyer Rajmund Niwinski stated, 'The joint plaintiffs are thankful to the court and the German state for this trial.' He expressed satisfaction with the verdict, stating, 'I think it is a satisfying verdict for the family.' The trial is one of the few recent proceedings related to crimes committed by the former communist regime of the GDR, raising critical questions about how societies confront their pasts and the need for accountability and truth-telling. Historians note that this trial brings to light a recent period of German history that has been somewhat neglected, highlighting the need for accountability and truth-telling regarding the crimes of the East German regime. The verdict can still be appealed. Despite the opening of the Stasi archives in the 1990s, few cases were able to be completed due to the agents ensuring they left no traces behind. The conviction of Naumann has 'great symbolic significance' in Germany's efforts to atone for the injustices of the communist dictatorship, according to officials. The trial demonstrates the importance of the legal and social reassessment of the injustices of the GDR up to today.

Back from the dead? IRGC chief Qaani appears live on TV in Iran	After weeks of speculation regarding his fate, Iran’s Quds Force Commander Esmail Qaani reappears at a funeral for a fellow terrorist; Rumors of his interrogation and heart attack swirl amid heightened regional tensions following Israeli strikes on key Hezbollah figures in Beirut Esmail Qaani, the elusive commander of Iran’s Quds Force, emerged looking very much alive on state television, ending weeks of speculation about his fate. His appearance came during a solemn memorial; ceremony in Iran for Abbas Nilforoushan, a key Quds Force figure killed in Beirut alongside Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah. Rumors had swirled around Qaani's disappearance, with claims ranging from his assassination in Beirut to conspiratorial whispers of his interrogation over alleged Israeli ties – dismissed by Iran as 'fake news.' Lebanese network Al-Mayadeen reported that Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, planned to honor Qaani, mirroring recent accolades given to Iran’s Aerospace Force commander after a missile attack on Israel. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf labeled the rumors of Qaani's demise as 'false news,' asserting his continued activity. The intrigue deepened with reports from Sky News Arabic, citing Iranian sources, alleging Qaani was under investigation for an intelligence breach and suffered a heart attack during questioning. His office chief, suspected of Israeli links, was implicated. This narrative was fueled by Qaani's absence following a powerful assault in Beirut’s Dahieh district, targeting Hezbollah’s Hashem Safieddine, slated as Nasrallah’s successor. While the IDF has yet to confirm Safieddine's elimination, Israeli Prme Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated as much. A Reuters sourcereported Qaani’s presence in Dahieh during the attack, although he reportedly missed a pivotal meeting with Safieddine. Further fueling suspicions, Qaani was last seen publicly alongside Hashem Safieddine’s brother Abdullah in Tehran. The New York Times added to the mystery, reporting Qaani’s Beirut trip aimed to assist Hezbollah leaders reeling from recent attacks in Lebanon. A Revolutionary Guards member in Beirut told the paper that Iranian silence on Qaani stoked panic among junior Guards. Since October 7, Qaani reportedly traversed the Iraq-Syria-Lebanon axis, meeting with Nasrallah and Fuad Shukr, both slain in Beirut. Suspicion around him deepened, sources claimed, when Qaani skipped a Hezbollah meeting in Dahieh that Israel later targeted, having initially planned to attend with his office chief, Ihsan.

North Korea demolishes cross-border roads with South Korea amid e...	Kim Jong Un orders closure of transport links after accusing South Korea of flying drones over Pyongyang North Korea officially began demolition operations, blowing up the roads that connect South and North Korea's Gyeongui Line and Donghae Line, specifically targeting sections previously used for cross-border exchanges. The explosions were confirmed by the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, who reported that the North Korean military had set off detonations in the east and west of the Korean Peninsula. The demolition of the roads occurred after North and South Korea exchanged threats amidst rising animosities over North Korea's accusation that South Korea flew drones over its capital. North Korea described the alleged drone flights as 'the enemy's serious provocation.' In response, the South Korean military immediately conducted firing exercises south of the Military Demarcation Line and warned of stern punishment if the safety of its citizens is threatened. Following Kim Jong Un's order, North Korea detonated bombs north of its eastern and western borders. The explosions are seen as a significant shift in policy and a display of North Korea's growing loathing of South Korea's conservative government. The destruction of the roads illustrates Kim Jong Un's hardening policy towards the South. The South Korean government issued a statement strongly condemning North Korea's actions, stating that they are 'extremely abnormal' and that North Korea must bear all responsibility for the deterioration of the situation. The South Korean Ministry of Unification emphasized that 'the Gyeongui Line and Donghae Line railways and roads are products symbolizing inter-Korean cooperation after the inter-Korean summit of the leaders of South and North Korea.' In response to the explosions caused by North Korea, South Korea's military fired warning shots within its border, confirming that the shots didn't cause any damage on Seoul's side of the border. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that they are 'strengthening their surveillance and alert posture' in response to North Korea's movements. The Gyeongui Line connects South Korea's western border city of Paju to North Korea's Kaesong, 26 kilometers away, and is a symbol of inter-Korean cooperation and peace. It starts from Seoul Station, north through Goyang City and Paju City in Gyeonggi Province, enters North Korea, passes through Kaesong and Pyongyang, and reaches Sinuiju. The Donghae Line is a railway from Yangyang County in Gangwon Province, South Korea, to Wonsan City in Gangwon Province, North Korea. It was opened in 1937 and is 180 kilometers long, passing through Mount Kumgang. Since the division of North and South Korea, the Gyeongui Line and Donghae Line railroads have been declared interrupted on both sides. The reopening of roads connecting the two ends of North and South Korea has been regarded as a symbol of reconciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas. However, now North Korea has unilaterally exploded the Gyeongui Line and Donghae Line railroads, which are regarded as symbols of peace, following its announcement to cut transport routes toward South Korea. The South Korean Ministry of Unification stated: 'They were constructed at North Korea's request, financed through loans, at a cost of 132.9 million dollars. We reiterate that North Korea still has the obligation to repay the debt.' The ministry added: 'Regarding North Korea showing such regressive actions, we are deeply saddened. The responsibility for blowing up the railways and roads connecting South and North Korea rests entirely with North Korea.' Observers say it is still unlikely for Kim Jong Un to launch preemptive, large-scale attacks on South Korea, because that would certainly invite massive retaliation by the more superior South Korea-U.S. forces, which would pose a threat to his survival. Analysts say the incidents reflect an escalation of tensions on the peninsula but do not signal the imminent start of a military conflict. Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, stated that North Korea's actions are a practical military measure related to the hostile dual-state system it has frequently mentioned and may indicate plans to erect more physical barriers along the border. He also noted that the road detonations could be 'preparatory work for its construction of those walls.' The recent destruction of roads aligns with Kim Jong Un's earlier edict to forgo the aim of peaceful unification with South Korea, marking a significant shift in policy. This action signifies a complete rupture of North and South Korean relations and declares South Korea the 'principal enemy.' Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have sharply increased in recent years, with North Korea performing a series of provocative missile tests, which it describes as a warning in response to the actions of Seoul, and South Korea and the United States expanding their military drills. The South Korean military is bolstering its readiness and surveillance posture in coordination with the United States while closely monitoring North Korean military activities. North Korea has accused South Korea of infiltrating drones to drop a 'huge number' of anti-regime propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month, describing it as a political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict. North Korea threatened to respond with force if South Korean drones drop propaganda leaflets again, warning it would consider it 'a declaration of war.' During a meeting with his top military and security officials, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un described the alleged South Korean drone flights as the 'enemy's serious provocation' and laid out unspecified tasks related to 'immediate military action' and the operation of his 'war deterrent' for defending North Korea's sovereignty. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea would face the end of its regime if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. The South Korean military is strengthening monitoring and maintaining a state of alert. In June 2020, North Korea blew up an empty, South Korean-built liaison office just north of the border in retaliation for South Korean civilian leafleting campaigns. North Korea has a history of staging choreographed events to destroy facilities on its soil as a political message. The destruction of roads connecting the two Koreas is not the first time North Korea has targeted symbols of rapprochement, as it has previously destroyed infrastructure as a political signal. Experts say Kim Jong Un likely wants to reduce South Korea's voice in the regional nuclear standoff and seek direct ties with the United States. Analysts say Kim Jong Un is also likely hoping to reduce South Korea's cultural influence and strengthen his rule at home. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. North Korea has also planted mines, removed lamps along its sections of the inter-Korean roads, and taken out ties on the northern side of the railways. The operations of these routes were later suspended as the Koreas wrangled over North Korea's nuclear program and other issues, with recent announcements from Pyongyang indicating further cuts and fortifications. Tuesday's detonations appear largely symbolic after Kim Jong Un removed the concept of peaceful reunification with the South from North Korea's policy stance. Kim Jong Un's regime has stepped up its defiance of the United States and its allies in recent years by ramping up its nuclear production efforts and strengthening ties with Russia. Washington has accused North Korea of supplying ammunition and missiles to Moscow for its war in Ukraine, a charge that Pyongyang denies. The South Korean Ministry of Unification reminded: 'We reiterate that North Korea still has the obligation to repay the debt.'

India and Canada expel each other's diplomats amid dispute over S...	Trudeau claims 'credible allegations' link Indian agents to Hardeep Singh Nijjar's murder on Canadian soil India has expelled six Canadian diplomats, including Acting High Commissioner Stewart Ross Wheeler and Deputy High Commissioner Patrick Hebert, marking a significant escalation in diplomatic tensions between the two nations. This move comes in the wake of heightened tensions over allegations made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accusing Indian agents of involvement in the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil. On October 14, 2024, India announced that the expelled diplomats must leave the country by 11:59 pm on Saturday, October 19, 2024. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India stated, 'The Government of India has decided to expel the following six Canadian Diplomats: Mr. Stewart Ross Wheeler, Acting High Commissioner; Mr. Patrick Hebert, Deputy High Commissioner; Marie Catherine Joly, First Secretary; Ian Ross David Trites, First Secretary; Adam James Chuipka, First Secretary; Paula Orjuela, First Secretary.' Canada had earlier informed India that it expelled six Indian diplomats, including High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, over allegations of their involvement in a criminal network targeting Canadian Sikhs. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly stated that the expulsions were due to accusations of 'widespread murder, extortion and coercion' by Indian diplomats across Canada. In a press release, she said, 'Keeping Canadians safe is the fundamental job of the Canadian government. The decision to expel these individuals was made with great consideration and only after the RCMP gathered ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case. We continue to ask that the Indian government support the ongoing investigation in the Nijjar case, as it remains in both our countries’ interest to get to the bottom of this.' The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) disclosed ongoing investigations into the involvement of agents of the Government of India in serious criminal activity in Canada. RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme reported that there had been 'over a dozen credible and imminent threats to life' specifically focused on members of the pro-Khalistan movement. He stated, 'We reached a point where we felt it was imperative to confront the government of India,' but discussions with Indian law enforcement were unsuccessful. India has strongly denied the allegations regarding Nijjar's killing, calling them 'absurd' and 'motivated,' with Prime Minister Narendra Modi describing the allegations as preposterous. The Indian foreign ministry dismissed the aspersions cast against High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma as 'ludicrous and deserving of contempt,' and stated the report contained 'unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations.' India's Ministry of External Affairs stated, 'There is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains,' in response to the allegations made by Canada. The diplomatic fallout occurred after allegations by RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme regarding the involvement of Indian government agents in serious criminal activities in Canada, including a 'threat to public safety.' The RCMP has evidence indicating that 'agents of the Indian government have used various entities in Canada and abroad to gather information,' and they have established linkages between this investigation and agents of the Government of India. RCMP Deputy Commissioner Brigitte Gauvin described the situation as 'extremely concerning' and emphasized that Indian diplomats must protect their nationals' interests and not engage in criminal activities, which is a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who held Canadian citizenship, was a leader in the movement for an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan, and had been a vocal supporter of the Khalistan movement, organizing an unofficial referendum for it at the time of his death. He was murdered in June 2023 near Vancouver, raising significant concerns within the Canadian community regarding the safety of individuals from the South Asian diaspora. The tension escalated when Trudeau claimed that Indian government agents were involved in the murder of Nijjar on Canadian soil, which he described as 'credible allegations.' Trudeau stated, 'The government of India made a fundamental error in thinking that they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians here on Canadian soil, whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts.' He accused India of using its diplomats and organized crime to attack Canadian citizens, linking these actions to allegations of murder, extortion, and coercion. India has accused Trudeau of pandering to Canada’s large Sikh community for political gain, believing he is targeting India to gain votes from Khalistanis in the upcoming elections. India has in the past described Hardeep Singh Nijjar as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group, having been designated a terrorist in 2020 for alleged involvement in an attack on a Hindu priest—accusations his supporters termed unfounded. Following Trudeau's allegations in September 2023, relations between India and Canada deteriorated significantly, with India suspending the issuance of new visas for Canadians and asking Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic presence. The diplomatic row has led to a significant deterioration in ties, with India asking Canada to reduce its diplomatic staff by 41 out of 62 members and suspending visa services. The Indian government expressed that it has 'no faith' in the current Canadian government's commitment to ensuring the safety of the six expelled diplomats, leading to the decision to withdraw them. India's Ministry of External Affairs stated, 'Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner [Sanjay Kumar Verma] and other diplomats and officials.' India 'strongly' rejected a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats were 'persons of interest' in an investigation, calling it 'preposterous imputations' and part of the political agenda of the Justin Trudeau government. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly confirmed that the diplomats were expelled and not withdrawn, as reported by Canada's foreign ministry. She added, 'We continue to ask that the Indian government support the ongoing investigation in the Nijjar case, as it remains in both our countries’ interest to get to the bottom of this.' The RCMP links Indian government agents to homicides, acts of violence, and organized crime targeting the South Asian community in Canada, as well as interference in democratic processes. The RCMP found evidence of interference in Canadian democratic processes. The RCMP has evidence indicating that 'agents of the Indian government have used various entities in Canada and abroad to gather information,' and they have established linkages between this investigation and agents of the Government of India. India has vehemently denied all accusations regarding Nijjar's death and described the actions taken by Canadian authorities as 'unjustified' and 'completely unacceptable,' reflecting a growing frustration in diplomatic relations. India's Ministry of External Affairs warned that India now reserves the right to take further actions in response to recent efforts by the Canadian government to fabricate allegations against Indian diplomats. The Indian government expressed that it has 'no faith' in the current Canadian government's commitment to ensuring the safety of the six expelled diplomats. The mutual expulsion of high-ranking diplomats constitutes a further escalation of the conflict between Canada and India. The developments came hours after the Canadian government declared the six Indian officials as 'persons of interest' for their alleged role in the June 2023 killing of pro-Khalistan figure Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia. Canada underscored its commitment to keeping citizens safe, asserting, 'Canada took this decision as its main interest remains the safety and security of all Canadians, defending our sovereignty and upholding the rule of law.' Stewart Wheeler stated that Canada has provided 'credible and irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.' He added, 'It is in the interests of both our countries and the peoples of our countries to get to the bottom of this.' After leaving the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, Wheeler reiterated Trudeau's accusation regarding the Indian government's involvement in the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. The RCMP disclosed ongoing investigations into the involvement of agents of the government of India in serious criminal activity in Canada. RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said the RCMP has charged 'a significant number' of people with direct involvement in homicides, extortions, and other criminal acts of violence over the past few years. The RCMP added, 'Despite law enforcement action, the harm has continued, posing a serious threat to our public safety.' India has been asking countries like Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom to take legal action against Sikh activists involved in the Khalistan movement. The Khalistan movement is banned in India but has support among a minority of Sikhs in the diaspora, especially in Canada. Approximately 770,000 Sikhs live in Canada, constituting 2% of the Canadian population, with significant support for the pro-Khalistan movement among the diaspora. Relations between India and Canada have been severely strained since Trudeau alleged he had credible evidence linking Indian agents to Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s murder, particularly following his claims of 'potential' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of the Khalistani terrorist. India has categorically denied allegations regarding Nijjar's death, calling them 'absurd and motivated' and 'preposterous.' The Indian foreign ministry said earlier on Monday, 'This latest step follows interactions that have again witnessed assertions without any facts. This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains.'

Israel faces 'severe shortage' of interceptor missiles, says repo...	Experts and senior officials in the military industry tell London-based Financial Times newspaper that Israel is facing a 'serious munitions issue' as it prepares for an attack in Iran, which could ignite further escalation. CEO of IAI: 'Some of our lines work 24 hours, 7 days a week. It is no secret that we need to replenish stocks.'' Israel faces a severe shortage of interceptor missiles, as it strengthens its air defense systems to defend against attacks by Iran and its proxies, the London-based Financial Times newspaper reported Tuesday morning, citing senior military industry officials, former officers and experts. The newspaper describes how the U.S. is rushing to help close the gaps, including the deployment of the advanced THAAD air defense system that will soon arrive in Israel, in what is described as a race against time to strengthen Israel's air defense. 'Israel’s munitions issue is serious,'' Dana Stroll, a former senior official at the U.S. Department of Defense, responsible for the Middle East, explained to the newspaper. 'If Iran responds to an Israel attack [with a massive air strike campaign], and Hezbollah joins in too, Israel air defenses will be stretched,' she said, adding that U.S. stockpiles are not limitless. 'The U.S. can’t continue supplying Ukraine and Israel at the same pace. We are reaching a tipping point.' The newspaper links the closing of the gaps in defense to the Pentagon's announcement of the deployment of the THAAD system that will arrive in Israel, in preparation for the expected attack in Iran, which could lead to further regional escalation. According to the Pentagon, the U.S. is 'rushing' to help close the gaps in the Israeli defense lines, which is why it announced the placement of the battery. Boaz Levy, chief executive of Israel Aerospace Industries, a state-owned company which makes the Arrow interceptors used to shoot down ballistic missiles, told the newspaper he is running triple shifts to keep production lines running. 'Some of our lines are working 24 hours, seven days a week. Our goal is to meet all our obligations,' Levy said, adding that the time required to produce interceptor missiles is 'not a matter of days'. While Israel does not disclose the size of its stockpiles, he added: 'It is no secret that we need to replenish stocks.' The British newspaper explained that Israel's three-tiered air defense systems have so far succeeded in intercepting most of the UAVs and missiles fired by Iran and its proxies at the country. The Iron Dome system intercepted short-range rockets and UAVs fired by Hamas from Gaza, while the David Slingshot intercepted heavier rockets fired from Lebanon, and the Arrow system stopped ballistic missiles from Iran. During the Iranian attack in April, according to the IDF, a 99% interception rate was achieved against the barrage, which included 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles. Israel reportedly had less success in repelling the second barrage, that took place at the beginning of the month, which included more from 180 ballistic missiles. Intelligence sources told the newspaper that nearly 35 missiles hit the Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel near Be'er Sheva. As for Hezbollah, Lt. Col. Assaf Orion, former head of the strategy department in the IDF, explained to the British newspaper: 'We are not seeing Hizbollah’s full capability yet. It has only been firing at around a tenth of its estimated prewar launching capacity, a few hundred rockets a day instead of as many as 2,000.' 'Some of that gap is a choice by Hezbollah not to go full out, and some of it is due to degradation by the IDF . . . But Hezbollah has enough left to mount a strong operation,' Orion added. 'Haifa and northern Israel are still on the receiving end of rocket and drone attacks almost every day.' During the security review presented to the ministers Monday by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the head of the IDF's Strategy Division Major General Eliezer Toledano, Gallant was asked about armaments. He replied that there was a large gap when he entered the Defense Ministry, which he instructed to be filled before the start of the war. He revealed that 'we are still dependent in air armaments and American planes,' but he clarified that 'we are working with all our might to promote blue-white production and the development of independence' on the issue of armaments. Our commentator Ron Ben Yishai pointed out in a recent piece that the agreement being formed with the U.S. to place THAAD in Israel is as much a result of American coercion as it is of Israeli necessity. The IDF's need is clear: It needs the addition of American interceptor missiles and launchers to deal with the hundreds of missiles that the Iranians may launch , if and when Israel responds to the attack against it on October 1. In this case, the quantities and numbers speak for themselves. The more missiles are launched in one or two small volleys in order to saturate the defense systems - the more launchers, interceptor missiles and radars are needed. Israel has several layers of interceptor missile batteries. On top is the Arrow 3 system, which hits the attacking missiles at a distance of hundreds of kilometers outside the atmosphere. Below that is the Arrow 2, which hits missiles close to the limit of the atmosphere, at a distance exceeding 100 kilometers. Far below is the David Slingshot system, which is designed to protect against missiles from a long distance in the atmosphere. At the bottom is the Iron Dome, which protects sites and intercepts missiles at short ranges of up to a hundred kilometers. Brigadier General Zvika Chaimovitz, former commander of the air defense system, said Tuesday morning in an interview with Ynet: 'The THAAD system is a significant force component and I don't want to compare it with the Arrow system, but in the end you add dozens more interceptors. It is a significant force that joins our forces, and we have seen scenarios of 200 missiles. It is assumed that if the conflict with Iran continues, we are expected to see more here.' According to him, 'the U.S. is a great power. When you look at capabilities, it's not a numbers game. In the end it's a combination of defense and attack. As for the economy of armaments, it is the result of policy. I don't think, from my knowledge, that an armaments economy component is leading the U.S. We are very far from the stage where we will have to do a lack economy.' He also emphasizes that, despite the damage to the terrorist organization, Hezbollah still 'has more capabilities.' 'It is too early to eulogize it. Hezbollah is in the stage of recovery and coming out of the shock. It is a decentralized organization, very focused at the strategic level.'

Australia puts sanctions and travel bans on 5 Iranians	Australia's government has imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on five Iranians contributing to the country's missile defense program, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Tuesday. Iran's launch of at least 180 ballistic missiles against Israel on Oct. 1 was a 'dangerous escalation that increased the risk of a wider regional war,' Wong said in a statement. The fresh sanctions target two directors and a senior official in Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization, the director of the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group, and the commercial director of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group. The decision brings to 200 the number of Iran-linked individuals and entities now sanctioned by Australia. 'Australia will continue to hold Iran to account for its reckless and destabilizing actions,' Wong said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1cui9sykg	2024-10-15T00:16:25-07:00

Qatar Emir says Israel chose to expand 'aggression' to West Bank,...	Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, said on Tuesday Israel deliberately chose to expand what he called its 'aggression' to implement pre-planned schemes in the West Bank and Lebanon. Israel had done so 'because it sees that the scope for that is available,' he said in his annual speech to open the Shura Council. The Council has legislative authority and approves general state policies and the budget, but has no say in the setting of defense, security, economic and investment policy for the small but wealthy gas producer, which bans political parties. Amendments to Qatar's constitution will be proposed by the Shura Council and put to a popular referendum vote, Qatar's Emir added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryb2gqiy1x	2024-10-14T23:50:49-07:00	
UN Security Council expresses 'strong concern' for UNIFIL workers	International law must be obeyed,' council warns, as peacekeeping force on border with Lebanon refuses to evacuate border area for its own safetly despite IDF requests as fighting rages The UN Security Council issued a statement overnight between Monday and Tuesday condemning the repeated incidents in which UNIFIL personnel were injured by IDF fire in southern Lebanon, and saying that the Security Council has 'strong concern' about the harm to peacekeeping force personnel. 'We express our strong concern after several UNIFIL positions were damaged. We urge all parties to respect the safety and security of the peacekeepers,' according to the statement. 'We also express deep concern regarding civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. We call on all parties in Lebanon to comply with international humanitarian law and the full implementation of Resolution 1701, which requires additional practical steps to be implemented. In addition, we emphasize the need for diplomatic efforts that will bring an end to the conflict.' Israel has turned to UNIFIL many times over the past two weeks in an attempt to evacuate the force's personnel from their positions in southern Lebanon for their own safety, following incidents in which UN peacekeeping force personnel were injured. Various commanders in the IDF, including an officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel, asked the force to move its position so that nothing would happen to them, but it has not responded. Requests were also forwarded to the commander of the force himself. UNIFIL firmly refuses to listen to the Israeli entreaties to move its positions and insists on remaining in the line of fire, as well as actually endangering the foreign soldiers arriving from countries around the world. Since the ground operation began, the IDF has asked UNIFIL to withdraw its forces five kilometers from the Blue Line, the nickname of the border between Israel and Lebanon, so that they are not harmed. The absolute refusal to evacuate surprised Israel, but the force's answer was unequivocal: 'We will not move from our positions.' The spokesman of UNIFIL, Andrea Tenenti, posted a video Monday night on the X platform in which he reiterated that the force will not move from its positions. 'We are staying. We are in southern Lebanon under the mandate of the Security Council, so it is important to maintain an international presence and maintain the UN flag in the region,' he said. He added: 'There were several targeted attacks against our soldiers, and the parties have an obligation to protect the peacekeepers and ensure their safety and security. At the end of the week, UNIFIL accused the IDF of opening fire on its peacekeepers 'intentionally' several times, in the direction of its positions, hitting cameras and a guard tower, and that within 48 hours five of its men were wounded. UNIFIL also complained that IDF tanks were approaching the positions in a way that endangered the security personnel and that the tanks were drawing fire from Hezbollah. Yesterday, a joint statement from Italy, Great Britain, France and Germany joined the many condemnations that Israel received following the attack on UNIFIL personnel. 'UNIFIL plays an essential balancing role,' stated the four countries, who noted that Israel must maintain the security of the force's personnel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that 'the best way to ensure the peace of UNIFIL soldiers is to listen to Israel's request to temporarily move away from the danger zone.' According to Netanyahu: 'The charge that Israel deliberately attacked UNIFIL personnel is completely false. It's exactly the opposite. Israel repeatedly asked UNIFIL to get out of harm’s way. It repeatedly asked them to temporarily leave the combat zone, which is right next to Israel’s border with Lebanon. In fact, on the day that Israel began its ground operation next to our border with Lebanon, we asked them specifically, 'Please leave this area so you're not harmed.'' Netanyahu added: 'Israel is not fighting UNIFIL. It's not fighting the people of Lebanon. It is fighting Iran’s proxy Hezbollah, which uses Lebanese territory to attack Israel. Hezbollah attacked Israel last year without any provocation on October 8th, a day after the Hamas massacre, and it's continued to attack us ever since by launching over 10,000 rockets and missiles at Israel.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyhecks1yl	2024-10-14T23:43:40-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/09/30/r1eS6t00RR/r1eS6t00RR_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

More than 200 demonstrators arrested; Many from groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace; they chanted 'let Gaza live' and 'stop funding genocide' in front of the exchange's iconic building and also protested against operation in Lebanon Police arrested more than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had staged a sit-in outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday to demand an end to U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza, authorities said. The protesters, many of them from activist groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace, chanted 'let Gaza live' and 'stop funding genocide' in front of the exchange's iconic building near Wall Street, in lower Manhattan. None of the protesters got inside the stock exchange but dozens crossed a police security fence set up outside its main building on Broad Street. A police spokesperson said 206 arrests were made, without providing details. Jewish groups involved with the protests said around 500 demonstrators attended. The stock exchange had no immediate comment. The protesters directed anger at American defense contractors and weapons manufacturers. Others chanted slogans against Israeli attacks in Lebanon, where Israel says it is waging war against Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. '(Hundreds) of Jews and friends are shutting down the New York Stock Exchange to demand the U.S. stop arming Israel and profiting from genocide,' Jewish Voice for Peace said on X, opens new tab. Israel denies genocide allegations at the World Court, and says its military operations in Gaza target Hamas militants. There was also a much smaller number of pro-Israel counter protesters at the site, who carried Israeli flags. The demonstration was the latest expression of anger against American support for Israel's assault on Gaza, which it launched after Hamas killed 1,200 in Israel and took 250 others hostage in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent military assault on blockaded Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire population, according to Gaza health officials.

Over 200 Hezbollah targets struck in Lebanon in last 24 hours	The airstrikes also took place deep within Lebanon; IDF troops continue operational activity in the central and southern Gaza Strip Over the past day, in coordination with ground troops, the Israeli Air Force has struck more than 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in southern Lebanon and deep within Lebanon, including terrorist cells, anti-tank missile posts, and surface-to-surface missile launchers, the IDF spokesman reported on Tuesday morning. In one of the strikes, the troops identified multiple terrorists entering a structure in the area. Shortly following the identification, the IAF struck the site and eliminated the terrorists. The IDF is continuing 'targeted operational activity against Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon,' according to the IDF. Troops eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and in IAF strikes, dismantled Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure, and located vast quantities of weaponry. On Monday, the IDF located an underground complex that served as the headquarters of Hezbollah's elite unit, Radwan Force. The headquarters, about 800 meters long, is located close to the border with Israel, in the heart of a civilian neighborhood in southern Lebanon. The soldiers located weapon caches in the tunnel, including anti-helicopter missiles, munitions, motorcycles, additional underground shafts, and enough supplies to stay in the underground complex, including food, a kitchen, and living quarters. According to the IDF, all of these were intended to be used by the Radwan Force as part of the plan to occupy the Galilee. According to the military spokesperson, the troops found cups with coffee that was still hot when they arrived. In the Gaza Strip, IDF troops are continuing operational activity in the Jabaliya area and have eliminated dozens of terrorists over the past day, the IDF spokesman reported on Tuesday morning. The troops eliminated a terrorist cell that fired anti-tank missiles toward them. Additionally, the troops identified multiple armed terrorists that posed a threat to them. Following the identification, and with direction of ground forces, the IAF struck and eliminated the terrorists. IDF troops continue operational activity in the central and southern Gaza Strip. Over the past day, the troops eliminated multiple terrorists and dismantled terrorist infrastructure. In addition, the troops located and dismantled a Hamas launcher.

This is how the Hezbollah UAV evaded detection, with fatal result...	Aerial defenses lost the drone 30 miles northeast of Acre; Misidentified as birds, it evaded interception twice, using GPS for precise targeting, leading to a deadly impact on a military base On Monday morning, Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar conducted a personal inspection of the Golani Training Base site before the initial assessment of the drone strike's impact. In recent months, IDF has noted that the Air Force intercepts drones daily from all fronts. Major General Bar has ordered the full elimination of all operatives and commanders of Hezbollah's UAV unit (Unit 127) as the most effective countermeasure against the threat. Their elimination will now receive intelligence and operational priority. Since the war's onset, about 1,200 UAVs have been launched toward Israel from various fronts. In total, approximately 23,000 different launches have been recorded, including rockets and missiles. Within Israeli territory, 221 UAVs have hit, while the rest were intercepted with a success rate of about 80%. 'For over a decade, we have prepared for the UAV threat, and it cannot be said that we were unprepared for it,' the IDF stated. 'We came strong, but in defense, there's never enough, and there's always room for more progress and investment. We examine every idea and proposal.' The primary reason for the UAV's successful strike on the dining hall was that it disappeared off of the radar 30 miles northeast of Acre after being initially tracked by IDF detection systems. After about half an hour, it hit the base, killing four soldiers and injuring dozens. In hindsight, IDF understands that the Air Force mistakenly believed the UAV had crashed into the sea. Apart from a brief minute-and-a-half tracking segment found later as it headed toward northern Sharon, it wasn't detected. Radar analysis suggested it could have been classified as a UAV or a flock of birds, but due to a short timeframe and the presence of hundreds of low-altitude targets, including birds, it wasn't classified as such. The Air Force attempted to shoot it down twice, following the interception of two similar UAVs from Lebanon by a missile boat and Iron Dome. It flew low over roads on its way to the Golani base. Using a GPS system installed on it, it flew to a predefined point with pinpoint accuracy to a specific room. There was no real-time navigation. Its warhead contained three to four pounds of explosives and extensive shrapnel, but the precise angle of impact enabled the deadly strike and penetration. Initial findings also reveal that a report was received from the police to the Air Control Unit near the northern town of Yokneam about a suspicious aircraft seen by a civilian. However, at the same time, a helicopter matching the description and location was in the sky, most likely causing some confusion. As a preliminary lesson from the incident, Major General Bar instructed the widening of the margins even further regarding alerts to towns and military camps, which may lead to more alarms and false alerts in the coming days, or 'To err on the side of caution with a more permissive alert policy.' It also became clear that at the beginning of the launch of the three UAVs, there was a combined event in which Hezbollah launched rockets and three precise missiles toward the Haifa area, indicating a coordinated and synchronized barrage. IDF identified signs of tactical recovery by Hezbollah after the initial blows it suffered. They are making adjustments and trying to improve after everything we've taken and continue to take from them,' according to the IDF. After the publication of the initial investigation findings, Golani Brigade Commander Colonel Adi Ganot addressed his soldiers. 'The Golani Training Base serves as the gateway to the brigade. The great loss we suffered this year is difficult and painful, but, as always, we have known and will know how to recover and rise from it and continue with our mission: defending the State of Israel and its residents.'

Hezbollah slams BBC for joining IDF press tour in Lebanon	Hezbollah accuses BBC of violating 'the sanctity of Lebanese lands, Lebanese sovereignty and Lebanese laws' calling it unjustified and 'absolutely unacceptable' Hezbollah’s Media Relations Office condemned the British BBC network on Monday after a team entered a village in southern Lebanon accompanied by the IDF. According to Hezbollah's announcement, published in an official statement, the BBC violated Lebanon's 'territory, sovereignty, and applicable Lebanese laws.' Hezbollah released the following statement. 'In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The BBC, with all its platforms and in different languages, did not just blindly side with the murderers and criminals and justify the Zionist barbarism against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, but brazenly sent a team that entered a southern village accompanied by the occupation army and violated the sanctity of Lebanese territory, sovereignty, and applicable Lebanese laws, as shown by the reports published by this institution.' 'Hezbollah’s Media Relations condemns this unjustified and absolutely unacceptable move and demands the Ministry of Information, the National Media Council, and the relevant judicial and security agencies take the necessary legal measures against the BBC and its teams in Lebanon and protest to the BBC Company and the legal bodies representing it. It also demands that the unions of journalists, editors, and free media outlets in the world condemn this step,' the terror organization said. Journalists were taken by the military spokesperson into South Lebanon, where troops uncovered Hezbollah's underground infrastructure. On Monday, the IDF revealed an 800-meter-long tunnel prepared with a fully-contained kitchen, and missiles and weapons in the ready for use by Radwan forces in their planned invasion of the Galilee. Another tunnel that was located by the soldiers, had vehicles with full gas tanks, fitted with machineguns and new, still packed military gear ready for the invading terrorists to use, along with personal equipment they may need. Hezbollah prefers that its activity be covered by agreeable, affiliated media networks such as the Lebanese Al-Mayadeen network, the Al-Akhbar newspaper, or Radio A-Nur. Whenever reports come from unaffiliated media networks, the terror organization raises problems, citing even violent incidents between Hezbollah operatives or supporters and journalists who came to cover a story. Such clashes have often been seen in the Dahiyeh district in ​​Beirut, an area considered Hezbollah's stronghold, which has suffered several attacks in recent weeks. The terror organization is trying to doctor the information coming out of Dahiyeh which explains why we have seen Lebanese broadcasts interrupted by Lebanese officials, either from Hezbollah or the organization's supporters, who did not allow them to broadcast freely from the areas of the attacks in recent weeks. Hezbollah actively tries to suppress networks that broadcast, according to the terrorist organization, the Israeli narrative. Every once in a while, an article would appear on Hezbollah-affiliated networks, saying that any network violated the organization's 'rules' and stood by Israel. For example, following the assassination of the former Hezbollah Chief of Staff Fuad Shukr, a Hezbollah supporter reprimanded a Sky News reporter after she had called the terror organization a 'militia.' The Hezbollah supporter stood next to her and demanded that she never call the organization a militia while the Al-Akhbar newspaper reported the incident and added that it was biased coverage against Hezbollah.

IDF tightens noose in northern Gaza towns	Israeli forces tightened their squeeze around Jabaliya in northern Gaza on Monday, killing at least 10 people queuing for food, according to Palestinians medics, and instructing people to evacuate as they pushed in against Hamas fighters. Jabaliya has been the focus of an Israeli offensive for around 10 days and the military has now encircled the camp and sent tanks into nearby Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun towns, with the declared aim of stamping out Hamas fighters who are trying to regroup there.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjlzemiy1e	2024-10-14T14:42:11-07:00	
Israel tells US Iran strike will not target oil or nuclear facili...	Officials say the strike will be significant and they are preparing for a counter-attack in full coordination with the Americans ; 'Israel and the U.S. see eye to eye' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed the U.S. that Israel was willing to attack Iranian military targets and not oil or nuclear facilities, according to a report in the Washington Post, quoting two officials, to avoid regional war. Officials in Jerusalem said the Israeli strike in retaliation for Iran launching 180 ballistic missiles on Israel earlier this month, would be substantial. Netanyahu has been consulting with his defense minister and senior security officials to decide on the timing and scope of the attack. On Sunday, he met with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief Herzi Halevi and senior intelligence officials in an intelligence base, for an unannounced meeting and continued consultations on Monday. The Biden administration announced it was deploying its THAAD missile defense system to the area along with American troops that would operate it, to bolster defenses should Iran launch a new and more extensive attack. The discussions with Washington continue, to reach maximum coordination if Iran does respond to the Israeli strike but according to the UK-based Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper, Iran has indicated that if the Israeli attack is a limited one, this round would be closed. 'There is an understanding among some senior Israelis that Iran is interested in a cease-fire,' sources told the paper. 'Israel and the U.S. see eye to eye,' officials said. 'There is no is coordination about the attack and what would follow,' he said adding the Israelis believe Iran will respond.

IDF's new target: Hezbollah's drone unit courtesy of Iran	Hezbollah's Unit 127, founded by Hassan al-Laqis, who was assassinated near his Beirut home a decade ago, specializes in UAV development learned from Iran, now tops the military's target list after a deadly drone attack kills soldiers; Amid the dense forest of geopolitical maneuvering, Hezbollah's Unit 127—its drone division—has emerged as a formidable player, evolving significantly since the 2006 Second Lebanon War. This unit, primarily rooted in Lebanon, has sharpened its expertise in crafting and deploying drones for a spectrum of purposes—ranging from offensive operations to intelligence gathering. Major General Tomer Bar, the Air Force Commander, ordered the corps to prioritize the dismantling of this unit's cadre, marking them as high-value targets in the complex chess game of regional security. This comes in the wake of the deadly attack by a Sayyad 107 drone that exploded Golani training base's dining hall, claiming the lives of four soldiers and injuring dozens of others. The brainchild behind this drone initiative was senior Hezbollah figure Hassan al-Laqis, who was allegedly assassinated over a decade ago near his Beirut residence. Al-Laqis, who had been a mastermind in UAV development, reportedly frequented Iran, visiting factories, engaging in military drills, and consulting with experts. His name, etched in Hezbollah's lore, was often invoked by former Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who spoke about al-Laqis's pioneering efforts in UAV technology for Hezbollah. Nasrallah himself was known to visit al-Laqis’s labs, where innovation in drone technology was nurtured to meet the tactical needs of the organization. Unit 127's reach extends beyond Lebanon, playing a pivotal role in establishing drone infrastructure in Syria, particularly in regions like Homs and Palmyra, in direct collaboration with local Iranian forces. This unit operates closely with Iran's Quds Force Unit 340, which aids Iran's proxies in developing autonomous weapon production capabilities across the Middle East—from Yemen to Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed an unrelenting offensive against Hezbollah across all of Lebanon, including Beirut. He said this was a broader, grueling campaign against what he termed the 'axis of evil' led by Iran, asserting that despite the heavy toll, Israel continues to achieve significant strategic victories.

Netanyahu says Hezbollah uses UNIFIL positions to attack Israel	PM says accusations that IDF purposely targeting peacekeepers are false and repeats his call for the UNIFIL forces to withdraw for their protection; 'We are not fighting UNIFIL or Lebanese civilians but an arm of Iran that attacks Israel,' he says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Hezbollah was using UNIFIL positions to attack Israel. The prime minister responded to a statement issued by European nations condemning Israeli attacks on the peacekeeping force in South Lebanon. 'Israeli attacks on the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are contrary to international humanitarian law and must stop at once, Italy, Britain, France and Germany said. In their statement, the four nations reaffirmed 'the essential stabilizing role' played by UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, adding that Israel and other parties had to ensure the safety of the peacekeepers at all times. Last week the leaders of Italy and France said they were outraged by the IDF attacks that resulted in injury to three members of the force. The U.S. also voiced concern and said they were seeking explanations from Israel. The UNIFIL mission, which includes hundreds of European soldiers, has said it has repeatedly come under attack from the IDF in recent days but rejected any possible withdrawal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected accusations that Israeli troops had deliberately targeted the peacekeepers as 'completely false' and repeated a call for them to be withdrawn from combat zones. He said the military did its utmost to avoid harming UNIFIL personnel while striking Hezbollah fighters. 'But the best way to assure the safety of UNIFIL personnel is for them to heed Israel's request and to temporarily get out of harm's way.' He said Israel was not fighting against the UNIFIL force or the citizens of Lebanon but against an arm of the Iranian regime, the Hezbollah terror group that has used Lebanese territory to attack Israel and continues to do so. 'Hezbollah launched over 10,000 rockets and missiles at Israel. It uses UNIFIL positions and installations for cover while attacking Israeli cities and their residents,' Netanyahu said. 'These attacks have cost many Israeli lives, including on Sunday [in the deadly drone strike on a base, killing four] and Israel has the right to defend itself and will continue to do so.' On Sunday, Netanyahu called on UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to order the UNIFIL forces to leave the areas where fighting was underway, for their own safety. 'Mr. Secretary General, Get the UNIFIL forces out of harm's way. It should be done right now, immediately,' Netanyahu said in a video posted by his office. He said Israel regrets any harm caused to the peacekeeping troops and does everything possible to prevent such harm but the simple way to avoid such events is simply to remove the troops from danger.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjsdkwjk1g	2024-10-14T13:41:06-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/13/B1btsvKJye/B1btsvKJye_0_307_3000_1688_0_small.jpg

EU sanctions Iran for supplying drones and missiles to Russia	Sanctions are imposed on Iran's defense officials and airlines, freezing assets after earlier warning of swift response to Iranian military support for Russia's war on Ukraine The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on Iran’s deputy defense minister, senior members of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and three airlines over allegations that they supplied drones, missiles and other equipment to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari is one of seven senior officials now banned from traveling in Europe and whose assets in the bloc were frozen. The EU said he 'is involved in the development of Iran’s (drone) and missile program,' given his high-level defense role. Iran Air, Mahan Air and Saha Airlines had their assets frozen. The EU said their planes were 'used repeatedly to transfer Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles and related technologies to Russia, which have been used in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.' EU foreign ministers endorsed the sanctions at a meeting in Luxembourg In March, the bloc had warned that 'were Iran to transfer ballistic missiles and related technology to Russia for use against Ukraine, the EU would be prepared to respond swiftly, including with new and significant restrictive measures.' EU member countries, with the exception of Hungary, have been supplying weapons and ammunition as well as economic and other support to Ukraine worth some 118 billion euros ($129 billion) since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on reports of an attack on UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon and said that 'the best way to ensure the safety of UNIFIL soldiers is to heed Israel's request to temporarily retreat from the danger zone. The accusation that Israel attacked UNIFIL on purpose is completely false. The opposite is true. Israel repeatedly asked UNIFIL to stay away from danger. In fact, on the day the ground operation near the Lebanese border began, we asked them explicitly.' Netanyahu added that 'Israel is not fighting UNIFIL and the citizens of Lebanon, but an Iranian proxy.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rysdp1okkl	2024-10-14T11:51:01-07:00	
FM Katz welcomes EU and UK recent sanctions on Iran	Following the EU and the UK, imposing sanctions on Iran for proliferating arms and threatening Europe and the Middle East's stability, Foreign Minister Israel Katz commented on the decision. 'I welcome the decision by the European Union and the UK to impose additional sanctions on Iran, including on airlines and individuals involved in the transfer of ballistic missiles and UAVs that threaten Europe and the Middle East. These sanctions send a clear message that the international community will not tolerate Iran's dangerous actions, its support for terrorism, and its destabilization of the region. Iran and its proxies continue to pose a threat to the free world, and through coordinated and decisive action can we stop its aggression and ensure security in the region.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1f11byikjl	2024-10-14T11:47:34-07:00	
Arab states shift humanitarian aid from Gaza to Lebanon	UAE's 'With You, Lebanon' campaign and Qatar's medical supplies highlight regional support, while aid deliveries face challenges amid reports of Israeli attacks on convoys In recent weeks, humanitarian aid from Arab nations has shifted from Gaza to Lebanon after repeated IDF strikes and after the ground offensive began, forcing residents of the south to move north to safety. The United Arab Emirates launched the 'With You, Lebanon' campaign to provide support and humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people. Arab reports claim that this campaign has already amassed 250 tons of aid. Over 4,400 volunteers have helped collect approximately 10,000 aid packages for Lebanese citizens enduring economic, social, and humanitarian crises worsened by the conflict. Sultan Al-Shamsi, the UAE's Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs for Development and International Organizations, said that the campaign underscores the Emirates' solidarity with Lebanon. He also said that the UAE will continue its support, especially with winter approaching. While the UAE has also been providing substantial aid to Gaza since the war began, recent days have seen a notable shift in focus toward Lebanon, since transporting aid there is more feasible by land, air, or sea. In contrast, in Gaza, only the land route has been consistently operational since the war began, while air and sea routes have been less effective. Qatar is also contributing aid to Lebanon. At Beirut's Rafic Hariri Airport, Qatari aid, including 17.3 tons of medical equipment and medicine, has arrived. Reports indicate this is the third plane from Qatar in an airlift initiated by the Minister of State for International Cooperation, Lolwah Al Khater. Known for her support for Gaza and criticisms of Israel, her initiatives have been significant. Lebanon's ambassador to Oman announced a delivery of 40 tons of medicine thanking the 'kind and generous humanitarian initiative,' highlighting Oman's longstanding support for Lebanon during challenging times. Iran's 'Al-Alam' channel said there was a plane arriving in Latakia, Syria, with aid for Lebanese families displaced by the conflict. Some reports from Syria and Lebanon claim Israel was targeting this aid. The Hezbollah-affiliated 'Al-Akhbar' reported an Israeli attack on a convoy in northern Bekaa near Syria. Media linked to Hezbollah also reported Israeli strikes on sites where the humanitarian aid from Iraq and Syria was being collected. Iraq was among the first to send aid to Lebanon, even before the war's significant turning point with the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. Following explosions in Lebanon, Iraq sent 20 medical professionals and 15 tons of aid to Beirut. Lebanon's 'Al-Jadid' channel reported the arrival of a Saudi aid plane, the second within 24 hours. Additionally, Lebanon's 'LBCI' network noted a Royal Jordanian Air Force plane with aid for the Lebanese Army landed in Beirut. Arab media reports indicate Gazans have noticed the shift of humanitarian focus toward Lebanon. Munir Al-Barash, Director-General of the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, told Qatar's 'Al-Jazeera' that Gaza remains the 'burning front now,' despite reports of it becoming a secondary focus. The interview ended abruptly as Al-Barash became emotional discussing the casualties in Gaza.

800 meter Hezbollah tunnel uncovered near border, 'coffee in cups...	The underground base has a fully equipped kitchen next to anti-helicopter missiles, munitions, and motorcycles; complex was to be used by Hezbollah's Radwan Force in its planned invasion of the Galilee The IDF located an underground complex that served as the headquarters of Hezbollah's elite unit, Radwan Force. The headquarters, about 800 meters long, is located close to the border with Israel, in the heart of a civilian neighborhood in southern Lebanon. The soldiers located weapon caches in the tunnel, including anti-helicopter missiles, munitions, motorcycles, additional underground shafts, and enough supplies to stay in the underground complex, including food, a kitchen, and living quarters. According to the IDF, all of these were intended to be used by the Radwan Force as part of the plan to occupy the Galilee. According to the military spokesperson, the troops found cups with coffee that was still hot when they arrived. During a raid on a compound, the IDF encountered a terrorist who had barricaded himself in the headquarters. He was killed in an airstrike. At the same time, troops battled and killed several Radwan terrorists, located weapons, and destroyed Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure above and below ground. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would continue to attack Hezbollah wherever the terrorists are. The prime minister spoke after a visit to the wounded soldiers hurt on Sunday when a Hezbollah drone exploded in a base in central Israel, killing four and wounding dozens more. 'I want to make it clear. We will continue to hit Hezbollah mercilessly in all parts of Lebanon, including in Beirut, according to operational considerations. We have proven this recently, and we will continue to prove it in the coming days as well,' Netanyahu said after reports that the IDF had suspended attacks on the Lebanese capital after the prime minister's call with U.S. President Joe Biden, last week.

PM consults Gallant, Military chief on response to Iran missile s...	The unannounced meeting is held in an intelligence base after the Biden administration decides to deploy its THAAD air defense system to assist Israel in intercepting ballistic missiles Pime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi held a confidential discussion on Sunday night at an Intelligence base. The focus was on a potential Israeli strike on Iran in retaliation for the missile attacks earlier this month. This meeting, which included representatives from the IDF Intelligence Directorate, indicates that the decision on this critical matter will rest solely with these three top officials. Other members of the political-security cabinet will only be briefed on the broad outlines of the decision. Before the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah last month, Netanyahu visited an intelligence base and received a detailed briefing from officers regarding the potential operation. Military sources suggest that this visit gave Netanyahu the confidence to approve the action and further operations against the Shiite terrorist organization. Sunday's meeting is one of several discussions among the three, expected to make the decision, but it is considered the most significant so far. A source familiar with the details said that the three were aligned on the objectives and are likely to keep them from additional cabinet members to prevent any information leaks. Following Iran's ballistic missile attack earlier this month, recent reports indicated that the Islamic Republic was on edge about a possible Israeli response and was working continuously to mitigate it. As far as Israel is concerned, reports from Iran are deemed credible. On Sunday, the United States confirmed the deployment of a THAAD air defense system to the region to assist Israel in intercepting ballistic missiles. About 100 American soldiers would be sent to the area. This move reflects Washington's expectations of an imminent Israeli strike in Iran and a potential Iranian response, recognizing that Israeli defense systems cannot provide complete protection, as evidenced by the ballistic missile attack earlier this month.

IDF strikes Christian area in Lebanon in 1st since war	At least 18 reported killed; Saudi media says the target was a senior member of Hezbollah; earlier reports claim local mayors fearful of displaced with Hezbollah ties bringing danger At least 18 people were killed, and one person was injured on Monday, according to a report in the Reuters news agency, in the first Israeli air strike on the predominately Christian region of Aitou in north Lebanon. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al Manar said the house that was hit was rented by one of its reporters Lebanese who evacuated from areas that were under Israeli attack, have moved to other parts of the country and have rented homes there. Local mayors have appealed to them not to host members of Hezbollah, according to reports. According to a report in Lebanon's English language Independent newspaper last August, residents of Dahieh did not believe that the capital would come under attack but after the assassination of Hezbollah's senior military commander Fuad Shukr in July, they became anxious and afraid. The Lebanese government unlike the government in Israel, did not provide any assistance to the displaced, nor did Hezbollah, and that caused outrage. The forced evacuations revealed the split in Lebanese society and landlords were afraid to rent property to people who may have ties to Hezbollah because they may put them at risk. One mayor said his town saw many former residents of Dahieh, trying to find furnished accommodations and landlords were limiting them to one family for each apartment. A Lebanese researcher told the paper that at the start of the war, people were uprooted from the South and moved into Sidon, Nabatiyeh and Beirut but after attacks on the Dahieh, more people were forced to evacuate further to the north and rent prices spiked as a result.

Not in Gaza or Lebanon, but here': The stories of fallen soldier...	Sergeant Omri Tamari, Sergeant Yosef Hieb, Sergeant Yoav Agmon and Sergeant Alon Amitay were killed after a Hezbollah drone exploded inside of their base near Binyamina; these are their stories The IDF on Monday released the names of four soldiers killed in a Hezbollah drone attack on the Golani Training Base near Binyamina the night before. Sergeant Omri Tamari, 19, from Mazkeret Batya; Sergeant Yosef Hieb, 19, from Tuba-Zangariyye; Sergeant Yoav Agmon, 19, from Binyamina-Giv'at Ada and Sergeant Alon Amitay, 19, from Ramot Naftali, all infantry trainees in the Golani Brigade. These are their stories. 'Yosef fell in the same month as his grandfather did' Sergeant Yosef Hieb is the 18th fallen soldier from the Hieb tribe and was a resident of the Bedouin village of Tuba-Zangariyye in the eastern Galilee. Hieb was related to the head of the village’s council, Hussein Hieb, who shared, 'Yosef was a brave soldier, a righteous son, an example of loyalty and giving.' 'We ask God to grant his family patience and comfort during this difficult time. We believe that God chooses pure souls to take them to the gardens of happiness,' he added. Attorney Wissam Omar, a family friend, said in an interview with Ynet on Monday, 'His grandfather fell in 1991 and his father is a police officer. This is a family that has contributed and continues to contribute a lot.' Wissam knew Yosef and shared, 'He was simply a wonderful and lovely child; it's so tragic that he fell. God must have willed it this way. He fell in the same month as his grandfather did. This is a bereaved family. We share in the family's profound grief and offer them our strength.' Amitai visited home on Saturday: 'His mother was anxious' Last Friday, Amitai Alon surprised his parents, Hagit and Itzik and his two younger siblings, twins Uriya and Hadas, 12, by arriving home for Yom Kippur. 'They sent him to say goodbye to his mother. I spoke to him on Friday and he was so happy, so glad to be home for Shabbat,' said Michal Nidam-Alharrar, Amitai's aunt. A few minutes before the start of the fast, Amitai's mother Hagit, managed to wash his uniform, who enlisted into the Golani Brigade eight months ago, just like many members of his large family from Kiryat Shemona who joined the unit. Amitai studied at a high school in Kibbutz Kfar Blum and those who knew him describe him as a beloved, funny and cheerful young man. Two years ago, he lost his two best friends in a car accident, and had since adopted their families and was unwilling to part from them. 'He visited their parents every Friday, never missed even on weekends when he came home from the army and sent them flowers. He never forgot anyone. He made sure to visit his grandparents at the hotel too,' Nidam-Alharrar said. Amitai and his family live in the settlement of Ramot Naftali and were evacuated when the war broke. Hagit, a lieutenant colonel in the reserves, was released from compulsory service two months before October 2023, but was called back to serve when the war began. 'His mother has dedicated her whole life to the military and was so anxious when she sent her eldest son to serve,' his uncle Yishai Alharrar said. 'She was afraid he'd finish basic training and the conflict in Lebanon wouldn't end. She so hoped he wouldn't have to fight there, but the most painful thing is that he was hurt in a place that should've been safe,' Yishai added. On Sunday, Amitai's father, Itzik, drove him to the bus stop and hugged him goodbye. 'He knew something terrible might happen. His mother, Hagit, was so scared and anxious,' Yishai described. Amitai's uncle said he spoke with him mother minutes before the attack took place. 'It was during the training course when they felt safer and that's when he got hurt. A person's fate is sealed,' he said. 'Amitai was eagerly waiting for his enlistment and wanted to be a combat soldier and a commander, just like his mother and uncles. He was an amazing child and a lover of people,' he added. Omri trained for two years to enter a combat unit The drone strike also claimed the life of Omri Tamari from Mazkeret Batya. 'It's incomprehensible for a grandfather to bury his grandson,' said Avraham Tamari, 81, Omri's grandfather, who lives in Kibbutz Sde Avraham. 'My father, Yaakov Tzvi, was killed in the War of Independence in Jerusalem when I was a 5-year-old child. My older brother Shmuel was killed in 1968 during the Jordan Valley War. On that terrible night, we received the call about Omri's death,' he recalled. Omri, who was in a gap year at the kibbutz, took care of animals and worked with children with special needs. He was drafted mid-year into combat service in the unit. He was determined and proud of his military service. 'He prepared himself well for the army and wanted to contribute as much as possible,' Avraham shared. 'He was in great shape and gave his best. He was proud to serve as a combat soldier in Golani,' he added. 'We heard about the attack in Binyamina and thought it might have been at another base until they called to inform us about Omri a few hours later. He used to call to check on me and always said he was in a place where he was contributing.' 'A remarkable figure, a quiet leader, introverted, smart, athletic and deeply principled,' the pre-military training group Omri trained in said following news of his death. 'Omri was dedicated and committed to his personal and team success. After passing many trials, he joined Golani and was driven by a deep sense of duty to the country and its future. 'Omri, who devoted all his energy to combat fitness training for two and a half years, stood out for his dedication and ongoing commitment. Even after joining the army, he stayed connected to the program, which appreciated and loved him back. Omri chose a gap year because of his deep love for the country and his desire to contribute in every possible way,' the group added. Yedidya Etzion, principal the Mazkeret Batya school in which Tamari studies, said, 'It's hard to put into words what Omri was — a young man led by values who excelled in everything he did, physically or intellectually. An outstanding athlete and student, a quiet leader who spoke little but was full of values.' 'I never heard him say a bad word about anyone or even complain — he was always focused on doing good wherever he was, whether at school, during his gap year, or in the army,' he added. Yoav died just a few kilometers from his family's home Yoav Agmon was the second of four children in the Agmon family. The son of Tzafrir, a high-tech professional at Elbit System, and Lilach, an elementary school teacher. He enlisted this past August and took great pride in his combat service in Golani. 'Yoav was always smiling and helping everyone, one of those people you call 'salt of the earth,'' his close friend said. 'He was full of joy and loved by all his friends. We never thought tragedy would strike so close to home.' The tragic incident took place at the Golani Training Base, which is less than three kilometers (1.8 miles) from the family's home. 'It's incomprehensible,' a relative said in pain. 'Not in Gaza, not in Lebanon — but here, right near home.' Yoav's parents, along with the town’s residents, are struggling to come to terms with the heavy loss. His loved ones described him as a 'silent leader,' and spoke of a young man full of pride in his service with Golani. IDF representatives arrived at the family's home late last night to deliver the devastating news. Relatives and Yoav's friends gathered at the family’s home in Binyamina-Giv'at Ada, struggling to cope with their shock and grief.

Did CIA help in the assassination of senior Hezbollah official?	Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper quotes officials saying CIA operatives gather information on the terror group from Lebanese security officials, reveal the whereabouts of Wafiq Safa ahead of the IDF strike, and aim to weaken the Iran-backed group politically Was the CIA involved in the assassination of Wafiq Safa? According to a report in the Hezbollah-affiliated Al Akhbar newspaper that may have happened. Ibrahim al Amin, editor of the paper published a story on Monday titled, American enters the war – Officers join Beirut station to weaken Hezbollah from within.' He claimed Lebanese security officials admitted that Western intelligence agencies led by the U.S. initiated daily conversations with them to collect information on Hezbollah. The officials said that a CIA team arrived at the Beirut airport and drove out in a convoy of armed cars to the American embassy to join the CIA station there. The report claimed that Hezbollah assigned Safa in his role as liaison to the Lebanese Army, to be in contact with some of the security officials although the terror group was aware that he may be compromised. Israel assassinated him in an attack on Beirut earlier this month. One official said Hezbollah's suspicion over the U.S. involvement in the war grew after Safa was targeted by Israel and said he believed American intelligence played a role in his assassination. 'The United States will support Israeli assassinations of non-military Hezbollah leaders to minimize its sway over Lebanese politics.'

Central Israel comes under rocket attack, sirens blare in major c...	IDF says three projectiles crossed into Israeli territory from Lebanon and were intercepted; millions rush to shelter as sirens blare in areas south of Haifa to the north to the outskirts of Ashdod Sirens blared in Israel from the north to the south of Monday afternoon as rockets were launched in Lebanon. Millions of Israelis rushed to shelter while aerial defenses intercepted some of the incoming threats. The IDF said three projectiles crossed into Israeli airspace from Lebanon and were intercepted. No damage or injuries were reported after an initial investigation. Some shrapnel from intercepting rockets fell in Holon, just south of Tel Aviv but no injuries were reported there. Ben Gurion Airport halted all flights for the duration of the attack and a flight arriving from Berlin, Germany, changed course and flew toward Cyprus before entering into Israeli airspace. Another flight preparing to depart for Portugal was stopped on the runway. Hezbollah targeted vast areas of the north during the day on Monday including the cities of Haifa and Acre. On Sunday, a drone exploded inside a military base in central Israel killing four soldiers and wounding dozens of others.

Israel accused of preventing food aid to north Gaza	As Israeli forces operate in Jabaliya and civilians are urged to evacuate, world leaders ask if Netanyahu is implementing a plan to lay a siege on the northern part of the Strip to force Hamas terrorists out and establish an alternative civilian rule UN officials claimed Israel was preventing food aid from reaching Gazan civilians in the northern parts of the Strip, the Associated Press said on Monday. According to the report, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was considering a plan to block humanitarian aid from reaching northern Gaza to force Hamas terrorists into submission. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) denied that the crossings to northern Gaza have been closed, but according to the AP, they did not respond to questions about how many aid trucks have reached the area in recent days. COGAT said on Monday that 30 trucks entered through 'Crossing 96' (in central Gaza), but those are likely not intended for the residents of northern Gaza. The UN estimates that about 400,000 Palestinians remain in the north, and a senior UN official noted that only around 100 people have fled to southern Gaza since the raid on Jabaliya began about a week ago. The plan promoted by former senior military officials, calls for Israel to maintain control over the area for an indefinite period to attempt to create a new civilian administration without Hamas, splitting the Gaza Strip in two. The cabinet did not decide to implement the plan and it is unclear how seriously it was being considered. When asked by AP if the evacuation orders in northern Gaza marked the first stages of the plan, an IDF spokesperson said no. 'We have not received a plan like that,' he said. But one official with knowledge of the matter said parts of the plan were already being implemented, without specifying which parts. A second official, who is Israeli, said Netanyahu 'had read and studied' the plan, 'like many plans that have reached him throughout the war,' but didn’t say whether any of it had been adopted. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan isn’t supposed to be discussed publicly. The so-called Generals’ Plan was presented last month by a group of retired generals and high-ranking officers, according to publicly available minutes. Since then, officials from the prime minister’s office called seeking more details, according to its chief architect, Giora Eiland, a former head of the National Security Council. Eiland said the only way to stop Hamas and bring an end to the yearlong war is to prevent its access to aid. 'They will either have to surrender or to starve,' Eiland said. 'It doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re going to kill every person,' he said. 'It will not be necessary. People will not be able to live there (the north). The water will dry up.' He believes the siege could force Hamas to release the 101 hostages still being held by the terror group since its Oct. 7 attack. So far, despite the IDF's evacuation orders, only a small number of people have relocated from northern to southern Gaza. Many residents remain hesitant, partly due to fears that conditions in the south may not be much better and concerns that they won’t be allowed to return to their homes in the north. 'All Gazans are afraid of the plan,' said Jomana Elkhalili, a 26-year-old Palestinian aid worker for Oxfam living in Gaza City with her family. 'Still, they will not flee. They will not make the mistake again ... We know the place is not safe,' she said, referring to southern Gaza, where most of the population is huddled in dismal tent camps and airstrikes often hit shelters. 'That’s why people in the north say it’s better to die than to leave.' In addition to fears about their fate, if they evacuate, some residents report that Hamas terrorists are intimidating them, warning them not to heed the Israeli military’s evacuation orders and to stay inside their homes and shelters. On Monday, the IDF released a recording of a conversation between a representative of the military intelligence and a Gazan resident. The resident is heard saying 'The problem is that when we follow the army's instructions and try to go to Al-Mawasi, there are people who come out against us and start hitting us with sticks, telling us 'go back, go back' What should we do?' The IDF accused Hamas of using Gaza’s civilians as human shields, preventing them from responding to the army's calls to evacuate to safer areas.

Israeli couple indicted in Iranian plot to assassinate Israeli of...	Authorities uncover Iranian attempt to recruit 2 Israelis to carry out assassination plot; indictment lists various tasks suspects allegedly performed for Tehran, including arson, spraying graffiti and posting flyers Israeli authorities have thwarted an Iranian plot to assassinate Israeli officials, the Shin Bet security agency and Israel Police announced Monday. Charges were filed against two residents of Ramat Gan—30-year-old Vladislav Viktorson and his 18-year-old partner, Anna Bernstein—accused of working under the direction of an Iranian agent to carry out various criminal activities. According to the Shin Bet, Viktorson had been in contact with an Iranian agent since August, conducting tasks such as hiding money, burning vehicles and recruiting accomplices, including Bernstein. Viktorson communicated in Hebrew with an individual named 'Mari Hossi' on social media, fully aware of the agent’s Iranian ties. He carried out tasks that included spraying graffiti, distributing flyers, setting fire to vehicles and sabotaging infrastructure. In exchange, he received over $5,000 in digital currency. For each piece of graffiti sprayed in Petah Tikva and Ramat Gan, the defendants were allegedly paid $20, totaling about $2,000. For the arson of vehicles in Yarkon Park, they received $1,450 in digital currencies and an additional $2,850 as an advance for future vehicle burnings. The investigation revealed that Viktorson had agreed to more severe actions, including plans to assassinate a prominent Israeli figure and carry out grenade attacks. He sought weapons such as a sniper rifle and handguns to execute these missions. To accomplish his tasks, Viktorson recruited two additional citizens, including his partner, who participated in some of these operations. He was also tasked with locating homeless individuals to recruit for further missions and filming protesters during demonstrations. The couple was charged in the Tel Aviv District Court with contact with a foreign agent, vandalism, arson and conspiracy. Viktorson also faces terrorism-related charges for conspiring to commit murder. A senior Shin Bet official said that the investigation highlights Iran’s ongoing efforts to recruit Israeli citizens for espionage and terrorism. Several such networks have been uncovered in recent months, with many Israeli citizens reporting suspicious contacts to authorities. During questioning, they admitted to acting under an enemy entity's direction but claimed they did not intend to harm national security. According to the indictment, the two 'established a connection with a foreign agent via Telegram and carried out tasks on their behalf that could jeopardize national security in exchange for payment in digital currencies.'

According to an IDF statement, intelligence indicates Hamas is attempting to regroup in Jabaliya, prompting the IDF to urge civilians to evacuate through designated humanitarian routes to the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone. In a conversation with an IDF representative, a Gazan civilian described how Hamas terrorists were beating them with sticks to stop them from leaving the area and forcing them to return from the humanitarian corridor. 'The problem is that when we follow the army's instructions and try to go to Al-Mawasi, there are people who come out against us and start hitting us with sticks, telling us 'go back, go back,' what should we do?' the man says in a frustrated voice in the recording. 'We want to leave. We took our belongings and wanted to leave, and now they're hitting us and telling us to 'go home, go home,' what should we do?' When the IDF representative asked whether the attackers were Hamas or Israeli forces, the Gazan firmly responded that the attackers were indeed Hamas members.

Nobel economics prize goes to researchers of prosperity	U.S.-based academics Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson won the 2024 Nobel Prize in economics 'for studies of how institutions are formed and affect prosperity', the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Monday. The prestigious award, formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is the final prize to be given out this year and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million). 'Reducing the vast differences in income between countries is one of our time's greatest challenges. The laureates have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for achieving this,' said Jakob Svensson, chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences. 'Societies with a poor rule of law and institutions that exploit the population do not generate growth or change for the better,' the award organizers added on their website. Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while James Robinson is at the University of Chicago.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywjwocjke	2024-10-14T03:27:07-07:00	
Hezbollah supporters flood social media with false claims IDF chi...	As impact of deadly drone strike on Golani ascertained, false rumors of Halevi’s death flood social media, amassing millions of views and highlighting use of fake news as psychological warfare; Halevi arrives at base for assessment after strike Hours after a deadly drone strike on a military base near Binyamina killed four Golani Brigade recruits and injured dozens, false reports circulated on social media Sunday and Monday claiming that IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi had been killed in the Hezbollah attack. The rumors, aimed at boosting the terror group and engaging in psychological warfare, were quickly disproven when Halevi arrived at the base after the incident to meet with commanders and medical teams. Despite being untrue, the claims spread rapidly on social media, with two prominent posts on X amassing two million views each within 12 hours. The rapid spread of misinformation, often outpacing the dissemination of facts, is bolstered by a well-coordinated network of Hezbollah and Hamas supporters online. An initial IDF investigation revealed that the drone exploded in the base’s dining hall during dinner, killing three soldiers instantly, with a fourth succumbing to his injuries later. Air Force helicopters evacuated the wounded, while military counselors were dispatched to support those traumatized by the attack. The relatively new base, which includes modern infrastructure and bomb shelters, was targeted by two Hezbollah drones, likely of the Sayyad 107 model, launched from Lebanon via the sea. The IDF detected both drones before one was intercepted off the coast of Nahariya. The second drone was pursued by fighter jets but lost contact before it exploded at the base. The Air Force is investigating why the drone was not rediscovered and why no alarm was triggered.

Families of wounded IDF recruits recall nightmare of deadly drone...	I hope he can recover emotionally,' says mother whose son sat at table with 3 of victims when Hezbollah drone hit Golani Brigade training base; 'he and his friends witnessed horrific sights, there was a major failure,' says another relative 'The images of these young soldiers, recruits who only enlisted in August, will stay with them for a long time,' said a relative of one of the soldiers injured in Sunday's Hezbollah drone attack on the Golani Brigade training base near Binyamina. The attack, which struck the base’s dining hall, killed four soldiers and wounded over 50 others, including eight seriously. Speaking from Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera, the relative expressed disbelief at the lack of warnings ahead of the attack: 'It’s incomprehensible—no alarms were triggered, which would have sent everyone to shelters. I don’t want to call it a blunder, but something went wrong. One drone was intercepted, but the other disappeared. Something wasn’t right.' Another relative, whose family member was also evacuated to the hospital, said, 'It was a direct hit on the base. My relative survived, but the sights he and his friends witnessed were horrific. The Air Force must conduct a thorough investigation—there was a major failure.' Residents in nearby Kiryat Yam and Yokneam reportedly alerted authorities to the drone, prompting questions as to why no alarms were activated. 'This is a huge tragedy—four dead, dozens wounded. Alarms should have been triggered to prevent this disaster,' the relative added. Hagit Ohayon, whose son Yarin was lightly wounded in the attack, recounted the events in an interview with Ynet: 'It was a miracle. They entered the dining hall around 7:15 p.m., and as soon as they sat down, there was a massive explosion. There was chaos—dust, smoke, loud noise. It took him a minute to realize it was a drone because no alarm was sounded. He messaged us saying he was okay and that there were fatalities, which he had seen.' At HaEmek Medical Center in Afula, four soldiers with light injuries are recovering. 'It was a huge miracle,' said the parents of one injured soldier. 'Just minutes after the explosion, he called us, and we rushed to be by his side.' Another mother, Galit, whose son was hospitalized at Hillel Yaffe, shared her relief: 'He was sitting with three of the soldiers who were killed, and he survived. It was a miracle. The drone hit their table in the middle of the dining hall. He went to help a friend, only to realize he was bleeding from his own head.' She described her son's condition: 'He has shrapnel in his arm and abdomen, but thank God he survived. He’s not talking much, but he saw some horrific sights. I hope he can recover emotionally.' Galit also expressed gratitude for the support she received, saying, 'We’re from Holon, and we’ve been surrounded with love and support here.' Another father questioned why no alarm system was activated: 'I don’t understand why we didn’t activate the warning systems to prevent this disaster. There were dozens of young soldiers in the dining hall for dinner. The drone pierced through the roof and exploded. I hope my son and the other wounded soldiers recover, both physically and emotionally. They witnessed terrible scenes—friends covered in blood, crying for help.' The IDF released on Monday the names of the four soldiers killed in the attack: Sgt. Omri Tamari from Mazkeret Batya, Sgt. Yosef Hieb from Tuba-Zangariyye, Sgt. Yoav Agmon from Binyamina-Giv'at Ada and Sgt. Alon Amitay from Ramot Naftali. All were 19-year-old infantry recruits in the Golani Brigade.

Germany's Greens blocking arms exports to Israel since March, rep...	Ministers freeze all requests to export weapons and tank and helicopter parts to Israel, conditioning approval on Israel’s assurance that no weapons imported from Germany would be used for 'genocide' Senior ministers from Germany's Green Party have blocked arms deals with Israel, with no licenses for arms or parts exports issued since March, according to a Bild report released on Sunday. In a heated debate in the German parliament last week, conservative leader Friedrich Merz claimed that Germany has not approved any such exports for weeks or even months. However, Chancellor Olaf Scholz took the podium afterward, asserting that 'Germany has supplied and will continue to supply weapons to Israel.' Sources from various coalition parties indicated that during secret federal security meetings—attended by the chancellor and key ministers—Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, both leaders of the Green Party, blocked the arms exports to Israel. While Baerbock’s position wasn’t surprising, given her recent reactions to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and anti-terror operations in Tulkarm, Habeck’s stance caught many off guard. He had, after all, previously expressed strong support for Israel’s right to defend itself and ensure the safety of its citizens. Just in September, Habeck stated, 'There is no arms export ban to Israel. Each request is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.' According to Bild, Green Party ministers froze all requests to export weapons and parts for tanks and helicopters to Israel, conditioning the approval on Israel’s assurance that no weapons imported from Germany would be used for 'genocide.' Government insiders reportedly called this demand 'absurd,' arguing that its sole purpose was to block arms exports to Israel. 'Accusing Israel of genocide aligns with the rhetoric of its most ardent enemies,' said one source close to the meetings. 'It’s unclear how Israel could defend itself if an international court, biased against Israel, ever ruled it was committing genocide.' The newspaper reported that Israel provided the necessary assurances in writing to the German government last week, leading Scholz to tell parliament that arms exports to Israel would resume. The actions of the Green Party, particularly Vice Chancellor Habeck, have been nothing short of astonishing. Although the Greens are experiencing a slump in popularity, as seen in recent elections in three East German states, they seem to be catering to their base of left-leaning voters, many of whom favor diplomatic solutions and generally hold anti-Israel views. In contrast, despite the Greens’ opposition to Israeli arms exports, the German cabinet, with Green Party support, approved the sale of air-to-ground missiles to Saudi Arabia and authorized €336 million worth of arms exports to Turkey—two countries with particularly poor human rights records. Meanwhile, arms exports to Israel have dropped from €326.5 million in 2023 to just €14.5 million by August this year.

Elusive and lethal: Inside the Hezbollah drone that struck IDF ba...	Since October 7, Hezbollah has been making extensive use of Iranian drone mass-produced locally; Israeli defense industries stumped in countering threat The drone strike that injured over 60 individuals and killed at least 4 at a Golani Brigade base near Binyamina on Sunday — seems to have precisely hit its target. The IDF is now investigating the incident, but from the limited details currently available, the drone was likely a Sayyad 107 model, a UAV manufactured in Iran and widely used by Hezbollah, which also produces it in large quantities in Lebanon. The model’s flight path can be programmed to frequently change altitude and direction, making it difficult to detect and track. It has a range of up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) and is small, with a very low radar signature compared to larger, metal-made UAVs. Its detection relies on the heat emitted by the engine, which is also challenging to identify via optical means. The military is examining all possibilities, but it's almost certain that the UAV, which hit a critical target and caused many casualties, wasn't only a specialized model but also that Hezbollah managed to overwhelm or disrupt the IDF's detection systems by launching a mixed salvo of rockets and two other drones aimed at the Western Galilee. The UAVs continued toward the sea off the northern coast and the Iron Dome system intercepted one. The IDF dispatched fighter jets and combat helicopters to track the remaining UAV, but contact with it was lost. The IDF is now conducting a thorough investigation into how both the fighter jets and helicopters that had been tracking the UAV lost sight of it. It's possible that the UAV was pre-programmed to sharply descend toward the ground or the sea and continue flying at low altitude, exploiting the coastal terrain and then the hills of the coastal plain to evade interceptors. Hezbollah has gained considerable experience in operating UAVs over the past year, successfully causing numerous casualties among civilians and primarily IDF soldiers at remote bases. Over half of the drones launched by Hezbollah are intercepted, either by IDF fighter jets sent to engage them or by the Iron Dome and David's Sling systems. However, due to the UAV's small size and very weak radar signature, the Iron Dome's fire control radars and the optical sensors on fighter jets and helicopters often lose track of them, especially in hilly areas where radar echoes from the terrain are dominant and misleading. The sophisticated UAVs manufactured by Iran are equipped with inertial navigation systems in addition to satellite navigation, enabling them to stay on course and strike their targets even when faced with GPS jamming. This is intended to mislead them, but Iran and Hezbollah sometimes bypass the American GPS jamming by using unique satellite navigation systems developed by Russia or China. Neither Russia nor Ukraine have found an effective solution to the drone threat despite the war in the area now ongoing for nearly three years. Both sides in this conflict struggle to intercept the other side's explosive and reconnaissance drones in significant numbers. The reasons are well known: UAVs and even more so drones, are small, fly low and slow and optical detection systems also struggle to identify them. All the sensors, including optical and radar systems, often fail to detect them. The IDF and Israel’s defense industries have been trying to find a solution to this issue at least since the current war began, but there’s still no effective detection and interception solution, particularly for consistent tracking and targeting that would allow successful interception of UAVs, which are essentially miniature cruise missiles. It can be assumed that when Israel finally deploys laser-based interception from the ground and from aircraft, the process of intercepting these threats will be easier and more efficient than using the Iron Dome, David's Sling, or aerial interceptor missiles. The laser system, despite having undergone several tests, will not be operational until mid-2025. Even then, however, the primary challenge will remain to detect and track UAVs that fly very low, using valleys and prominent terrain features to hide before rising and crashing into their targets. There’s still no proper solution to this issue, which likely explains the lack of alert sirens sounding and the reason why the UAV injured so many when it crashed into its target.

Rockets from Lebanon set off alarms in Netanya and central Israel...	Multiple rocket interceptions sighted over central Israel; earlier Hezbollah rocket barrages targeted Haifa in 2 separate attacks, no injuries reported; Israeli border towns continue to face heavy fire Rocket alert sirens were activated Monday morning in central Israel, including in Netanya, Wadi Ara, Harish, Even Yehuda, Kadima-Zoran and several towns in the Sharon region. The IDF reported that 'sirens were triggered in central Israel following multiple launches from Lebanon. Details are under investigation.' Several rocket interceptions were sighted over central Israel. Earlier, sirens twice sounded in Haifa. The IDF confirmed that one rocket fired from Lebanon exploded in an unpopulated area during the first attack. In the second attack, sirens were also heard in Kiryat Yam, Nesher and other towns in the Haifa Bay area. The IDF identified around 10 rockets fired from Lebanon, most of which were intercepted, with one landing in an open field. Meanwhile, rocket alerts were also triggered in the Lebanon border towns of Margaliot, Manara and Misgav Am in the Upper Galilee, as well as in Tziv'on, Sasa, Mattat and Dovev, following two separate barrages. The Upper Galilee Regional Council confirmed rocket landings in open areas from the first attack, with no reported injuries.

Tunnels like in Vietnam': Hezbollah’s secret war machine thrived...	As IDF deepens ground operations in Lebanon, extent of past negligence on full display: terror stronghold built near Nahariya, more lethal than arsenal used for October 7 attacks; Hezbollah built supply tunnels stocked with Iranian and Russian arms Hezbollah has prepared three elite Radwan Force regiments, known as 'fawjs' in Lebanese military jargon, for potential action against communities in Israel's Western Galilee. Each regiment is marked with its own tactical identifiers to prevent friendly fire, and different colored markers guide fighters through a network of hundreds of tunnels. These markers help Hezbollah fighters quickly locate their weapons caches and regroup with their units. Underground, in Hezbollah’s logistical plan, fighters are equipped with commando knives, personal weapons (machine gunners, snipers, drivers and team leaders), communication devices, night-vision goggles, combat uniforms tailored to each fighter, Blundstone boots, storm gear, emergency food supplies, blood units and advanced first-aid kits. All of this equipment is stored in fortified thickets along the border, giving Hezbollah tactical oversight over Israeli towns like Nahariya, Kiryat Shmona and various kibbutzim and moshavim in the area. The logistical plan, modeled after the IDF's 2007 logistical improvements following equipment shortages in the 2006 Lebanon War, provides personalized, modern gear for each Hezbollah fighter, similar to IDF preparations for rapid deployment to southern Lebanon. As the IDF deepens its ground operations in Lebanon border villages, the scale of Hezbollah’s preparations is becoming clear. Senior commanders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and successive defense ministers, are now facing criticism for allowing Hezbollah to develop this extensive infrastructure over the past decade—described as twenty times more lethal than the arsenal used by Hamas in its attack on southern Israel on October 7 last year. These fortified areas, once referred to as Hezbollah 'nature reserves,' have long been used to shield the terrorist group from Israeli military operations. In the 2006 Lebanon War, the IDF avoided entering these zones, which Hezbollah had also used during Israel’s occupation of the southern Lebanon security zone prior to its 2000 withdrawal. Colonel Yoav Schneider, commander of the 205th Iron Fist Brigade, noted that in 2006, the IDF did not dare enter these areas. Schneider, who previously commanded the 82nd Battalion in 2019 near Gaza, had openly expressed frustration with restrictive rules of engagement that limited fire on Hamas fighters. Against Hezbollah, Schneider said, Israeli policy had been even more lenient. Schneider now strikes a more diplomatic tone, acknowledging that the political leadership will need to finish the military’s work. However, some of his reservists are less restrained. 'It would be a disaster if we revert to a policy of containment after we leave,' one reservist said. 'Hezbollah will rebuild its invasion infrastructure, and it will be a tragedy for future generations. We're doing our part—the political leadership must do theirs and set a long-term policy.' Hezbollah invasion still in the cards Lt. Col. (res.) Binyamin Tropper, one of nine siblings of MK Chili Tropper, commands a battalion under Col. Yoav Schneider’s brigade. 'We’re combing every inch here,' he said. 'We walk through the thicket, suddenly sense something in the leaves, and discover yet another tunnel prepared for Hezbollah’s Radwan Force, packed with large explosives meant to breach the border wall, bags full of equipment and more. We’re clearing everything. This is what we’ve been training for since 2006. Our mission is to ensure residents of the north return home with real security, not just a ‘sense of security,’ and we’re not done yet.' 'We’ve been here since Rosh Hashanah, through Yom Kippur and will remain through Sukkot and Simchat Torah at the earliest,' Tropper added. 'We’re loud and present, not operating like a special forces unit. Golani veterans are out here in force, and anyone left from Hezbollah is afraid to face us. As a veteran of the 2006 Lebanon War, I remember we didn’t dare enter these areas. Even the explosives here are wrapped to withstand winter conditions.' Brig. Gen. Yiftach Norkin, commander of the 146th Division, is operating in dual roles. While most of his brigades operate beyond the border, some of his forces are still defending the Western Galilee. Reflecting on the situation, Norkin recalled his time as a battalion commander in the Metula sector years ago, when Hezbollah prepared to launch a massacre of the local population from the opposing border village of Kfarkela. 'We’ll learn from this and investigate what we saw and didn’t see over the years,' Norkin said. 'The key now is to complete the mission. Discovering the scope and spread of their preparations was significant. We were surprised to find that the weapons were positioned so far forward. We had expected them to be further back.' Some of the battalion and brigade commanders from those earlier years, now uncovering the extent of Hezbollah’s preparations, are shocked that they were tasked with defending civilians while a lethal, state-level threat was growing right in front of them. Despite most of its forces being deployed in Lebanon, the 146th Division remains on alert for infiltration attempts into the Galilee. Hezbollah has trained hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in the western sector, some affiliated with Hamas, who could attempt to breach the border if an opportunity arises. Senior Northern Command officers warn of this exact scenario, noting that while the IDF is on the offensive and confident in its capabilities, complacency could set in as the weeks go by, despite ongoing airstrikes on Hezbollah targets. Under UNIFIL's nose In a Lebanese-controlled area with a clear view of Israel's Western Galilee and the Haifa University towers in the distance, a square iron door hidden among the bushes opens to a 30-foot-deep underground bunker. The bunker is connected by tunnels to nearby rooms storing Hezbollah’s Radwan Force’s weapons and supplies. Less than 300 feet away are an IDF post and a UNIFIL position, both close enough to have likely seen or heard the years-long digging and equipping of the site, despite the dense thicket concealing it. The military supplies—heavy boxes of weapons and ammunition—must have been transported above ground, as there is no tunnel connecting the site to nearby Lebanese villages. Despite the cover of dense vegetation, concealing such an operation, especially over years, would be difficult. Camouflaged explosives are even suspended in the treetops, ready to target any Israeli forces that dare to enter. 'This isn’t a temporary setup, but rather a network of military positions, tunnels and bunkers, like those built in Vietnam, all under UNIFIL’s nose,' Israeli officers explained. 'The weapons are of the highest quality, made in Iran and Russia.' 'We respect UNIFIL, and there was no intent to harm them during recent events. We’re investigating those incidents,' said Brig. Gen. Norkin. 'But this is a complex combat environment, and when attacking in such areas, mistakes can happen.' Col. Dvir Diamond, commander of the Carmeli Brigade operating in the sector, stepped into his role without a formal transition and was immediately thrown into the fray. His dark protective glasses cover the eye he lost in Gaza during 2014’s Operation Protective Edge. Previously, as the commander of the elite Duvdevan Unit, he preferred to stay in the shadows, and even now, he lets his soldiers speak for him. Diamond was at the forefront during the massacre at Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7, losing soldiers in the battle, while his unit continued to excel in operations in the West Bank and Khan Younis. His colleague, Col. Schneider, vowed, 'We will do whatever it takes to prevent Hezbollah from returning here. We now realize we cannot go back to the situation we were in. Hezbollah is battered, with many of its commanders eliminated, creating chaos within the group. Right now, they don’t want to engage with us and are abandoning their infrastructure to save themselves.' A reserve officer, armed with a chainsaw, began cutting through the thick vegetation—a small effort, but part of a larger operation. The IDF has promised a significant clearing of Hezbollah’s 'terror jungle' as the campaign continues.

Chased by fighter jets, Hezbollah drone disappears before fatal e...	Preliminary IDF investigation reveals drone detected after entering Israel from Lebanon via the sea, tracked and pursued by fighter jets and helicopters before disappearing from radar, only to explode minutes later The IDF reported Monday night that a preliminary investigation into the drone strike that killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others at the Golani Brigade Training Base near Binyamina was being tracked and chased by Israeli aircraft before disappearing from radar shortly before the fatal explosion. According to the investigation's findings, two drones were launched by Hezbollah—likely of the Sayyad 107 model— and entered Israel from Lebanon via the sea. The drones, launched just before 7 p.m., were detected by the IDF's radar systems. One was intercepted off the coast of Nahariya, while the other was under aerial surveillance by fighter jets and helicopters. However, contact with it was lost at some point. Minutes later, it exploded in an army base adjacent to Binyamina, killing 4 IDF soldiers and injuring at least 67. The Israeli Air Force is now investigating why the drone wasn’t rediscovered and why no warning siren was sounded. The Sayyad 107 drone has a range of about 100 kilometers (60 miles) and a wingspan of 1.5 to 2 meters (5 to 6.5 feet). Drones of this type have infiltrated Israeli airspace dozens of times during the ongoing war, causing damage to infrastructure and buildings. Last month, one of these drones struck a building in Nahariya, along with dozens of other sites. As part of the initial strikes in Operation Northern Arrows, the IDF targeted Hezbollah’s drone storage facilities, describing them in a statement as 'armed drones.' A soldier who witnessed the explosion described the drone hitting the dining hall while Golani recruits were having dinner: 'There was a crazy boom, without any warning, The iron door bent. We didn’t know what happened, and suddenly something pierced through the ceiling. We didn’t hear anything before, just the huge blast. No sirens went off. We ran to the shelter, and that’s when I saw they needed tourniquets. There were a lot of injured people covered in blood. We helped them get to the shelter and waited there.' Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Lebanon, particularly in Beirut. 'Hezbollah is still capable of defending Lebanon and its people,' the terror group said in a statement. Al Jazeera quoted a Hezbollah source claiming the organization launched 'swarms of drones' in the attack. 'Hezbollah's capabilities remain strong and can reach deep into Israel,' the source added. Sky News Arabia reported that the drone was launched under the cover of a rocket barrage targeting the Galilee. Meanwhile, the Saudi network Al-Hadath, citing unnamed sources, claimed the drone 'fired a missile' before it exploded. If confirmed, this would not be the first such instance. In May, Hezbollah claimed to have used a drone equipped with S5 missiles in an attack near Metula, claiming that one missile was fired before the drone detonated on its target.

Eyewitness to drone strike at IDF base near Binyamina, which left dozens injured and 4 dead, recalls, 'We ran to the shelter, soldiers needed tourniquets, many bleeding heavily'; 'He managed to call his sister, said he was hurt but okay,' soldier's parents say Dozens were injured, including four soldiers killed, in a Hezbollah drone attack on a Golani Brigade training base near Binyamina on Sunday. The drone, a Sayyad 107, struck the base's dining hall, where the brigade's recruits were eating dinner. Eyewitness accounts from the scene and hospitals describe the aftermath as harrowing. Images from the base show a blood-stained floor where the drone exploded. One soldier who witnessed the blast said, 'I had just finished eating and was heading to the corridor to return my tray when I heard a massive boom. The metal door bent from the impact. We didn't understand what happened, then something burst through the ceiling of the dining hall. We heard nothing beforehand—just the explosion. There was no alarm. We ran to the shelter, and that's when I saw soldiers needed tourniquets. Many were bleeding heavily. We helped them reach the shelter and waited there.' Parents of a soldier evacuated to Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera, where more than half of the 58 wounded soldiers were taken, recounted their panic. 'A friend called and told us our son had been hit in the head and was bleeding. He managed to call his sister, said he was hurt but okay,' said the mother. 'We rushed here. We just want to see him and hold him. It's hard to handle this pressure, we can't even breathe.' The father of another wounded soldier said, 'He has two shrapnel injuries, one in his head and one in his arm, but he's okay and fully conscious. He said they suddenly heard a boom, but there was no alarm.' Magen David Adom paramedic Rafi Sheva described the scene: 'Dozens of MDA teams arrived. We declared a mass-casualty event and treated the wounded. It was a devastating scene—blast and shrapnel injuries everywhere. The injured were evacuated quickly by MDA teams and helicopters to hospitals.' A total of 115 units of blood were sent to Hillel Yaffe for the 36 soldiers admitted there, while another 40 units were delivered to Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv. Dr. Yehoram Klein, head of emergency surgery and trauma at Sheba, said three soldiers were airlifted to the hospital, including two transferred from Hillel Yaffe in serious condition. 'All of them were wounded by shrapnel,' he said. Earlier on Sunday evening, Hezbollah launched two drones. Israel's air defense intercepted one after alarms were triggered at 6:50 p.m. in the Western Galilee, including Acre and Nahariya. However, a second drone penetrated deeper into Israel, striking the military base near Binyamina without triggering an alarm. The IDF is investigating why no warning was sounded. Preliminary findings indicate that both drones entered Israel from Lebanon via the sea. The drones, likely Iranian-made Sayyad 107 models, were detected by Israeli monitoring systems. One was intercepted off the coast of Nahariya, while the second was tracked by Israeli aircraft until contact was lost. Minutes later, it exploded, causing mass casualties. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, particularly in Beirut. A Hezbollah official cited by Al Jazeera said the organization had launched a 'swarm of drones' during the attack, claiming the terrorist group's capabilities remain strong and capable of reaching deep into Israel.

4 soldiers killed in drone attack on army base near Binyamina	UAV launched on Sunday by the Hezbollah terrorist organization hit an army base adjacent to Binyamina, the IDF announced; 67 soldiers were injured in the attack, including the 4 dead soldiers and 7 more seriously injured; 'The incident is being investigated' The UAV launched on Sunday by the Hezbollah terrorist organization hit an army base adjacent to Binyamina, the IDF announced early Monday morning, hours after the attack that injured at least 67. Four IDF soldiers were killed in the incident and an additional seven were severely injured, according to the IDF. All the injured individuals have been evacuated to hospitals and their families have been notified. The IDF said that the incident is being examined. 'The IDF shares in the grief of the bereaved families and will continue to accompany them,' the IDF said in a statement, adding: .'We ask to refrain from spreading rumors and the names of injured individuals, and to respect the families.' The drone attack is the highest number of casualties in a single event since the October 7 massacre. Hezbollah launched two UAVs on Sunday evening. Air defense systems intercepted one of them after alarms in the Western Galilee, including in Acre and Nahariya. But one of the two UAVs penetrated deep into Israel, and the explosion occurred in the Binyamina area without triggering an alarm. 'There was a crazy boom, without any warning,' said an eyewitness.

4 soldiers killed by UAV strike at a base near Binyamina		https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkztthyy1g	2024-10-13T14:39:46-07:00	
Israel can't go back to same situation it had on the border with ...	There were 1,000 first aid kits, hundreds of blood units, and thousands of weapons from Iran and Russia: Hezbollah’s deadly invasion plan reached Israel’s doorstep, but now the IDF is clearing it out; 'It takes a decade to build something like this, we knew about the plan, but the scale on the ground surprised us,' says IDF commander In recent days, the reservists of Division 146 have entered the hidden lairs of Hezbollah’s Radwan Force in southern Lebanon —the rocket launch positions that Hezbollah built over years in the dense, thick foliage along the border with Israel. From these positions, Hezbollah had a commanding view over the entire western Galilee, all the way to the outskirts of Haifa and the Krayot/Haifa Bay region. Division 146, composed of the Carmeli Brigade, Iron Fist Brigade, 300th Brigade and 646th Brigade, is the first reserve division to operate in southern Lebanon. Over the past week, the troops uncovered dozens of tunnels in the rugged and mountainous terrain. These tunnels lead to underground combat facilities and Hezbollah positions, from which rockets had been fired at Israel in recent months. So far, in targeted raids, the soldiers have eliminated over 100 terrorists, destroyed dozens of tunnels and terror infrastructure, and neutralized more than 50 rocket launchers and over 60 Hezbollah command centers. The Carmeli and Iron Fist brigades, accustomed to defensive missions along the Israeli side of the western Lebanon front, received the green light last week to cross into Lebanon where they discovered a whole new world – a hidden terror army lurking beneath the dense bushes, tightly-packed trees and 'natural' tunnels built over the past decade by the Shiite terror organization for an invasion force. The forces are also operating in a nearby village, moving through narrow alleys and streets. However, Hezbollah's main focus was on fortified positions in the thick terrain, where three of Radwan Force’s battalions had been stationed, ready to invade Israel. Fortunately, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, did not give the order during the critical morning hours of October 7 last year. At that time, these reserve forces were mobilized from their homes even before receiving emergency call-up orders, bolstering the Northern Command as Israel reeled from the Hamas attack in the south. The findings uncovered by Division 146 show how easily thousands of Hezbollah's elite fighters could have stormed Israeli military bases near Haifa, the Jezreel Valley, and Galilee’s lower regions, while the IDF was in shock and rushing to deal with Hamas' deadly attacks in the Negev. In the past few days, the reservists of Division 146 have uncovered hidden combat positions right under the noses of Israeli outposts and UNIFIL positions. Hezbollah had been digging tunnels 10 meters deep, only tens of meters apart. These were designed to conceal Hezbollah forces, allowing them to surface at the border for an invasion. In areas where Israel built security walls in recent years, explosives were found in these tunnels, specifically designed to demolish the 14-meter-high barrier. The IDF reported that Iron Fist Brigade forces destroyed a 120-meter-long underground facility located about half a kilometer inside Lebanon, equipped with electrical systems, ventilation and storage for weapons and ammunition. This tunnel was discovered months ago but was destroyed only recently. 'These positions contain combat trenches, living quarters and hidden firing posts, all with traps around every corner. We found personal weapons, neatly packaged uniforms, and endless ammunition –everything a Radwan Force operative would need upon arriving at the border,' described Brigadier General Yiftach Norkin, commander of Division 146. 'We discovered tunnels reminiscent of Vietnam. It took a decade to build something like this. We didn’t know the full extent of it over the years, but we were aware of Hezbollah’s plans.' The division also uncovered over 1,000 first aid kits, hundreds of blood units, and supplies meant for long-term stays in enemy territory, dwarfing the findings from Hamas’ October 7 invasion. They also found thousands of Russian- and Iranian-made weapons. The reservist officers, who are less bound by the constraints of political correctness compared to regular forces, are making it clear to the political leadership what the situation will be 'the day after' the ground operation ends in a few weeks: 'We will not allow Hezbollah to establish this kind of presence along our border and near our communities – no matter the cost. That decision will rest with the political leadership, but we cannot afford to let this happen again.'

This is the new air defense system the US is sending to Israel	Mobile and capable of intercepting missiles outside the atmosphere, the new THAAD system reportedly will be operated by US troops in Israel to counter Iran's retaliation threats Israel announced on Saturday that the U.S. had agreed to deploy a THAAD air defense system to help intercept ballistic missiles, with the U.S. confirming on Sunday that the system would arrive soon. This comes amid a potential Israeli retaliation to Iran's ballistic missile attack and the possibility of a significant and rapid escalation in regional tensions in the Middle East. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi issued a veiled threat against U.S. forces operating in Israel, in a post addressing the THAAD system’s deployment. 'The United States is putting the lives of its people at risk by deploying an American missile system in Israel. While we’ve made enormous efforts to reduce the likelihood of a full-scale war in the region in recent days, I must say, we have no red lines when it comes to defending our people and assets.' The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that around 100 U.S. troops will be responsible for operating the system, a detail later confirmed by the Pentagon. The system will represent a significant air defense capability that could serve as a 'force multiplier' for Israel against the various threats surrounding the country, particularly against Iran. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system is a mobile, high-altitude regional defense system, similar in capability to Israel's Arrow system. It can intercept missiles outside the atmosphere, using kinetic energy to neutralize them. THAAD is designed to target various stages of an enemy missile's flight path, as well as other threats. The system’s deployment comes following an Israeli request to the U.S. It’s also seen as a show of strength by sending additional military assets to the region. A Tehran-based source cited by CNN said Iran has informed the U.S. that it will retaliate against any new attack by Israel. What makes this system special? 'The system is comparable to the Israeli Arrow system; it’s not intended to add another layer of defense or replace an existing system. It’s about providing additional firepower and each of these batteries comes with dozens of interceptors, significantly boosting firepower,' former IDF Air Defense commander Brig.-Gen. (res.) Zvika Haimovich told Ynet. 'We saw around 200 interceptors used in the last barrage after 100 were used in April. If the next attack includes more munitions, this addition provides more opportunities and enhances your ability to defend against Iran’s more intense scenarios,' he explained. What’s the significance of deploying THAAD beyond just boosting firepower? 'In essence, it's part of a defensive alliance and U.S.-Israeli partnership. This system is one of several components we’ve seen over the past year including elements on the ground, at sea and detection systems in space.' 'It sends a regional message of a strong, stable strategic alliance, with the U.S. literally standing by Israel's defense. It’s both a deterrent and a practical threat that could eventually manifest in the interception of missiles fired at Israel from the ground by American forces. This dual significance is incredibly important,' Haimovich said. What has U.S.-Israel cooperation in this field looked like so far? 'During the first Gulf War, the Americans deployed air defense forces in the region but there’s been an ongoing process with the U.S. since the early 2000s where hundreds and thousands of American troops come to Israel every two years and we practice the response to a complex, multi-front threat landscape that didn’t only emerge this past year. 'These are personal connections, reciprocated on a daily and weekly basis and not just in biannual exercises. This doesn’t just start with an order from the U.S. president – it’s built on a longstanding, very personal relationship, as close as it can get. When people say 'fighting shoulder to shoulder' – it's not a cliché; that’s exactly what it is,' Haimovich added.

Man arrested near Trump rally in California on gun charges	A man arrested at a security checkpoint near Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's California rally on Saturday faces gun charges after he was found in possession of two guns and a high-capacity magazine, authorities said on Sunday. The 49-year-old man, a resident of Las Vegas, was stopped in a black SUV by deputies from the Riverside County sheriff's office on Saturday and taken into custody without incident, according to the office. 'The incident did not impact the safety of former President Trump or attendees of the event,' the sheriff's office said in a press release. Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July. Trump's rally on Saturday took place in the Coachella Valley, an area known for its annual music and arts festival. The sheriff's office said the man arrested, identified as Vem Miller, was charged with possession of a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine. More details about the charges were not available.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rychznfkkg	2024-10-13T13:47:35-07:00	
Lawmakers direct IDF to lower number of attacks on Beirut after N...	Decision comes after U.S. president asks to refrain from attacking Lebanon's capital amid fears escalations could expand scope of Israeli ground operation The Israeli Air Force hasn't conducted strikes on Beirut for three days following U.S. President Joe Biden's request to scale back operations in the area during his recent conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. The slowing of attacks was directed by Israel's political echelon. The last attack in the Lebanese capital targeted the city center, reportedly aiming at Wafiq Safa, a trusted confidant of the former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was eliminated in an Israeli strike in Dahieh about two weeks ago. During Biden's conversation with Netanyahu, after a prolonged period of no communication between the two leaders, the U.S. president asked the prime minister to reduce the scale of Israeli strikes in Beirut. Israel has refrained from attacking the capital since. Following the call with Biden, the Prime Minister's Office described Netanyahu's call with him as 'businesslike. Israel always listens attentively to the issues raised by our ally, the United States, but the prime minister ultimately makes decisions based on Israel's national interests.' Regarding coordination with the U.S., the Prime Minister's Office said: 'There is ongoing communication with them and we listen to their concerns, just as we explain our perspective and analysis. Israel will do whatever is necessary to protect itself.'

Hezbollah has less than a third of its missiles', Gallant says	During a Cabinet security briefing, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Maj. Gen. Eliezer Toledano reported that hundreds of Hezbollah combat vests and fully equipped battle kits were located, indicating a possible incursion was planned; Gallant also added that Israel 'is still dependent on American munitions and aircraft, but we are working at full speed to promote domestic production' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Strategy Division Chief, Maj. Gen. Eliezer Toledano, provided a security briefing to Israel's Cabinet on Sunday, reporting that Hezbollah has less than one-third of the missiles it once possessed. Gallant also revealed that hundreds of combat vests and fully equipped combat packs prepared for battle were located, indicating a possible incursion was planned. Since the start of the war, Hezbollah has fired more than 14,000 rockets, with many more destroyed in Israeli Air Force strikes. When asked about Israel’s munitions stockpiles, Gallant acknowledged that there was a significant shortfall when he took office as defense minister. He added that, even before the war, he had already ordered ammunition to close those gaps. However, Gallant noted: 'We are still dependent on American air munitions and aircraft.' Gallant emphasized that Israel is working 'at full speed to promote domestic production and develop independence' in terms of munitions. Gallant and Toledano also reported that the operation in southern Lebanon is progressing as planned. Unlike in the 2006 Lebanon War, this time the objectives are very clear: clearing enemy infrastructure from rural areas. The forces are highly experienced and well-equipped, encountering minimal direct contact with Hezbollah fighters. A large cache of weapons has been uncovered, including hundreds of anti-tank missiles, launchers and ammunition. Maj. Gen. Toledano stated: 'Previously, there was a man with an organization and an organization with a state. Now there is no man, and the organization is weakened.' According to Gallant and Toledano, Hezbollah's senior command structure has been almost entirely eliminated. Gallant also addressed the recent injuries to UNIFIL personnel by Israeli fire in southern Lebanon, explaining that they were caught in a Hezbollah ambush. Earlier on Sunday, the IDF Spokesperson's Unit released drone footage of a Hezbollah tunnel shaft discovered in a civilian area in a southern Lebanese village. The IDF also provided updates on ongoing operations by the 8th Brigade's combat team, in collaboration with the IDF’s counter-terrorism unit and under the command of the 91st Division, in southern Lebanon. The forces are engaged in close-quarters combat, eliminating terrorists and destroying Hezbollah's infrastructure along the border. The forces have uncovered, confiscated and destroyed large quantities of weaponry, including dozens of rockets, AK-47 rifles, Kornet missiles, grenades, and ammunition intended for Hezbollah's elite Radwan Unit. They have also discovered several weapons caches hidden in civilian homes stocked with dozens of missiles. Underground, troops found and dismantled terrorist infrastructure, including tunnels and underground chambers used by militants for shelter and weapon storage. The 36th Division also continued its focused operations in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah's terror infrastructure. The Israeli Air Force, in collaboration with the division, struck dozens of Hezbollah targets, including launchers, anti-tank positions, weapons depots, and other terror assets. The IDF reported that in the last 24 hours, the Israeli Air Force and Northern Command have struck approximately 200 Hezbollah targets across southern and deeper parts of Lebanon. These included terror cells, launchers, military structures, anti-tank positions, and command centers.

Zelensky says North Koreans fighting with Russians in Ukraine	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that defense relationships with his country's partners would have to change in light of North Korean transfers of people as well as weapons to Russian forces in Ukraine. The Kremlin on Thursday dismissed South Korean assertions that North Korea may have sent some military personnel to help Russia against Ukraine and might be weighing a bigger deployment. 'We see that the alliance between Russia and such regimes as the North Korean one is getting stronger,' Zelensky said in his nightly video address. 'This is not just about the transfer of weapons, this is in fact about the transfer of people from North Korea to the armed forces of the occupiers. South Korea's Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun said on Tuesday that 'there was a high possibility' North Korea could deploy troops to help Russia in the war with Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked on Thursday if North Korea was sending its troops to fight in Ukraine, told reporters: 'This looks like another bit of fake news.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/by5m39yy1l	2024-10-13T12:16:23-07:00

Meet Poland's new ambassador to Israel: This is what he answered ...	Maciej Hunia has previously visited Israel and has held several senior positions in his homeland, including head of Poland's intelligence service and military intelligence agency; Poland has not had an envoy in Israel for a long time For the first time in over three years, Poland finally has an ambassador in Israel. Maciej Hunia, Poland's new ambassador, arrived in Israel on the eve of Yom Kippur to begin his role. The 63-year-old Hunia has visited Israel several times in the past and held various senior positions, including head of Poland's intelligence service and military intelligence agency. His appointment was announced a month and a half ago, and during his confirmation hearing in the Polish parliament, he was asked if he believes Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Hunia replied that military actions causing unintended civilian casualties cannot be characterized as genocide, explaining: 'We saw this in Iraq and Afghanistan.' Poland’s embassy in Israel confirmed the ambassador’s arrival in a post on its X account on Sunday. Israel's ambassador to Poland, Dr. Yacov Livne, welcomed Hunia, saying: 'Wishing you much success, dear colleague. I look forward to working with you. Welcome!' However, Hunia cannot yet present his credentials to Israel's President Isaac Herzog, since Polish President Andrzej Duda has not signed off on the letter of credence due to an internal political dispute with the government. Poland currently has over 50 ambassadors without official letters of credence for the same reason. Despite this, Hunia can still fully function as an ambassador to Israel. Poland’s previous ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski, was recalled over a diplomatic crisis between the two countries over Poland's controversial property restitution law. Israel returned its ambassador to Poland two years ago, but Poland delayed sending its own, despite repeated promises. The diplomatic rift began in 2021 when Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Paweł Jabłoński announced a review of the Israeli youth trips to Poland, which had been paused during the COVID-19 pandemic. He claimed the trips were spreading 'hatred of Poland.' Jabłoński later helped negotiate the renewal of the youth delegations, and in June of last year he stated that relations between the two countries had improved. 'We will discuss the hundreds or thousands who collaborated with the Nazis, but not at the expense of the victims. The agreement on youth delegations aims to encourage Israelis to also learn about modern Polish-Israeli relations. We want them to understand what happened without identifying Poland solely with the death camps,' he said during a visit to Israel.

World's first drone war' taking place in Middle East	Israel’s multilayered defense is under increasing pressure from drone strikes, marking a new chapter in regional conflict; Ukraine’s air force has improved its drone interception capabilities against attacks from Russia; Drones are 'cheap to manufacture and easy to operate' Since the onset of the conflict between Israel and Iranian proxy groups in the region, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been deployed to target Israel, putting its multilayered defense systems to the test. The most recent such attack on Sunday night has left at least 67 people injured in the Binyamina area of central Israel. Four of the injured are in critical condition. This follows an attack on Friday night during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, when a drone launched from Lebanon struck a retirement home in Herzliya, also in central Israel. Although no casualties were reported, the attack caused extensive damage to the home, nearby buildings and vehicles. 'This is the world’s first drone war,' according to Brig. Gen. (ret.) Zvika Haimovich, commander of the Israeli Air Force Air Defense Command from 2015 to 2018. 'All of the regional players recognized the potential and the complex challenges that Israel faces in dealing with them. We will see this challenge continue.' Data from the Institute of National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University shows that since the conflict began a year ago, 180 drones have been launched by Houthi rebels, 150 by Shia militias in Iraq, and 170 by Iran. Most of these drones have been intercepted, many before entering Israeli airspace. The number of drones launched by Hezbollah in Lebanon is believed to be significantly higher, though the exact figure has not been disclosed by the Israel Defense Forces. According to the Alma Research and Education Center, which specializes in terrorism studies, there have been 556 incidents involving Hezbollah drones targeting Israel, with at least 1,500 drones involved. The Israeli military also employs UAVs in offensive operations across the region. According to the London-based Royal United Services Institute, Israel is one of the largest drone operators in the Middle East and has accounted for over 60% of global UAV exports in the past three decades. Dr. Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at INSS, explained that UAVs are typically small, offering several advantages to their operators. Many drones used by Israel’s adversaries are produced in Iran, the primary supporter of these proxies, or in factories in Syria overseen by Iranian engineers. Israel has reportedly struck drone production sites in Syria. 'They are cheap to manufacture and easy to operate,' Kalisky said. 'Their small radar signature makes them difficult to detect, and they can easily maneuver to evade interception. Their slow flight speed also makes them challenging for Israeli fighter jets to intercept.' While single drones are occasionally launched, more frequently—particularly from Lebanon—they are fired in salvos, increasing their effectiveness and overwhelming defense systems. Hamas, the Gaza-based terrorist organization, used drones in its surprise offensive against southern Israel on October 7 of last year, the attack that ignited the current multifront war in the Middle East. Videos on social media showed numerous Hamas operatives launching drones into Israeli territory, with some drones targeting Israeli military tanks and detonating explosives. The use of drones by terrorist organizations has helped narrow the gap between them and conventional militaries, adding a significant new threat to their arsenals. 'They can stay in the air for a long time in order to carry out offensive, intelligence, or other missions that pose no danger to their operators,' he added. 'UAVs have the ability to communicate with their ground operators.' Alongside UAV attacks, Israel has faced heavy rocket fire. According to data released by the IDF on the first anniversary of the war, 13,200 rockets have been launched from Gaza since last October, with an additional 12,400 fired from Lebanon. 'The drone threat is not more significant or more lethal than missiles,' said Haimovich. 'But there is a matter of how such an attack is perceived as an infiltration of the territory with an aircraft. It sounds much more significant and troublesome than a rocket or missile.' Footage of the drone launched toward central Israel over the weekend spread on social media, prompting alarmed citizens to rush to bomb shelters. Israeli radars detected the UAV, triggering sirens and sending civilians to safety. 'The main challenge is the interception, not the detection,' Haimovich explained. 'This is due to several levels of asymmetry.' Haimovich noted that Hezbollah’s main advantage is the geography and topography of Lebanon, with its higher, mountainous terrain just a few kilometers from the Israeli border. There is also asymmetry in the weapons systems and technology employed by both sides. F-35 fighter jets are deployed to counter drones, some of which are purchased on eBay or AliExpress before being modified for warfare. 'This asymmetry is part of the challenge,' Haimovich said. 'State-of-the-art systems are faced with threats that are far less sophisticated. But this is the mission, and it must be dealt with.' In recent decades, Iran has developed the Mohajer UAV, whose 10th generation was unveiled last year. It can carry up to 300 kilograms of cargo, giving it significant firepower. The Houthis in Yemen are believed to possess the Samad 3, a long-range drone with a 1,800-kilometer range, though it is highly inaccurate. In July, a Houthi drone that was not intercepted struck a building in Tel Aviv, killing one civilian and injuring 10 others. 'Israel is dealing with the threat by using its air defense systems—fighter jets and helicopters and the Iron Dome system,' said Kalisky. 'In the future, it will use radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery or a laser system developed in Israel.' Israeli defense technology firm Rafael recently unveiled the Iron Beam system, claimed to be the first laser-based system designed to intercept UAVs 'quickly and effectively … with almost zero cost per interception' and causing 'minimal collateral damage,' according to its website. Israeli media reports suggest it is nearly operational and expected to greatly simplify drone interceptions. 'There has definitely been a success so far, especially in thwarting drones that are launched from afar,' Kalisky said. 'The UAVs from Lebanon come from a shorter distance, so when they are intercepted, it is usually already within Israeli territory which can cause secondary damage from debris of the drone and the interceptor.' For over two years, Ukraine and Russia have faced a similar threat, with frequent and often deadly drone attacks on both sides. The use of drones and UAVs in military operations is not new. While UAVs have been used in warfare since the 1970s, their first widespread deployment occurred in the Russo-Ukrainian War. Russia continues to receive Iranian-made drones. Throughout the war, Ukraine’s air force has improved its drone interception capabilities, using electronic warfare, shoulder-fired air defense systems, and other publicly disclosed methods. 'The Ukrainians use slow piston-driven planes to intercept UAVs and in order to overcome their low radar signature, they use simple voice amplifiers and cellular applications to recognize the drone sound from a distance,' said Kalisky. 'Ukraine’s large territory compared to that of Israel means there is a large margin of error. Israel does not have the privilege to miss an interception, and this is not an easy task.' Israeli media have quoted Ukrainian sources claiming that Ukraine offered Israel the knowledge it gained in its war with Russia. The offer was reportedly declined, as Israel appears to prefer relying on its own solutions. 'Ukraine has developed acoustic sensor systems which help to detect drones,' said Haimovich. Drones emit a distinct humming sound, which becomes more noticeable near the ground, resembling the sound of a swarm of bees, adding to their psychological impact. 'Israel’s systems and air force are more advanced, larger, and more skilled than Ukraine’s.' In April, Israel faced a massive ballistic missile and drone attack from Iran, during which 170 drones were launched simultaneously. With support from a regional alliance led by the US, most of the drones and missiles were intercepted. One child was seriously injured, but no major damage was reported. As the war continues, drone attacks are expected to persist, with both sides advancing their tactics, potentially fueling another arms race in the Middle East.

This follows an attack on Friday night during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, when a drone launched from Lebanon struck a retirement home in Herzliya, also in central Israel. Although no casualties were reported, the attack caused extensive damage to the home, nearby buildings and vehicles. 'This is the world’s first drone war,' according to Brig. Gen. (ret.) Zvika Haimovich, commander of the Israeli Air Force Air Defense Command from 2015 to 2018. 'All of the regional players recognized the potential and the complex challenges that Israel faces in dealing with them. We will see this challenge continue.' Data from the Institute of National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University shows that since the conflict began a year ago, 180 drones have been launched by Houthi rebels, 150 by Shia militias in Iraq, and 170 by Iran. Most of these drones have been intercepted, many before entering Israeli airspace. The number of drones launched by Hezbollah in Lebanon is believed to be significantly higher, though the exact figure has not been disclosed by the Israel Defense Forces. According to the Alma Research and Education Center, which specializes in terrorism studies, there have been 556 incidents involving Hezbollah drones targeting Israel, with at least 1,500 drones involved. The Israeli military also employs UAVs in offensive operations across the region. According to the London-based Royal United Services Institute, Israel is one of the largest drone operators in the Middle East and has accounted for over 60% of global UAV exports in the past three decades. Dr. Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at INSS, explained that UAVs are typically small, offering several advantages to their operators. Many drones used by Israel’s adversaries are produced in Iran, the primary supporter of these proxies, or in factories in Syria overseen by Iranian engineers. Israel has reportedly struck drone production sites in Syria. 'They are cheap to manufacture and easy to operate,' Kalisky said. 'Their small radar signature makes them difficult to detect, and they can easily maneuver to evade interception. Their slow flight speed also makes them challenging for Israeli fighter jets to intercept.' While single drones are occasionally launched, more frequently—particularly from Lebanon—they are fired in salvos, increasing their effectiveness and overwhelming defense systems. Hamas, the Gaza-based terrorist organization, used drones in its surprise offensive against southern Israel on October 7 of last year, the attack that ignited the current multifront war in the Middle East. Videos on social media showed numerous Hamas operatives launching drones into Israeli territory, with some drones targeting Israeli military tanks and detonating explosives. The use of drones by terrorist organizations has helped narrow the gap between them and conventional militaries, adding a significant new threat to their arsenals. 'They can stay in the air for a long time in order to carry out offensive, intelligence, or other missions that pose no danger to their operators,' he added. 'UAVs have the ability to communicate with their ground operators.' Alongside UAV attacks, Israel has faced heavy rocket fire. According to data released by the IDF on the first anniversary of the war, 13,200 rockets have been launched from Gaza since last October, with an additional 12,400 fired from Lebanon. 'The drone threat is not more significant or more lethal than missiles,' said Haimovich. 'But there is a matter of how such an attack is perceived as an infiltration of the territory with an aircraft. It sounds much more significant and troublesome than a rocket or missile.' Footage of the drone launched toward central Israel over the weekend spread on social media, prompting alarmed citizens to rush to bomb shelters. Israeli radars detected the UAV, triggering sirens and sending civilians to safety. 'The main challenge is the interception, not the detection,' Haimovich explained. 'This is due to several levels of asymmetry.' Haimovich noted that Hezbollah’s main advantage is the geography and topography of Lebanon, with its higher, mountainous terrain just a few kilometers from the Israeli border. There is also asymmetry in the weapons systems and technology employed by both sides. F-35 fighter jets are deployed to counter drones, some of which are purchased on eBay or AliExpress before being modified for warfare. 'This asymmetry is part of the challenge,' Haimovich said. 'State-of-the-art systems are faced with threats that are far less sophisticated. But this is the mission, and it must be dealt with.' In recent decades, Iran has developed the Mohajer UAV, whose 10th generation was unveiled last year. It can carry up to 300 kilograms of cargo, giving it significant firepower. The Houthis in Yemen are believed to possess the Samad 3, a long-range drone with a 1,800-kilometer range, though it is highly inaccurate. In July, a Houthi drone that was not intercepted struck a building in Tel Aviv, killing one civilian and injuring 10 others. 'Israel is dealing with the threat by using its air defense systems—fighter jets and helicopters and the Iron Dome system,' said Kalisky. 'In the future, it will use radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery or a laser system developed in Israel.' Israeli defense technology firm Rafael recently unveiled the Iron Beam system, claimed to be the first laser-based system designed to intercept UAVs 'quickly and effectively … with almost zero cost per interception' and causing 'minimal collateral damage,' according to its website. Israeli media reports suggest it is nearly operational and expected to greatly simplify drone interceptions. 'There has definitely been a success so far, especially in thwarting drones that are launched from afar,' Kalisky said. 'The UAVs from Lebanon come from a shorter distance, so when they are intercepted, it is usually already within Israeli territory which can cause secondary damage from debris of the drone and the interceptor.' For over two years, Ukraine and Russia have faced a similar threat, with frequent and often deadly drone attacks on both sides. The use of drones and UAVs in military operations is not new. While UAVs have been used in warfare since the 1970s, their first widespread deployment occurred in the Russo-Ukrainian War. Russia continues to receive Iranian-made drones. Throughout the war, Ukraine’s air force has improved its drone interception capabilities, using electronic warfare, shoulder-fired air defense systems, and other publicly disclosed methods. 'The Ukrainians use slow piston-driven planes to intercept UAVs and in order to overcome their low radar signature, they use simple voice amplifiers and cellular applications to recognize the drone sound from a distance,' said Kalisky. 'Ukraine’s large territory compared to that of Israel means there is a large margin of error. Israel does not have the privilege to miss an interception, and this is not an easy task.' Israeli media have quoted Ukrainian sources claiming that Ukraine offered Israel the knowledge it gained in its war with Russia. The offer was reportedly declined, as Israel appears to prefer relying on its own solutions. 'Ukraine has developed acoustic sensor systems which help to detect drones,' said Haimovich. Drones emit a distinct humming sound, which becomes more noticeable near the ground, resembling the sound of a swarm of bees, adding to their psychological impact. 'Israel’s systems and air force are more advanced, larger, and more skilled than Ukraine’s.' In April, Israel faced a massive ballistic missile and drone attack from Iran, during which 170 drones were launched simultaneously. With support from a regional alliance led by the US, most of the drones and missiles were intercepted. One child was seriously injured, but no major damage was reported. As the war continues, drone attacks are expected to persist, with both sides advancing their tactics, potentially fueling another arms race in the Middle East.

Trump: 'Bibi has been very strong, not listening to Biden'	U.S. Republican candidate says in Fox News interview prime minister met with him in Florida despite his office saying no such meeting took place U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed on Sunday he spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'like two days ago,' despite the Prime Minister's Office saying no such conversation took place. In an interview with Fox News aired on Sunday, the Republican candidate was asked about the fact that U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu only after a seven-week hiatus, to which he responded it was 'pathetic.' 'Like two days ago and he came to my house in Florida, Mar-a-Lago with his wife who was lovely,' Trump said, referring to Netanyahu and his wife, Sara. 'I can tell you that Bibi has been very strong. He's not listening to Biden,' he added, calling the prime minister by his nickname. During the call that the U.S. president had with Netanyahu after the extended silence, Biden asked the prime minister to scale back Israeli strikes in Beirut. Indeed, in the days following, Israel refrained from attacking the Lebanese capital. The Prime Minister's Office said Netanyahu's call with Biden was 'businesslike. Israel always listens attentively to the issues raised by our ally, the United States, but the prime minister ultimately makes decisions based on Israel's national interests.' Regarding coordination with the U.S., the Prime Minister's Office said: 'There's ongoing communication with them and we listen to their concerns, just as we explain our perspective and analysis. Israel will do whatever is necessary to protect itself.'

At least 20 injured in drone strike in Binyamina, 3 in critical c...	Emergency rescue teams, including helicopters, are on the scene following the explosion on Sunday evening Many casualties have been sustained from a drone strike in the Binyamin area of northern Israel. Magen David Adom Director General Eli Bin said that at least 20 people were injured Sunday evening from a drone strike launched by Hezbollah that exploded near Binyamina in northern Israel. Three of the injured are defined as critical, five others were seriously injured and another 14 were in moderate condition. Emek medical center in Afula has declared a mass-casualty event. Hezbollah launched three UAVs. Air defense systems intercepted one of them after alarms in the Western Galilee, including in Acre and Nahariya. But one of the two UAVs penetrated deep into Israel, and the explosion occurred in the Binyamins area without triggering an alarm. 'There was a crazy boom, without any warning,' said an eyewitness. The serious incident comes in the wake of several other serious injuries recorded by Hezbollah's incessant barrages on Israeli communities at the same time as the battles that are currently taking place in the IDF's limited ground operation in southern Lebanon. On Wednesday, Dvir Sharvit, 43, and Revital Yehud, 45, were killed by a direct hit in Kiryat Shmona. Israel is also still struggling to deal with the threat of Hezbollah's UAVs, and an example of this came on the eve of Yom Kippur with the direct hit of a UAV launched from Lebanon on a sheltered housing facility for the elderly in Herzliya, in which there were no casualties, after the residents followed the directives of the Home Front Command.

US to send THAAD anti-missile system to Israel, says Pentagon	The United States said on Sunday it will send to Israel an advanced anti-missile system - and U.S. troops to operate it - in a bid to bolster the country's air defenses following missile attacks by Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden said he was sending the system 'to defend Israel.' Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said the deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery would augment Israel's integrated air defense system. 'It is part of the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months, to support the defense of Israel and protect Americans from attacks by Iran and Iranian-aligned militias,' Ryder said in a statement. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi warned earlier on Sunday that the United States was putting the lives of its troops 'at risk by deploying them to operate U.S. missile systems in Israel.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjc0outykx	2024-10-13T09:45:41-07:00

Israeli bombardments blow holes in Hezbollah budget, report says	Terror group's access to money is drying up amid increased IDF operations in the country according to experts in new report diving into Hezbollah's financial situation as war continues Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah is running out of funds to finance its continued assault on Israel amid the IDF’s deepening operation in Lebanon, researchers told U.S.-based outlet Voice of America (VOA). The news outlet reported on Friday, citing authorities in the U.S. and Lebanon, that the terror group’s source of funds is Al-Qard al-Hasan (AQAH), a quasi-banking group operating in Lebanon without a proper license. Israel's Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (ITIC) told VOA the terror group funded the financial body in 1982 as a charity fund providing loans to needy, mainly Shi’ite, Lebanese citizens. The body has since grown into a major financial player across Hezbollah-dominated Lebanon including inside of Beirut and the terror group’s Dahieh district. The outlet added that the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on AQAH in 2007. In a 2021 announcement about further sanctions targeting AQAH employees, the department said the institution had accumulated around half a billion dollars. According to MTV Lebanon, one of the country’s major TV networks, Israel's initial airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Beirut’s Dahieh in late September dealt a significant blow to AQAH. On September 30, an Arabic-language report from MTV Lebanon stated that the Israeli strikes had targeted Hezbollah’s 'cash storage centers, including a large part of the AQAH vaults,' resulting in what the network described as a 'financial crisis' for the group, according to the report. Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut, told the outlet that Israel 'destroyed' most of AQAH’s branches during the strikes. 'Hezbollah is facing a very serious financial problem. They are unable to pay rank and file members who have fled their homes and need to feed their families,' he said. The U.S. Treasury Department's 2021 statement regarding sanctions on six AQAH employees revealed that these individuals had used personal accounts at licensed Lebanese banks to move over $500 million to and from AQAH over the past decade. This arrangement allowed AQAH access to the global financial system through the employees’ personal accounts at Lebanese banks, the report added. David Asher, a former U.S. Defense and State department official who worked on targeting Hezbollah’s global drug trafficking and money laundering operations, told VOA that the group is in 'deep trouble' as it also loses access to the Lebanese banking system. 'I’m hearing from Lebanese bankers, including Hezbollah financiers, that Lebanon’s wealthiest bankers who can afford to fly have fled to Europe and the Gulf, fearing they could be targeted next by Israel for helping Hezbollah,' Asher, now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, said. 'These Lebanese bankers, most of them billionaires, see the wind is blowing against Hezbollah, so they are not going to let it take millions of dollars out of their banks, which still have cash despite being bankrupt on paper,' he added. 'They know that if they do, Israel probably will eliminate them, too.' Asher and Khashan also pointed out that another funding source for Hezbollah has dried up: cash deliveries on planes flying to Beirut’s airport, mainly from the group’s Iranian patron. 'I’ve heard from my Israeli counterparts that the Iranians are scared to send money to Lebanon right now because Israel is threatening to target flights into Beirut. The Israelis are warning they will target flights full of money, not just weapons,' Asher said. Khashan told the outlet that Iran previously arranged regular flights from Tehran to Beirut to smuggle cash to Hezbollah, bypassing Lebanese government customs. 'Since Israel escalated its attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs, the Lebanese government has asserted more control over the airport, and now there is no cash flow to Hezbollah,' he said. Lebanese Public Works and Transport Minister Ali Hamieh told APF last week that Beirut airport 'is subject to Lebanese laws and to the scrutiny of various relevant departments and security agencies.' He added that any plane carrying weapons must receive approval from the Lebanese army and be licensed by his ministry. In a Thursday report, Saudi outlet Al Arabiya cited a Lebanese army source saying the army and other security agencies have been 'scrambling' to establish control over the airport by initiating cargo inspections to verify declared contents. Despite the lack of cash, Khashan told VOA it was unlikely Hezbollah's operatives would halt their fight against Israeli forces anytime soon. 'Keeping up the fight depends more on the availability of food and ammunition,' he said. 'When your fight is motivated by religious zeal, you have more fundamental issues to worry about than the availability of cash.'

Nazi Party member killed during hike on Hitler's favorite mountai...	Andreas Münzhuber, a member of the far-right The Third Way party in Bavaria, tripped over an exposed tree root and fell 60 meters to his death A prominent German neo-Nazi activist, Andreas Münzhuber, fell to his death about two weeks ago while hiking on Mount Untersberg in Bavaria, near the Austrian border. He was hiking with around 30 others on a mountain once favored by Adolf Hitler. The view from the 1,972-meter-high peak was so beloved by the Nazi leader that he chose to build his infamous retreat, the Eagle’s Nest, in the area. German police reported that Münzhuber likely tripped over an exposed tree root and fell 60 meters to his death. He was killed instantly. The recovery of his body involved two helicopters. According to the German news site T-Online, Münzhuber was a senior member of The Third Way, a far-right neo-Nazi political party in Germany, serving as treasurer for its Bavaria branch. The party was founded in 2013 by former officials of the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and activists from the banned Free Network South. The party is estimated to have around 600 members across Germany. In the German news reports, Münzhuber was identified only as Andreas M. due to privacy laws, but media outlets worldwide covering the incident over the weekend published his full name. The British Telegraph reported that his full name also appeared on a crowdfunding page set up to cover his funeral expenses. 'Munzi, as everyone called him, was only 37 and still had so many plans in life. His death hit us hard,' read the post. 'The biggest void is felt at the dinner table in his home. His wife now has to raise their daughter alone. She is less than four months old and was the light of Munzi’s life. She looks just like him. He will continue to live on in her and in our hearts.' So far, about €12,000 has been raised for the funeral costs.

Columbus holiday in Latin America revives centuries-old historica...	After a 22-year investigation using DNA analysis, Spanish scientists argue Christopher Columbus, who was traditionally thought to have been from Genoa, Italy, was a Sephardic Jew from somewhere in Western Europe An Argentine claim that European contact brought civilization to the Americas has provoked rebukes from across Latin America, where heated debates often flare up over the era's contested historical legacy. Commemorating Christopher Columbus' landing in the Americas on Oct. 12, 1492, the office of Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei posted on social media on Saturday that the Italian explorer's arrival introduced enlightenment to the region. 'It marked the beginning of civilization in the American continent,' the post boasted, accompanied by a slick video set to triumphant music that elaborated on the claim. Columbus' arrival in the present-day Bahamas led to centuries of Spanish and Portuguese domination of a region stretching from much of today's United States to near Antarctica. The conquests and subsequent colonial experience have long generated impassioned debate. Many Latin American leaders now embrace a more critical view, acknowledging the abuses committed, including massacres, forced labor and widespread looting. Columbus, traditionally thought to have been from Genoa, Italy, was a Sephardic Jew from somewhere in Western Europe, Spanish scientists said on Saturday after a 22-year investigation using DNA analysis. The debates about his legacy often fall along ideological lines, with leftists especially sensitive to suggestions that the region's Indigenous cultures are inferior. Mexico's new leftist leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, ended a speech on Saturday outside the nation's capital with a repudiation of the view represented by Milei. 'For many years, they told us that they come from over there to civilize us. No! There were already great cultures here,' said Sheinbaum, who took office earlier this month, ticking off contributions from the Olmecs and Aztecs, among others. 'It's more than that, Mexico is great because of its original peoples,' she said, speaking in the working class city of Nezahualcoyotl, named for the 15th century king of Texcoco, famed for his poetry, engineering feats and skill on the battlefield. In 2020 when she was Mexico City mayor, Sheinbaum ordered the removal of a statue of Columbus that had adorned the capital's most prominent avenue since 1877. Sheinbaum and her like-minded predecessor have urged Spain's King Felipe VI to apologize for atrocities committed during the 16th century conquest of Mexico, a request that led to a rare royal snub ahead of her inauguration. The holiday is recognized across Latin America. But it has taken on different names, including in Argentina, where it was changed by a 2010 presidential decree from Day of the Race, a nod to Spanish culture, to Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity. In the United States, Columbus Day, observed on Monday this year, remains a national holiday. President Joe Biden also commemorated the day as Indigenous Peoples' Day in a proclamation in 2021. The holiday in Venezuela has been called Day of Indigenous Resistance for the past couple of decades. On Saturday, embattled President Nicolas Maduro accused Milei of seeking to rewrite history. 'Did you see what he published?' Maduro scoffed, referring to Milei's post. 'Remembering Oct. 12 as the great day when they civilized us,' he said. 'They want to impose their false narrative.'

Israel contemplates a response to Iran missile strike, two weeks ...	Israel has yet to retaliate against the Iranian regime's missile barrage while the US warns against attacking oil or nuclear facilities in Iran; 'Not procrastination, there is a strategy' After Iran's first direct missile attack on April 14, Israel took six days to respond. However, it has been almost two weeks since Iran's largest direct attack, which included about 200 ballistic missiles and was greater in scope and in the severity of its threat. This delay raises the question of whether Israel is procrastinating or if there is a plan to attack altogether. Sources privy to the details emphasize that there is no delay in the planned attack. According to them, 'Israel acts according to different considerations and what was true for the previous attack does not correspond to the current situation.' In addition, they stressed that 'Israel is not procrastinating, and is acting according to an orderly plan and a clear strategy.' Sources in Israel explain that the response will arrive and be significant, but so far it has not been officially decided regarding how, when and where. As part of the discussions on the nature of the expected retaliation, cabinet members were presented with options but no decisions were made concerning the attack. Also, unlike the last attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were not authorized to make the decision. Amid deliberations, the delay may be due to operational considerations and the desire to coordinate with the Americans. Despite Israel not coordinating Nasrallah's assassination, Israel wishes to keep the Americans in the loop to ensure Israel's defense, based on the assumption that Iran will retaliate. Israeli and American defense counterparts have been discussing the potential plan to respond to the Iranian strike. While Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden held several calls, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer spoke with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Defense Minister Gallant was supposed to meet Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the U.S. and Ambassador Mike Herzog has been talking to his counterparts in the White House. Meanwhile, the talks between Israel and the U.S. show that the Americans want to avoid attacking Iran's nuclear and oil facilities. Israel, nevertheless, wants to strike 'two birds with one stone', since damage to the oil facilities will significantly damage Tehran's sources of income, and will make it difficult for it to finance the continuation of the program nuclear and the financing of global terrorism. Still, Israel may be losing valuable time waiting to respond. The more it waits after the Iranian attack, the less the world will accept a significant Israeli attack, even if it is retaliatory. However, it seems that Israel is doing to the Iranians what Iran did to Israel after the assassination of the head of the political bureau of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, on July 31, for which Israel has not taken responsibility.

'Prime Minister Meloni reiterated the unacceptability of UNIFIL being attacked by Israeli armed forces,' the Italian government said in a statement. Italy is a significant contributor to the U.N. mission known as UNIFIL.

Officials to decide urgent defense needs as IDF shopping list gro...	Israel's senior political leadership will discuss the defense budget, with priority given to immediate IDF requests for bombs, missiles, and interceptor purchases, extending compulsory military service, and procuring JLTVs from the U.S. for ground forces Senior Israeli officials are expected on Sunday to discuss Israel's defense budget including whether to approve or reject a series of urgent requests from the IDF, given the constraints and strategic considerations of expanding combat across all fronts. The meeting comes ahead of the government approving the next national budget, expected by the end of the month. Deputy IDF Chief of Staff Major General Amir Baram is spearheading the army's force-building strategy, pressing for the immediate approval of a substantial purchase of thousands of bombs and missiles for the Air Force, driven by ongoing use and increasing demand across all sectors. Some of these acquisitions will be sourced domestically from Israeli industries. Additionally, the military plans to request a significant immediate purchase of interceptor missiles for the air defense system. Regarding manpower, IDF is pushing for several budget-related changes to alleviate the heavy burden on regular, reserve, and permanent forces. One proposal involves extending compulsory service for regular soldiers by four months, restoring the service period to three years as it was previously, thereby allowing many reserve battalions longer rest periods between call-ups. The interim recommendations also suggest improvements in the conditions for young career personnel, although this reform is expected to be delayed until the committee's final conclusions are submitted in a few months. Concerning the naval ships that the IDF seeks to reinforce through procurement, it appears the committee is currently postponing these recommendations, considering the ongoing acquisition of missile boats and batteries already strengthening the naval forces. The committee is anticipated to approve another IDF request for the immediate procurement from the U.S. of hundreds of light armored vehicles, specifically JLTVs, to benefit maneuvering brigades among ground forces. Other matters, which the IDF sought to advance financially and are likely to be deferred to the committee's forthcoming conclusions, pertain to plans for strengthening the eastern border with Jordan. This includes upgrading barriers and establishing an eastern division for defense, as reported by Ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth last month, accelerating production of armored vehicles such as tanks and Namer APCs, and setting up a dedicated emergency procurement management for weapons acquisition.

Troops taken aback by Radwan arsenal in South Lebanon	Cars with full gas tanks with machine guns loaded on them, weapons, munitions found meters from a kindergarten in Metula: 'Commander says only troops on the ground could locate what Radwan had been hiding IDF troops were amazed at the amount and quality of military, equipment and weapons they found mere meters away from the border town of Metulah and a kindergarten there. Since the IDF began its offensive in southern Lebanon, the troops discovered the scope of the failure to prepare for the danger posed by Hezbollah's elite Radwan force that was preparing for an invasion of Israel along the about 130 km of border, close to civilian centers. Troops operating in villages close to the border uncovered hundreds of weapons, wrapped and packed vehicles with which the terrorists planned to invade the Galilee to occupy bases and settlements as far south as Haifa. The vehicles were filled with gas, armed with heavy machine guns, packed with combat uniforms, personal weapons, and medical supplies, and were ready to emerge from hiding places. The soldiers who operated in the northern part of Kfarkila found Hezbollah's weapons stores up a ridge that was hidden from view from the Israeli side. They located anti-tank missiles of various types and ranges, a bounty of ammunition for full-scale combat, machine guns of various types, and explosives. 'We found real headquarters to control and command what they planned with maps on the walls, computers, offices for briefing, and safes for their classified documents,' the commander of the IDF force said. 'Because it is a relatively large village, you can only see a part of it from the Israeli side. That's why we operated at its edge and the whole brigade took it apart. I saw the preparation that was going on for years by Radwan.' The battalion commander commented on the limited operation, emphasizing that the Air Force cannot locate such complex structures with aerial photographs and they can only be found by ground maneuvers. 'Fighting in the Gaza Strip did not cause burnout and was an advantage,' he said. 'We are now much more experienced, even though we are fighting a different, more professional enemy in a different terrain.'

Netanyahu urges UN's Guterres to move UNIFIL forces away from fig...	In a clip Netanyahu addresses the UN General Secretary in English telling him that removing the peacekeepers from harm's way must be done immediately after repeated requests from Israel and repeated rejections from the UN Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday made an English, on-camera appeal to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to pull UNIFIL forces away from the fighting in South Lebanon. 'Mr. Secretary General, Get the UNIFIL forces out of harm's way. It should be done right now, immediately,' Netanyahu said in a video posted by his office. In Hebrew Netanyahu said the IDF had repeatedly asked that UNIFIL move out of the area where fighting was taking place and was repeatedly refused, thereby providing the Hezbollah terror group with human shields. 'Your refusal to remove the troops makes the UNIFIL forces hostages in the hands of Hezbollah,' Netanyahu said. He said Israel regrets any harm caused to the peacekeeping troops and does everything possible to prevent such harm but the simple way to avoid such events is simply to remove the troops from danger. Netanyahu went on to say that regrettably, some European leaders are exerting pressure in the wrong place. 'Instead of criticizing Israel, they should direct the criticism to Hezbollah which is using the peacekeepers as human shields just like Hamas used UNRWA in Gaza. Guterres condemned the shooting at UNIFIL forces, calling it a violation of humanitarian international law and the UN Security Council also condemned the incidents. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Saturday expressed deep concern over IDF's fire on UNIFIL positions. At least two members of the force had suffered mild injuries. The leaders of France and Italy condemned Israel for firing at the UN troops earlier calling it outrageous. Italy lodged its protest after the report that shots were fired, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said. An emergency meeting will be held at the UN Security Council later on Thursday following the incident. Firing on UNIFIL bases was 'totally unacceptable' and clearly flouts international law, Crosetto added in a statement. Italy has summoned Israel's ambassador to the country, Jonathan Peled, to Rome following the incident. France said it was waiting for explanations from Israel. 'France expresses its deep concern following the Israeli shots that hit the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and condemns any attack on the security of UNIFIL,' the foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that none of its 700 troops in the mission had been wounded. On Monday the IDF asked the UNIFIL forces to move out of the fighting area for their safety but was rejected. 'There is an obligation on Israel and Hezbollah to respect the role of UN peacekeepers and their mandate, and do nothing that would put peacekeepers and our troops in particular in harm’s way,' Irish President Michael Higgins, whose troops are part of the UNIFIL deployment, said.

Watch Hezbollah terrorist nabbed in S. Lebanon tunnel shaft	Man seen emerging from a deep tunnel in a village near Israel's border as troops operate in South Lebanon to destroy the terror group's underground infrastructure IDF forces operating in South Lebanon detected a Hezbollah terrorist hiding in a deep shaft leading to an underground tunnel that was located in a village near the border with Israel. The man was taken into custody and was under interrogation. In footage released by the military, the terrorist is seen climbing out of the shaft, stripped of his cloths to ensure he did not have an explosive device. The IDF spokesperson said that during the operation in southern Lebanon, the forces located an underground shaft in a building leading to a terrorist shelter with an exit shaft nearby. The soldiers surrounded the building, uncovered the tunnel shaft, and located an underground complex at a depth of about seven meters and approximately 50 meters of living space where a Hezbollah terrorist could remain alongside weapons and equipment for a long stay. After the terrorist surrendered and was arrested, the soldiers interrogated him in the field and later brought him to a detention facility for further investigation in Israel. The military also released the footage of a drone that located a tunnel shaft in the heart of a South Lebanon village and said forces were conducting fighting in close-range with Hezbollah terrorists nearby.

Iran Condemns 'Illegal And Unjustified' US Sanctions On Oil Indus...	Tehran Foreign Ministry says Iran to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interests and citizens against any violation and foreign aggression Iran condemned Sunday what it called an 'illegal and unjustified' expansion of US sanctions targeting its oil industry following Tehran's missile attack on Israel earlier this month. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei defended Iran's attack on Israel and 'strongly condemned' the sanctions, saying they were 'illegal and unjustified.' The United States on Friday slapped Iran with a spate of new sanctions on the country's oil and petrochemical industry in response to Tehran's October 1 attack against Israel. The US Treasury Department said it targeted Iran's so-called shadow fleet of ships involved in selling Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions. It said it had designated at least 10 companies and 17 vessels as 'blocked property' over their involvement in shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products. The State Department also announced it was placing sanctions on six further firms and six ships for 'knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran'. Baghaei said 'The policy of threats and maximum pressure' had no impact on 'Iran's will to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interests and citizens against any violation and foreign aggressions.' He said the sanctions would enable Israel 'to continue killing innocents and pose a threat to the peace and unity of the region and the world'. The new wave of sanctions comes as the world awaits Israel's promised response to Tehran's missile attack, with oil prices hitting their highest levels since August. Earlier this month, US President Joe Biden advised Israel against targeting oil infrastructure in Iran, one of the world's 10 largest producers. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi last Tuesday warned that 'any attack against infrastructure in Iran will provoke an even stronger response'.

Residents in north claim Hezbollah has more tunnels in store	We saw people on the other side who suddenly disappeared,' Israelis living near the Lebanon border say, IDF reveals more tunnels and shafts found near border The IDF said on Sunday that they uncovered a tunnel shaft near the Israel border in South Lebanon, in drone footage from the area. On Tuesday, the military said its forces located and dismantled a Hezbollah tunnel that crossed about 10 meters (33 feet) from Lebanon’s Marwahin area into Israeli territory near the community of Zar'it. The IDF spokesperson said that troops found infrastructure built underground including living areas for terrorists and stores of weapons and equipment. But residents of the north are not reassured. Yossi Adoni, mayor of Zarit, who has been living away from the border lining farming community, for a year, said that more tunnels are there. 'We've reported on digging noises and activity across the border. We heard noises and sawdust coming out from time to time. More than once we saw people who would be walking on the paths through the fields and suddenly disappear,' he said. Gadi Shabtay, who was evacuated from his home on the border in Kibbutz Rosh HaNikra said he believed the threat had not been removed. 'The army took all the findings and testimonies we had been collecting for years and gave ridiculous answers like 'what you hear is the noise of roots splitting the rock' or 'the noise of the cables on the antennas on the roof' or 'mice running in the sewer pipes' and many more strange responses.' He said that had it not been for the Hamas assault on the South, the army would have still been in the dark. 'We would have found ourselves invaded by Radwan's forces. Hezbollah has been preparing for 18 years,' he said. Like Shabtay, Attorney Eliyahu Ben Ezra from Rosh HaNikra also said that he warned about tunnels just before the October 7 massacre. 'In 2019, I heard noises in the bedroom, and in 2020 during COVID, I was working from home and heard and recorded vibrations in the ground,' he said. 'In my opinion, not all the tunnels have been taken care of, and it will take a long time. In my opinion, the story will not end with one tunnel. We will not return until everything is eliminated. 'For years we knew and warned that something was happening there. For years I have been shouting that the northern border should be taken care of and an IDF force should be brought in to clean out the border, said Moshe Davidovitch, Chair of the Confrontation Line Forum of Northern Regional councils and the Head of a council in the Western Galilee said. 'It is extremely lucky that the tunnels and the arsenal of weapons have now been found because it could have been a huge disaster that could have destroyed the State of Israel. The obvious conclusion is that we must listen to the local leadership and residents who are the eyes and ears of the state.'

IDF refrains from attacks on Beirut after Biden, Netanyahu call	Last strike on Lebanon's capital was the attack on Wafiq Safa, a senior member of the terror group and a close ally of slain leader Hassan Nasrallah last week; Biden reportedly urged the PM to refrain from harming civilians especially in Beirut The IDF has not conducted any airstrikes on Beirut since U.S. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone last Wednesday, for the first time since Iran's ballistic missile strike on Israel. Biden reportedly told Netanyahu to reduce its attacks on civilian populated areas, especially in and around the Lebanese capital. Israeli jets last attacked Beirut in an attempt to assassinate senior Hezbollah member Wafiq Safa. The IDF said he had been killed in the strike on an area outside Hezbollah's stronghold in the south of the city, the Dahieh. Saudi media claimed he was killed in the strike. Lebanese health officials said 18 people were killed and 92 injured in the attack on the center of the city, the third time that the IDF struck targets outside Dahieh since the war began. Meanwhile, in South Lebanon, the IDF was expanding its operations and calling on residents of villages there to evacuate. Forces uncovered a shaft leading to a tunnel near the border after other tunnels were found. The military also said it was surprised by the amount of arms and equipment found so near Israeli border communities, in preparation for an invasion of Israel by Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit. Hezbollah continued to target Israel on Sunday including Acre and Haifa and their surrounding areas. No injuries or damage to the cities were reported.

Brothers meet on battlefields first in Gaza, now in Lebanon	Josh and Avi Ettinger both serve in the reserves 'I just wanted to make sure he was okay and then update Mom so she wouldn’t worry,' Avi says 'hard to imagine what she must be going through.' After completing an extended reserve duty in Gaza, Josh and Avi Ettinger had planned a joint trip abroad to celebrate Josh's 40th birthday. However, they never imagined they would meet in the middle of a Shiite village in southern Lebanon, just two months after sharing a smoke in the heart of the Gaza Strip. On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, Josh—a father of four and married to Tali—was called up for reserve duty in the north, in preparation for the ground entry of a maneuvering brigade. Avi, his 35-year-old younger brother who lives in Modiin, received a similar call from the brigade's mobility unit commander and headed north. Avi's wife, Elisheva, and their three children celebrated the holiday with Josh's family at their parents' home in the town of Modi'in, not far from Jerusalem. Early Thursday, under complete darkness, Avi led a mobility unit supplying forces in the heart of the Lebanese villages. Upon arrival, he recognized the company where his older brother served, and the two met with great excitement. 'I just wanted to make sure he was okay and then update Mom so she wouldn’t worry,' Avi recounted. The Ettinger brothers immigrated to Israel about 20 years ago, a year before the outbreak of the Second Lebanon War in the north. At the onset of the current war, they were exempt from reserve duty but fought hard to return to service. 'We were eager to be called to help restore the residents in the north to their normal lives,' Avi described. A few months after the war began, he decided to leave the investment fund where he was a partner and manager. 'For me, the most important thing now is the military and restoring security. Once we finish here, I'll start a new career chapter,' he said. Over the weekend, the younger Ettinger returned to tasks at the border, while his older brother remained beyond enemy lines. 'It's hard to describe what a mother feels when she knows both her sons have gone to war on the eve of the holiday, but she is very proud of us,' Avi concluded. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s16gcao1yx	2024-10-12T23:37:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/12/yk14112348/yk14112348_1_11_709_400_0_small.jpg

U.S. says Israel has narrowed down targets for strike on Iran, NB...	Israeli security cabinet set to meet to vote to authorize Netanyahu and Gallant to decide the scope and details of Israel's retaliation on Iran after its missile strike U.S. officials believe Israel has narrowed down targets in its response to Iran's recent attack to military and energy infrastructure, NBC reported on Saturday. The Israeli security cabinet was set to meet on Sunday after it had not voted to authorize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to decide on what the Israeli attack would include. There is no indication that Israel will target nuclear facilities or carry out assassinations, the report said citing unnamed U.S. officials, adding that Israel has not made final decisions about how and when to act. Earlier the U.S. was reported to be moving its THAAD missile defense system to Israel to help intercept potential ballistic missile threats from Iran after Israel requested Washington to increase its power projection by sending additional military assets to the region, as well as providing assistance with air defense systems. Israel has repeatedly said it will respond to Iran's missile attack on Oct. 1, launched in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Lebanon and Gaza and the killing of a Hamas leader in Iran. Iran has been engaging in urgent diplomatic efforts with regional countries to mitigate the scale of Israel’s expected response and possibly secure protection for the Iranian capital. Tehran’s heightened concern stems from uncertainty over the U.S.' ability to persuade Israel not to target critical Iranian nuclear or oil infrastructure.

Tensions soar at NYU after threats, vandalism tied to Zionist gro...	University investigating threatening social media posts from Betar USA and allegedly linked act of vandalism; Betar denies involvement in vandalism but accuses NYU of failing to protect Jewish students from pro-Palestinian activists New York University (NYU) has referred recent incidents to law enforcement after receiving threatening social media posts linked to the Zionist Betar youth movement and facing an alleged act of vandalism at the university’s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW). According to NYU spokesperson John Beckman, these threats were directed at members of the university community and followed earlier reports of vandalism at ISAW, where the words 'Betar was here' were spray-painted on the side of the building. This act of vandalism came weeks after an ISAW staff member was assaulted in July for wearing a keffiyeh. In a public statement, Beckman condemned both the social media posts and the acts of vandalism, stating, 'Threats and invocations of violence have no place on NYU’s campus or in our political discourse, and NYU has zero tolerance for violence, threats, or intimidation'. The university has since increased security measures at the ISAW and has formally handed the matter over to law enforcement for further investigation. The threatening posts, made by Betar USA, included calls to disrupt pro-Palestinian activities on campus through violent means. In one such post, the group claimed, 'We have a legal right to ensure that events glorifying terrorism do not take place in our city. Shame on NYU. We proudly oppose SJP (Students for Justice in Palestine) and other pro-terror groups and call on all American Jews to boycott NYU until SJP is banned.' SJP has been a prominent organizer of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at the university. Betar’s statement also included the assertion that the movement was not behind the vandalism, despite the graffiti found on the ISAW building. In response to NYU's actions, Betar’s leadership expressed outrage, accusing the university of siding with groups supporting terrorism. They noted that NYU had condemned their efforts to counter pro-Palestinian demonstrations, specifically criticizing a planned October 8 event organized by SJP. Betar claimed that SJP supports Hamas and Hezbollah and had described Hamas’ October 7 attacks as a 'historic victory.' World Betar CEO Yigal Brand issued a strongly worded letter to NYU President Linda Mills, condemning the university’s stance and demanding the immediate expulsion of SJP from campus. Brand echoed the sentiments of Columbia University professor Shai Davidai, comparing SJP to a 'modern-day Hitler Youth.' He further accused NYU of allowing an environment hostile to Jewish students, warning that the university’s failure to act could lead to violence. 'We will not remain silent,' Brand wrote, calling for an international boycott of NYU. 'You will be held responsible for the safety of Jewish students on your campus. On the eve of Yom Kippur, as we reflect on our actions, we demand that you do the same and take steps to protect Jewish students', he addresses the Jewish president. The tensions between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups at NYU have been simmering for months, with demonstrations and counter-demonstrations drawing attention from both sides of the political spectrum. NYU has been one of the main focal points of pro-Palestinian protests, and while it has emphasized its commitment to free speech and dialogue, it has also repeatedly condemned violence and threats from any group. However, the university has faced criticism for not doing enough to protect Jewish students, even as it continues its efforts to maintain security and safety on campus amidst these escalating tensions. Betar, a Zionist youth movement founded in the early 20th century, has long been active in promoting Jewish pride and opposing antisemitism. However, its recent involvement in the controversy at NYU has drawn criticism from those who argue that its rhetoric has crossed the line from advocacy to incitement. Despite these accusations, Betar continues to insist that its actions are justified in the face of what it perceives as NYU’s failure to protect its Jewish students from pro-Palestinian activists.

Hamas' chilling blueprint: Tel Aviv skyscrapers targeted for 9/11...	Sinwar reportedly requested hundreds of millions from Iran and training for 12,000 operatives, claiming it would enable them to destroy Israel within two years; documents revealed in Washington Post also outline multi-front attack scenarios Hamas leaders had plans for large-scale assaults on Israel, including a 9/11-style attack on skyscrapers in Tel Aviv, even before launching their deadly incursion into Israeli border communities on October 7 of last year, The Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing both digital files and paper records recovered from Hamas command centers by IDF forces in Gaza. The documents outline a broad attack strategy involving the use of railways, boats and even chariots, according to the Washington Post report. However, terrorism experts noted that many of these plans were not practical. The 59-page trove of documents also details a 2021 request from Hamas to Iran for $500 million in funding, along with training for 12,000 additional Hamas operatives. Letters from Sinwar to Khamenei and Qaani Documents from 2021 indicate that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar reached out to senior Iranian officials, including Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, seeking additional financial and military support. In a letter, Sinwar claimed that with Iran's backing, Hamas could achieve the total destruction of Israel within two years. 'We promise you that we will not waste a minute or a penny unless it takes us toward achieving this sacred goal,' Sinwar wrote in June 2021. While the letter did not provide details on how Hamas planned to destroy Israel, it was also addressed to Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran’s Quds Force, who has been out of the public eye for two weeks amid reports of his investigation over alleged ties to Israel and a subsequent heart attack. Months before the October 2023 assault, Hamas had considered an even broader attack plan. A 36-page presentation, discovered at a Hamas outpost in northern Gaza on November 10, outlined potential scenarios for a multi-front assault on Israel, targeting military bases and civilian locations such as shopping malls. The Arabic document, titled 'Strategy to build an appropriate plan to Liberate Palestine,' contains dozens of maps, photographs and schematics showing Hamas movements and follow-up attack strategies across Israel. A vast database of over 17,000 images According to the presentation, Hamas' attack plans were based on a vast database of over 17,000 images, including satellite photos and drone-captured footage of Israeli cities. The database also featured imagery from social media, covering key military and civilian sites such as Israeli Air Force bases and diagrams of civilian flight paths to Ben Gurion Airport. The presentation outlined three attack scenarios, with tactics for deceiving Israeli defenses. Some of the planned operations were 'low-tech,' similar to methods used in the October 7 attacks, while others were far more ambitious. One such goal was to bring down prominent skyscrapers in Tel Aviv, including the 68-story Moshe Aviv Tower in Ramat Gan and the Azrieli Towers complex, which comprises three skyscrapers, a large shopping mall, a train station and a cinema. 'If this tower is destroyed in one way or another, an unprecedented crisis will occur for the enemy, similar to the crisis of the World Trade Center towers in New York,' the document noted, though Hamas had not yet devised a method to achieve this. 'Working to find a mechanism to destroy the tower.' Last week, Israeli prosecutors charged several residents of the central Israeli town of Taibeh with plotting to attack the Azrieli Towers and bring about its collapse. A more practical target, according to the documents, was Israel’s railway system. Hamas outlined various scenarios for using trains to transport fighters and powerful explosives. 'The railway line is designated for transporting fuel, which is a weak point in the event of a train explosion after moving inside one of the cities (a moving bomb),' the document read. Explosive-laden boats and chariots Other documents showed Hamas planned to modify vehicles to travel on rails and convert fishing vessels into fast-attack boats capable of carrying fighters and explosives to infiltrate Israeli ports. Regarding the boat-bombing plan, the documents state that Hamas had 'found a working mechanism.' One of the most unconventional proposals outlined in the documents involved using horse-drawn chariots, reminiscent of ancient times, as a 'modern' transport method for terrorists and weapons. The presentation included photos and descriptions of a chariot that could carry three people, traverse rough terrain with ease and operate more quietly than a motorcycle while emitting less heat. Meanwhile, a New York Times report revealed minutes from ten meetings held by Sinwar with the Hamas’ high command. The meeting summaries, found on a computer in Khan Younis and obtained by the Times, provided new insight into Hamas' preparations for the October 7 attack, code-named 'The Big Project.' The report also highlighted Hamas' deception strategy, which emphasized maintaining silence, even during Ramadan, and instructed members not to join the fighting alongside Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The documents further revealed that Hamas aimed to launch its attack before Israel completed its laser weapon development and requested Iran to target sensitive sites with missile strikes during the first hour of the assault.

Vanished without a trace: Where is Iran’s Quds Force commander?	Tehran dismisses reports Esmail Qaani had a heart attack while under investigation as ‘fake news’; however, questions regarding Iranian general’s whereabouts linger for weeks The whereabouts of Iran's Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani remain unknown after two weeks of speculation. Rumors circulated that Qaani was killed in a Beirut airstrike, and later reports claimed he suffered a heart attack during interrogation over alleged links to Israel. Iran has dismissed these reports as 'fake news.' On Friday, Hezbollah-affiliated Al Mayadeen reported that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei plans to award Qaani an honor on Monday, following a similar award given to Iran's Air and Space Force commander for the ballistic missile attacks on Israel earlier this month. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told Al Mayadeen that rumors about Qaani are 'false' and that he is continuing his duties. Despite these reassurances, Qaani has not been seen publicly for two weeks, fueling speculation. Last Thursday, Sky News Arabia cited Iranian sources claiming Qaani was under investigation for an intelligence breach and suffered a heart attack during questioning. His chief of staff was reportedly under suspicion for links to Israel. Last week, senior Iranian security officials said Qaani went missing after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s Dahieh district targeting senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine. While Israeli officials have not confirmed Safieddine death, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a statement hinting at it. Sources told Reuters that Qaani was in Dahieh during the strike but did not meet with Safieddine at the time. Qaani was last seen publicly on Sunday of the previous week in Tehran alongside Safieddine's brother. The New York Times also reported on Qaani’s disappearance, saying that his trip to Beirut aimed to assist Hezbollah leaders after a series of Israeli strikes. According to a Revolutionary Guard member stationed in Beirut, Iran’s silence on Qaani has caused unease within the ranks of the Revolutionary Guard. The report further claimed Qaani had visited the Iraq-Syria-Lebanon corridor several times since October 7 and was supposed to attend a Hezbollah meeting targeted by an Israeli strike, but canceled last minute.

US deploys THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense to Israel amid ri...	Fearing Israeli strike, Tehran seeks support from Gulf states, some of which promise not to allow Israel to use their airspace; Iran warns Washington it would retaliate immediately The United States will immediately transfer the THAAD missile defense system to Israel to help intercept potential ballistic missile threats from Iran, Ynet learned on Saturday, as tensions escalate in the region. The move comes as Tehran anxiously braces for a possible Israeli retaliation following its recent missile strike on Israel, according to CNN. Iran has been engaging in urgent diplomatic efforts with regional countries to mitigate the scale of Israel’s expected response and possibly secure protection for the Iranian capital. Tehran’s heightened concern stems from uncertainty over the U.S.' ability to persuade Israel not to target critical Iranian nuclear or oil infrastructure. Washington has been in continuous discussions with Jerusalem since the Iranian strike, with U.S. officials urging Israel to avoid targeting strategic sites in Iran, particularly as the U.S. presidential election nears. President Joe Biden, in his first conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in weeks, called for a 'proportional' Israeli response. Meanwhile, U.S. allies in the Gulf, including Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, have assured both Iran and Washington that they will not permit Israel to use their airspace for strikes on Iran. While these nations wish to avoid involvement in the conflict, they recognize that an escalation could impact the entire region. Despite ongoing discussions, Israeli officials have yet to make a final decision on whether to strike Iran. Some U.S. officials have expressed concerns about Israel’s transparency, with reports suggesting Israel has not provided assurances that it will refrain from attacking Iranian nuclear or oil facilities. A response to the response Washington does not believe Iran seeks a full-scale war with Israel, despite Tehran’s recent missile strikes and the rhetoric from some officials. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in an interview with Al Jazeera this week that Netanyahu 'is the only one who wants a war and to set the region on fire to stay in power.' Despite such statements, a U.S. official said Washington is indirectly urging Iran to calibrate its response if Israel launches an attack on Iranian soil. Qatar has been playing a key role as a mediator between Iran and other parties throughout the ongoing conflict. However, the U.S. acknowledges uncertainty surrounding Iran’s next moves. 'We just do not know what [Iran] will do,' one U.S. official told CNN, noting that key voices in Tehran likely have differing opinions on whether and how to respond to any potential Israeli action. Another Biden administration official added that Iran’s reaction will 'depend on the scale and scope of the highly anticipated Israeli move.' Talks between the U.S. and Iran have continued regularly since Iran’s ballistic missile barrage on Israel. Gallant's threat Shortly after the call between Netanyahu, Biden and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that while Iran’s missile strike was 'aggressive but inaccurate,' Israel's response would be 'lethal, precise and above all, surprising. They won’t know what hit them, and they will see the results.' Gallant made the remarks while visiting the IDF’s Unit 9900, a visual intelligence unit under the Military Intelligence Directorate, which is actively involved in preparing for strikes in Lebanon and other theaters. Gallant received a briefing on recent and upcoming operations, saying, 'Thanks to you, we see the entire Middle East—Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq and any other place we want to focus on.' Ahead of his trip to the United States in the coming days, Gallant’s travel approval was contingent on two conditions set by Netanyahu, one of which was a conversation with Biden, following weeks of silence between the two leaders despite escalating tensions on Israel's northern front. This is seen as a sign of the strained relations between Netanyahu and Biden.

IDF tank commander killed in Gaza fighting hours before Yom Kippu...	Shortly before fast, army reports Staff Sgt. Ittai Fogel, 22, from Yakir, killed in combat along Philadelphi Corridor, weeks after losing cousin during operational activity in West Bank The IDF announced Friday afternoon, just before the start of Yom Kippur, that Staff Sgt. Ittai Fogel, 22, from the West Bank settlement of Yakir, was killed in combat along the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza. Fogel, a tank commander in the 401st Brigade's 46th Battalion, is believed to have been struck by an anti-tank missile. Fogel is survived by his parents and four younger siblings. His cousin Staff Sgt. Elkana Navon was also killed in action during an operation in Jenin in late August. At Navon's funeral, their grandfather, Avri Navon, who now faces the loss of a second grandson, recalled their last conversation: 'Before you entered Jenin, I managed to bless you. My heart aches that it was the last time we spoke. A grandfather burying his grandson, parents burying their son—it’s unbearable.' Fogel studied at Nehalim Yeshiva, was a youth leader in Yakir, a counselor in the Bnei Akiva youth movement and volunteered with Lehosheet Yad, a charity supporting and assisting children with cancer and those with complex disabilities. His death marks the second loss for the community of Yakir, following the death of Captain (res.) Gavriel Shani in combat in southern Gaza on January 30. Yakir Council Chairman Elhanan Shabati expressed the community’s grief: 'On the eve of Yom Kippur, our community has suffered its second loss in Israel's battle for survival. We are devastated and will continue to support the family.' Rabbi Aharon Cohen of Yakir added, 'Ittai was a true leader, filled with love for Israel, Torah and strength. His life's mission was to do good for the people of Israel and Torah.' Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan also paid tribute: 'The entire Samaria family mourns the loss of Ittai, one of the finest sons of this land. On the eve of Yom Kippur, we face a tremendous loss that is hard to fathom. Ittai was a man of values, dedicated and caring, always giving of himself.'

18 years after brother fell, he steps into Lebanon: 'I’m here to ...	On Rosh Hashanah eve, Dovi Rhein was called up for reserve duty on northern border and entered Lebanon, where his brother Maj. Benaya Rhein fell in 2006; 'I wish we didn’t have to do this, but Hezbollah has left us no choice' Maj. Benaya Rhein became one of the symbols of the Second Lebanon War, leading a force that heroically rescued dozens of wounded soldiers and earned a commendation for his bravery. Recently, his younger brother, Dovi Rhein, closed a personal circle he had waited 18 years for—entering Lebanon, the same land where his brother fell, determined to continue his mission. 'I wish we didn’t have to do this, but Hezbollah has left us no choice. We can’t leave things as they are,' Rhein said. On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, he was called to reserve duty with the Mobilization Unit of the Alexandroni Brigade and reported to the Lebanese border. 'I enlisted in Golani, knowing that one day I would step foot in Lebanon like Benaya did,' he said. 'On a personal level, this is closure. From the day my brother fell, I wanted to pick up where he left off because Hezbollah is still here. I was 17 when Benaya fell. Looking back, I realize the job wasn’t finished, and now we’re here again.' In a photo Rhein shared this week, he is smiling and visibly emotional. 'I waited 18 years for this moment,' he wrote. 'I always knew the day would come when I would finish what Benaya started.' Last October, Rhein spoke to Ynet after being deployed to defend Israel’s northern front. He and his comrades in the brigade have since spent over 200 days fighting in Gaza and on the Lebanese front. 'It wasn’t easy to return, but we’ve been waiting a year for this opportunity. The hostages aren’t home yet, and the northern residents have been displaced. Now we’re on the offensive to bring them back. It’s a good but tough feeling.' Last week, Rhein's brigade began its maneuver under the command of Col. Moshe Pesel, who was gravely injured in the battle for Kissufim in October 2023. Just months later, he was back leading the brigade in Gaza. 'We are in the midst of historic days in a battle for survival against the axis of evil,' Pesel told the soldiers before they crossed into Lebanon. In a radio communication message, Pesel explained: 'The cruel enemy thought it would face a weakened nation and army. Now it realizes we are a united front, like an unbreakable wall. We’ve taken the initiative and gone on the attack. Our mission is clear: return the northern residents to their homes safely. You are authorized to go on the offensive.' Back home in Neta, Rhein's wife and three children are waiting for him. His mother, Hagit, is also playing her part in the war effort, visiting mourning families to offer comfort and support, carrying the pain only bereaved families know. Dovi shared that he didn’t need his mother’s permission to go to war. 'I always tell her she raised me with these values, so she can’t say anything when I go out to fulfill them. When I was called up before the holiday, I stopped by my mom’s, gave her a hug and wished her Shanah Tova,' he recounted. 'She told me to do what was necessary to restore sanity, and that’s what I’m doing. When I got the call-up, I felt my stomach turn, but I know everyone has their reasons not to show up.

Nicaragua cuts diplomatic ties with Israel, citing 'genocide' and...	South American dictatorship breaks off ties with Jerusalem over actions against Palestinians; Mexico's Sheinbaum calls for recognition of Palestinian state to promote peace in Middle East Nicaragua announced on Friday that it has severed diplomatic relations with Israel, joining Belize, Bolivia and Colombia in protest of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories. Vice President Rosario Murillo said the decision was due to 'Israel's attacks on Palestinian territories,' accusing the Israeli government of being 'fascist' and committing 'genocide.' Murillo added that the Middle East conflict is 'expanding against Lebanon and severely threatening Syria, Yemen and Iran.' Earlier in the day, Nicaragua’s Congress approved a resolution to commemorate the anniversary of the Gaza war. Nicaragua, led by President Daniel Ortega, is a close ally of Iran. In recent years, the country has become increasingly isolated, as Ortega, often labeled a dictator, violently suppressed anti-government protests in 2018. According to human rights organizations, around 300 people were killed during those clashes. Meanwhile, Mexico’s newly inaugurated president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who is Jewish, called for the recognition of a Palestinian state to 'achieve peace in the Middle East.' She emphasized that 'a Palestinian state should be recognized, just as Israel is,' adding that 'war will never lead to a positive outcome.'

Herzliya sheltered housing facility hit by Hezbollah drone; IDF begins evacuating 23 more southern Lebanon communities; US announces expanded sanctions on Iran's oil industry following ballistic missile attack Over 100 rockets were launched from Lebanon throughout Yom Kippur, targeting towns in the Galilee, Acre, Safed, Haifa and the surrounding bay area, sending over a million Israelis to seek shelter. In addition, a drone from Syria exploded over the Golan Heights. On the eve of Yom Kippur, two drones penetrated Israeli airspace from central Lebanon, with one hitting a sheltered housing facility in Herzliya. Two more rockets were fired Saturday from northern Gaza, hitting Ashkelon. Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon killed 22 people on Friday, and the IDF began evacuating 23 additional communities in southern Lebanon. Two UNIFIL peacekeepers were injured by Israeli fire, sparking international condemnation, with global leaders calling it a 'serious violation by Israel.' U.S. President Joe Biden urged Israel to cease actions that harm UN personnel. In separate incidents, two Lebanese soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pressed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to shift from military operations in Lebanon to a diplomatic path. Meanwhile, fighting continues in northern Gaza, where dozens were killed in Jabaliya. The IDF has called on residents of neighboring Gaza City to evacuate their homes. The U.S. announced expanded sanctions on Iran's oil industry following the Islamic Republic's ballistic missile strike on Israel at the beginning of the month. Reports suggest Iran is 'extremely concerned' about Israel's potential response. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated her stance, saying, 'I will never allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.' Iran announced on Saturday that the body of the Quds Force commander for Lebanon and Syria, Abbas Nilforoushan, who was killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's Dahieh district, was found. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized Israeli strikes on Damascus, calling for intervention from Russia, Syria and Iran. French President Emmanuel Macron repeated his call for halting arms exports to Israel, saying, 'It's the only way to end this.' Nicaragua has cut diplomatic ties with Israel, accusing it of running a 'fascist government committing genocide.' Meanwhile, Mexico's president urged recognition of a Palestinian state, saying it is the path to peace in the Middle East. In other news, a resident of East Jerusalem was shot dead in a suspected murder. The U.S. military confirmed a series of strikes targeting Islamic State sites in Syria.

Hezbollah appoints new leadership to fight war, report, terror gr...	just 72 hours after the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah a new command was constructed to run the war, sources said adding Hezbollah forces fighting IDF in the South take orders from new commanders, precision missiles kept for later use against Israel Hezbollah appointed a new military command in preparation for a long war of attrition in South Lebanon 72 hours after Israel wiped out its top leadership, Reuters reported on Friday citing two sources familiar with its operations. Hezbollah denied the report. According to the report, the Iran-backed group still has a considerable stockpile of weapons, including its most powerful precision missiles which it has yet to use, four sources familiar with its operations said, despite waves of airstrikes that Israel says has severely depleted its arsenal. The new command center has kept functioning despite subsequent Israeli attacks, meaning fighters in the south were able to fire rockets and fight according to centrally issued orders, according to the sources, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters. A third source, a senior official close to Hezbollah, said the group was now waging a war of attrition. Another source familiar with Hezbollah's operations said the group's dedicated, fixed-line phone network was 'essential' to current communications. Sources have said the network survived attacks on the group's communications in September. Tunnel warfare Hezbollah possesses an extensive tunnel network in southern Lebanon, constructed for the fighting force against Israeli troops and is estimated to be hundreds of kilometers long. The Hezbollah field commander told the news agency that the tunnels 'are the foundation of the battle'. Hezbollah had toiled for years to build them, he added. 'Their time has come,' he said adding that the tunnels found and destroyed by the IDF were built for the Radwan special forces units to one day enter the Galilee region of northern Israel. The source said Israel did not know the full extent of the tunnels. The source close to Hezbollah said the tunnels detected by Israel were built for its Radwan special forces units to one day enter the Galilee region of northern Israel. The source said Israel did not know the full extent of the tunnels. Hezbollah says it has stepped up fire in recent days but some Israelis wonder why they launch hundreds and not thousands of rockets and missiles at Israel including their arsenal of power precision missiles. Israeli officials said it indicates the Iran-backed group's difficulty after the devastating blows inflicted on it. Prior to the latest conflict, the World Factbook of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said Hezbollah possessed upwards of 150,000 missiles and rockets. The two sources said Hezbollah had chosen not to use its most potent rockets - including precision-guided missiles - to keep something in reserve for a long war and to avoid giving Israel a pretext to widen its strikes to Lebanese infrastructure, such as Beirut airport, roads and bridges. The third source said the group had not targeted Israel's cities, such as Tel Aviv, with its most powerful weapons because such a move would give Israel a reason to hit Lebanon even harder. Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar visited the troops operating in South Lebanon on Thursday. 'We are fighting not just to bring security to the north now but also with a look toward the future,' Halevi said. 'If someone tries to rebuild these villages, he may consider it wrong to build terror infrastructure that would only be destroyed by the IDF.' Bar said Israel cannot defend its citizens by building shelters and must fight where the terrorists are. 'In a peaceful border, you guard your side of the frontier. Where there is war, you operate on both sides,' he said. 'We've observed Hamas entrenching in Lebanon and they will grow in number when terrorists leave Gaza. We will keep hunting them wherever they are,' he said.

Suspects plotting to bring down Tel Aviv towers aimed to cause pi...	The prosecution indicts five members of the cell after they swear allegiance to Islamic State, learn how to make a car bomb and where it would cause most damage when parked bellow Azrieli towers Israel's prosecution indicted five Israeli men from the Arab city of Taibeh charged with plotting to blow up iconic Tel Aviv towers with a car bomb, in an ISIS-inspired attack. According to the charges, Sajed Masarwa, 27, Abdullah Baransi, 26, Abed al-Karim Baransi, 27, and plot leaders Mahmoud Azzam, 24 and Ibrahim Sheikh Youssef,34, joined the Islamic State and carried out actions in its name and spirit, since the war broke out last October. They watched ISIS posts on social media, expressed their support for the terror group and its ideology and some swore their alliance to it. Among the posts they watched content explaining how to make explosive devices and material. Ibrahim Sheikh Youssef decided to carry out a terror attack in the name of ISIS and said he would blow up the Azrieli towers after National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said that a synagogue should be built on Temple Mount, Islam's third holiest site. Some of the accused had conversations and meetings with ISIS supporters outside Israel and spoke of their shared intent to carry out a shooting attack against Israeli citizens. They even discussed the best way to die as a martyr. In June 2024, Sheikh Youssef decided to form a military-style squad that would carry out attacks in Israel, hiding it under the guise of a Muslim religious study group. According to the charges, two of the accused decided that a car bomb would be the best way to attack the Tel Aviv towers. They watched an ISIS video clip and other videos explaining how to make the explosive devices and discussed the amount needed to successfully destroy the towers. They also discussed where the car bomb should be parked in the underground parking garage so that the blast and the temperature it would cause, would melt the pillars and bring the towers down, thereby increasing the damage caused in the attack. Two of the accused said they would film themselves claiming responsibility for the attack in the name of ISIS to prevent other terror organizations from claiming credit. They also planned to acquire weapons and open fire on passers-by by after the car bomb exploded. In a separate conversation, Mahmoud Azzam and Ibrahim Sheikh Youssef discussed the need to build an explosive device containing 150 to 200 kilograms (330 to 440 lbs.) of explosive material including hydrogen peroxide to create the largest and most effective explosion. Sheikh Youssef said he would bring cooking gas canisters as well and was able to obtain the needed amounts of explosives. In the indictment, the prosecution asks to remand the suspects to custody for the duration of legal proceedings. It writes the five men, who are Israeli citizens, hold an extreme religious ideology of an especially cruel and murderous terror group and have taken action toward achieving the aims of ISIS, whether by joining the fight in different areas, acquiring means or planning violent actions against citizens of Israel. Allah Talawi, a defense attorney for Karim Baransi said the indictment shows the men had a wish or a dream and not a realistic plan.

Iran threatens regional neighbors not to assist Israel, or come u...	Tehran uses secret diplomatic channels to warn Jordan, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar among others that they would themselves come under attack if they allow Israel to use their airspace to strike Iran; US official confirms Pentagon informed of concerns Iran threatened Arab nations that if they assist Israel in its retaliatory attack on Iranian targets, they would be punished, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Arab officials told the Journal that Tehran used discreet diplomatic channels to warn Gulf states and other regional American allies that it would strike them if they help Israel. The officials said the countries that were threatened by Iran include Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, all of which host U.S. troops. According to the report, those countries informed the Biden administration that they 'don’t want their military infrastructure or airspace to be used by the U.S. or Israel for any offensive operations against Iran, the officials said.' They told the newspaper that following the Iranian threats, they worry that their oil installations might be targeted adding that American troops and bases may also be in danger. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi visited Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states including Qatar for talks on Wednesday. 'Iran made it clear that any action by a Persian Gulf country against Tehran, whether through the use of airspace or military bases, will be regarded by Tehran as an action taken by the entire group, and Tehran will respond accordingly,' A senior Iranian official told Reuters earlier. 'The message emphasized the need for regional unity against Israel and the importance of securing stability,' he said. 'It also made clear that any assistance to Israel, such as allowing the use of a regional country’s airspace for actions against Iran, is unacceptable.' In expectation of a pending Israeli attack in retaliation for Iran's ballistic missile strike earlier this month, American security officials admitted some of the regional U.S. allies told the Pentagon that they do not want IDF fighter jets to use their airspace to attack Iran, or that the Americans use their territory or airspace in case of an attack. The allies said the U.S. forces have the right to take defensive action. Since the start of the war in Gaza a year ago, Arab nations have limited the action that the Americans could take from their territories, fearing a regional conflict.

Inside the village where thousands of Radwan fighters prepared to...	In an open Humvee through southern Lebanon, every anti-tank missile or mortar leaves little chance of survival; yet, since the war began, the IDF has cleared out thousands of terrorists, uncovering vast weapon stockpiles; Lebanon now faces a Gaza-like reality Almost two weeks into the IDF's ground incursion into southern Lebanon, I accompanied the forces into the Shiite villages on Thursday. Looking left out of the Hummer, I see the nearby Lebanese village. My first thoughts are that from such a distance, one mortar or anti-tank missile, and my chances of surviving are slim. We’re still traveling along the Israeli side of the border along a rickety road, once used for patrols. A thin fence, full of sensors, separates us from Lebanese territory, and I’m thinking about Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, which this fence was supposed to delay, or at least warn us about, minutes before reaching the nearby Israeli community. I can’t detail the location or the village we’re going to as Hezbollah reads, watches and listens to everything published by Israeli media, and an explosive-laden drone may well find its way here tomorrow. It’s no longer theoretical. This is reality, but it’s going to change. While traveling, we see the houses at the front of the village, out of which short-range rockets and anti-tank missiles have been launched over the past year. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) hit them very well indeed. The IDF breaks through the border fence, and we start bouncing along a path that had been used by Lebanese farmers tending the terrace orchards. The old and familiar scent of Lebanon at the summer’s end kicks in: sage, thorns, yellow grass and a lot of burning. Over the past year, no Israeli has set foot here on our side of the border, less still on the Lebanese side. These villages served as Hezbollah’s firing bases. But no more. We’re driving along here in open Hummers because the 91st Division has pushed Hezbollah’s anti-tank missiles back a few ridges north and west of here. Even if they were to put their mind to it, they couldn’t target us directly as they could have done up to only a few days ago. The 91st Division, however, is still fighting in the villages near the border, and cleansing one house after the other. Every now and then, you hear an explosion, followed by a long round of gunfire, followed by silence. The ambushes set up by the IDF along the border fence lead us, out of Hezbollah’s line of vision, to a bone-racking windy route straight into the village. To our left, a reserve duty unit takes cover in a half-ruined house. To our right, there’s an excavator with a huge arm breaking the walls of a rather stubborn house built of concrete, natural rocks and hard dolomite, the most plentiful rock around here: The 'Dahieh doctrine' in action. Thousands of Radwan fighters awaited the order to storm into Israel A Radwan Force numbering 4,000–6,000 men was supposed to include six brigades and 16 battalions intending to invade Israel all at once along six routes. The plan was for Radwan operatives to live in the villages and dug-out compounds in the tangled terrain, waiting for the day the order would be given. They would then come out of the villages and the thicket and, under the cover of rocket and artillery fire, break through the fence and storm Israeli civilian communities and IDF outposts. The plan was for the Radwan force and Hezbollah men to ordinarily walk around unarmed, as innocent villagers, and then, when the order was given, descend to the subterranean bunkers in the thicket on the village outskirts, come out with the equipment and charge toward Israel. The equipment prepared for that day includes vests, AK-47s, helmets and explosives to break through fences and smash walls. Radwan Forces would cross the Israeli border following fire from forces stationed on the front line by the Israeli border covering them. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was so sure he could implement the element of surprise that he didn’t even bother concealing the plan’s outline. Brig. Gen. Shai Kleper, 91st Division commander, whom we accompanied for our tour in southern Lebanon, shows us an arsenal prepared for the day the order is given. 'This storehouse serves Hezbollah and Radwan attack forces who come here and equip themselves,' he says. 'Here, you can see hundreds of vests packed full of cartridges alongside sniper rifles, AK-47s and machine guns. Here, at the side, there are mortars, here landmine explosives and here you see bags of RPDs, Dragunovs, Steyrs and hand grenades. It means that an operative leaves Bekaa in jeans and sandals, gets here, gets his combat equipment, a map, the plan he’s already prepared for, and with it knows how to get in. That’s this line. The next line is where Hezbollah deployed rocket launchers aimed toward Israeli territory. They’re deployed here, in apparently civilian orchards; this, apparently civilian, village is, in fact, a military village used as a springboard into the territory of the State of Israel.' Thursday evening, the IDF revealed some details regarding the weapons found so far by the 91st Division in southern Lebanon, which we accompanied, that raided various areas, destroyed Hezbollah terror infrastructure and weapons and conducted face-to-face battles with terrorists. 'The 3rd Brigade’s combat team found 800 military vests and hundreds of weapons including grenades, explosive devices and AK-47s,' the army said. 'The 8th Brigade combat team found crates of weapons in civilian homes, including magazines and long-range Kornet anti-tank missile launchers aimed at the communities in the Galilee and the surrounding area and dozens of ready-for-launch missiles.' We have to be honest: Had Nasrallah implemented his plan on October 8, 2023, the day following the Hamas attack, it would have likely been a catastrophe. But the IDF reservists rushed here, some without even being called up, positioned themselves here to defend the border. Now, those same reserve duty units, the 228th Brigade, ex-Nahal men, the 769th Brigade and ex-Golani men, along with further brigades are here for defensive (offensive?) purposes. This Sunday, these same brigades crossed into southern Lebanon on foot via crossings, pathways, and unanticipated routes. Before entering the villages, however, the 91st Division elite vanguard at the front, commanded by Brig. Gen. Kleper, seized controlling ridges miles away to neutralize the anti-tank missile threat. Hezbollah was relying on these missiles and, in his last speech, Nasrallah even mocked IDF forces, inviting them to come in to taste Hezbollah’s missiles. But the Northern Command, with very few exceptions, has surprisingly dismissed Hezbollah’s ability to make use of its key weapons. Simply because the IAF has preemptively taken out anti-tank missile launchers and anti-tank fire positions, with frontline ground forces quickly taking control of them. The main forces then entered the villages accompanied by tanks. Hezbollah homes packed with weapons and ammunition We walk among the houses. Here and there, we hear forces cleanse a house. Thursday afternoon, the day before the eve of Yom Kippur, there were no altercations. None of our forces were hurt, and most of the explosions were those of houses blown up by the IDF, in which Hezbollah and Radwan forces operatives were staying. We’re now in the village. Bint Jbeil is not far from here. The little mountain village that had turned into a large, flourishing community, has mostly been reduced to ruins. During the War of Attrition in the 1970s and the Second Lebanon War a decade later, when I was here, the enemy were Palestinian terrorists, most of whom fled after the first round of gunfire, or surrendered to our forces without a fight. This time, the enemy’s different. 'Yesterday, we had an altercation,' says 29-year-old Alaa from Usfiya, who has served over 300 days in reserve duty since October 7. 'We got close to here, and they suddenly started shooting at us from all directions. At first, we thought it was friendly fire, but we soon realized that terrorists were firing at us from those two houses,' he added, pointing at a burned-out house with walls perforated by bullet holes and another house with a few destroyed walls beside it. 'In addition to shooting at us, they also used explosive devices, but we didn’t fall into the trap. We had eight wounded, not seriously, and we managed to kill the terrorists who ambushed us from the houses.' Alaa says that serving for so long in reserve duty isn’t hard for him. 'We haven’t had so many altercations. They’re like mice, trying to run away underground, attacking us with all kinds of devices, but we’re crushing them,' he says. Shalev, 22, from Ashkelon has also been serving on the northern border for many months. 'We’ve been here both for defense and offense. The offensive part feels much more important. We’re destroying the enemy' he says. Hezbollah is still in these little villages, intermittently taking the IDF by surprise. The extensive experience garnered during the fighting in Gaza plays a crucial role. The work put in by the Northern Command, the IAF and special forces who operated here covertly before the ground operation, made their message clear: Most of the Radwan Force was pushed north, some even beyond the Litani River. This likely explains the relatively meager resistance and the rather low number of casualties, that were not severe, suffered by the four divisions dealing with these villages. Even before the ground operation in southern Lebanon, the IDF worked extensively to prepare the area. 'We peeled Hezbollah and cooked it very slowly in a pot, here in this area, from Dahieh all the way to Bekaa,' says IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. 'We gradually eliminated the commanders of the main units. We peeled away their capabilities. Thousands of terrorists who should have been here now, have been repelled, killed.' Hagari says, that now, that we’re 'after a strong aerial campaign and have assassinated the senior command, we’re comprehensively dismantling the infrastructure and weapons that Hezbollah had prepared here to conquer the Galilee.' 'Even, as you stand here now, the threat is still present,' he says. 'There’s the threat of mortars and anti-tank missiles. We’re not in a sterile environment. Terrorists are lurking here too. We’re cleansing. It’s not sterile – but this isn’t what should have been here. 'The element of surprise afflicted on the enemy stems from an orderly process conducted by the Northern Command and the IDF over the past year: An orderly and systematic degradation of Hezbollah’s command capabilities, repelling the enemy far away from here, eliminating important cells, while working on Hezbollah’s strategic capabilities and going in with a ground operation after training, at a time that the enemy is in an inferior state. This is the operation that was built and this is what we’re doing. 'We’re going house to house finding piles of Radwan Forces’ personal equipment, or cannons pointing at Israel lying around the yard. We see flimsy electric wires leading from the houses to rocket launchers with mortar barrels positioned on the edges of the orchards, and obviously, above all, dozens of Kornet anti-tank missiles, as well as older models.' Only when you see this vast arsenal and notice the up-to-date night vision equipment lying in the corner of the room do you realize that there was an army here – a terrorist army ready to charge at our communities. I prefer not to think about what would have happened if the IDF, primarily the reservists, hadn’t rushed to position themselves on the defense lines in such a way that made Nasrallah and his field commanders not want to try us. Now, Lebanon is living the Gaza experience. 'How long have you been on reserve duty?' I ask Lt. Avi Goldberg from Jerusalem. 'Three hundred days, I think. Maybe more,' he says without batting an eye. 'We’ll be here and do the work for as long as it takes. We have to bring the residents of the north back to their homes.' I try testing him saying, 'I’m hearing that cliché over and over. Do you really mean it?' This provocation doesn’t even make him blink. 'No. That’s what I, and everyone you see here around you, thinks exactly. It’s not a cliché. It’s reality. This is what we’re supposed to do and this is what we’ll do and we won’t leave here until we’ve done it,' he asserts. I’m not giving up. I go up to one of the soldiers and ask him the same question. Believe it or not, I get the exact same answer, word for word, despite this reservist being a father of four nearing 40. Yaniv Berliner, a reservist living on Kibbutz Or Haner near the Gaza border, has served a whole year in the reserves. 'Only a few days ago, a year passed since that horrific day. I have friends, acquaintances and relatives still in captivity. I hope that what we’re doing here will help bring them back home as quickly as possible,' he says. 'We’re doing everything we can, and we’ll serve as long as we need, to genuinely restore security to the country and its borders. There are reservists here risking their lives day and night, 24/7. I hope that everything we’re doing here will be worth it.' For now, it seems to be working, and it looks like without cleansing this strip of the vast quantity of weapons, the infrastructure for launching attacks into Israel and the arsenals above and below ground, no one living on the northern border will be going back home. Moreover, the State of Israel won’t be able to let them back before totally cleansing the sector - not only due to the absent sense of security – but also due to security itself.

1 murdered in missile fire on the Galilee	Foreign worker struck by anti-tank missile, two others hurt; IDF says it killed the Hezbollah commander responsible for anti-tank missile fire on Israel in a strike on South Lebanon; rockets hit Haifa suburb industrial zone earlier One man was murdered on Friday in a missile attack on the Upper Galilee. He was a foreign worker who was driving a tractor when the anti-tank missile hit. At least two others were injured in the attack. The IDF shot down two attack drones the entered Israeli air space from Lebanon. Hezbollah rockets continued to target the Galilee throughout the morning. The military said its jets killed Hezbollah's commander of the anti-tank missile force in South Lebanon. The strike came after forces operating on the ground directed the jets to where terrorists were in battle with them. A Hezbollah-affiliated news site said the IDF once again fired at a UNIFIL position in South Lebanon after condemnations of Israel in the United Nations on Thursday following previous incidents of fire. Two members of the peacekeeping force were reported to be lightly hurt. The Al Akhbar newspaper reported that Israel hoped to remove UNIFIL from South Lebanon and replace the peacekeepers with an alternative international force. According to the report, there is an American initiative to bring major alterations to UN resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War and to the deployment of international forces on Lebanon's borders with Israel and Syria. In an earlier rocket strike on the coastal areas in the north including the city of Acre and the northern suburbs of Haifa, some 25 projectiles were fired, one landing in an industrial zone in Kiryat Bialik, causing damage but no injuries. The military said it had also shot down an attack drone targeting Ashkelon in the early morning. Sirens warned of the attack in the city and its surrounding areas but no damage or injury were reported.

Amid concerns of terror attacks security forces on alert on major roads, city centers and around the Western Wall with special attention given to mixed Jewish-Arab cities; a dedicated phone app alerts observant Jews of rocket threat Synagogues in major cities and susceptible areas will be under armed guard on Yom Kippur amid concerns that terrorists will try to launch attacks on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Police deployment was already spread to major highways and city centers with special attention placed on mixed Jewish and Arab cities where tensions have traditionally been high during the holiday. Synagogues were asked to place an armed guard outside their door and leave a phone available to call for help if the need arises. Jerusalem police will be on high alert around the city and at the Western Wall, to bolster the sense of security for Jewish worshipers. Checkpoints will also be set up leading to the holy site for increased security and to prevent overcrowding. Access ahead of Yom Kippur will only be allowed to public transportation and the police will stop cars from the predominately Arab eastern sectors of the capital, from entering the western quarters. Access will only be allowed for humanitarian reasons. Observant Jews will be able to receive rocket alerts on a dedicated app on their phones and on dedicated radio channels. Security officials said Iran would attempt to ignite violence in and from the West Bank. They said that there are currently 60 specific threats of terror attacks, mostly originating from the West Bank.

Report details damage from over 1,600 rocket to northern Israel	over 103 incidents of direct hits and collateral property damage have been reported since the start of the war on October 7, , 61 incidents of damage to private and public infrastructure and property; Kiryat Shmona hit hardest The Defense Ministry's Northern Horizon Directorate published on Thursday a detailed report covering the damages done to areas in northern Israel amid Hezbollah's increasing fire toward the country and the IDF's entry into Lebanon. The ministerial body coordinates the activities of various ministry bodies and collaborates with other government agencies near the Lebanese border, covering 124 towns, cities, and regional councils located up to nine kilometers (5.5 miles) from the border. According to the directorate, over 103 incidents of direct hits and collateral property damage have been reported since the start of the war on October 7. In the 10 days preceding the IDF's ground operation, 61 incidents of damage to private and public infrastructure and property were reported. The data collected so far shows approximately 1,645 reports of damage, affecting private homes, apartment buildings, public facilities, businesses, agriculture, and more. Of these, 54% of the damage caused by Hezbollah's attacks targeted private residences, 11% impacted public buildings, 4% hit chicken coops or cowsheds, 3% affected infrastructure, 2% struck agricultural land, pastures or orchards and 2% damaged businesses. Another 19% have yet to be classified due to difficulties in accessing the impact area and risks to professional personnel. In terms of the source of the damage, 79% of the incidents were caused by Hezbollah fire while 21% resulted from IDF activity, mainly during the early stages of the war when large numbers of forces reached the front lines before the military established more organized control over the area. Brigadier General (Res.) David Suissa, head of the Defense Ministry's Rehabilitation Department, explained the data collection method treats each damage report as a single case, without adding the total number of affected assets. For example, an attack on a residential building that damages five apartments and five vehicles would be recorded as one incident. A minor event is defined as one where the damage can be locally repaired, while major incidents involve buildings that were either heavily damaged or are beyond repair. When dividing the incidents by local councils, municipalities and cities in the northern region, Kiryat Shemona experienced the highest number of incidents, with 218 reports of damage. Most of the damage, 117 cases, was classified as minor. At least 14 damage sites were identified in the city in the rocket barrages that took place on Wednesday alone. Kibbutz Manara sustained the highest number of severe impacts, with nine out of 73 incidents classified as very serious. Shetula in the Western Galilee saw 68 reports, 19 of which were considered severe.

US still believes Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon,...	The intelligence assessment could help explain U.S. opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for an Iranian ballistic missile attack on Israel The United States still believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's recent strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two U.S. officials told Reuters. The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran's leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program. 'We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003,' said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The intelligence assessment could help explain U.S. opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week. U.S. President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program might only delay the country's efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran's resolve to do so. 'We're all watching this space very carefully,' the Biden administration official said. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program. Key Iran ally weakened In the past weeks, Israel's military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group's setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month. The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself. Beth Sanner, a former U.S deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is 'higher now than it has been' and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon. That would still take time, however. 'They can't get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months,' said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund. Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to 90% weapons-grade, at two sites, and in theory, it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. watchdog. The expansion in Iran's enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to 'a week or a little more,' according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president. Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate. Possible Israeli attack Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran's attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the U.S. military. The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran's energy infrastructure. Israel, however, views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat. The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel. Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, saying: 'That's the thing you wanna hit, right?' Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead. 'The Iranians have to recalculate what's next. I don't think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity,' he said. 'They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in.'

Satellite images show destruction of two S. Lebanese towns	New report releases photos showing Yaroun and Maroun al-Ras following a year into war against Hezbollah on the northern border The New York Times on Thursday published an article describing the destruction of two towns in southern Lebanon — Yaroun and Maroun al-Ras — via satellite imagery said to be confirmed by the American outlet. The footage shows massive destruction in villages that were heavily bombed and attacked for over 11 months of war even before the IDF’s ground operation in southern Lebanon. Satellite images provided by Planet Labs reveal tank tracks from the Israeli side of the border leading to Yaroun. IDF positions can be seen where the military prepared positions for tanks and other military vehicles. The paper reminded readers that Hezbollah joined the war initiated by Hamas on October 8, one day after the massacre on the Israeli-Gaza border and began launching rockets at Israel, which led to IDF bombings and airstrikes, forcing tens of thousands of residents to evacuate their homes on both sides of the border. Israel said that the goal of the ground operation was to destroy Hezbollah's military infrastructure deeply embedded in border villages to allow northern residents to return to their homes safely. The images from southern Lebanon, according to the Times, show IDF forces patrolling the streets of the villages and towns, setting up positions near homes and buildings. Lebanese officials told were quoted in the article saying that the residents of the two villages had abandoned them before IDF forces entered the area. An analysis of the images and footage reveals similar levels of destruction in Maroun al-Ras, including additional buildings that were recently flattened, with IDF military vehicles visible in the area. Another video featured in the extensive report shows what appears to be the controlled demolition of a mosque in Yaroun. 'This is the main mosque where daily prayers are held, and where religious holidays and occasions are celebrated,' the local mayor said.

Luxury villa once owned by Goebbels given away for free—but there...	Lakeside villa near Berlin, once used by Nazi chief propagandist for hosting Reich leaders and secret affairs, now at center of controversy; Germany plans to give it away for free, fearing far-right groups might turn it into shrine Wandlitz is a village in the state of Brandenburg, Germany, consisting of 25,000 inhabitants, and the kind of place that tourist guides would definitely call 'picturesque'. A half an hour's drive of just 22 miles north of Berlin, and you reach this marvelous place: green forests, pastoral silence and peaceful bike paths. 'Most people who live here were raised here and came back after they were through with education and career, wishing to grow old here; those who stayed in the East following German reunification, were either families who worked in Berlin but wanted a bit of quiet, or wealthy Berliners who needed a quiet place for the weekend or the summer,' says Catherine Brozovsky, owner of a real estate agency located on the main street of the village. These are exactly the reasons why Wandlitz has a dark past. Not far from here, for example, is the villa of Hermann Goering, one of the Nazi Party leaders, and nearby is the hunting lodge and bunker of Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany and the prime organizer of the building of the infamous Berlin Wall. But this is not why Wandlitz has made headlines in recent months. To find the reason one should drive for ten minutes, down the road that leads to the village, beside the Bogensee Lake. All of a sudden you will see an abandoned bus station, all covered in stickers and Nazi inscriptions in Gothic letters. Then you will encounter a large garage, where there used to be a fleet of black luxury cars, decorated with swastika flags, some of which were convertibles, so that he could wave to the crowds at the mass gatherings he organized. Right after, there is a building where his bodyguards were housed. And then it shows: a spacious villa, the finest architecture of the 1930s, extending over 17,000 sq ft. on one elongated level; walls that were once white, a tiled roof, and an entrance above which the inscription 'Bogensee', the German name of the nearby lake, is displayed. This is the summer Villa of Josef Goebbels, the Propaganda Minister of the Third Reich and one of Hitler's closest associates. Goebbels received the land as a gift from the state of Berlin in 1936, he had the villa built in 1939 and used it as a retreat for his personal needs. In 1943, after his home in Berlin was bombed by the Allied forces, he moved to live there with his wife Magda and their six children. They decided to move back to Berlin to Hitler's bunker in the final phase of the war. After Hitler and his new wife Eva Braun committed suicide, Goebbels managed to serve as Chancellor for one day. Then he and Magda poisoned their six children and committed suicide as well. Meanwhile, the villa moved from one dictatorship to another. The Soviets, who controlled the territory of Wandlitz after the war, built there four huge buildings on a total area of about 40 acres. The massive complex was used as an education center, dormitories and cultural center for East German youth, so they could learn the principles of communism. Since then, the Soviet dictatorship has also collapsed, and in the meantime, all the buildings - one Nazi villa and four Stalinist concrete monsters - have stood as monuments during almost six decades of totalitarian regimes. The ownership of the site returned to the state of Berlin. However, the city found no use for it. In the last 25 years, the entire complex has been abandoned and neglected. In the meantime, nature is taking its own course: the beech trees grow wild, the walls are overgrown with nettles, mold and rot. The roof was leaking and had to be replaced at a cost of four million euros. Everything is crumbling, and the maintenance and upkeep costs have been borne by the public. Last May, Berlin's new state finance minister, Stefan Evers, has had enough. Every year the state spends about a quarter of a million euros for the maintenance and security of the complex, mainly because it attracts groups of neo-Nazis. 'I offer to anyone who would like to take over the site, to take it over as a gift from the state of Berlin,' stated the minister. 'If we fail again, as in the past decades, Berlin has no other option but to carry out the demolition that we have already prepared for,' he added. Then the mess started. 30 rooms, 40 study rooms and one cinema hall It is seemingly a simple deal, offering a huge area of about 170 acres, isolated, in the middle of a green lung of trees and water, half an hour's drive from Berlin, and all for free. It should have been a gem for real estate agents. But the German authorities themselves don't really know what the purpose of this complex should be. There are those who claim that it should be obliterated, to completely erase the past, and construct a new project instead; in contrast, there are those who are convinced that this is a historical site that must be preserved. But if so, then why give it to an entrepreneur? After all, a museum is not profitable, and besides, the renovation of the place will cost millions. Above all, there is fear that the place could attract German far-right extremists, turning it into a pilgrimage site and a shrine, worshipping Goebbels. 'The history of the place is precisely the reason why Berlin would never hand this building over to private hands where there would be a risk that it could be misused,' Minister Evers warned when he announced the ultimatum. This fear is not unfounded. Berlin tried to sell the land in the past. 'The only serious inquiries were from a Russian oligarch, who wanted to establish a private education center but could not prove to the Germans the source of his money,' says Claudia Schmid-Rathjen, a Wandlitz-based historian. 'An earlier inquiry, from an extreme-right group called the Reichsbürger movement, seemed to embody the authorities’ worst fears. The group denies the legitimacy of the current German state; some of its members are on trial for a plot to overthrow the government. In Berlin, they don't know whether to repurpose or bulldoze the site to save maintenance costs. In contrast, there are historians and academics who oppose demolishing the buildings that hold German history. No one can agree what to do with a villa so tainted that no one is willing to buy, or even get for free.' But to understand how much this piece of land is charged with emotions and history, one should go back more than a century. Originally, this area belonged to a rich Jew named Friedland, from whom in 1913 the state of Berlin purchased the land. Schmid-Rathjen explains that there were two reasons involved, marking a vision of a hundred years ahead: the industrialized Berlin needed a green belt around it; Berlin's population growth will be such that it will have to find housing solutions outside the city.' But Germany sank into World War I, followed by hyperinflation and political instability. Then the Nazis rose to power. Goebbels was a high-ranking official in the Reich and played a major role in spreading Nazi propaganda using cultural and media platforms within Germany. The state of Berlin was very impressed by his achievements and decided in 1936 to gift him the estate by the lake Bogensee. There Goebbels decided to build his dream villa. When he was not in his apartment in Berlin with his new wife Magda (the two were married in 1931), Goebbels lived in a log cabin in the compound, where he spent time with his mistress, Czech actress Lída Baarová. Two years later, Magda found out about the affair and turned to Hitler demanding to divorce Goebbels. Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship with the actress and threatened Baarová using the Gestapo. It worked, but later Goebbels had several affairs, and so did Magda. Goebbels was very much involved in the construction of his villa. As he wanted to overshadow the villa of his neighbor Goering, Goebbels built a house with 30 rooms and 40 study rooms, clever day-room windows that fold away into the floor at the push of a button, 60 telephones, a cinema hall with 525 padded seats with preparation for headphones, wooden ceiling decorations and other architectural avant-garde and technological luxury that were popular at the time; of course, he also had a bunker. 'It's so comfortable here that you can think you're living in peacetime,' Goebbels said of the place in 1943. When completed, Goebbels used the villa to entertain Nazi leaders, artists and actors. But he would also work there. Today it is impossible to enter the villa, but I did manage to have a tour from the outside and peek inside through the boards blocking the windows to two rooms: one room with a large fireplace where Goebbels sat with Albert Schaefer in 1944 planning the renovation of German cities after the war. The second room, to the right, was Goebbels' study, overlooking the lake, where he wrote his diary and many of his speeches. Here, for example, Goebbels wrote the 'Total War' speech that he delivered in February 1943. 'The villa is not his at all. It was co-funded by the UFA film company', says Peter Longerich, a historian from Munich who wrote a biography of Goebbels. Goebbels loved abundance and luxury in his private life. He would use the villa mainly to entertain friends and Nazi elite leaders. They would come to advise him on the materials he reviewed on his weekly radio show, adds Longerich. But the luxurious life was about to end. In 1945, when it was already clear at the top of the Reich that Germany was going to lose the war, Goebbels and his neighbor chose two different paths. 'Göring ordered the killing of all the animals on his farm, so that there would be no food left for the Russians; he blew up his villa and then went to negotiate with the British,' says the historian Schmid-Rathjen. 'But Goebbels was an ideologist. He left the villa intact and went to Berlin, where he, his wife and their six children committed suicide in Hitler's bunker.' The villa was left intact and was used briefly as a military hospital. Very quickly it was nationalized by the East German Communist Party, becoming an education center for the party's youth organization. Here the young leaders of East Germany and the Communists in general were to be nurtured. In the mid-1950s, architect Hermann Henselmann, who designed the monstrous Karl Marx Avenue in Berlin, erected the four buildings of the school. When finished, the complex could host 800 young students from around the world, who were to get communist education there. 'I was a communist in West Germany and the organization sent me to study there between 1983-1984,' says Detlef Siegfried, Associate Professor of History at the University of Copenhagen, Department of Germanic Studies, who wrote a book about the compound. 'It was an amazing experience which involved studies, conversations, activities, parties and meetings with people from all over the world. I remember it as a very secluded place, in the middle of the forest. I was very surprised by how much East Germans admired Western brands like Coca-Cola, which we despised. We, Westerners, went there as revolutionists, we wanted to replace capitalism with socialism. The East Germans went there to learn how to organize frameworks.' Did you know anything about the villa there? 'We knew nothing about the villa and its history. Everyone I talked to from that time did not know either, although it was clear that it belonged to a different era. It was very strange in retrospect, because East Germans always pointed to the West as Nazis, and the villa could have been used as a propaganda tool for them, to show the difference. But they said nothing to us.' In the early 1990s, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, ownership of the site returned to the state of Berlin. In the four new buildings, dozens of listening devices are discovered, leading straight to the East German Ministry of the Interior. Various uses were made of the structures: Deutsche Bank settled in the complex; then there was a center for training social workers. The place was revived, a hotel and restaurants were opened. Nothing worked. The property was completely abandoned about 25 years ago, and since then it has only been crumbling and costing the German taxpayer money. Lots of money. Preserve or demolish? Real Estate agent Catherine Brozovsky estimates that currently, the value of the property is very low, at about 600 euros per square meter, because it is abandoned and neglected, with no infrastructure, no public transportation or internet. An investor who will renovate it, can receive a value that suites an estate by a lake, which is almost 8,000 euros per square meter. Even when disregarding the areas designated for conservation and afforestation purposes, the property's worth is estimated at hundreds of millions of euros.' Renovation and repurposing the property could also cost the future investor many millions of euros. Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association (EJA) has also issued an appeal to the state of Berlin with an interesting proposal to convert the mansion into a center for combatting antisemitism and hate propaganda, which are dangerous, causing even normal people to do terrible things. And who will finance it? 'Hopefully the government and organizations that deal with Holocaust commemoration and education against hate speech and antisemitism. We are busy trying to recruit Jewish donors to increase our chances vis-a-vis the state of Berlin.' This is not the first time that a Nazi site has been converted into a memorial site. Hitler's Austrian birthplace turned into a human rights training center after it became a pilgrimage site, used as a shrine for neo-Nazis. Also, the villa in Wannsee which hosted the famous conference where the 'Final Solution' was discussed, also became - after quite a few debates - one of the most famous and most visited memorials in Berlin. 'It's a big quandary for the Germans, whether to preserve or obliterate the edifices from Germany’s Nazi past and in this case also the communist regime, especially today when the extreme right in Germany is on the rise', says the historian Schmid-Rathjen. 'We need to think how many sites should be preserved, and how much we should be considerate of the municipalities' needs. Will the demolition mean the erasure of history, or are there other ways to remember the place? In Yad Vashem, there are no more victims, but they live on the internet. The truth and historical facts are already inscribed. So, I think it won't be a disaster if they obliterate the place.' Oliver Borchert, the mayor of Wandlitz, actually thinks that there should be no measures or decisions regarding demolition. 'We mustn't talk about the demolition,' he says, 'because extreme right-wing movements might take over it, the value of the property will decrease and will not do justice to its historical importance.' So, what else can be done? 'It needs transformation. You have to find a use that can stand against and reflect the shadows of the house and its history', says Borchert. There needs to be a place that will be used for education for democracy, a research center and a campus, and the rest of the area will be left for private use such as a hotel, rehabilitation and recovery center. It is a building of historical and architectural importance, and we need to learn how to get along with history, it is impossible and forbidden to destroy history, he added. The Berlin municipality is trying to cope with the fear that neo-Nazi organizations will take over the property; thus, it determined that the taker would have to submit an offer that would include a detailed plan for ten years, no matter what. 'So, the question is what happens after ten years,' says Schmid-Rathjen. 'Extreme right-wing organizations can prepare a wonderful plan, finance a shell company, and after ten years will use it for evil, turning it into an education center for extreme right-wing studies. That's why I think it's all bullshit. No one will destroy the only private house left, which is linked to the rise of the Nazis. Nothing will happen.' 'This is a place of propaganda, misanthropy, distortion of words, a crime scene,' says journalist Stefan Berkholz, who also wrote a biography on Goebbels. 'There must be a place with a concept here, with priority for an educational institution. Demolition would be a scandal, erasing the reminder for future generations. It would become a no-man's land that would always be occupied by memories, and then the question is - who tells the memories, who controls the narrative.' What do you suggest? 'We must turn this dark historical place into a bright future that will illuminate history and warn future generations. But it seems that Berlin only wants the wild weeds to grow and hide the place and its history. We must not forget what happened here: a mechanism of two paranoid regimes. We must not allow the wild weeds to hide it.' 'We can allow Elon Musk to build a Tesla University there,' says Mayor Borchert, 'but he will not be allowed to build a Tesla factory there, and we will not authorize any entrepreneur to build thousands of housing units there. Ideally, we would like to have an academy for democracy, a campus for sciences of resistance to dictatorships; and everything should be funded by the German government.' And the villa? Will it be demolished? 'As far as we are concerned, it will not be demolished. There are already many problems in the world that cover up the past, making it disappear over time with no ability to learn from it. And there is also the opposite scenario, in which the right-wing wins the elections and turns the place into an ideological education center.' Lost place We are sitting in an Italian cafe on the banks of the lake. 'The children of Goebbels traveled on this road to get to school, using a peasant carriage,' says Schmid-Rathjen, then pointing to a nearby shop. 'And here they would have an ice cream.' Also today, children eat ice cream here peacefully, families have bike rides around the lake, and the wind attracts dozens of windsurfers to the place. It is a hot summer day in the green belt around Berlin, and it seems that only a few care who lived here, in the adjacent villa. What about the villa? Schmid-Rathjen thinks that nothing will happen at the moment. 'No one has come for 25 years and there is no reason for anyone to come now. It will be a waste of time and energy. It's a lost place.' Do you have another idea? 'As a historian, I would say that this place should be given for free to Israelis who came to live in Berlin, as a sign of solidarity. Let them turn it into a culture club, have techno parties, alongside exhibitions that explain about the history of this place.'

Unmasking genocide accusations: Israel and the Palestinians	Accusations of genocide against Israel are widely debated, but they lack evidence and distract from real issues; Hamas, not Israel, causes Palestinian suffering through violence and oppressive governance, while Israel aims to protect civilians The notion that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians has been a contentious topic for nearly 40 years. This accusation diverts attention from the core issues and undermines the gravity of actual genocides. It is crucial to understand that Hamas, rather than Israel, has engaged in actions that could be seen as genocidal by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians with the intent of inflicting maximum harm. Conversely, Israel's actions are framed as necessary for the protection of Palestinians from their leadership, which manipulates their suffering for political leverage. Historical context and accusations The term 'genocide' began to be used against Israel particularly since the First Intifada in 1987, and more prominently during the Second Intifada (2000-2005). Accusations from Palestinian leaders and supporters often include claims of colonization, ethnic cleansing and genocide. Legal definition of genocide The 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, including killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions of life to bring about physical destruction, imposing measures to prevent births and forcibly transferring children. Evaluating Israel's actions Killing members of the group: From 1987 to 2023, around 10,000 Palestinians lost their lives in the conflict (All sources cannot be verified). Since the 2023 war, casualties have risen to about 40,000 if we accept the numbers of casualties being released by Hamas which are most likely higher than in reality. Comparatively, many other conflicts with much higher civilian death tolls have not been labeled as genocide, including the Second Congo War with 5.4 million deaths, or the Iraq War with up to 500,000 deaths. Serious bodily or mental harm: There are instances of harm due to the harsh reality of war, but no substantial evidence shows intent to destroy the Palestinian people as a group. Conditions of life: Living conditions for Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank have significantly improved with a 1000% rise in GDP per capita in the past 40 years, with increases in household income far outpacing neighboring countries. In Gaza, however, conditions have stagnated or worsened under Hamas' rule. Therefore it is Hamas who is responsible for the bad conditions that Palestinians in Gaza face, while Palestinians in the West Bank and Israel enjoy a much higher standard of life. Preventing births: The Palestinian population has grown significantly, from 1.9 in 1987 to nearly 5 million in 2023, countering claims of measures intended to prevent births. Forcibly transferring children: While there are reports of detained Palestinian children, international law permits the detention of enemy combatants for questioning if done humanely. Other than that, there is no credible evidence that Israel is forcibly transferring Palestinian children. The current war in Gaza The current war, initiated by Hamas on October 7, 2023, with barbaric attacks on Israeli civilians, has resulted in significant casualties. Hamas' strategy of embedding military operations within civilian infrastructure exacerbates the situation, forcing Israel to target these areas, which is legal under international law. Israel has taken extensive measures to minimize civilian harm, including warnings and humanitarian aid. The evidence does not support the claim that Israel is committing genocide. Accusations against Israel serve more as strategic narratives than substantiated facts. Recognizing the true nature of these accusations is essential for understanding and resolving the conflict, respecting the term 'genocide,' and addressing the real contributors to the suffering of Palestinians. If anything, Hamas should be accused of committing genocide against the Palestinians.

Iran's Quds force chief suspected of ties to Israel, collapses in...	Esmail Qaani reported to be under investigation in Tehran, suffers a heart attack during questioning; was rumored to have been killed in an IDF strike targeting Nasrallah's replacement as Hezbollah chief The commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, Esmail Qaani is under investigation for ties to Israel, according to media reports and had suffered a heart attack during interrogations. 'He was investigated for an intelligence brief, a source told Sky News Arabic. 'He was moved to a hospital and his bureau chief is suspected of connections with Israel.' Senior Iranian security officials said Qaani, who replaced Qasem Soleimani, the legendary commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds force killed by the U.S. in 2020, disappeared after an Israeli strike last week that targeted Hezbollah's deputy chief and head of internal security Hashem Sefieddine who was designated to replace the slain Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an Israeli strike on the Dahieh last month. Contact with Sefieddine was also lost after the attack and he is believed to have been killed, although Israel has not confirmed it. A source told the Reuters news agency that Qaani was in Dahieh when the IDF attacked but did not attend the meeting with Nasrallah's designated replacement. Another source said the Quds force commander had traveled to Beirut after the assassination of Hezbollah's chief and was last seen on Sunday of last week when he visited Hezbollah's offices in Tehran and photographed there with Sefieddine's brother Abdullah. The New York Times reported that Qaani traveled to Lebanon to help Hezbollah regroup after Nasrallah's killing. A source in the IRGC in Beirut told the paper that the commander's disappearance and the silence from officials in Tehran were causing panic in the ranks. Rumors about his fate spread quickly and varied between him having died to him being kept in isolation after the assassinations carried out by Israel on prominent Iranian leaders. According to a report published in the Saudi Al Hadath channel Qaani had recently met with Nasrallah and Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's operations chief who was also assassinated by Israel The channel said he backed out of his original plan to attend the high-level Hezbollah meeting that was then targeted by the IDF and that led to increased suspicion.

Israel targets senior Hezbollah member in Beirut strike	Wafiq Safa is under U.S. sanctions for exploiting Lebanese ports, border crossings to facilitate Hezbollah terrorists’ travel; known as Beirut Airport strongman overseeing weapons arrival from Iran that is stored in great amounts at the airport IDF carried out two airstrikes on central Beirut on Thursday, targeting areas outside Hezbollah's stronghold the Dahieh, for the third time in the war. According to some reports, the attacks were an attempt to assassinate Hezbollah's Liaison and Coordination Unit head Wafiq Safa, a close ally of slain Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah who was killed in an Israeli attack last month. Lebanese health officials said 18 people were killed and 92 injured in the strikes. Safa's fate was unknown, security sources told Sky News Arabic while other sources said he survived the attempt on his life. According to the U.S. Treasury Department's website, Safa exploits Lebanese ports and border crossings to facilitate Hezbollah terrorists’ travel. The site adds that, together with senior Hezbollah member Mohammad Raad, Safa was involved in attempting to secure foreign citizenships for 100 Hezbollah operatives who were to be sent on 'long missions' in Western or Arab countries. Safa is a well-known figure in Beirut and his position in Hezbollah gave him incredible power. He was known as the man who was actually in charge of Beirut's Rafic Al Hariri International Airport, the main gateway into Lebanon. An airport employee told the newspaper Safa maintained close ties with customs control. 'Wafiq Safa is always showing up at customs,' one whistleblower claimed, citing close relationships with the customs managers. 'I feel like if we don’t do what they say, our families will be in danger.' According to an investigative report in the UK's Telegraph newspaper last June, Hezbollah was hiding a significant weapons stockpile at the airport. Officials there said the terror group receives weapons on flights from Iran that are then stored. According to the same sources, Hezbollah stores huge amounts of Iranian weapons, missiles and explosives inside the civilian airport. 'This is extremely serious, mysterious large boxes arriving on direct flights from Iran are a sign that things got worse. When they started to come through the airport, my friends and I were scared because we knew that there was something strange going on,' one source at the airport said. The paper reported that a Lebanese official rejected the claims and Transport Minister Ali Hamie called the information incorrect. He has invited media and ambassadors to visit the airport to see for themselves. Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he would be suing the publication. As a member of Nasrallah's close circle, Safa was part of the negotiation committee Hezbollah established in 2000 during the kidnapping of three IDF soldiers on Mount Dov – Benyamin Avraham, Adi Avitan, and Omar Sawaid. The three bodies were returned to Israel in 2004 in a prisoner exchange deal. He also participated in negotiations for the return of soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, who were kidnapped by the terror group shortly before the Second Lebanon War in 2006.

IDF says three soldiers dead in Gaza explosion	Military says Major Netanel Hershkovitz, Master Sergeant Ori Moshe Borenstein and Master Sergeant Matityahu Marantz Tzvi were killed when their vehicle drove over an IED in Jabaliya The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit reported on Thursday that three IDF soldiers were killed in fighting in Gaza’s Jabaliya after their vehicle drove over a planted explosive in the area set by terrorists. They are: Major (res.) Netanel Hershkovitz, 37, from Jerusalem, a Deputy Company Commander in the Logistical Support Unit of the 5460th Unit, 460th Brigade, Master (res.) Sergeant Ori Moshe Borenstein, 32, from Moreshet, an Achzarit APC Commander in the Logistical Support Unit of the 5460th Unit, 460th Brigade and Master Sergeant (res.) Matityahu Marantz Tzvi, 32, from Bnei Adam, a Squad Commander in the Logistical Support Unit of the 5460th Unit, 460th Brigade. Tal Marantz, the wife of Matityahu Tzvi Marantz, shared a photo of her husband on her Instagram account, writing, 'My Tzvi, my heart, the man of my life has been killed.' Tzvi is survived by his wife, Tal, and their three children Omer, Ofir and Naia, who was born after her father had already been called for reserves and will celebrate her first birthday at the end of the month. Hershkovitz’s friend mourned his loss, saying, 'A few months ago, you teased me when you were the convoy commander leading me into Gaza. You joked, and rightfully so, because I delayed the convoy since I forgot my helmet at home. You led me and hundreds of convoys inside safely and now you’re no longer here. You leave behind a heartbroken family, community, friends, and fellow soldiers. May your memory be a blessing.' The Ma’oz pre-military academy in Lod, where Borenstein studied, paid tribute to him, writing, 'Uri sacrificed his life for the people of Israel and the State of Israel, for the nation’s victory. He was killed in sanctification of God's name on the eve of Yom Kippur, the day of purification for Israel, a day when all of Israel stands united as one.' Borenstein’s friends said he always made sure to bring joy to others and look after everyone, noting his rare generosity. 'He was loved by everyone,' they said. Uri Hananya, Borenstein’s close friend, described him as 'incredibly witty, funny and outgoing. He would dance for the bride and groom at every wedding, do breakdancing and bring them joy. He the salt of the earth. A talented guy. He was called for extended reserve duty since October 7 and it was very important to him to contribute and help.' 'The city of Lod mourns the death of reservist Ori Borenstein, may his memory be a blessing, a resident of the city who was killed today in Gaza,' Lod Mayor Yair Revivo said.

US concerned, Italy, France outraged over UNIFIL under IDF fire	UN forces positioned in southern Lebanon claim IDF tank fired at their position injuring at least two; US, European countries call incident 'war crime' The United States voiced deep concern about reports that Israeli forces fired on UN peacekeepers' positions in southern Lebanon and was pressing Israel for details, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said on Thursday. 'We understand Israel is conducting targeted operations near the Blue Line to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure that could be used to threaten Israeli citizens,' the spokesperson said. 'While they undertake these operations, it is critical that they not threaten UN peacekeeper' safety and security.' Italy lodged its protest after the report that shots were fired, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said. An emergency meeting will be held at the UN Security Council later on Thursday following the incident. Firing on UNIFIL bases was 'totally unacceptable' and clearly flouts international law, Crosetto added in a statement. Italy has summoned Israel's ambassador to the country, Jonathan Peled, to Rome following the incident. Israeli forces fired on two positions used by UN peacekeepers in Lebanon on Thursday and at a third one on Wednesday, the UN force said, injuring two of its peacekeepers. France also commented on the incident and said it was waiting for explanations from Israel after UN peacekeeping troops were targeted in Lebanon and that it was an obligation to ensure their safety. 'France expresses its deep concern following the Israeli shots that hit the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and condemns any attack on the security of UNIFIL,' the foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that none of its 700 troops in the mission had been wounded. Israel on its part is focused on fighting Hezbollah and recommends that the United Nations peacekeeping force (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon move north, Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon said on Thursday shortly after the incident was first reported. 'Our recommendation is that UNIFIL relocate 5 km (3 miles) north to avoid danger as fighting intensifies and while the situation along the Blue Line remains volatile as a result of Hezbollah's aggression,' Danon said in a statement. He said that 'Israel has no desire to be in Lebanon, but it will do what is necessary' to force Hezbollah away from its northern border so 70,000 residents can return to their homes in northern Israel. On Monday the IDF asked the UNIFIL forces to move out of the fighting area for their safety but was rejected. 'There is an obligation on Israel and Hezbollah to respect the role of UN peacekeepers and their mandate, and do nothing that would put peacekeepers and our troops in particular in harm’s way,' Irish President Michael Higgins, whose troops are part of the UNIFIL deployment, said.

Every house is a terror base, IDF says of South Lebanon village	Hezbollah's elite Radwar force planned an invasion of northern Israel carried out by thousands of terrorists breaching the border in six points to overrun bases and communities; terrorists embedded in villages, their equipment stored, waiting for the order to attack IDF troops operating in South Lebanon found Hezbollah's preparation for an invasion into Israel, the military spokesperson said on Thursday. Every house here was a base for terror, Daniel Hagari said in a video filmed inside a Shi'ite village near the Lebanon border with Israel. Hagari said Hezbollah's Radwan forces were embedded in the village, appearing as regular villagers while their military equipment, including rifles, grenades and more, were stored in the houses waiting for the order to be given to launch the assault. 'It would have been bigger than the one on October 7,' Hagari said. The forces are going from house to house and uncovering stores of rockets and other munitions. Hezbollah's elite Radwan force was to number 4,000 to 6,000 men in six brigades and 16 battalions that were to breach the border at the same time through six points, and overrun military bases and communities on the Israeli side. According to the military, the terrorists would arrive from elsewhere in Lebanon, mostly the Bekaa Valley, where Hezbollah has bases, to live in the villages where they walked in civilian clothes, pretending to be innocent residents, while they awaiting the order. According to their plan, named Conquering the Galilee, when the world was given, they were to emerge with their weapons and attack. The terrain around the villages which is dense with vegetation was full of dugouts and rocket and missile launchers, that would provide cover for the assaulting force. Israeli forces were working to clear the area that overlooks the Israeli border communities, from the Hezbollah terrorists and to destroy their capabilities to launch attacks, thereby enabling residents of Israel's north to return safely to their homes.

Jeremy Loffredo faces Israeli court after reporting Iranian missiles striking several Israeli air bases; U.S. fears possible diplomatic incident following reporter's actions Jeremy Loffredo, 28, an independent American journalist who also works with Fox News, was arrested by police on suspicion of endangering national security after reporting on where missiles landed in the attack launched by Iran earlier this month including in the IDF's Nevatim Air Base and an intelligence base in central Israel. In his report, Loffredo said that attacks on Gaza were launched from the Nevatim base and said that government's private jet used by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was located there. The charges against him include aiding the enemy during wartime and providing information to the enemy. His arrest has raised concerns of a potential diplomatic incident between Israel and the U.S. because of his status as a foreign journalist. Representatives from the U.S. Embassy attended the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court for a hearing on the request of the police to extend his detention. 'He published the information openly and fully, without attempting to hide anything. If this information constitutes aiding the enemy, many other journalists in Israel, including Israeli reporters, should also be arrested, said Attorney Leah Tsemel who is representing him in his defense. 'A spy would not have acted so publicly and transparently.'

Hamas tries to prevent civilians fleeing danger in northern Gaza	As troops urge Gazans to leave, many remain fearing travel through areas under IDF control and after threats from Hamas that seeks to use them as human shields while forces hunt them down The Hamas terror group has been preventing civilians from leaving areas under IDF attack and sheltering in humanitarian zones. The military has been urging civilians to leave ahead of an operation targeting Hamas terrorists. Some 200,000 people managed to leave, according to the military but many civilians remain. Troops began going door to door, interrogating the men and asking the women and children to leave for an UNRWA school where they would be safe. Some said they were afraid to move through areas under IDF control and others said Hamas terrorists were threatening them and demanding that they stay. The Hamas interior ministry also called on civilians to remain where they were, making them human shields for the terrorists. Hamas health officials said the IDF demanded that hospitals in the area, evacuate. They said the Kamal Adwan hospital was surrounded and that the forces were shooting at the administration offices. Hamas also claimed there was a siege on northern Gaza and that basic supplies were not allowed in. An Israeli security official said the Palestinians in northern Gaza are again experiencing fear of attack while Hamas attempts to assert its governing control of the area. On Thursday, the IDF said it destroyed a Hamas command center inside what had been a medical facility, killing 12 terrorists. the military identified three of the dead as terrorists who participated in the Hamas massacre on Oct. 7 last year.

Gulf states urge US to stop Israel from bombing Iran's oil sites	Countries fear Tehran's possible retaliation against them should the conflict escalate after Iran wans them against allowing Israeli aircraft or missiles in their airspace Gulf states are lobbying Washington to stop Israel from attacking Iran's oil sites because they are concerned their own oil facilities could come under fire from Tehran's proxies if the conflict escalates, three Gulf sources said. As part of their attempts to avoid being caught in the crossfire, Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are also refusing to let Israel fly over their airspace for any attack on Iran and have conveyed this to Washington, the three sources close to government circles said. Israel has promised Iran will pay for its missile attack last week while Tehran has said any retaliation would be met with vast destruction, raising fears of a wider war in the region that could suck in the United States. The moves by the Gulf states come after a diplomatic push by non-Arab Shi'ite Iran to persuade its Sunni Gulf neighbors to use their influence with Washington amid rising concerns Israel could target Iran's oil production facilities. During meetings this week, Iran warned Saudi Arabia it could not guarantee the safety of the Gulf kingdom's oil facilities if Israel were given any assistance in carrying out an attack, a senior Iranian official and an Iranian diplomat said. Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst close to the Saudi royal court, said: 'The Iranians have stated: 'If the Gulf states open up their airspace to Israel, that would be an act of war'.' The diplomat said Tehran had sent a clear message to Riyadh that its allies in countries such as Iraq or Yemen might respond if there was any regional support for Israel against Iran. A potential Israeli strike was the focus of talks on Wednesday between Saudi de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, who was on a Gulf tour to rally support, Gulf and Iranian sources said. The Iranian minister's visit, along with Saudi-American communications at the defense ministry level, are part of a coordinated effort to address the crisis, a Gulf source close to government circles said. A person in Washington familiar with the discussions confirmed that Gulf officials had been in touch with U.S. counterparts to express concern about the potential scope of Israel's expected retaliation. The White House declined to comment when asked whether Gulf governments had asked Washington to ensure Israel's response was measured. U.S. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Wednesday about the Israeli retaliation in a call both sides described as positive. Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy U.S. national intelligence officer on the Middle East and now at the Atlantic Council think-tank in Washington said: 'Gulf states' anxiety is likely to be a key talking point with Israeli counterparts in trying to convince Israel to undertake a carefully calibrated response.' Oil at risk? The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, which is de-facto led by Saudi Arabia, has enough spare oil capacity to make up for any loss of Iranian supply if an Israeli retaliation knocked out some of the country's facilities. But much of that spare capacity is in the Gulf region so if oil facilities in Saudi Arabia or the UAE, for example, were targeted too, the world could face an oil supply problem. Saudi Arabia has been wary of an Iranian strike on its oil plants since a 2019 attack on its Aramco oilfield shut down over 5% of global oil supply. Iran denied involvement. Riyadh has had a rapprochement with Tehran in recent years, but trust remains an issue. Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE all host U.S. military facilities or troops. Concerns over oil facilities and the potential for a wider regional conflict were also central to talks between Emirati officials and their U.S. counterparts, said another Gulf source. In 2022, the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen fired missiles and drones at oil refueling trucks near an oil refinery owned by UAE's state oil firm ADNOC and claimed the attack. 'The Gulf states aren't letting Israel use their airspace. They won't allow Israeli missiles to pass through, and there's also a hope that they won't strike the oil facilities,' the Gulf source said. The three Gulf sources emphasized that Israel could route strikes through Jordan or Iraq, but using Saudi, UAE, or Qatari airspace was off the table and strategically unnecessary. Analysts also pointed out that Israel has other options, including mid-air refueling capabilities that would enable its jets to fly down the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean, proceed to the Gulf and then fly back. 'Middle of a missile war' According to two senior Israeli officials, Israel is going to calibrate its response and, as of Wednesday, it had not yet decided whether it would strike Iran's oilfields. The option was one of a number presented by the defense establishment to Israeli leaders, according to the officials. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday: 'Our strike will be lethal, precise, and above all - surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened. They will see the results.' The three Gulf sources stated that Saudi Arabia, as a leading oil exporter along with oil-producing neighbors - the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain - had a keen interest in de-escalating the situation. 'We will be in the middle of a missile war. There is serious concern, especially if the Israeli strike targets Iran's oil installations,' a second Gulf source said. The three Gulf sources said an Israeli strike on Iran's oil infrastructure would have a global impact, particularly for China - Iran's top oil customer - as well as for Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election in which she is running against Donald Trump. 'If oil prices surge to $120 per barrel, it would harm both the U.S. economy and Harris' chances in the election. So they (Americans) won't allow the oil war to expand,' the first Gulf source said. Gulf sources said safeguarding all oil installations remained a challenge, despite having advanced missile and Patriot defense systems, so the primary approach remained diplomatic: signaling to Iran that Gulf states pose no threat. Bernard Haykel, professor of Near East Studies at Princeton University, noted that Riyadh was vulnerable 'because the Iranians can swarm those installations given the short distance from the mainland'.

Child hostage forced to watch violent murder, while captive	Eitan Yahalomi tells influential TikTok star about his captivity in Gaza: 'people on the streets beat me when I entered Gaza, now I don't sleep much, I've already been through the worst' 'When I got to Gaza, I saw many people. They were waiting for me, civilians also beat me,' said released hostage Eitan Yahalomi, 13, who was returned to Israel in November's hostage deal. His father Ohad is still held in captivity along with 100 others. In a discussion with the international TikTok star Montana Tucker, Yahalomi recalled the moments of terror he experienced on the morning of the October 7 massacre and in captivity. 'We started hearing gunshots and shouting in Arabic. I was a little scared. They (the terrorists) showed me videos in which they kill people. They were happy. I couldn't look away, because they didn't let me. I also saw things and it's in constantly in my mind.' Yahalomi said that he ate one pita and one cucumber daily. Even today, he still has trouble sleeping: 'Now I don't sleep much, as if I've been through the worst and that's it.' The film 'The Children of October 7' produced by Kastina Communications will echo the atrocities committed by Hamas and will be published in the next few weeks. While 13-year-old Eitan reminds us of the dire situation in captivity, some of the hostages' families express their frustration that the country has shifted its focus to the northern front. According to the Bibas family's relatives, the issue was pushed aside following the escalation in the northern front and the possible confrontation with Iran. In an interview with Ynet, Eilon Keshet, the cousin of Yarden Bibas', who celebrated his 35th birthday in captivity this week, becoming the first hostage to celebrate a second birthday in captivity in Gaza. 'Since Lebanon, the whole subject of the hostages has been pushed aside.' He said that 'it's easier to carry on in life. The hostages don't have time. They either died or were murdered in captivity.'

Humanitarian pauses have been agreed to allow a second round of polio vaccinations targeting 590,000 children under the age of 10 to start in the Gaza Strip on October 14, the head of the UN children's agency UNICEF said on Thursday. 'Area-specific humanitarian pauses have been agreed. It is critical that these pauses are respected by all parties. Without them, it is impossible to vaccinate the children,' UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjanrwryyl	2024-10-10T08:10:41-07:00	
UN inquiry accuses Israel of crime of 'extermination' in destruct...	International body's human rights says Israel commits war crimes, crimes against humanity and 3extermination; report to be submitted to the General Assembly at the end of October A United Nations inquiry said on Thursday it found that Israel carried out a concerted policy of destroying Gaza's healthcare system in the Gaza war, actions amounting to both war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination. A statement by ex-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay released ahead of a full report accused Israel of 'relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities' in the war, triggered by Hamas terrorists' deadly cross-border attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. 'Children in particular have borne the brunt of these attacks, suffering both directly and indirectly from the collapse of the health system,' said Pillay, whose report will be presented to the UN General Assembly on October 30. Israel says that Gaza's terrorists operate from the cover of built-up populated areas including private homes, schools and hospitals and that it will strike them wherever they emerge, while also trying to avoid harming civilians. Hamas denies hiding terrorists, weapons and command posts among civilians. The UN inquiry's statement also accused Israeli forces of deliberately killing and torturing medical personnel, targeting medical vehicles and restricting permits for patients to leave the Gaza Strip. As an example, it cited the death of a Palestinian girl, Hind Rajab, in February along with family members and two medics who came to rescue her from under Israeli fire. The World Health Organization says over 10,000 patients requiring urgent medical evacuation have been prevented from leaving Gaza since the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was shut in May. The Palestinian health ministry says nearly 1,000 medics have been killed in Gaza in the past year in what the WHO called 'an irreplaceable loss and a massive blow to the health system'. The statement said the treatment of both Palestinian detainees in Israel and hostages seized by Hamas terrorists in the October 7 attack had been investigated and it accused both sides of involvement in torture and sexual violence. The Commission of Inquiry has a broad mandate to collect evidence and identify suspected perpetrators of international crimes committed in Israel and the Palestinian territories. It bases its findings on a range of sources including interviews with victims and witnesses, submissions and satellite imagery. The COI has previously alleged that both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes in the early stages of the Gaza war, and that Israel's actions also constituted crimes against humanity because of the immense civilian losses. The term is reserved for the most serious international crimes knowingly committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against civilians. Israel has not cooperated with the inquiry, which it says has an anti-Israel bias. The COI has accused Israel of obstructing its work and preventing investigators from accessing both Israel and the Palestinian territories. Sometimes, the evidence gathered by such UN-mandated bodies has formed the basis for war crimes prosecutions and could be drawn on by the International Criminal Court.

Israel dropped the ball on messaging Hamas atrocities to the worl...	On a visit to Israel Elon Musk said would post a video of clips showing the atrocities committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 and collected by the IDF but no one bothered to deliver it to him, missing the opportunity to reach mass exposure while officials trade blame At the end of November, Elon Musk visited Israel. He toured the Kibbutz Kfar Aza with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and was deeply shaken by the testimonies describing the October 7 massacre. He was also shown a video of clips most from Hamas's own cameras, collected by the IDF. Netanyahu offered Musk the option to share a version of the video on his X account, which has over 200 million followers. Musk agreed but the film was never delivered to him. The matter 'fell through the cracks,' officials said, claiming judicial restrictions over the need for the approvals of the families of victims, and those were not obtained. Thus Israel missed an opportunity to share the video with a massive global audience—an effort that could have shifted the tide in Israel’s public diplomacy, which many feel has been lacking. A senior official involved in the campaign called Musk’s agreement a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' to share the harrowing footage with the world. 'However, legal and military officials prevented the video’s release, insisting that permission from all the victims' families was required, which was impossible to obtain,' the official said. Another official from one of the state's communication bodies stated: 'The IDF Spokesperson created an incredible product, a historic feat in public diplomacy. Yet fewer than 10,000 people worldwide have seen it. There was a strategy to create a sense of ‘FOMO,’ where only a select few would view it, prompting curiosity and conversation. On the other hand, everyone involved in national advocacy and the Foreign Ministry wanted to distribute it globally.' He added that legal limitations regarding the families of victims shown in the video blocked its dissemination, saying, 'It seemed like an odd excuse. We even suggested removing sensitive segments and shortening the video to 25 minutes from 47, but that wasn’t accepted either.' 'Many believe this was a huge missed opportunity,' the official continued. 'The video should have been screened in Times Square and broadcast on networks worldwide. Instead, it was said that legal officials were preventing its release. While nowadays they deny it, everyone knows lawyers behind the scenes blocked it. This is an incredibly powerful tool, and anyone who saw it was deeply disturbed.' The source also revealed that there were further attempts to release a shortened version of the video to international media, but outlets refused to broadcast it after learning it wasn’t the original IDF video, as they didn’t want to rely on leaked material—they insisted on the official version. 'Instead of a global screening week, it was handled like a Rolex launch' 'We were tearing our hair out in frustration. Everything moved at a snail’s pace. No one had the courage to take responsibility, and the issue kept being passed to lawyers, who vetoed it,' said another official involved in the behind-the-scenes efforts to distribute the video. 'The prime minister wanted the video distributed, but neither he nor his team followed through. Rather than securing 1,000 theaters worldwide for free screenings, they opted for small, exclusive events, as if it were a luxury item for collectors.' An Israeli citizen living in the U.S., who was active in Israel's advocacy efforts, expressed his frustration with the government's strategy. 'Israel’s biggest mistake was focusing on the stories of hostages instead of the atrocities of October 7. At any given time, there are 300 Americans held hostage worldwide, and as sad as it is to say, it doesn’t capture public interest.' He added that closed screenings of the video achieved nothing. 'There were internal power struggles between the Foreign Ministry and the IDF Spokesperson's Unit over who would be involved in the screenings. It was obvious that a 47-minute film couldn’t be broadcast internationally. They needed short, 30-second clips and to run them globally.' The same Israeli claimed that Israel’s Attorney General, Gali Baharav-Miara, blocked the video’s release. 'She and her team deny it, but they were responsible for halting the distribution. The main reason was their fear of dealing with the issue. Sadly, everyone involved wasn’t truly looking out for Israel’s interests—they just didn’t want to get in trouble.' Thanks to private donations, underground websites have since released videos containing much of the footage from the IDF video, with one clip reaching 20 million views. Officials working on the issue believe it’s not too late to release the full video. 'It’s still possible,' they said. 'Faces can be blurred for families that object. The country’s interest now is to distribute the video, even a year later.'

Thieves tied to polls in deserted Dahieh	Where was once a Hezbollah HQ, no desolate ruins where petty thieves try to loot homes; Hezbollah, aiming to assert themselves in the area, posted their picture on social media In Beirut's Dahieh district, once a Hezbollah stronghold, the Lebanese Shiite militant group displayed a formidable presence and tight control. It was here that Hezbollah concealed armaments and established key command centers, believing the area to be a safe haven. However, recent weeks have seen intensified Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) strikes, transforming Dahieh from a significant bastion into a battlefield. Initially, during the early months of the conflict, strikes on Dahieh were rare and typically reserved for high-profile targets. Yet, in the past month and a half, the IDF has launched almost daily attacks, often multiple times a day. IDF has long regarded Dahieh as a central hub of Hezbollah's terrorist activities. A military spokesperson said that 'this is where Hezbollah makes its decisions and produces and hides its strategic weapons—inside and beneath civilian structures in Dahieh.' Amid the extensive attacks and the residents' growing realization that the intensity would only increase, many are fleeing Dahieh, moving northward to areas not yet reached by IDF strikes. For some, this marks their second or even third displacement. Families who initially evacuated from border villages in southern Lebanon sought refuge in areas then deemed safer, such as Tyre, Sidon, Nabatieh, and Dahieh in Beirut. However, as the conflict progressed, these regions too became unsafe, prompting families to move northward again. The situation is even more complex for most of the displaced from Dahieh. The district's population is predominantly Shiite, and not all regions in Lebanon are willing to accept them because of the perceived risk associated with their support for Hezbollah. Recently, videos from Tripoli in northern Lebanon showed residents removing stickers with images of Nasrallah and Hezbollah activists from the cars of displaced people. The growing intensity of the strikes has led to the killing of high-ranking officials, bringing the 'Dahieh Doctrine' back into focus. In recent weeks, top Hezbollah leaders, including Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, have been targeted in Dahieh. Many were killed while hiding beneath civilian complexes. Israeli forces also destroyed large weapons caches, including advanced precision surface-to-sea missiles, also hidden in the area. It appears that if Hezbollah leaders had anticipated immediate danger, they would have fled promptly. However, the results of the strikes suggest that Hezbollah underestimated Israel's intelligence penetration into its ranks, unlike during the Second Lebanon War in 2006. The intensified strikes in Lebanon raise another issue first presented after the Second Lebanon War: Is this new phase of combat indicative of implementing the 'Dahieh Doctrine,' introduced in 2008 by then commander of the northern front and now lawmaker Gadi Eizenkot? This doctrine involves disproportionate use of aerial and artillery fire against civilian infrastructures used by terrorist organizations, primarily Hezbollah. 'Each of the Shiite villages is a military site. Dozens of rockets are stored in basements and attics. Dozens of local activists and fighters from outside are prepared for defense battles and missile fire toward Israel,' Eizenkot said at the time. 'We know Hezbollah will fire much more broadly than in the last war, and we will respond accordingly. Any village from which fire is directed at Israel will be subjected to disproportionate force, causing massive destruction.' And in recent days, 16 years after Eizenkot's remarks, it seems this is being implemented. Images and videos from southern Lebanon's villages in recent times, and occasionally even from specific areas in Dahieh, indicate unprecedented destruction in the streets. The villages, under fire for months, have emptied of residents, with those who didn't leave at the war's outset deciding to evacuate in recent weeks as the attacks intensified. That said, ever since the Second Lebanon War, IDF's intelligence and offensive capabilities have developed, allowing for much more focused operations. Even the attacks in Dahieh, though intense, are target-oriented and purposeful. 'In 2006, IDF essentially had no targets. Our capabilities against Hezbollah were relatively limited, and the fact is we didn't eliminate any of their commanders. Certainly not a leader or senior commander,' said Professor Eyal Zisser, an expert in the modern history of Lebanon and Syria and vice-rector at Tel Aviv University. 'The attacks were more about locations, assets, not something precise. We didn't know where their weapons were; it was very unfocused and imprecise. The result was also significant environmental destruction.' 'Today, first of all, after Gaza, we're more cautious, and secondly, we have good intelligence, so we're more focused,' he added. 'There's destruction, and people have fled, but I wouldn't compare the scale of the destruction. We also see that the IDF spokesperson's announcements are about very focused things. It's not about systematic and widespread destruction of Dahieh. There is destruction, but I wouldn't say it's like 2006. Maybe we'll get there. Israel is trying and can, thanks to quality intelligence, be more focused.' Professor Zisser noted that for Hezbollah, this isn't a different war from 2006. 'It's not a different war in the sense that they continue to fire. There are aspects of our ability to hit their assets and commanders, that's true, but essentially they are firing at Haifa like in 2006,' he said. A ghost town where thieves are brutally punished Orna Mizrahi, former Deputy Head of Israel's National Security Council and now a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, suggests that we may not fully understand the intentions for Dahieh until the war concludes. 'The current situation involves numerous targeted strikes, with reports of about seven attacks per day, each hitting multiple buildings and causing significant damage,' she explained. 'While it’s uncertain if Dahieh will face total destruction, similar circumstances might unfold. The IDF's operations today are very focused, often employing bunker-penetrating bombs,' Mizrahi said. 'Dahieh likely has an underground network, making comparisons to 2006 challenging. We are still in the early stages.' Contrary to the 'Dahieh Doctrine,' which involves 'using disproportionate force and causing massive destruction,' Mizrahi believes the current strikes aim not to obliterate the area. 'The strikes are currently precise, targeting assassinations, warehouses, ammunition stockpiles, and industrial facilities,' she explained. Commenting on the chaos in Dahieh, she added, 'Many residents have left. A Lebanese journalist described it as a ghost town. Previously, Hezbollah maintained strict control, deterring thieves and criminals, which provided a sense of security. Now, those returning to check on their property after evacuating have found they were robbed. It has become a lawless zone,' Mizrahi said. Recent images and videos from Dahieh show thieves caught looting abandoned homes. They were hanged or tied to poles, injured and bleeding. Social media posts claim Hezbollah is responsible for these severe punishments, highlighting the breakdown in governance and the prevailing chaos in Dahieh. One user who shared images of the thieves wrote, 'Soon, the same fate will come to the collaborators from within.' The strategic position in Dahieh - and why Hezbollah leaders stay Dahieh, once home to agricultural villages near Beirut, saw a population surge in the 1950s from southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley due to poverty and employment needs. These villages expanded into suburbs, becoming part of Beirut. 'Dahieh is a suburb that began as villages outside Beirut, which merged to become part of the city,' Mizrahi explained. 'Interestingly, Lebanon's main airport, Rafic Hariri Airport, is located in this neighborhood, adjacent to Dahieh, allowing Hezbollah to control what happens there.' Recently, there were proposals in Lebanon to establish another airport, but Hezbollah strongly opposed this. 'Hezbollah wanted everyone to continue using Rafic Hariri Airport to prevent it from being seen solely as a Hezbollah stronghold,' she explained. 'As long as all Lebanese use it because it’s the only airport, it remains general Lebanese infrastructure rather than a Hezbollah target.' Nasrallah was killed there, alongside other key figures like Saleh al-Arouri and Fuad Shukr. Reports indicate that senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine, marked as Nasrallah's successor, was also confirmed dead in Dahieh. Residents of the district reacted strongly to Nasrallah's assassination, with hundreds spontaneously protesting in Dahieh's streets. Reports from Al Arabi and Asharq Al-Awsat describe Lebanese citizens crying and collapsing, and a sense of confusion prevailing after the assassination. Despite these high-profile eliminations, none of the senior figures have fled Dahieh. The simple reason is they have nowhere else to go. Professor Zisser explained, 'They can't move to a Christian neighborhood as they would be reported immediately, so they stay with the Shiites. Their plans didn't work out well,' he added. 'They prepared for a different kind of war, expecting it to be more limited and less intense, thinking we wouldn't attack Dahieh and they wouldn't fire on Tel Aviv.' Mizrahi also believes that 'their options are likely limited.' She stated, 'The main issue is they haven't realized the extent of their exposure to Israeli intelligence. They don't understand how infiltrated they are, so they continue to believe they can hide. The fact they haven't convened to appoint Hashem Safi al-Din as secretary-general isn't coincidental. Perhaps they feared such a gathering.' 'In addition, it seems he feared that once appointed, he would become a target, but he didn’t realize that even as a candidate, he’s a target,' Mizrahi said. 'There are probably places they believe to be safe. It’s a vast area. They still need to hold meetings and gather somewhere. Besides, where else could they go besides leaving Lebanon? Dahieh is the center, the headquarters, everything.' Hezbollah is down, but not out The psychological blow to Hezbollah in recent weeks is substantial. The organization is confused, as seen in its recent activities, but it remains operational. 'There's no doubt they've suffered a setback, but they continue to function. They keep firing. It's a large organization. You've cut off the strategic head, but those firing at Kiryat Shmona continue,' said Professor Zisser. Mizrahi added, 'The current war has achieved remarkable gains. The intelligence penetration, developed over the years, combined with the Air Force's operational capability to conduct precision strikes with bunker-penetrating bombs, allows for much more accurate attacks.' She noted, 'Attention should also be paid to the relatively limited collateral damage. The major concern I recall from this war was about the extent of collateral damage. Overall, it is relatively limited because the strikes are precise.' Recently, the issue of Nasrallah's burial has also arisen, with a Hezbollah source claiming last week that he was secretly buried in a temporary location. However, according to Mizrahi, the reason no funeral has been held yet is that they are 'afraid to conduct it.' She added, 'There were discussions about whether he might be buried in Lebanon or not. There is also uncertainty about how he was killed, whether from the strike or gas at the site. It was also said he was temporarily buried, intending that when times change, he will be properly interred. There’s a lot of confusion around Nasrallah's burial, also out of fear that Israel could use it as an opportunity to attack.'

F-35A fighter jets and B-52 bombers will be among some 60 aircraft from 13 nations taking part in the Steadfast Noon exercise, hosted by Belgium and The Netherlands, NATO officials said. 'In an uncertain world it is vital that we test our defence and that we strengthen our defence so that our adversaries know that NATO is ready, and is able to respond to any threat,' Rutte said in London following meetings with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The exercise does not use any live weapons. But some 2,000 military personnel taking part in the drills will simulate missions in which warplanes carry U.S. nuclear warheads, officials said. Putin has repeatedly warned the West of potential nuclear consequences since Russia' s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. NATO officials stressed its exercise was not a response to any recent declarations from Moscow and that the drills had taken place annually for more than a decade. 'We don't â€¦ adjust constantly according to whatever is being said or not said on any given day,' said Angus Lapsley, NATOâ€™s assistant secretary general for defence policy and planning.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the support Ukraine would need in its war against Russia in the coming months during talks in London on Thursday, Starmer's spokesperson said. The spokesperson also reiterated Britain's view that Ukraine has the right, in certain circumstances, to strike targets inside Russian territory, but said that Britain's stance on the use of its long-range Storm Shadow missiles was unchanged. 'We obviously want to put Ukraine in the strongest position. But no war has ever been won by a single weapon. And on Storm Shadow specifically, there has been no change to the UK government's position on the use of long-range missiles,' the spokesperson said. Zelensky also met NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in London. Asked about long-range weapons, Rutte told reporters: 'We discussed it today, but in the end it is up to the individual allies.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hygylsryye	2024-10-10T04:52:39-07:00

South Korean author Han Kang won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature for 'her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life', the award-giving body said on Thursday. The prize is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million). 'She has a unique awareness of the connections between body and soul, the living and the dead, and in her poetic and experimental style has become an innovator in contemporary prose,' Anders Olsson, chairman of the academy's Nobel Committee, said in a statement. Han Kang is the first South Korean to win the literature prize. Born in 1970, she comes from a literary background, her father being a well-regarded novelist. Han Kang won the Man Booker International Prize for fiction for her novel 'The Vegetarian' in 2016, the first of her novels to be translated into English and regarded as her major international breakthrough.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sylyjbsyjx	2024-10-10T04:48:53-07:00	
5 Arab-Israelis from Tayibe planned to blow up Azrieli tower in T...	The terror cell affiliated with ISIS planned to detonate a car bomb at the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv, an investigation found; During their interrogation, terror cell members revealed that they had watched videos of bombings in Syria and discussed the amount of explosives needed Five residents of the Arab-Israeli city of Tayibe were arrested on suspicion of forming a terror cell affiliated with ISIS, with plans that included bombing a car in the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv, police and the Shin Bet revealed Thursday. Indictments are expected to be filed against them in the coming days. Footage of their arrests was also released. The suspects were apprehended by the Gidonim Unit of Lahav 433, which handles serious national and international crimes, and various weapons were found in their possession. During interrogation, it was uncovered that they had watched online videos of bombings in Syria and discussed the amount of explosives needed to bring down the Azrieli Towers. The first arrests included the cell's leaders, Mahmoud Azzam and Ibrahim Sheikh Youssef. As the investigation progressed, it was revealed that they had connections with ISIS operatives and recruited three additional Tayibe residents – Sajed Masarwa, Abdullah Baransi, and Abed al-Karim Baransi – to advance their terror plans in Israel. Israel Police and Shin Bet officials emphasized that this was a particularly dangerous and unusual organization of Israeli citizens, who conspired to carry out severe security offenses against the State of Israel and its citizens in the name of ISIS ideology. The terror infrastructure was uncovered and thwarted in the early stages of its execution thanks to precise and effective intelligence work, according to the police and Shin Bet. 'This is a serious security case, and thanks to a coordinated and professional investigation by the police and Shin Bet, we prevented a major disaster and saved lives,' Central District Police Commander, Chief Superintendent Yair Hatzroni, said. 'We will continue to act within our legal authority to preemptively foil any intentions to harm the security of the State of Israel and its citizens.'

Swedish police arrest suspected shooter who targeted Israeli defe...	Police apprehended the suspected shooter targeted a Elbit Systems subsidiary branch in Sweden, no casualties reported in the incident Amid recurring terrorist activity against Israel and Jews in Sweden, Swedish police said on Thursday they were investigating a shooting near an Israeli target in the city of Gothenburg, which the national broadcaster said was a unit of Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems. There were no reports of injuries, police said in a statement. An underage suspect was apprehended at the scene and a preliminary investigation into suspected attempted murder and serious weapons crime has been initiated, police added. The police have also sent several patrols and a helicopter to the scene. In early June, police said they had found a 'suspected explosive object' outside the offices of the defense export firm, known for its unmanned aerial systems. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war in October 2023, there have been several incidents targeting Israeli assets and personnel in Sweden. In January, police found a grenade on the grounds of the Israeli embassy compound, which the ambassador said was an attempted attack. In mid-May, gunshots were fired outside the Israeli embassy, which prompted the country to boost security measures around Israeli interests and Jewish community institutions. Sweden’s intelligence agency said in late May that Iran was recruiting members of Swedish criminal gangs to commit 'acts of violence' against Israeli and other interests in Sweden, a claim Iran denied. In neighboring Norway, the authorities informed on Tuesday they are raising the terror warning from medium to high (one level before the highest level). Norway has experienced an increase in threats to Jewish and Israeli targets. The Norwegian security service's decision means that police officers across the country, who are mostly unarmed, will now carry guns.

IDF soldier in fake Hamas video says bullet whizzed past him	The Nahal Brigade soldier featured in the edited video released by the terror group meant to show him getting shot says 'It was frightening for a second, but I quickly pulled myself together. I ducked and reported it; We’ll take out this terrorist too. The incident won't stop me' 'I heard the bullet whizz past me –and realized it was a sniper,' a Nahal Brigade soldier recounted to his comrades about a video released by Hamas, in which the terror group falsely claimed to have shot and killed him, despite missing the target. 'The bullet struck nearby. I followed protocol, ducked down, and quickly alerted the commanders beside me so they could take cover and we could begin efforts to locate the terrorist.' The video, released earlier this week, purportedly shows a sniper from Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza shooting and hitting the soldier, who was unharmed. Hamas fabricated the footage, editing it to include visual effects that seemed to show a bullet hitting the soldier's abdomen. On a bag near the sniper Hamas operatives had written, 'One bullet, one officer, Al-Aqsa Flood' – the name Hamas has given to the current war. The sniper’s face was blurred in the video. 'It was a bit frightening for a second, but I quickly regained my composure,' the soldier added. 'We've gained significant operational experience here over the months, even against Hamas snipers – many of whom we've eliminated. This incident didn’t stop me from continuing to fight alongside my comrades in this week's operation. We won’t stop until we take out that sniper too.' The shot at the soldier was likely fired from an American-made Barrett sniper rifle in the hands of Hamas snipers. The sniper fired a .50-caliber bullet, which causes severe and deadly damage if it hits a person. However, the bullet narrowly missed the soldier's head. Realizing this, he quickly ducked behind a nearby dirt embankment where he and his commander had been standing. Following the incident, Israeli forces launched intelligence and aerial operations to track down and eliminate the sniper, but as of now he remains alive. In recent months, Hamas snipers have successfully targeted Israeli soldiers across the Gaza Strip, documenting the incidents and producing propaganda videos. The terror group has also used drones for reconnaissance and psychological warfare. On the other hand, as revealed by Ynet, the IDF has recently initiated a concentrated campaign to hunt down Hamas snipers in northern Gaza, successfully neutralizing several in past attempts.

Sex-segregated Yom Kippur prayer in Tel Aviv cancelled, despite c...	Chairman of outreach group Rosh Yehudi, Israel Zeira, had been determined to hold the planned prayer service in Meir Park; but he has made a complete reversal, saying that the service would instead take place in a synagogue on Bar Kochba Street over concern about plans to disrupt it A day after the Supreme Court ruled that gender-segregated prayer could be held in Tel Aviv’s Meir Park, the Rosh Yehudi organization announced Thursday that, due to concerns over potential provocations, the prayer service would be moved to a synagogue on Bar Kochba Street rather than taking place outdoors. The organization’s chairman, Israel Zeira, initially said that the prayer service would proceed as planned, but shortly afterward, he issued a statement reversing his decision. 'In times of war, when our soldiers are risking their lives in heroic battles, and the entire nation is praying for the safe return of our captives, the path to victory and the defeat of the enemy, as well as the return of our captives, lies in increasing holiness, unity and internal peace,' he wrote. 'Unfortunately, we have heard plans to disrupt this lawful prayer as well. We are choosing the responsible course of action, to be those who endure insults without retaliating, and we will hold Yom Kippur prayers in the synagogue.' Zeira sounded more defiant, arguing that gender-segregated prayer does not exclude women. 'Many women want to follow the traditions of our ancestors and pray in separation,' Zeira said. 'This is not an offense, it’s not exclusion, it’s not a slap in the face – it harms no one except those who choose to be offended by it. This is authentic Jewish tradition, and no one should be hurt by it. We're not forcing anyone – those who want to stand separately do so, just as they did two years ago. People have unfairly targeted us. We oppose coercion, whether in our prayers or in the lessons we teach. We educate with full intellectual freedom, without any imposition.' Tel Aviv Deputy Mayor Meital Lehavi criticized Zeira’s initiative. 'For 75 years in Tel Aviv, Jews, Arabs, secular, and religious people have lived together peacefully. The religious community here has all the space it needs, with more than 530 synagogues, and the city supports religious events just as it supports cultural events. We allocate substantial spaces for religious purposes. If we want to talk about discrimination and exclusion, I’d argue that it’s the Reform and Conservative institutions in Israel that face discrimination. They receive no support from the Religious Services Ministry or the local religious council. So, to claim that Orthodoxy is suffering when it receives so much funding and recognition, to the point that it has become the state’s official form of Judaism, while pluralistic Judaism is sidelined, is simply inaccurate.' On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that Rosh Yehudi could hold a gender-segregated prayer service in Tel Aviv’s public space for Yom Kippur, including the placement of a partition between men and women. However, the prayers would take place in Meir Park, a less central location than Dizengoff Square, as part of a compromise suggested by the judges. Tel Aviv-Jaffa Mayor Ron Huldai criticized the court’s decision: 'The Supreme Court has allowed the exclusion of women in public spaces, opening a slippery slope. I urge the residents of Tel Aviv-Jaffa to respect the ruling and allow the prayers to take place in Meir Park.' In a surprising turn, former Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef also called for the event to be moved back to a synagogue. Rabbi Yosef issued a public statement saying, 'Regarding Yom Kippur prayers in public spaces, it is clear from a halachic standpoint that prayers should be held in a synagogue. Public prayer should not be preferred over a synagogue.' Rabbi Yosef acknowledged the initiative to bring Yom Kippur prayers to a wider audience in recent years due to overcrowding in synagogues. 'However,' he added, 'a small group of those very distant from religion have sought to cancel public prayers on the grounds of opposing separation, and last year, they went so far as to disrupt the prayers with loud protests, necessitating security intervention, which resulted in the desecration of the holy day.' He concluded, 'While the court has legally permitted public prayers, the risk of confrontations and protests remains. Therefore, I request that the Deputy Mayor of Tel Aviv-Jaffa work to ensure that Yom Kippur prayers take place in synagogues, which is the most appropriate option according to halacha. If that is not possible, the prayers should be held in community centers or closed halls to prevent desecration of the holy day.'

Israeli arrested after entering Lebanon with journalists deported...	Joshua Tartakovsky, who had previously visited Beirut on multiple occasions, was detained by Lebanese authorities after discovering an Israeli passport in his belongings; After the United States intervened, he was deported Joshua (Shuki) Tartakovsky, a former ultra-Orthodox resident of Jerusalem, was deported from Lebanon to the United States following American intervention. Tartakovsky, who graduated from Brown University and the London School of Economics, was reportedly arrested in Beirut on Tuesday after entering Lebanon recently saying he is an investigative journalist. His behavior aroused suspicion among the Lebanese authorities, and when he was caught, they discovered he had an Israeli passport. This was not his first visit to Beirut, according to his social media accounts. Using a British passport to enter Lebanon, Tartakovsky also had his Israeli passport with him. The Al-Akhbar newspaper, associated with Hezbollah, reported that security forces arrested him in the Dahieh district, two weeks after his arrival in the Lebanese capital. He entered the country with other journalists, but his suspicious behavior led to his arrest. Al-Akhbar described Tartakovsky as a 42-year-old Israeli born in the United States who works for a weekly publication. Friends describe him as 'peculiar character.' One noted his frequent shifts in political stance, characterizing him as someone who could be far-right one day and far-left the next, often leaving others confused. His arrest in Lebanon didn't surprise those who knew him. Previously, he posted content supporting Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit or Jewish Power party, yet his friends label him as a leftist 'opposed to wars.' His friend Aharon Rose remarked, 'He earned his degree from a top American university, but he was always a bit strange. He had these confusing traits. The strangest thing was his Facebook. For six months, he was anti-Zionist, then for another six months, he was a Kahanist. He kept changing his Facebook profiles. He's too eccentric to be a spy.' Another friend noted, 'He wrote articles against drafting ultra-Orthodox into the army and against settlements, and suddenly he wrote in favor of drafting ultra-Orthodox.' One of the websites where he published articles even deleted them. Another acquaintance described him as 'an unstable person. He's certainly not a Mossad agent or an Israeli agent of any kind. He's an unstable but very intelligent guy. He's against the West and doesn't live in Israel; he travels the world. Each month he's in a different place—Greece, Brazil, Lebanon, Spain, Turkey, Pakistan. He's an adventurer. He studied international relations and went to experience the world. I'd be surprised if he has a journalist's credentials; he was writing blogs and giving interviews on TV in various countries. He's a polyglot.'

The Shin Bet and Israel Police foiled a planned car bombing attack in the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv planned by five residents of the Arab-Israeli city of Taiba who established a terrorist infrastructure associated with ISIS, according to a joint statement by the Shin Bet and police issued on Thursday. An indictment would be filed against them in the coming days following the findings of a preliminary investigation. The security forces conducted a month-long undercover investigation around the terror cell and at the end of it the five were arrested. The investigation reveals that the suspects watched online videos of terrorist attacks in Syria, and discussed the amount of explosives that would be required for the demolition of the Azrieli Towers.

A Liberia-flagged tanker was struck by an unidentified projectile in the Red Sea causing minor damage, but no casualties, British maritime security agencies said on Thursday. The incident occurred about 73 nautical miles (135 kilometres) southwest of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, security firm Ambrey said. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations agency (UKMTO) said separately that it had received a report of an incident in the same area, adding authorities are investigating. The chemical/products tanker, en route from Saudi Arabia's Jeddah to Muscat in Oman was struck on its starboard side. The projectile hit the bridge causing minor damage, Ambrey said. Approximately four hours later, two additional projectiles reportedly detonated within 0.27 nautical miles of the vessel's port side. The master of the Liberia-flagged vessel reported the tanker was hit by four projectiles, sustaining damage, but no fires or casualties were reported, UKMTO said in a statement. The crew are reported safe and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call, the statement added.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rypycmhkyg	2024-10-10T02:30:43-07:00

Cyprus arrests 8 on suspicion of terrorism funding, say police	Police in Cyprus on Thursday detained eight individuals for questioning on allegations they were involved in raising funds for a designated terrorist group in a third country, authorities said. The suspects, seven men and a woman, all from Syria, were arrested in morning raids by police in the towns of Limassol and Paphos. There was no indication the suspects were plotting attacks themselves and police declined to name the group or where it was based. 'There is absolutely no information these individuals were planning any terror attack in Cyprus. It's purely (related to) issues of financing a specific terrorist group based in a third country,' police spokesperson Christos Andreou told Cyprus's ANT1 TV channel. One issue under scrutiny was whether funds were raised from dealing in illicit narcotics and psychotropic substances, he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bksptfsj1l	2024-10-10T02:26:56-07:00	
Father of 6 dies of injuries sustained in Hadera stabbing attack	Doctors fought for the life of the man, 35, in hospital for a day before his death was declared; 5 others were injured in the attack by an Arab terrorist from the northern Israel city of Umm al-Fahm A man who was mortally wounded in the stabbing attack Wednesday in Hadera has died of his ijhuries. The death of the man, a 35-year-old father of 6 children, was determined Thursday at the city's Hillel Yaffe hospital, after doctors fought for his life for a day. In the stabbing spree carried out by an Arab-Israeli terrorist from Umm al-Fahm, five more people were injured, including one who is in a serious and stable condition, and others who are moderately and slightly injured. The victim was identified as Raphael Mordechai Fischhof, affiliated with the Knesset Yitzhak yeshiva in the city. 'The city of Hadera is in pain and shares in the heavy mourning,' Mayor Nir Ben Haim said in a statement. Fischhoff's family thanked the medical staff at the hospital for their dedicated care and support. According to the police, the terrorist stabbed the six wounded in four different places. He began his stabbing spree on Gitit Street, from there he continued to Botkovsky Street, and then stabbed people on Herzl Street. He was neutralized on Herbert Samuel Street, which is considered a central street in Hadera. At first it was civilians with drawn weapons who, according to footage from the scene, subdued him and tried to arrest him, ordering him to lie on the ground. The assailant, who was wearing a helmet, tried to escape. Municipality security guard, Adi Netaf, shot him in the leg. In additional documentation from the moments that the assailant was neutralized, citizens can be seen pushing the terrorist into an alley in the street, while one of them throws chairs at him, and others who join the scene with drawn-out cheers call on him to lie down on the ground. Police forces that arrived at the scene immediately afterward prevented citizens at the scene from hitting the terrorist. We rushed from site to site,' said local security officer Adi Nataf. 'At first, we thought there were two terrorists and then we heard a call to come to Herbert Samuel Street. I saw him wounded and then he stood up, with a coat on, we shouted 'lie down' so that he would not shoot at us, and a reservist fired two shots in the air. I shouted 'lie down' again and shot him in the leg.' Later, police forces also arrived at the scene. An ax and a knife handle were found near the terrorist. In field scans, the blade of the knife was found covered in blood. Police commissioner, Senior Superintendent Danny Levy, arrived at the scene as well. In a statement from the scene he said that 'I want to make it clear that the Israel Police is stretched from end to end, we are handling all the scenes of rocket falls in the entire State of Israel after the barrage on Haifa and the Krayot at the same time as the attack. My heart goes out to the wounded, but apparently this is what we are destined for in this period. We, the police deployed in all the arenas, will also be there to prevent these incidents. The public's sense of security is the most important thing today.' Fearing the presence of additional terrorists, the entrances and exits to the city were blocked Wednesday and Mayor Nir Ben Haim also ordered students not to be released from the schools and kindergartens. The security forces in the city joined the police searches in order close the incident and to allow a return to routine. After some time the restrictions were removed. Sarit Levy, a resident of the city who was near one of the scenes at the time of the attack, told Ynet Wednesday that 'it was scary. I was at the entrance to a stairwell in front of Gitit Street and then people shouted 'attack, attack, stab here.' Suddenly someone ran away quickly, I went up quickly and then I heard. There were other scenes later.' Even before the terrorist was neutralized, he exploded in the city. The owner, E., noticed a 'strange man', as he put it. 'He came in in a panic. He took a bottle of water and then I saw that he had blood and I asked him, 'What's going on?' He said to me 'Do you want me to kill you?' - Then I saw that he was trying to mess with something in his shirt, then I sprayed him with pepper spray and threw a chair at him. I miraculously survived, I realized that he was strange and then it turned out that he was the terrorist.'

The US plan to weaken Hezbollah and shift Lebanese politics; Qata...	The Biden administration believes Hezbollah is in disarray, providing an opportunity to alter Lebanese politics by encouraging Arab nations to support electing a new Lebanese president, a position vacant since 2022; However, Qatar and Egypt warn this move is unrealistic and dangerous, with a potential to ignite sectarian conflict and civil war In a strategic shift, some Western officials, while publicly advocating for calm in the north, are considering leveraging Israel's successful strikes against Hezbollah to diminish the group's political influence in Lebanon. This effort aims to break Hezbollah's stronghold on the country following the assassination of key leaders, primarily Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah. The Biden administration is encouraging Arab nations, such as Qatar, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to collaborate on this initiative, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. This move is intended to weaken Hezbollah's grip, as reported by American and Arab sources. Recently, Washington reached out to Cairo and Doha, which have been involved in cease-fire efforts in Gaza since the war's onset and are now also engaged in discreet talks for stability in the north. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in discussions with leaders from these countries, requested their support in getting a new president elected for Lebanon, which is facing a severe political crisis alongside Israel's conflict with Hezbollah. Biden's special envoy to the region, Amos Hochstein, conveyed to Arab officials that the weakening of Hezbollah should be seen as an opportunity to resolve Beirut's political deadlock. Lebanese parties have struggled to agree on a new president since Michel Aoun's term ended in 2022. This effort represents a quiet shift in the Biden administration's approach, following its recent calls for an immediate cease-fire. However, countries in the region are wary, fearing that pushing a presidential candidate could reignite internal conflict. Years of U.S.-backed reform efforts in Lebanon have only led to minor changes. Qatar and Egypt are not on board Lebanon's citizens suffer from sectarian and political divisions established during the French occupation after World War I, with elites from major groups – Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims, Christians and Druze –dividing government roles among themselves. Riyadh-based sources indicate that the American initiative currently enjoys Saudi support. The oil-rich Gulf state has played a significant role in shaping Lebanon's state and economic actions in recent years. Conversely, Qatar and Egypt warn that this is a risky gamble. Officials in Cairo and Doha told senior American officials that the proposed plan is 'unrealistic and even dangerous.' In conversations with these sources, they argued Israel would never succeed in destroying Hezbollah, and thus the terrorist organization must be part of any political settlement to the conflict. Egypt also expressed concern that attempting to intervene in Lebanese politics during an ongoing war could increase the risk of civil war in a country that has already suffered one in the past century. The U.S. initiative also depends on key Lebanese leaders, including Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Shiite leader considered a 'central conduit' in cease-fire negotiations with Hezbollah. If Washington succeeds in initiating a move, it will need to unify Lebanon's political factions to elect a new president. The president of Lebanon serves as the commander-in-chief of the Lebanese army and is seen as crucial in establishing a competent government capable of addressing the current crisis. Mikati and Berri expressed support for electing a new president last week but also praised Hezbollah's 'struggle against Israeli forces.' Hezbollah's acting leader, Nasrallah's deputy Naim Qassem, rejected calls for a new political settlement while the war with Israel continues. However, he did not rule out a cease-fire independent of the Gaza Strip's situation. Ynet analyst Ron Ben-Yishai notes that Qassem's statement agreeing to a cease-fire without preconditions was likely coordinated with Iran. Qassem, from Hezbollah's founding generation and a key spokesperson, is part of the jihad council. He is currently the highest-ranking member of Hezbollah's military-political leadership after Nasrallah's assassination and the attack on his intended successor, Hashem Safieddine. In Lebanon, the president is elected by the parliament, which has 128 members. Currently, no party has enough strength to elect a president alone and without Hezbollah and its allies' support, forming a political consensus within Lebanese politics remains challenging. Amid tensions in Lebanon, where hundreds of thousands have been displaced following the IDF's entry into southern Lebanon and massive air force strikes across the country, Israel also hopes to effect change. Evidence of this can be seen in a video released by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In his message to the Lebanese people, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged them to seize the opportunity to liberate Lebanon from Hezbollah's control to prevent the country from descending further into destruction and chaos. He reminded them of Lebanon's past as 'the pearl of the Middle East' and blamed Hezbollah and Iran for its current state of turmoil and war. Netanyahu claimed that Hezbollah's actions, including launching thousands of rockets at Israel, serve Iranian interests at Lebanon's expense. He emphasized Israel's right to defend itself and declared that Israel will prevail in the conflict. Netanyahu appealed to Lebanese citizens to reclaim their country and restore it to peace and prosperity, warning that failure to do so would allow Hezbollah to continue its futile war against Israel, causing further suffering for all Lebanese people. He encouraged Lebanese families to consider whether the ongoing conflict is worth the cost, emphasizing the potential for a better future sans Hezbollah's influence.

Hezbollah rocket damages his parents grave stones in Kiryat Biali...	Yitzhak Shalev, 60, from Kiryat Bialik, was devastated to learn a rocket barrage from Lebanon hit the graves of five family members, while seven people were injured in the attack; 'Hearing this was overwhelming, I had chills all over my body' Yitzhak Shalev, 60, from Kiryat Bialik, was devastated when he learned that the graves of five family members were damaged during a rocket barrage on Haifa and surrounding communities on Wednesday afternoon. 'It deeply pains the soul. I was at work when I received a video showing a direct hit. I looked and saw part of my parents' tombstone,' he told Ynet. During the barrage, approximately 40 rockets were launched from Lebanon, injuring seven people from lightly to serious and causing damage, including at the Tzur Shalom cemetery. Mayor Eli Dokorski urged residents not to visit the site. 'We will inform any family whose loved ones' graves were damaged. Do not come here; it is still dangerous. Security forces are working,' the mayor said. He joined Home Front Command forces and municipal workers to assess the damage. 'Two minutes later, I received a call from the cemetery manager. He told me that the tombstones of my brothers-in-law and father-in-law were also damaged,' Shalev said. He said that his father, Shalom Shtashvili, died 20 years ago, and his mother, Bat Sheva, six years later. 'Their grave was hit directly by a missile. Four rows behind them are my brothers-in-law, Yitzhak Peer and Tal Israel. Their tombstones were damaged by shrapnel and metal. Their father, Yaakov Petroschvili, my father-in-law, is buried next to them.' 'Hearing this was overwhelming. I had chills all over my body. I took some solace in the fact that the missile didn't penetrate the ground. It hit the gravestone and exploded, which is a small comfort in a difficult situation. I wanted to see the damage with my own eyes, so I went to the cemetery. I photographed everything to show the property tax authority. It's not just a crack; everything is shattered there. It's a very heavy feeling,' he said. 'I'm sure if my parents were here and I could ask their opinion, they would prefer their tombstone be damaged—as long as none of the family members or residents are harmed,' he concluded. The images and videos were shared on social media and in the news, with residents describing them as 'painful.' After watching one of the videos, a resident of Kiryat Ata said: 'Even the dead are not given peace here.' Following the barrage, the Kiryat Bialik municipality issued a notice to residents. 'Anyone whose loved one's grave was damaged will need to file a claim with the property tax authority, where the deceased is the claimant and the family member is the reporter,' according to the announcement. Another barrage targeted Kiryat Shmona: A couple walking their dogs were killed Shortly after the barrage on Haifa and surrounding communities, approximately 20 rockets were also launched toward Kiryat Shmona – most of its residents had been evacuated following the outbreak of the war. Dvir Sharvit, 43, and Revital Yehud, 45, a couple walking their dogs who did not manage to reach a shelter in time, were hit and pronounced dead shortly after at the scene. In addition, eight people were injured in the barrages in the north: seven in the barrage that also damaged the cemetery – including a 16-year-old boy who was evacuated in serious condition with a shrapnel wound to his head – and a 41-year-old man was injured by shrapnel in Shlomi. He was taken to the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, where he underwent surgery. His condition is now classified as moderate. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byfm00ybj1l	2024-10-09T23:44:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/09/rke6AZN4Jye/rke6AZN4Jye_0_660_1536_865_0_small.jpg

The U.S. sees the Israeli strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon as an opportunity to end the terrorist organization's control of the country and to elect a new president, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources from U.S. and Arab countries with knowledge of the details. According to the report, U.S. official Amos Hochstein told senior officials from Arab countries that the weakening of Hezbollah should be seen as an opportunity for a breakthrough and an exit from the political crisis in Lebanon. Senior officials from Egypt and Qatar told the Americans that the plan was 'dangerous and unrealistic,' arguing that 'Israel will not succeed in destroying Hezbollah, and must be part of any political settlement to the conflict.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sk62n1hyyg	2024-10-09T23:00:14-07:00

North Korea’s key role in supplying artillery to Russia revealed ...	North Korea is providing up to half of the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine; as military ties deepen, experts warn of growing cooperation, including potential transfers of advanced weapons systems North Korea has become a key supplier of artillery shells to Russia, providing substantial military support in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. According to Western intelligence cited by The Times of London, North Korean shipments make up approximately half of the 3 million artillery shells Russia uses each year, with an estimated 1.5 million shells originating from Pyongyang. Despite many of these shells being defective, their sheer quantity is crucial for maintaining Russian military operations on the front lines. Russia’s reliance on North Korean ammunition has grown significantly following Vladimir Putin’s visit to Pyongyang in June 2024. This meeting followed a high-profile visit by Kim Jong Un to Russia in September 2023, which marked a turning point in the countries’ military and diplomatic relationship. Regular shipments of North Korean ammunition have been reported since these meetings, solidifying Pyongyang’s role in supporting Moscow’s war efforts. While Russia and North Korea have long-standing historical ties, their relationship has deepened in response to Russia’s growing international isolation following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Putin’s recent visit to North Korea was his first in 24 years, underscoring the strategic importance of the new partnership. Growing military collaboration between Russia and North Korea raises serious concerns for global security, as both nations continue to violate international sanctions and deepen their strategic ties. Fyodor Tertitskiy, a leading researcher at Seoul’s Kookmin University, told The Media Line that Russia and North Korea have now formed a true alliance, solidified by a formal treaty. He highlights that North Korea’s involvement, particularly through supplying artillery shells, positions the country as a potential exporter to other nations with limited access to Western markets. 'Russia’s reliance on North Korean military supplies has become crucial, especially as reports suggest that Russia receives half of its artillery shells from North Korea. This is an enormous quantity, given that Russian military tactics focus heavily on shelling Ukrainian towns to the ground before advancing,' Tertitskiy told The Media Line. 'North Korea’s extensive artillery production is a result of its hyper-militarized state, where 45% of the population serves in the military, and the service term is an unprecedented seven to eight years. No other country comes even close to that,' he states, illustrating North Korea’s intense focus on military strength. He added that North Korea’s 'second economy' is dedicated solely to military production, particularly artillery. 'If you look at the structure in a Korean general’s staff, you’ll see how seriously overrepresented the artillery is there,' he said. Military expert Yan Matveev told The Media Line that while North Korean weaponry don’t likely make up half of all Russian artillery, they still play a significant role. 'Judging by the frequency with which North Korean ammunition appears in footage from the front lines, it’s unlikely that these supplies make up half of all artillery shells, as some reports suggest. However, they do represent a significant portion and are quite widespread. The complete absence of 122-mm shells for howitzers and multiple rocket launchers from North Korea would seriously weaken Russia’s firepower, though likely not critically. This would result in higher infantry losses during offensives, as there would be less artillery support,' he told The Media Line. Matveev shared that the quality of provided munitions is extremely poor. 'For example, the amount of gunpowder in the charges varies, making accurate shooting difficult. You cannot reliably adjust your fire when the shells fall either closer or farther away than expected. This leads to an increase in ammunition consumption. While this doesn’t significantly affect Russian tactics—since their fire support largely relies on massive, inaccurate bombardments—it does limit some of the artillery’s capabilities. Occasionally, these shells explode inside the barrel, though the same issue occurs with Russian-made shells as well,' he explained. According to Matveev, given the existing supply of military equipment and ammunition from North Korea, further deepening of military cooperation can be expected, potentially extending to the transfer of more advanced weapons systems. 'We are already seeing North Korean officers arriving at the front, likely in the role of instructors. Russia is also utilizing KN-23 tactical missiles. While the expansion of cooperation is limited by the modest capabilities of North Korea’s defense industry, they may very well view the war as a testing ground and send more of their missiles to Putin, and possibly other equipment—such as drones,' he said. 'However, mass supplies will likely focus on Soviet-caliber ammunition and possibly Soviet-era equipment,' noted Matveev. North Korea’s artillery is not just abundant but compatible with Russian systems, as both countries’ militaries are offshoots of the Soviet army. 'Everything sort of clicked,' he said, pointing to how this compatibility has made trade between the two countries smooth and beneficial for Russia’s war effort. For North Korea, he explained, this alliance has been a long-sought success. 'The dream since 1990 was to diversify their dependence on China because, if you look at the trade balance, it’s 90% plus trade with China. They don’t like it. They don’t like to be too dependent on Beijing. They don’t want to put all the eggs in one basket. Now, with Russia, they found another basket, and apart from that, just direct income. They’re getting food to feed their population. They’re getting more resources to do whatever the Supreme Leader thinks they should do,' Tertitskiy shared with The Media Line. Tertitskiy also speculated on the future of the alliance, particularly once the war in Ukraine ends. 'Even if Putin stays in power and everything politically is exactly the same, Russia would no longer have a need for North Korea like they haven’t had before.' Historically, the trade relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang was nearly nonexistent, and Tertitskiy suggested it might return to that state after the war. 'Everything now comes just as a supplement to the war trade.' He also noted China’s role in the relationship, suggesting that Beijing gave a 'green light' to North Korea’s involvement in the war with Ukraine, as they are 'quite happy that the Russians are feeding North Koreans and they’ve taken some of the economic burden.'

Brown University rejects demand to divest from companies with tie...	Ivy-league university's governing body votes against proposal by pro-Palestinian students ; vote held after agreement between university administration and students to evacuate protest camp established on campus after start of war in Gaza After months of protests and pressure, Brown University's governing body announced Wednesday that its governing body voted to reject a student proposal to disinvest from companies with ties to Israel. The vote is considered a defining event in the academic arena in the U.S. against the backdrop of pro-Palestinian campaigns that have spread on campuses throughout the country. Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, pro-Palestinian student movements have demanded that universities across the U.S. disinvest from Israel or financially disassociate themselves from entities that have ties to Israeli defense industries. These efforts have only rarely been successful, but the decision by the prestigious university in Rhode Island to even consider the proposal caused great concern in the U.S. Jewish community. Brown agreed to the move as part of an agreement to evacuate the protest camp set up by the students in April in the center of the campus. As part of the negotiations, the protesters promised to dismantle the encampment In exchange for a board of directors examination of the demand to stop investing in certain companies. The decision led to the publicized resignation of hedge fund manager and trustee Jewish billionaire Joseph Edelman. At the end of the vote that was held Wednesday night, university President Christina H. Paxson, and Chancellor Brian T. Moynihan, announced that the board rejected the proposal because 'Brown has no direct investments in any of the companies targeted for divestment and that any indirect exposure for Brown in these companies is so small that it could not be directly responsible for social harm.' Among the companies targeted in the proposal were Boeing, General Electric, Motorola, Volvo and Airbus. Brown’s mission doesn’t encompass resolving or adjudicating global conflict,' they wrote. 'Our greatest contribution to the cause of peace for which so many members of the community have advocated is to continue to educate future leaders and produce scholarship that informs and supports their work. A decision to divest would greatly jeopardize our ability to continue to make this contribution. If the Corporation were to divest, it would signal to our students and scholars that there are ‘approved’ points of view to which members of the community are expected to conform. This would be wholly inconsistent with the principles of academic freedom and free inquiry, and would undermine our mission of serving the community, the nation and the world.' Those around her justified the vote as an attempt to prevent the many conflicts recorded at other academic institutions, such as Columbia University and UCLA, where mass fights broke out between police and protesters, dozens of which were arrested. At Brown, on the other hand, one of the first pro-Palestinian protest centers in the U.S., relative quiet was maintained on campus. The student organization 'Brown Divest', which demanded the vote, described Wednesday night's decision as a moral failure of the university and said that the board 'chose to remain complicit in genocide.' 'It's a shame that the vote even took place' Unlike past protests, the proposal to diest did not deal with cultural or academic isolation of Israel, but with giving instructions to the university to stop investing in 10 companies linked to the 'Palestinian occupation.' Among the arguments put forward by the opponents of the proposal was that it is a double standard, and that these measures endanger freedom of expression on campus. Professor Hedy Wald,, a family medicine specialist at the Brown Faculty of Medicine, and one of the leaders of the fight against the vote, told Ynet that the board's decision is a victory for values ​​and justice. 'It's a shame that, due to the lack of a moral leadership example, this vote was even held in the first place,' she said. 'Kudos to the Students for Israel And to the Jewish Brown graduates for the great efforts they have invested during the last period. Calls to remove investments from military equipment manufacturers that contribute to Israel's ability to defend itself are antisemitic. In this spirit, there is no social harm in investing in companies related to Israel when it must defend itself against the annihilation intentions of terrorists.' Paxson and Moynihan called on the campus community to maintain respectful discourse even in times of disagreement, and emphasized that Brown continues to be an institution committed to academic freedom and freedom of opinion. Unlike Brown, there are several institutions that have agreed to protesters' demands. San Francisco State (SFSU) earlier this month removed investments from three defense companies - Lockheed Martin, Leonardo, and Planetary Technologies, as well as Caterpillar, which do business with the Israeli Ministry of Defense. According to the institution's statement, the university's investment portfolio, estimated at $163 million, was updated 'to conform to new human rights standards proposed by a working group of students and administrative staff.' Pro-Palestinian organizations saw the unprecedented decision as a great victory. The revised policy will have a final approved in December, but its implementation has already begun in practice. Before that, in May, the Columbia University Theological Seminary (UTS) announced the withdrawal of all its investments in Israel, in accordance with the demands of the pro-Palestinian demonstrators on campus.

There will be pubic segregated prayer for Yom Kippur in Tel Aviv,...	The Supreme Court responded to a petition by the Rosh Yehudi organization and ordered the Tel Aviv municipality to allow the outdoor, public service to be held in Meir Garden instead of the more central, secular Dizengoff Square, a compromise the city had rejected The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the Rosh Yehudi organization can hold a gender-segregated prayer in the public space in Tel Aviv for the upcoming Yom Kippur holiday, including placing a mechitza or partition, between men and women. The judges in a compromise proposal ordered the organization to set up its prayer service in Meir Garden, a less central location in the city, and not in Dizengoff Square where it had requested. The court said the municipality must enable Rosh Yehudi to hold the Kol Nidrei and Neilah prayers in the park, at the beginning and end of the holiday. A year ago, clashes erupted at Dizengoff Square on Yom Kippur Eve between hundreds of Tel Aviv residents and the organizers of the gender-segregated prayer service. The Tel Aviv District Court, which heard the organization's petition against the Tel Aviv Municipality, did not find it appropriate to intervene in the municipality's decision prohibiting the holding of gender-segregated prayers and events in the public space - and therefore the petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court. The appellants, Rosh Yehudi and residents of Tel Aviv who joined the petition, were represented by attorneys Uri Paz and Harel Arnon. At the opening of Wednesday's hearing, Judge David Mintz said: 'These are difficult days. In any case, the issue should not have come to court. Certainly not a topic of prayer on Yom Kippur. With good will, it can be resolved outside the court's walls.' Judge Grosskopf said during the hearing: 'I don't understand, a municipality can't allow prayer in the public space according to accepted customs?! You say: when the place is closed, in a synagogue, gender segregation is allowed - but under the open sky in the space, then it is not allowed? Who wants an Orthodox prayer He will go there and those who don't, shouldn't go. Why should a municipality prevent prayer?' The judges slammed the Tel Aviv municipality: 'What is emerging is that a municipality in the State of Israel seeks to discriminate against Orthodox worshippers.' The representative of the township said: 'We do not discriminate', and the judges replied: 'Certainly yes.' Grosskopf added: 'The Tel Aviv Municipality will determine which prayer is legitimate? The public will decide that for itself.'

A military intelligence unit is operating in southern Lebanon and...	Members of Unit 504 are embedded with battalions in the field gathering intelligence from the combat zone, and they are also skilled in on-site interrogations of enemy combatants, including critically injured ones; In recent years, they have successfully recruited agents against Hezbollah without setting foot on Lebanese soil Two soldiers from Unit 504, part of the Military Intelligence Directorate, were injured on Tuesday – one moderately, the other seriously – likely from an explosion during a clash with Hezbollah terrorists in the western sector of southern Lebanon. These are the first casualties from the unit in the ground operation against Hezbollah. As with the Gaza incursion, the IDF has deployed prisoner interrogators from Unit 504 alongside combat battalions operating in Lebanese territory. Their mission is to gather as much intelligence as possible from battle zones and military positions of Hezbollah's Radwan forces, to analyze enemy tactics in real-time, and, when possible, to interrogate captured Hezbollah terrorists or Lebanese civilians. So far, after nine days of ground operations, the IDF has not disclosed whether any Hezbollah terrorists have been captured. However, reports suggest that close encounters with Hezbollah have resulted in their deaths, contrasting with the capture and interrogation of thousands of Hamas terrorists in Gaza over the past year, which provided valuable intelligence, including on the issue of Israeli hostages. Although the IDF's ground operation in Lebanon is currently limited to Radwan’s border villages, Unit 504 is still working to extract human intelligence from the field in real time. The unit’s interrogators are trained in battlefield questioning, including extracting information from wounded Hezbollah terrorists on the verge of death, which could prove invaluable for ongoing operations. Unit 504 has not been as active in Gaza in recent years, where the Shin Bet and the Intelligence Directorate’s technological capabilities have led efforts against Hamas. However, the unit has maintained a presence in southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan, even after the IDF's withdrawal from the security zone in May 2000. Over the years, it has managed to recruit agents and informants against Hezbollah without setting foot on Lebanese soil, helping to build a comprehensive intelligence picture of the Shiite terror army. Meanwhile, Major Roy Ofir, commander of the 71st Armored Battalion Tactical Command Post, described the fighting in southern Lebanon. 'We just returned from one of the villages. We hit Hezbollah hard, destroyed their infrastructure, and neutralized several of their forces and enemy squads. We found a lot of weapons, some of which we've brought back for research in Israel. We crushed anyone who confronted us. We are here to protect our people,' he said. 'We're coming in with significant force,' Ofir added. 'Hezbollah can't even lift its head. They’re taking hit after hit. The IDF has prepared for this. Ask any soldier in the last few years, and they'll tell you – we’ve been preparing for Lebanon and Hezbollah.' Ofir, who began the war in the Gaza sector, continued: 'In the end, we are dismantling the stranglehold Iran has built around us, piece by piece. That is our mission – and we will be on the frontlines despite the difficulties. Those challenges pale in comparison to the larger purpose we’re fulfilling this year.'

Theives in Dahieh were tied to street poles or hanged	Exploiting the war and stealing from houses ' read social media posts showing how the thieves were punished In recent days, photos and videos have been circulated from Hezbollah's stronghold, Beirut's Dahieh, showing thieves who were caught after looting the property of residents who were displaced from their homes. The thieves were hanged or tied to street poles, wounded and bleeding. Passers-by photographed them, uploaded the pictures to social media networks. 'Exploiting the war and stealing from houses in the Al-Rabiri area in Dahieh,' read some of the posts. According to some of the social media messages, Hezbollah is responsible for the harsh punishments. The video footage and photos prove the damage to the governance and the chaos that now prevails in Dahieh.

Iranian exiles ran to bomb shelters during visit to Haifa. They s...	A delegation of Iranians who have left their homeland has arrived in Israel, and has already experienced sheltering from rockets both in central and northern Israel; They say Israel has a right to defend itself; 'Israel's war is with Khamenei and the Islamic Republic of Iran, not with the Iranian people' 'Not a single Iranian desires war, yet it seems our only hope for salvation lies in military intervention by Israel,' stated Katie Amiri Yaunasi, an Iranian-American lawyer visiting Israel this week. Yaunasi is part of a delegation of senior Iranian exiles who have been touring Israel, including visits to communities near the Gaza border. During their visit, they raised the flag of the Shah of Iran alongside the Israeli flag in the Knesset and even sought shelter during air raid sirens in Haifa. The delegation, invited by the Public Diplomacy Department of the Foreign Ministry, includes Golsa 'Goldie' Jamari, a Canadian politician; Nazanin Ansari, an Iranian-British journalist and activist; Hamid Jamalvashi Fard, an underground Iranian rapper; Houman Khalili, an Iranian-American filmmaker and DJ; Hamidi Saeidi, a Grammy-winning Iranian-American musician; and Mahtab Jamali, an Iranian-British businesswoman and fashion designer. The delegation wanted to express solidarity with Israel following the events of October 7. They visited the Gaza border community of Nir Oz and the Re'im parking lot, where the massacre at the Nova music festival took place. They participated in a memorial ceremony in Sderot attended by President Isaac Herzog, traveled north to meet with IDF representatives, and visited the Knesset alongside lawmaker Sharren Haskel. On Tuesday, they experienced air raid sirens for the first time during Hamas' rocket fire on Tel Aviv, and on Wednesday afternoon they ran to shelters during Hezbollah's barrage on Haifa. They were scheduled to meet later on Wednesday with families of hostages. 'Israel's war is with Khamenei and the Islamic Republic of Iran, not with the Iranian people,' Jamari said. 'Iranians love Israelis and stand with them against terror. They want Israel to strike Khamenei. By weakening the Islamic Republic, the Iranian people can overthrow the dictatorship. The people welcome an attack against the Republic that holds them hostage. When Iran is free, there can be peace again in the Middle East.' When Iran is free, there can be peace again in the Middle East Khalili, who lives in California, also expressed his support for Israel, and not just during this visit. 'Iran's attack on Israel is severe and has serious consequences. Israel has every right to defend itself and should respond decisively. It’s important to recognize that many people in Iran are pro-Israel,' he said. Khalili has visited Israel before, making 16 trips in the past two years. His art has become a symbol of support for human rights worldwide, and he aims to present murals in Israel that draw attention to the shared history of Israelis and Persians. Saeidi added that 'the people of Iran and Israel are not enemies but victims of regimes thriving on division. We yearn for peace and freedom. On the streets of Tel Aviv, like in Tehran, you can feel the heartbeat of humanity – full of hope. We share more than history and geography; we share the desire for a life without fear.' The Foreign Ministry noted that 'this visit highlights the connection between the Israeli people and the Iranian expatriate community. It reflects the shared struggle for freedom and human rights.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/r18lk84y1g	2024-10-09T14:04:25-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/09/ryI4RG4yke/ryI4RG4yke_0_183_1280_721_0_small.jpg
Ukraine's Zelensky to meet NATO's Rutte, UK's Starmer on Thursday	President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet NATO General Secretary Mark Rutte and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London on Thursday, a boost for Ukraine after a summit of its main backers was cancelled at a difficult moment in its fight against Russia. Zelensky and Starmer have both described the war with Russia as being at a critical point, and the Ukrainian leader is keen for the West to deliver long-range missiles and other support to try to change the balance on the battlefield. Starmer's spokesperson said Zelensky's arrival in London would coincide with a visit by Rutte.

Top UN envoy in Lebanon calls for truce, UN resolution enforcemen...	A call by the U.S. and France for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah 'is still on the table,' said the top U.N. official in Lebanon on Wednesday as she pushed for a way to enforce a U.N. Security Council resolution violated for years by both sides. A U.N. peacekeeping mission is mandated by Security Council resolution 1701, adopted in 2006, to help the Lebanese army keep its southern border area with Israel free of weapons or armed personnel other than those of the Lebanese state. That has sparked friction with Iran-backed Hezbollah, which effectively controls southern Lebanon. All parties are banned from crossing the Blue Line - a U.N.-mapped line separating Lebanon from Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. 'We need a realistic roadmap for the implementation, by both sides, of resolution 1701. And this must include clear implementation and enforcement mechanisms,' said U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert. Any changes would have to be made by the 15-member Security Council and agreed by both sides. U.N. peacekeepers have remained in place in southern Lebanon, despite Israel asking them to move as its troops crossed the border to target Hezbollah militants. Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday that Israel believed in the language of resolution 1701, but that 'we should think about how to enforce it.' 'We have no desire to stay in Lebanon, and I think the only troops that can do that will be the Lebanese military and UNIFIL, but they need to have the strength, the power and the ability to ensure that Hezbollah is not coming back to the same places,' Danon told reporters, referring to the peacekeeping mission - the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1q9qw4yjl	2024-10-09T13:43:19-07:00

IDF places hopes in new laser anti-rocket systems amid expanding ...	As Hezbollah continues to target northern and central Israel with rocket and missile barrages, security officials hope to expedite laser system allowing for faster and cheaper interceptions Fighting along Israel’s northern border is intensifying, with increased rocket fire aimed at the country. The IDF's operations in villages near the northern border focus on exposing and destroying Hezbollah infrastructure, supported by artillery and airstrikes. The Israeli Air Force continues its attacks on Hezbollah's weapon stockpiles and command centers across Lebanon, including in Beirut’s Dahieh quarter. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday visited the IDF Northern Command to assess the army's progress in southern Lebanon. However, shortly before Gallant detailed the IDF’s operational achievements in the north, Hezbollah launched a heavy barrage of over 100 rockets toward the Haifa Bay area and several towns in the Western Galilee, most of which were intercepted by Iron Dome batteries. Factories under fire Frequent rocket barrages from Lebanon have caused damage to several factories in northern Israel over the past few days. Roy Israeli, northen region manager at the Manufacturers' Association of Israel (MAI), told Ynet’s sister outlet Calcalist that production has continued as usual despite the damage, much of which was caused by rocket fragments. According to the association, the recent expansion of rocket fire and the increase in launch volume haven’t impacted worker attendance at the factories significantly. However, some northern industrialists, including those in factories located dozens of kilometers from the Lebanese border, reported receiving inquiries from overseas customers asking them to ensure future supply capabilities, even in scenarios of war escalation and increased rocket fire from Lebanon. MAI President Ron Tomer noted that producers are facing increased demand to boost production for stockpiling for up to six months. This comes in addition to expanding their procurement of large quantities of raw materials. Tomer warned that this issue could significantly increase financing costs for industrialists as they work hard to maintain their business relationships with global customers. Amid the escalation, the Economy Ministry has expanded its plan to establish shelters in factories in the north. The program's budget stands at NIS 10 million ($2.6 million) and includes distributing shelters to factories located within 40 km (25 miles) of the Lebanese border. These areas include towns in the Jezreel Valley and Haifa, which have been increasingly exposed to rocket fire from Lebanon in recent weeks. Accelerating deployment of laser defense systems While Hezbollah's heavy rocket barrage toward Israel’s coastal cities was largely intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system, security officials are placing high hopes on Rafael Advanced Defense Systems’ 'Iron Beam' laser defense system, which is expected to be operational in the coming months. The air defense system is expected to dramatically improve and reduce the cost of intercepting rockets and drones launched at Israel. There has been progress in innovative development programs over the past year, and Rafael intends to present its new Lite Beam system next week at a defense exhibition in the U.S. The system is based on laser technology and provides mobile defense for maneuvering forces against drones and UAVs. The system is mounted on a Plasan Stormer vehicle and carries the Samson 30mm gun in addition to its laser targeting system as a complementary interception solution if a laser can’t be used to target the threat. The larger Iron Beam system is designed to intercept targets at short range and will initially be integrated into the Iron Dome system. With the incorporation of the laser system into Iron Dome, interceptions will be carried out using either a high-powered laser beam or an interception missile, depending on the circumstances. This dual capability addresses the limitations of laser use under conditions such as cloud cover, fog or dust storms. A special U.S. grant of approximately $8.7 billion from President Joe Biden is set to allow Israel to expand its interceptor stockpiles and munitions inventory, including allocating budgets to accelerate the development of laser-based defense systems at Rafael. Elbit Systems is also involved in these programs, working on airborne laser products that would enable fighter jets and UAVs to intercept threats far from Israel's borders. The Israel Aerospace Industries has its own laser program, which has been significantly accelerated over the past year. In addition to the mobile laser system Rafael plans to unveil next week in Washington, it will also showcase enhanced capabilities in its Trophy active defense system for tanks and armored personnel carriers. The system is already operational in the IDF and installed on vehicles used in the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The system provides protection against anti-tank missiles and rockets fired at moving forces. According to Rafael, variations of the Trophy system have been adapted in recent years for numerous platforms used by armies worldwide, offering comprehensive protection for the crews operating them.

Watch: Hezbollah terrorists eliminated from the air by drones	IDF Spokesperson's Unit says troops from the specialized 636 drone strikes unit eliminated several Hezbollah terror cells, and killed armed terrorists including a platoon commander Troops from Unit 636, a specialized Israeli military unit skilled in drone strikes against enemy targets, operating under the command of the 36th Division, have eliminated several Hezbollah terror cells and destroyed significant terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon. According to The IDF Spokesperson's Unit, in recent days, the unit has directed drones to assist in operations, in coordination with the division’s artillery units, successfully killing armed terrorists, including a Hezbollah platoon commander. Over the past year, the unit has participated in operations in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and now in the ongoing fighting along Israel’s northern front. Overnight, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) carried out a series of precision strikes targeting a Hezbollah weapons production facility and an intelligence headquarters in Dahieh, a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut. To minimize civilian casualties, the IAF issued warnings to residents in the area before the strike. Hezbollah has long embedded its weapons storage sites beneath residential buildings, schools, mosques, and universities, putting civilians at risk. On Tuesday, the IAF conducted another intelligence-driven strike on Hezbollah's drone storage facilities, both above and below ground, along with ready-to-use launchers belonging to the group's aerial unit. The IDF says that it 'continues to operate with the aim of degrading and dismantling Hezbollah's military capabilities.'

JERUSALEM, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant appeared on Wednesday to say that retaliation against Iran for its missile attack will be 'lethal, precise and surprising,' in a video published on Israeli media on Wednesday. After describing Iran's Oct. 1 missile attack as a failure, Gallant said: 'Whoever attacks us will be hurt and will pay a price. Our attack will be deadly, precise and above all surprising, they will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjqla4vkke	2024-10-09T10:34:31-07:00	
Netanyahu and Biden, joined by Harris, talk for 50 minutes	It's been six weeks since the president and PM last spoke; They discussed Israel's plans for a retaliatory attack against Iran; After conversation Defense Minister Yoav Gallant says that 'Our attack will be deadly, precise and, above all, surprising' U.S. President Joe Biden spoke Wednesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 50 minutes, a day after the prime minister's decision to postpone Defense Minister Yoav Galant's scheduled visit to Washington until he had a conversation with Biden. Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris also joined the conversation, according to the White House. According to officials in Jerusalem cited by Reuters, the conversation between the two leaders was intended, among other things, to discuss Israel's plans for a retaliatory attack against Iran, in response to the latest barrage it launched into Israel. Also present in Netanyahu's office during the conversation were the Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer; the prime minister's political advisor Ophir Falk; National Security Council Deputy Director Gil Reich, Head of the National Security Council Foreign Policy Division, Dr. Joseph Drazanin; and prime minister's military secretary, Maj. Roman Goffman. Shortly after the conversation, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant - who visited Unit 9900 of the Intelligence Division, which is used to collect visual intelligence - said that 'the Iranian attack was aggressive but inaccurate. Whoever attacks us will be hurt and will pay a price. Our attack will be deadly, precise and above all surprising, they will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results.' Gallant received a briefing from unit 9900 on the preparation for the latest attacks in Lebanon, and also for attacks that are expected in other arenas. 'Thanks to you, we see the entire Middle East - Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq and everywhere else,' he said. 'We see exactly and in a very, very focused way any place we want.' Gallant's flight to the U.S., now postponed until after a potential discussion between Biden and Netanyahu on Wednesday, was aimed at enhancing coordination between Jerusalem and Washington as the IDF prepares to respond to Iran's second ballistic missile attack within a year. Gallant, as noted, delayed his planned night flight partly because the government had not yet approved his trip. It is believed Netanyahu is actually wary of Gallant gaining more clout in the eyes of Biden and wants to demonstrate to his Likud base that he is preventing Gallant from coordinating with the U.S. The Americans were utterly shocked on Tuesday, as this has gone from being a conflict between Netanyahu and Gallant to one also between Netanyahu and the Biden administration. The Defense Minister was invited by the Americans, who see him as 'the war liaison,' and he coordinated his trip with the Prime Minister's office. Until Tuesday night, despite lacking travel approval, Gallant's associates were confident the trip would proceed as planned. Meanwhile, even before Netanyahu and Biden's conversation, the Prime Minister spoke with former U.S.; President Donald Trump, who is the Republican Party's current candidate for presidential elections next month. Netanyahu's office reported that Trump called the prime minister on his own initiative about a week ago, and congratulated him on the determined and powerful actions Israel took against Hezbollah. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham also participated in the conversation. An Israeli official told The Washington Post that Netanyahu had tried several times to reach Biden by phone but was unsuccessful. An American official denied these claims, calling them untrue. 'The administration consults with Israelis on a number of levels and we've always said the leaders will speak soon, following these consultations. That is what we agreed in recent weeks,' he said, adding that a call on Tuesday was not possible because Biden was traveling to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to address the hurricane response. According to The Wall Street Journal, Israel has refused to provide the Biden administration with details of its planned attack on Iran after Iran launched its missile strike on Israel earlier this month. Hours after news broke of Netanyahu delaying Gallant’s visit, U.S. officials told the Journal there was growing frustration in the administration over being repeatedly surprised by Israeli military operations in Lebanon and Gaza. Sources detailed a conversation between Gallant and his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, shortly after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a bombing of his bunker in Beirut last month. 'Sorry, what did you say?' Austin reportedly asked, according to officials with knowledge of the exchange. Austin also questioned whether Israel intended to defend itself on its own, given the lack of communication with the administration. Sources said Austin was frustrated because the U.S. had insufficient time to organize its forces to assist Israel or protect American troops in the Middle East. Washington officials expressed hope that in the future, they would have more advance notice of attacks that could lead to greater American involvement, as Israel continues to vow retaliation against Iran. American officials believe Israel will target Iranian military and intelligence assets. A conversation between Biden and Netanyahu, details of which were revealed on Tuesday in excerpts from a new book by journalist Bob Woodward, reportedly led to a tempered Israeli response to an Iranian attack in April. Biden is said to have told Netanyahu to 'take the win' after the Iranian attack failed, advising that no further action was necessary. Israel may be withholding information from the administration due to concerns over leaks. Shortly before the Israeli ground offensive in southern Lebanon began last week, U.S. officials leaked details of the IDF's operational plans to the media, likely in an effort to prevent any miscalculations by Iran, which has since launched over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. Meanwhile, on Tuesday conversations between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden were publicly revealed that resulted in Israel's moderate reaction in Iran. Biden asked Netanyahu to 'take the victory' of the failure of the Iranian attack, telling him, according to a book by journalist Bob Woodward: 'You should not take on step further. Don't do anything.' In the end, as mentioned, Israel reacted in a targeted and limited manner to Iran, when according to reports outside of Israel, it attacked the radar of an advanced air defense battery that protects the reactor in Natanz . It was revealed by Ynet on Tuesday night that this wasn't the first such incident between the two. Prior to the incident barring Gallant from traveling to the U.S. and imposing conditions, which included 'decisions on Israel's next actions,' the prime minister previously demanded amid wartime to talk with a leader of a nation maintaining diplomatic relations with Israel, to which Gallant had discreetly traveled. The conversation occurred, and negotiations with Netanyahu allowed the flight to proceed.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkhj7n41jx	2024-10-09T10:25:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/04/14/B1ebI4BtxR/B1ebI4BtxR_0_0_850_479_0_small.jpg

Erdogan: Israel is a Zionist terrorist state	Turkish president tells lawmakers from his ruling AK party that Hamas terrorists are 'freedom fighters who fight for the honor of the Muslim world' and warns Israel will turn against Turkey next Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called Israel a 'Zionist terrorist organization' in a speech to lawmakers from his ruling Justice and Development Party (AK) on Wednesday. Erdogan criticized the West, especially the United States, for its support to Israel and said Turkey will continue to expose the hypocrisy of the West. Since the start of the war, the Turkish leader has spoken fiercely against Israel including comparing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Hitler and Israel to the Nazis in his speech to the UN General Assembly last month. 'Just as Hitler was stopped by an alliance of humanity 70 years ago, Netanyahu and his murder network must be stopped by an alliance of humanity,' he said. 'The UN General Assembly’s authority to recommend the use of force should be considered.' The Turkish leader said the direct attacks exchanged between Israel and Iran demonstrate the danger of a regional conflict and said Israel's 'expansionist policies' will eventually be turned against Turkey, that 'can burst their bubble.' He also said Israel's illusion of a promised land will lead it to great disappointment and defeat. 'History will never forgive those who cheered for Netanyahu who has the blood of tens of thousands on his hands,' Erdogan said. He praised Hamas, calling the terror group 'freedom fighters who are fighting for the honor of the Muslim world,' adding that they are 'also fighting for Turkey.' Also on Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Hakan Fidan and National Defense Minister Yaşar Guler held a closed door meeting with lawmakers to brief them on Israel's 'aggressive policies' and how they may impact Turkey. The content of the meeting is to remain secret for 10 years. According to a report in Turkey's Hürriyet news paper the meeting was called by lawmakers of the opposition to Erdogan, including the leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) to learn if there is any danger to Turkey from Israel.

Gulf states must not allow use of airspace against Iran, Iranian ...	Iranian Foreign Minister Araqchi warns Gulf states against allowing use of their airspace for attacks, while those states have reassured him of their supposed neutrality, as Gulf oil producers raise output in case regional escalation Tehran has told Gulf Arab states it would be 'unacceptable' if they allowed use of their airspace or military bases against Iran and warned that any such move would draw a response, a senior Iranian official said. The official also said any action by Gulf states to balance oil markets should Iranian energy facilities be hit by Israel was not part of the discussions so far. The comments come amid growing concern over possible Israeli retaliation for last week's Iranian missile attack, as Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi visits Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states including Qatar for talks on Wednesday. They followed discussions between Iran and Gulf Arab capitals last week on the sidelines of an Asia conference in Qatar, when Gulf states sought to reassure Iran of their neutrality in any conflict between Tehran and Israel. 'Iran made it clear that any action by a Persian Gulf country against Tehran, whether through the use of airspace or military bases, will be regarded by Tehran as an action taken by the entire group, and Tehran will respond accordingly,' the senior Iranian official told Reuters. 'The message emphasized the need for regional unity against Israel and the importance of securing stability,' he said. 'It also made clear that any assistance to Israel, such as allowing the use of a regional country’s airspace for actions against Iran, is unacceptable.' U.S. President Joe Biden held a telephone call on Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that was said to include discussion of any plans to strike Iran, according to a person familiar with the matter. Washington hopes to weigh in on whether the response is appropriate, a separate person briefed on the discussions said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Biden said Friday he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields if he were in Israel's shoes. Last week he also said he would not support Israel striking Iranian nuclear sites. The Iranian official said Tehran did not discuss the issue of Gulf Arab oil producers raising output if Iranian production were disrupted during any escalation. U.S. news website Axios, citing Israeli officials, reported last week that Israel could target oil production facilities within Iran as retaliation. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, which is de-facto led by Saudi Arabia, has enough spare oil capacity to make up any loss of Iranian supply if an Israeli retaliation knocks out some of the country's facilities. Much of OPEC's spare capacity is in the Middle East Gulf region. Iran has not threatened to attack Gulf oil facilities but has previously warned that if 'Israel supporters' intervene directly their interests in the region would be targeted. Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia has had a political rapprochement with Tehran in recent years, which has helped ease regional tensions, but relations remain difficult. Saudi Arabia has been wary of an Iranian strike on its oil facilities since a 2019 attack on its key refinery at Abqaiq briefly shut down more than 5% of global oil supply. Iran denied involvement. A Western diplomat in the Gulf said that during Thursday's Gulf-Iran meeting in Doha, Iran made clear that Tehran had called for regional unity in the face of an Israeli attack and that it considered neutrality of Gulf states a bare minimum. The diplomat said Iran had made clear that Tehran would keep a close eye on how each Gulf country responded in the case of an Israeli attack, and also how U.S. bases housed in their countries were used. Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates all host U.S. military facilities or troops. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byaqugnkkx	2024-10-09T09:09:01-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2020/05/31/SyUNuXZhU/SyUNuXZhU_101_0_411_231_0_small.jpg

FBI returns Nazi-looted Monet pastel to Jewish owners' heir	In 1940, the Nazis seized a Claude Monet pastel and seven other works of art from Adalbert 'Bela' and Hilda Parlagi, a Jewish couple forced to flee their Vienna home after Austria was annexed into Adolf Hitler's Germany. After the war, Bela Parlagi searched for his art to no avail until his death in 1981. His son continued the search without success until he died in 2012. But on Wednesday, more than 80 years later, Parlagi's granddaughters Helen Lowe and Francoise Parlagi were reunited with the missing Monet after the FBI and a Britain-based nonprofit located it in the United States. The 7- by 11-inch (18- by 28-centimetre) pastel, called 'Bord de Mer,' dates back to 1865 and features a scene from France's Normandy shoreline. The FBI recovered the painting in 2023, after it appeared for sale at a Houston-based gallery. The FBI said the owners of the pastel - Bridget Vita and her late husband Kevin Schlamp, did not realize the Nazis had stolen the Monet and they voluntarily surrendered it.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjcauqnjkx	2024-10-09T08:55:25-07:00

This is why Yoav Gallant's trip to Washington was scrapped by Net...	Inside sources speculate that the Israeli premier did not want to give Gallant more clout with Biden, which is why a phone call between the president and the PM was promptly scheduled; Netanyahu tells US Jewish organizations the struggle against Iran is one the whole western world shares Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was set to touch down in Washington at midday on Wednesday. However, this visit – prompted by an invitation from the Pentagon last week – was abruptly postponed on Tuesday night due to last minute stipulations from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Gallant is now sharing his perspective on the trip's delay, mere hours before his intended departure to the U.S. As per his office's statement, last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin extended an invitation to Gallant for a formal visit to the United States. Upon receiving this invitation, Gallant promptly informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to Gallant's office, 'both agreed that the minister would prepare to depart on Tuesday night, following security discussions.' Gallant says the trip was deferred 'at the Prime Minister's request,' pending a conversation between Netanyahu and President Joe Biden, as became apparent on Tuesday. The Defense Minister's office added, 'The Defense Minister represents the Israeli government and the prime minister, and any diplomatic travel will only proceed with official approval.' While awaiting a call from Biden, Netanyahu on Wednesday met with a delegation from the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, making a pointed remark directed at the Biden administration: 'There is only one force in the world confronting Iran – and that is Israel. However, this is not solely our fight – it is the struggle of the free world.' It was revealed by Ynet on Tuesday night that this wasn't the first such incident between the two. Prior to the incident barring Gallant from traveling to the U.S. and imposing conditions, which included 'decisions on Israel's next actions,' the prime minister previously demanded amid wartime to talk with a leader of a nation maintaining diplomatic relations with Israel, to which Gallant had discreetly traveled. The conversation occurred, and negotiations with Netanyahu allowed the flight to proceed. The Americans were stunned Gallant's flight to the U.S., now postponed until after a potential discussion between Biden and Netanyahu on Wednesday, was aimed at enhancing coordination between Jerusalem and Washington as the IDF prepares to respond to Iran's second ballistic missile attack within a year. Gallant, as noted, delayed his planned night flight partly because the government had not yet approved his trip. It is believed Netanyahu is actually wary of Gallant gaining more clout in the eyes of Biden and wants to demonstrate to his Likud base that he is preventing Gallant from coordinating with the U.S. The Americans were utterly shocked on Tuesday, as this has gone from being a conflict between Netanyahu and Gallant to one also between Netanyahu and the Biden administration. The Defense Minister was invited by the Americans, who see him as 'the war liaison,' and he coordinated his trip with the Prime Minister's office. Until Tuesday night, despite lacking travel approval, Gallant's associates were confident the trip would proceed as planned. Biden has long avoided a conversation with Netanyahu, while he spoke with President Isaac Herzog on the anniversary of the October 7 massacre the day before. The two are expected to speak Wednesday, in the wake of Netanyahu's ultimatum. However, U.S. sources denied an Israeli claim Wedenesday morning that Biden refused a direct request from Netanyahu for a conversation. Sources in Washington stated the conversation between the two leaders was not feasible on Tuesday because Biden was engaged in discussions on response efforts to Hurricane Helene that struck the United States, and there is no connection to tensions with Netanyahu. According to U.S. sources, who subtly criticized Netanyahu, 'a conversation between them was supposed to occur later this week, and Israel was aware of this.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rkmotbnyje	2024-10-09T08:16:28-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2023/10/18/rkWyiJr6Wa/rkWyiJr6Wa_0_0_1280_852_0_small.jpg

Hamas posts video falsely claiming its snipper shoots soldier	Terror group snipers target troops in Gaza; IDF working to identify, eliminate sniper Hamas falsely claimed that one of its snipers hit an IDF soldier, in a clip it posted on social media to its followers in which a sniper from Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip is seen shooting and apparently hitting an IDF soldier. The snipper did shoot but missed the soldier who was unhurt, however. The Hamas terrorist carried an American-made Barrett rifle and shot a 0.5 caliber bullet that can be fatal; but, the shot missed the soldier, who realized he was in danger and ducked behind a dirt embankment near by protecting him and his commanding officer. Other officers began working to pinpoint the sniper who has thus far escaped capture. In the images posted by Hamas, the sniper's face was blurred and a bag nearby bore the saying: 'one bullet, one officer.' Hamas snipers have succeeded in targeting troops in Gaza in recent months and to document their attacks in posts. The terrorists also filmed drones launched to gather intelligence about IDF troops. The IDF is concentrating efforts on locating and eliminating the threats posed by the snipers. The soldier that was a target of the sniper is part of the ultra-Orthodox IDF unit which has been fighting in Gaza for the past 10 months. The forces are also tasked with preventing far-right activists from entering the Strip in their efforts to force new Israeli settlements there.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bydxcbeyjx	2024-10-09T07:21:19-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/09/HkV4002X1kg/HkV4002X1kg_155_83_651_366_0_small.jpg

Joshua Tartakovsky entered Lebanon using a British passport and presented himself as an investigative journalist, but after exhibiting erratic behavior he was detained by local police who found an Israeli passport among his belongings Joshua (Shuki) Tartakovsky, previously part of the ultra-Orthodox community in Jerusalem and an alumnus of Brown University and LSE, was detained in Beirut on Tuesday. He had recently entered Lebanon by presenting himself as an 'investigative journalist.' His conduct drew suspicion from the Lebanese authorities and, upon his detention by local police, an Israeli passport was discovered in his possession. Social media accounts suggest this wasn't his first visit to Beirut. Tartakovsky entered Lebanon using a British passport but also carried an Israeli one. Al-Akhbar, a Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper, reported security forces apprehended him in Dahieh, two weeks after his arrival in the Lebanese capital. Although he entered Lebanon with other journalists, his behavior raised enough suspicion to lead to his arrest. Al-Akhbar described Tartakovsky as a 42-year-old Israeli born in the United States. His acquaintances describe him as a 'peculiar character.' One noted his frequent shifts in political stance, characterizing him as someone who could be far-right one day and far-left the next, often leaving others confused. His arrest in Lebanon didn't surprise those who knew him. Previously, he posted content supporting Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit or Jewish Power party, yet his friends label him as a leftist 'opposed to wars.' 'He wrote articles against drafting ultra-Orthodox Jews and settlements, then suddenly supported drafting them,' according to an aquaintance. Articles he contributed to certain sites were even removed. >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sywklz4kje	2024-10-09T07:05:43-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/09/B17KU11lVJ1e/B17KU11lVJ1e_0_138_1080_608_0_small.jpg

Netanyahu blocked Gallant's US trip after Biden refused call, rep...	White House denies POTUS snubbed PM, cites Hurricane Helene response; Austin reportedly caught off-guard by Nasrallah assassination amid growing US frustration with Israel’s lack of communication Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prevented Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's trip to Washington after U.S. President Joe Biden reportedly refused to take his call, The Washington Post reported on Wednesday. U.S. officials denied the report, claiming that the president's call with the prime minister was scheduled to take place this week and that they had not spoken earlier due to Biden’s need to address the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Sources close to Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Gallant was informed his trip was not approved prior to Netanyahu and Biden speaking. 'Gallant was invited to Washington and informed the Prime Minister's Office. He was told at the time that he could not travel until the prime minister spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden,' the sources said. 'The decision was not personal and was not an effort to flex muscles. There is a process that must take place so that Gallant travels armed with the Cabinet's decision.' This is not the first time Netanyahu has delayed a trip planned by the defense minister until he could personally speak to the leader of the country Gallant was scheduled to visit. Ultimately, the visit was allowed to proceed after Netanyahu had the conversation he was seeking. Netanyahu conditioned Gallant's visit to the U.S. on the Security Cabinet’s approval of the response to Iran's attack on Israel and on a conversation with Biden. The two leaders are scheduled to speak later on Wednesday, marking their first conversation since August 22. Following the Iranian missile strike, Biden said he would be speaking with the prime minister, but the call has not taken place in the nine days since. The president did, however, speak with President Isaac Herzog on October 7, marking a year since the Hamas massacre. An Israeli official told The Washington Post that Netanyahu had tried several times to reach Biden by phone but was unsuccessful. An American official denied these claims, calling them untrue. 'The administration consults with Israelis on a number of levels and we've always said the leaders will speak soon, following these consultations. That is what we agreed in recent weeks,' he said, adding that a call on Tuesday was not possible because Biden was traveling to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to address the hurricane response. According to The Wall Street Journal, Israel has refused to provide the Biden administration with details of its planned attack on Iran after Iran launched its missile strike on Israel earlier this month. Hours after news broke of Netanyahu delaying Gallant’s visit, U.S. officials told the Journal there was growing frustration in the administration over being repeatedly surprised by Israeli military operations in Lebanon and Gaza. Sources detailed a conversation between Gallant and his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, shortly after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a bombing of his bunker in Beirut last month. 'Sorry, what did you say?' Austin reportedly asked, according to officials with knowledge of the exchange. Austin also questioned whether Israel intended to defend itself on its own, given the lack of communication with the administration. Sources said Austin was frustrated because the U.S. had insufficient time to organize its forces to assist Israel or protect American troops in the Middle East. Washington officials expressed hope that in the future, they would have more advance notice of attacks that could lead to greater American involvement, as Israel continues to vow retaliation against Iran. American officials believe Israel will target Iranian military and intelligence assets. A conversation between Biden and Netanyahu, details of which were revealed on Tuesday in excerpts from a new book by journalist Bob Woodward, reportedly led to a tempered Israeli response to an Iranian attack in April. Biden is said to have told Netanyahu to 'take the win' after the Iranian attack failed, advising that no further action was necessary. Israel may be withholding information from the administration due to concerns over leaks. Shortly before the Israeli ground offensive in southern Lebanon began last week, U.S. officials leaked details of the IDF's operational plans to the media, likely in an effort to prevent any miscalculations by Iran, which has since launched over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel.

Hadera terrorist's rampage: 4 scenes, attempts motorcycle getaway	Assailant identified as 36-year-old Israeli-Arab from Umm al-Fahm; 'I shouted at him to lie down and shot him in the leg,' says security guard who helped subdue attacker The assailant behind Wednesday’s terror attack in Hadera, which left one victim critically injured, has been identified as a 36-year-old Israeli citizen from Umm al-Fahm. The attacker was shot and subdued by armed civilians on Herbert Samuel Street after attempting to flee. Initially treated as a criminal incident, police later confirmed it was a terror attack. Doctors are fighting to save the life of one victim, while another remains in serious condition, and four others sustained moderate injuries. The Arab municipality of Umm al-Fahm condemned the attack shortly after the assailant's identity was revealed. 'We rushed from site to site,' said local security officer Adi Nataf. 'At first, we thought there were two terrorists and then we heard a call to come to Herber Samuel Street. I saw him wounded and then he stood up, with a coat on, we shouted 'lie down' so that he would not shoot at us, and a reservist fired two shots in the air. I shouted 'lie down' again and shot him in the leg.' Police Commissioner Daniel Levy, who arrived at the scene, acknowledged the strain on police resources amid ongoing rocket fire and terror attacks. 'This is our fate at this time,' he said. Levy vowed to investigate anyone connected to the attack and criticized gaps in intelligence, noting the responsibility of the Shin Bet for preventing such incidents from the West Bank.

Bolivia joins S.Africa ICJ 'genocide' case against Israel	Bolivia has joined South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice that alleges the Israeli Gaza offensive breaches the UN Genocide Convention, the court said on Wednesday. The South American country is the latest of several nations, including Colombia, Libya, Spain and Mexico, to add their weight to the case against Israel, which vehemently denies the accusations. Bolivia already announced in November it was severing diplomatic ties over what it described as the 'disproportionate' attacks on Gaza by Israel. At the time, Israel slammed the move as 'a surrender to terrorism.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syfpgleyyl	2024-10-09T05:10:04-07:00	
Two killed in Lebanon rocket barrage on Kiryat Shmona	First responders find couple critically injured from shrapnel after attack on northern city but had to declare their death shortly after; IDF says about 20 rockets launched in volley A man and a woman were killed in a rocket barrage on Kiryat Shmona, Magen David Adom (MDA) Director Eli Bin confirmed on Wednesday, describing the strike as 'unusual.' MDA had initially reported that the couple, both in their 40s, were critically injured from shrapnel but had to declare their death shortly after. According to IDF, about 20 rockets were launched from Lebanon toward Kiryat Shmona and the surrounding area. Sirens were also activated due to a false alert of a potential hostile aircraft. Fire and Rescue Services said several buildings caught fire after direct hits from the barrage. Five firefighting teams were deployed to contain the blazes and search for additional casualties. 'Fires are raging in multiple buildings that sustained direct hits, and firefighters are working to contain the spread while searching for victims,' said Incident Commander Chief Reshef Dror Buchnik. Police have cordoned off the impacted areas, with sappers working to neutralize remaining threats. Authorities urged the public to avoid the scene and not touch rocket debris, which could contain explosives, and to report any findings to emergency services. MDA emergency medic Aviad Hertz, who responded to the scene, said, 'Upon arrival, we found a man and a woman, both in their 40s, unconscious. Despite medical efforts, we had to pronounce them dead at the scene.' Earlier, six people were lightly and moderately wounded in the Haifa Bay area following a rocket barrage from Lebanon. Among the injured is a 16-year-old boy who sustained moderate head injuries from shrapnel. Four others, in their 40s and 50s, suffered light injuries from shrapnel. A 36-year-old motorcyclist was also lightly injured in an accident during the rocket sirens. The IDF reported that approximately 40 rockets were launched from Lebanon, with several rockets being intercepted by air defenses, while others crashed in various locations. Residents in Kiryat Bialik reported power outages following the attack after interception fragments crashed in the city's Zur Shalom cemetery.

IDF hoists Israeli flag over Lebanon's 'Iran Garden'	Troops take operational control over the Shi'ite village of Maroun al-Ras where Iran decided to commemorate its presence in a lavish viewpoint over Israeli border towns IDF footage released on Tuesday revealed forces destroyed southern Lebanon’s 'Iran Garden,' which included a model of the Dome of the Rock in Maroun al-Ras. The garden, located in the Shiite village overlooking the Israeli towns of Avivim and Yiron in the Upper Galilee, had an Israeli flag raised at the site. It was inaugurated in 2010 by former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and served as a vantage point for other Iranian officials to observe Israel and make various commitments regarding Tehran's support for Lebanon over the years. The park was established in a festive ceremony attended by Ahmadinejad who visited southern Lebanon at the time. The former Iranian president even considered throwing a stone toward Israel during that visit. The 'Iran Garden' was an Iranian historical center, but also a Lebanese one. Lebanese tourism sites described it as 'a place that commemorates Hezbollah's resilience against the Israeli invasion in 2006.' Over the years, it became a pilgrimage site for senior Iranian officials. The most recent visitor was former Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian who visited the Lebanese village in April 2023, observed Israel and declared, 'We’re here in Maroun al-Ras to loudly proclaim our support for the resistance against the occupation.' Three weeks earlier, during Passover, 34 rockets were fired from Lebanon toward towns in the Galilee — described as the heaviest barrage from Lebanon since the Second Lebanon War in 2006. This marked the beginning of a gradual escalation along the northern border, which intensified significantly in June 2023 when armed Hezbollah terrorists set up a post with two tents on the Israeli side of the border at Mount Dov, eventually reaching a head with the outbreak of war on the northern border following the October 7 massacre. The garden was well-maintained with tables for hosting visitors, a green plaza with seating areas, a cafeteria and an amphitheater overlooking Avivim. It also featured a playground for children, guard towers facing Israel, stone arches, a parking lot and a water well. Its centerpiece was a model of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount, and a cutout of the former Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, pointing toward Israel was also present at the site. 'Iran Garden welcomes you to the most beautiful spot in the south, with a unique view and many activities,' read an invitation to the park circulated online in 2019. In the video, one could notice the Iranian flag flying on Lebanese soil near the children's playground, in the same village where the Israeli flag was raised in recent days. The park was filled with Iranian symbols and signs in Persian. Stopping points in the complex were named after Iranian provinces, giving the impression of a small Iranian enclave in the Shiite village — from which Israel was clearly visible. Judging by its design, this was undoubtedly the goal. Golani Brigade soldiers reached Maroun al-Ras, which became a Shiite symbol during the Second Lebanon War, about a week ago. The IDF quickly gained operational control of the village, enabling relatively free movement in the hostile area. Some commanders can move back and forth to Israeli territory due to its proximity — only 2 aerial km (1.2 miles).

I'd love to go on one last hike with him': Talking with Israel's...	Over 780 children have been orphaned since the war began on October 7; four teenagers who loved their loved ones share their grief and hope Over 780 children have been orphaned since the war began on October 7. They lost their father or mother in the brutal terror attack or in the subsequent fighting in Gaza, the northern border and the West Bank. Some even lost both of their parents. Ynet spoke with four teenagers who lost their loved ones marking a year to the horrible massacre. Mika's father, Lieutenant Colonel Eli Ginsburg, fell on October 8 in the battle for Kibbutz Be'eri. He was the commander of the IDF’s Counter-Terrorism Unit and had already been on leave, preparing for his discharge. Mika, your father didn't have to go and fight. Does that weigh on you? Do you talk about it? 'Sometimes, but ultimately, this was the moment he was preparing for all those years in the army. So I understand his decision. I think everyone knew that he'd be the first to go if something like this happened.' Tell us a little about him. Beyond being a distinguished soldier, what did he love? What did you do together? 'He was the most amazing dad. He was present even when he wasn’t physically at home. He loved the sea and hiking across the country. He had a weird taste in music — really heavy rock.' Are there small things that have happened since October 7 that suddenly bring his presence back into your home? 'Everything. Walking around the house and suddenly remembering something or catching the scent of his cologne. Everything reminds me of him.' Lieutenant Colonel Alim Abdallah from Yanuh-Jat, Maia's father, was also nearing the end of his military service. He fell on the northern border during a battle with terrorists two days after the war started. Maia, the fighting in the north is intense for you. 'There's been a war in the north since October 7, but it seemed like no one cared. Only now, after many have fallen, people are starting to grasp that there's a war in the north.' Tell us a bit about your father. What did he love? What did you do together? 'My dad was my best friend. He was in the army, so he wasn’t always physically with us, but he was always present even at a distance. We talked every day via video calls and messages. I shared everything with him; he knew everything about me.' He served in the IDF for many years. Were you worried about him? 'Yes, I was always worried. Even on his last day, I was worried. My sister had a strong sense that something was happening that day.' Did you have plans for his retirement from the army? 'Yes. We planned to go on a trip together for his retirement.' Major (res.) Eitan Menachem Naaman, father of Evyatar and Avinoam, fell in battle near Sderot during the early days of the war. He was a doctor at Soroka Medical Center and died while serving in the reserves. Avinoam, tell us a bit about your dad. 'A central part of my dad's life was medicine. He started young, volunteering with Magen David Adom at age 15. He later studied medicine and became a doctor after finishing his studies. He was also a doctor in the reserves and volunteered with the Arad Rescue Team at the same time.' He dedicated his life to saving others. 'Yes. He always kept medical equipment at home in case one of us got injured. On Saturdays, people from the community would often come and ask for help with all sorts of injuries and illnesses.' How were you informed about the loss? 'They woke us up at 2 a.m. My sister said to me, 'Avinoam, get up.' I asked her, 'Why should I get up at this hour?' Then I saw soldiers in our house and thought, 'Please, let them just tell me he was injured,' but they said he was killed.' Following the loss, Evyatar, the younger brother, published a booklet aimed at helping other cope with the death of a friend or loved one. Evyatar, tell us how the booklet came about. 'My friend and I were studying a book by a rabbi that talks about challenges during the time of redemption and we noticed that there weren't really any books for youth that discuss death —so we decided to write a booklet together. 'I really believe in taking action, especially when dealing with grief. Action allows you to channel the pain of loss into something positive. Instead of just struggling, you can create and grow from it.' Where did you distribute the booklet? 'In various bookstores. We mainly tried to get it to bereaved families. We received a lot of responses. People told us they were really happy to read it and that it helped them a lot.' A question for all of you: What’s the one thing you miss most? Mika: 'There's not just one thing. I think I just miss the whole concept of 'dad.'' Maia: 'Right, there’s no one specific thing we miss. We really miss everything, even arguing with him.' You say everything triggers the longing, but how have your daily lives changed? Mika: 'Everywhere we go is accompanied by a storm of emotions — sadness, joy and longing. I think I’ve learned a lot about myself during this time.' What have you learned about yourself? 'That I’m capable, that I have strength.' Evyatar and Avinoam, what do you miss? Evyatar: 'I would love to go on one last hike with him. His love for the land of Israel and hiking were very central in his life and we hiked a lot as a family, especially in the Judean Desert.' Avinoam: 'I really miss having a doctor at home. It’s very convenient. When you get hurt, you don’t go to the ER — you just go to your dad, and he tells you, 'Oh, it’s nothing.' If you needed stitches, heaven forbid, he’d stitch you up. Whatever happened, you could just ask him for help.' Are there any stories about your dad you heard after he passed that surprised or made you happy? Mika: 'I was told that when I was born, my dad introduced himself to his soldiers with these words: 'I’m married to Malki, and I have a daughter named Mika. One day, she’ll grow up and join the unit, and God help anyone who tries to mess with her.'' A lot of crazy things happened in Israel this past year. If you had the chance to tell your dad one thing from your personal life or something happening in the country, what would it be? Evyatar: 'Maybe that I wrote the booklet.' Mika: 'I’d tell him about all the terrorists that were eliminated and I think I’d also tell him that I traveled solo a few times.' Maia: 'I’d tell him that war broke out in the north, that I finished 12th grade and that we’re moving forward. Life goes on.'

Waiting to photograph the return of the hostages,' veteran Ynet ...	After 35 years covering warzones, Ziv Koren says nothing prepared him for October 7; 'A photograph is proof that it happened,' he reflects, stressing importance of documenting tragedy Veteran photojournalist Ziv Koren says he can barely remember life before October 7, 2023, the day Hamas launched a brutal attack on Israel. Like many Israelis, Koren awoke to a new reality that day, but as a professional, he quickly headed south under fire to document the events as they unfolded. Since then, he has been working tirelessly. 'I've been working 19 hours a day, seven days a week, for a year straight, to try to produce that significant body of work, which for me is a historical document that should remain here for future generations,' he told Ynet during a special broadcast marking the one-year anniversary of the massacre. Koren believes the world is split into two groups: 'Half who don’t remember October 7, and the other half who don’t believe it really happened. In the end, the photograph is such a significant document. It’s proof that things really happened, and that’s why I try to echo October 7 around the world,' he said, noting his collaboration with Israel’s Foreign Ministry to ensure global awareness. The truth is hidden behind the cliché: one picture is worth a thousand words, no matter how many interviews and speeches will be everywhere, in the global media. This picture, this photograph, has much more meaning. 'True. And that's why, again, I'm trying to create an echo for this footage, so there is also an exhibition that has been on display for several months at the Peres Center, and at the same time, the Foreign Ministry has an exhibition that has already been shown in many countries around the world. There is work with magazines abroad that publish the story, to keep the issue of October 7 relevant, and not forget in any way the issue of the hostages. These are the goals.' You got in touch with some of the hostages who returned, in the sense that you also accompany them. We saw it with Mia there, for example. really. How did such a relationship come about? 'First of all, it's on a daily level. I mean, especially since the project we did for Yedioth and Ynet, that we bring back significant figures whose lives changed on the seventh of October to the place where it happened. I must say that it has almost become my daily life - the fact that I am in touch with hostages who have returned, with wounded people who are still in rehabilitation, with families I accompany.' It also affects the image, the photography. 'Yes, but it's a double-edged sword, because you stab and are stabbed with the same degree of intensity, and these are really people who entered my heart and became, I can say, even my friends. I think that every citizen in the State of Israel should get up every morning and think about what he can do To end this unimaginable saga, there are Israelis who were kidnapped from their beds and are under the ground in Gaza. We cannot afford to normalize this event. It is impossible, and there are great minds in the world Here in this country, which has to find some kind of solution, it is impossible to normalize this event.' What moment are you waiting to take a picture? 'The return of the hostages. There will not be a happier moment than this in the history of the State of Israel.'

Golani officer undergoes final surgery after October 7 wounds, ey...	Lieutenant Niv Baranes severely wounded defending Kibbutz Nir Am from terrorists, leaving his military future uncertain; after multiple surgeries, including one by fellow Golani veteran, Baranes determined to return to battlefield alongside his comrades One year after being critically wounded during the October 7 Hamas attacks, Lieutenant Niv Baranes, 22, of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, has undergone his final surgery. The procedure was performed by Dr. Oren Michaeli, a Jewish-American surgeon who traveled to Israel specifically for the operation. Dr. Michaeli, who served in the Golani Brigade like Baranes, was joined by Prof. Dana Egozi, head of Plastic Surgery at Kaplan Medical Center. Baranes was wounded while defending Kibbutz Nir Am, which was spared from being breached by terrorists. 'The siren sounded, and shortly after, a drone dropped a mortar on us. We began fighting at 6:30 a.m.,' Baranes recalled. 'We attacked four terrorists before they could cross the fence.' During the battle, Baranes was shot in both hands. Despite being critically injured, he fought on for three hours before being evacuated to Kaplan Medical Center, where he underwent 12 surgeries over five weeks. During the battle, Sergeant Matan Abergil was killed after throwing himself on a grenade to save his comrades. 'I was in the field for three hours with a tourniquet, without reinforcements or anything,' Baranes said. 'Around 10:00 a.m., I was evacuated to Nir Am and arrived at Kaplan Medical Center by 1:30 p.m. I was hospitalized there for five weeks, undergoing 12 surgeries in a month. The bullets shattered my left arm. Last week, they stitched my nerves. 'I know all the guys who fell. It's not easy, but we have to keep moving forward. It will always be with me. Nir Am was not breached, partly thanks to my unit and my soldiers. We managed to protect the kibbutz. Now, either I'll return to the army, or I'll start real life.' Dr. Amir Oron, a senior orthopedic and hand surgeon at Kaplan, explained that hypersensitivity in Baranes' radial nerve required the expertise of Dr. Michaeli, who volunteered for the procedure. 'Niv dreams of returning to combat service, and I hope we can make that possible,' Oron said.

Sinwar 'revived the practice of suicide bombings', report says	Article details how Hamas' leader instructed terror group officials to reinstate attacks it avoided since the end of the Second Intifada days before a failed bombing in Tel Aviv The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar ordered to reimplement suicide bombing attacks against Israelis during the summer amid the war in Gaza shortly before a terrorist attempted to carry out an attack of that nature in Tel Aviv. 'the attack sent an unmistakable message,' the Wall Street Journal wrote. 'Now is the time to revive suicide bombings,' Sinwar said in a directive to a senior Hamas official according to an Arab intelligence source talking to the outlet. 'What a blessing it is that my bones become shrapnel that blow apart the usurping Zionist Jews,' Hamas terrorist Ja’far Sa’d Saeed Muna, who carried out the planned attack, said in a video later published by the Gazan terror group. According to the outlet, such attacks were largely discontinued by Hamas in the last two decades, and some of its officials feared renewing them would turn the terror group into a 'political paraiah.' However, 'Despite misgivings within Hamas, no one was willing to speak out against the practice once Sinwar was at the helm of the group,' the Arab intelligence source told the outlet. According to the Wall Street Journal, internal disagreements within Hamas have been present for years between some seeking the ultimate destruction of Israel via terror and those wishing to use these methods to acquire a legitimate political position for the ultimate goal of establishing a Palestinian state. 'Under Sinwar, Hamas can be expected to be a much clearer-cut, hard-line fundamentalist organization,' Matthew Levitt, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute think tank, told the Wall Street Journal. The American outlet continued to detail the mounting differences between Sinwar and Hamas' previous politburo head Ismail Haniyeh who was eliminated by Israel back in July. According to the Wall Street Journal, the two bolstered the terror group's ties with Iran, but Haniyeh believed Sinwar failed to understand Hamas' need to portray a legitimate political image for the Palestinian people on the international stage. The outlet added that while Haniyeh — who was present in Qatar alongside the rest of the group's politburo on October 7 — was aware of the planned massacre but was taken by surprise at its timing. 'Hamas officials in Doha, while publicly praising the October 7 attack, began privately criticizing Sinwar as a 'megalomaniac,'' Arab and Hamas officials told the Wall Street Journal. According to the report, Hamas’s political leadership started meeting with other 'Palestinian factions in early December to discuss reconciliation and a postwar plan without consulting Sinwar,' and added Haniyeh was open to an option of demilitarization of the terror group and a cease-fire agreement in Gaza, which Sinwar criticized as a 'shameful and outrageous,' move.

Tunnel rescue attempt, remote training and the 'Jewish Schindler'...	Nearly 10 years after 11-year-old Fawzia Amin Sido was kidnapped and taken to Gaza, she managed to send a message to her family through TikTok; They contacted Steve Maman, a Canadian-Moroccan Jew who had previously helped rescue more than 100 other Yazidi girls Months of negotiations, successes and setbacks culminated in the rescue of Fawzia Amin Sido, a 21-year-old Yazidi woman who was sold to a Hamas terrorist affiliated with ISIS in 2014, and freed last week from Gaza. The man behind the operation was Steve Maman, a Canadian-Moroccan Jewish businessman, known as the 'Jewish Schindler,' for his efforts in rescuing more than 100 Yazidi girls from ISIS. Fawzia's story raises questions about the potential for rescuing Israeli hostages who have been held in Gaza for more than a year. Like them, Fawzia was under the control of terror groups in Gaza. She managed to survive alone for nearly a year before sending a sign of life from the enclave. When Yazidis in Iraq face trouble, they know to call Maman – the man who has helped free many Yazidi captives. In an interview with Ynet, Maman explained that he is one of the few Jews the Yazidis know, and given his long history with their community they believed he was the right person to help with Gaza. Maman described the intense months leading up to the successful rescue, involving high-level political and military contacts in Israel and the U.S., even reaching out to former President Donald Trump to pass information to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'It all started in November 2023,' Maman said. 'Fawzia managed to upload a TikTok video, and her family realized she was still alive.' From that moment, the family knew they had to contact Maman because of his experience with the Yazidis. In a 2015 interview, Maman said Oscar Schindler, who saved about 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust, had been a major inspiration. 'He’s a hero not just to me but to everyone,' Maman said at the time, and since then he has continued his work. Growing up in Morocco, Maman learned about coexistence and heard stories about King Mohammed V, who is regarded as a hero among Moroccan Jews for protecting Jews during World War II. 'I'm the only Jew the Yazidis know who is connected to them,' Maman explained. 'Their logic was that because I’m Jewish I could get her out of Gaza. I wish it had been that easy. It was the hardest rescue operation I’ve ever done. The geopolitical challenges between Iraq and Israel, two countries that don’t communicate, made it so difficult. I eventually had to divide the tasks and work with each side separately. I needed Israel to open the door for her.' Maman said they trained Fawzia for months, teaching her to familiarize herself with the area in Gaza and approach Israeli forces. 'We trained her to make contact with the IDF, identify fences, and spot potential crossings,' he said. Meanwhile, constant negotiations were underway with various parties to solve the complex mission. In May, Maman visited Israel after one rescue attempt had already failed and shared Fawzia’s story during a Knesset meeting. One of the initial plans was to smuggle Fawzia into Egypt. 'Israel was focused on the war. I told my team we might be able to get her through the tunnels. I also had a team on the Egyptian side ready to pick her up.' Maman explained that external intermediaries indirectly offered to pay Hamas terrorists $5,000 to allow her passage through the tunnels. 'That was the price at the time to move her through the tunnels. Just as we were close to executing the plan, Egypt tightened its border control with Gaza, making it very difficult to cross. The fighting intensified, and Israel moved into the area.' At that point, Maman realized the Egypt plan had failed, and he shifted his focus to Israel. 'I said, there’s an option. I’m here now. There’s a Yazidi girl in Gaza. Let’s try to solve this diplomatically.' One of the biggest challenges was obtaining a passport or travel documents for her. 'With the help of Iraq and Jordan, I managed to get her a passport using a photo from a WhatsApp video call,' Maman said. The passport was essentially a one-way travel document through the Allenby Bridge border crossing between Israel and Jordan, which is how Fawzia ultimately left Gaza. Fawzia endured a harrowing ordeal in Gaza, with days spent wandering the streets and experiences too painful to put into words. Eventually, the gates to Israel opened for her, and from there she made her way to Iraq. 'Israel participated in the rescue,' Maman emphasized. 'This story shows that the Palestinians don’t just have a problem with Jews. They have a problem with every other non-Jew, or someone who is not Muslim.. This is the proof – a Yazidi woman held hostage.' Fawzia is now with her family in Iraq, leaving behind years of hardship in Gaza but also precious things close to her heart. Her recovery is complex, and she has been forbidden from discussing her ordeal or the details of her rescue for now. However, an official statement is expected to be released on her behalf soon.

Netanyahu blocks Gallant's trip to US, after setting conditions f...	Prime minister prevents defense minister from traveling to Washington to coordinate retaliation against Iran with Pentagon unless he can speak with Biden and Cabinet first approves next steps in war; Gallant was to meet with counterpart to ask for assistance in case of further Iranian assaults Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was set to leave Israel for Washington Tuesday night for a visit expected to tighten coordination between Israel and the U.S. amid preparations for an Israeli retaliation for the Iranian ballistic missile attack. However, as of late Tuesday night the flight was not yet approved, the trip is in danger of being canceled and U.S. officials are reportedly shocked over the issue. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set two conditions before approving Gallant's flight: a conversation to be held between the prime minister and U.S. President Joe Biden, after weeks of no communication between the two leaders, and a Security Cabinet approval of Israel's next steps. The government had not approved Gallant’s trip as of very late Tuesday night, leading to the announcement that it had being postponed. The Pentagon announced that Gallant would not be arriving in the U.S. as scheduled. 'We were just informed that Minister Gallant will be postponing his trip to Washington,' Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told a news briefing, referring questions about why Gallant canceled to Israel's government. Biden has avoided speaking with Netanyahu for several weeks, though he has had conversations with President Isaac Herzog, including this week for the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack. Netanyahu reportedly fears giving Gallant more clout with Biden and wants to show his Likud voter base that he’s preventing Gallant from coordinating with the Americans. U.S. officials are reportedly stunned – as this has gone from being a conflict between Netanyahu and Gallant to one also between Netanyahu and the Biden administration. The Americans were the ones who invited the defense minister, who is seen as their 'point of contact for the war,' and Gallant had coordinated his trip with the Prime Minister's Office beforehand. Up until hours before the scheduled departure, those close to Gallant were confident the trip would proceed as planned. 'Ultimately, decisions about cabinet members' trips to Washington are up to the Israeli government,' U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on the issue in a briefing. Gallant’s main goal in his trip was to project a show of power from Washington in a play to deter possible Iranian attacks against Jerusalem following a possible retaliation. NBC reported on Tuesday, citing two U.S. officials, that Israel hadn’t provided the U.S. with details regarding its response to the Iranian missile attack even after senior U.S. military officials publicly discussed the possibility of supporting an Israeli response. According to the officials, Gallant and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin discussed potential response options, but Israel’s final decision wasn’t shared. American officials believe that Israel has yet to make a definitive decision on how to act. The potential targets for the attack, according to the sources, include military and intelligence complexes, air defense systems and energy infrastructure. 'Gallant and Austin did not discuss nuclear facilities as possible targets,' NBC reported. Gallant and Israeli defense officials have been advocating for a strike on Iran and have presented plans to lawmakers, although no decision appears to have been made yet. Gallant was expected to meet with Austin to discuss the matter. In addition to Austin, Gallant was also scheduled to meet with President Biden’s advisors amid a severe crisis of trust between Netanyahu and Biden. Gallant was set to arrive in Washington with a clear message for the U.S. administration: Israel needs to strike Iran, but it should be done in the most effective way with maximum coordination with the U.S. Gallant believes the U.S. must project its strength in the region, from sending aircraft carriers to the region to displaying the joint cooperation between Israel and the U.S. While Israel doesn’t expect the U.S. to join in any strike, it looks for American support if and when Iran responds with another missile attack, as part of the international coalition formed during the war. 'We have the ability to cause significant damage to Iran, but the working assumption is that Iran will retaliate, which is why coordination with the U.S. is crucial. Iran is left without Hamas or Hezbollah as effective forces, but that doesn’t mean Israel shouldn’t prepare for a direct Iranian attack.' American officials visiting Israel said on Tuesday. 'It’s important Tehran understands the U.S. is with us in such a case.' Gallant also planned to ask Austin during his visit for aid in the form of various types of weaponry, particularly additional missile defense batteries against Iranian missiles and systems that can support Israel’s Arrow batteries both at sea and on land. Israel also intends to ask for heavy munitions, whose shipment has been delayed for months due to the ongoing war in Gaza. At present, Israel doesn’t face a shortage of munitions, but defense officials wish to prepare for future gaps that could arise in the event of a broader, all-out war. Bibi-Biden relationship revealed in Bob Woodward's new book Also on Tuesday, excerpts of veteran journalist Bob Woodward's new books were released that shed light on Biden's relationships with other world leaders, including Netanyahu. 'That son of a bitch, Bibi Netanyahu, he’s a bad guy. He’s a bad f***ing guy!' Biden said privately about the Netanyahu to one of his associates in the spring of 2024 against the backdrop of the Gaza war, Woodward writes. Following Israel’s entry into Rafah, Biden reportedly called Netanyahu a 'f***ing liar.' Adter the Israeli airstrike on Beirut in July that killed Fuad Shukr, Biden said, according to the book, 'Bibi, what the hell?' and adding 'You know, the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor.'

Loaded launcher and dugout for hiding: This is what a Hezbollah f...	IDF commander showcasing Hezbollah rocket launchers says it was used to fire daily at northern Israeli communities over the past year The IDF released a video on Tuesday showing Capt. N, a company commander in the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade, unveiling a rocket-launching site that was discovered during ground operations. Capt. N displayed a loaded launcher concealed beneath a tree in an olive grove, connected by an electric cable to a more distant position from which Hezbollah terrorists could remotely fire the rockets. 'This is the launcher. As you can see, it’s aimed south, toward Israel. Right now, it’s armed with four warheads,' he explained while crouching beside the launcher. 'This launcher fired daily at northern Israeli communities over the past year – but not anymore.' The video then cut to a nearby position, where the commander showed a hidden dugout used by the rocket operator to retreat to safety after launching, protecting himself from IDF counterattacks. 'He hides here until the airstrikes are over, then he can return to his operational hideout,' Capt. N explained. The commander also pointed out boxes of Kalashnikov ammunition and the electrical mechanism that allowed the rockets to be launched from a distance. He showed a cable connecting the rocket-launching position to the launcher and another cable leading to what he described as an 'advanced weapons cache' containing rockets ready for firing. The video later shifted to a civilian structure where the commander showed explosives and launchers found in the home’s kitchen, with an ammunition crate hidden under the stove. In another video, a different soldier revealed a large weapons cache discovered in a house in one of the southern Lebanese villages where Golani troops had been operating. The soldier explained that the cache contained 'numerous anti-tank warheads,' enough for four Hezbollah ambushes. 'All of this weaponry was intended for northern Israeli civilians. It was within immediate reach and is very new, meaning the previous stock had already been used. We’ve disrupted a Hezbollah operation here,' he said, emphasizing, 'We’re here to protect the people of Israel and bring them back to the north.' According to an IDF statement, the Golani Brigade's combat team discovered a site in the area overlooking northern Israeli communities near the border, and it also uncovered underground infrastructure, hiding spots, and staging areas used by Hezbollah terrorists. Inside the residential building, the IDF discovered and destroyed a weapons cache, including rocket launchers in the kitchen, weapons, anti-tank missiles, camouflage nets, and combat vests. The IDF noted that they also found and eliminated weapons intended for planned ambushes against Israeli forces and northern Israeli towns.

Up at 4:45 a.m. to make the perfect lunchbox': Israel’s growing ...	Shaped bread, vegetable skewers and colorful stickers: more Israeli moms are replacing standard school sandwiches with creative lunchboxes; we spoke to three mothers about the trend’s benefits, costs, time commitment and the kids’ reactions When Maayan Hafuta from Nahariya goes to bed, she sets her alarm for 4:45 a.m. But it’s not for a long commute, an early workout or to watch the sunrise. Maayan has a passion for creating elaborate and beautifully designed lunchboxes for her three children – Noam, 9, Liam, 7, and Ilai, 5. 'I admit, I’m a little obsessed,' Maayan says. 'It takes me about two hours each morning, depending on how creative I decide to get. I don’t prepare anything the night before because I want it all to be fresh. I started when my eldest began preschool, and every year I get more into it. I spend hours on AliExpress looking for accessories to bring my ideas to life. I work in HR, mostly from home, but even when I used to commute, I still made the lunchboxes. If it means waking up 30 minutes earlier, I’ll do it.' How early can you wake up? 'I know it sounds crazy, but when you love something, it’s not that hard. This time in the kitchen with the lunchboxes is my 'me time.' It's more than just food for the kids – it's how I express myself. Even recently, when our routine was disrupted because of the fighting in the north and the schools were closed, I still got up and made the boxes. The kids love it, and that makes it all worth it.' Are they picky eaters? 'They’re not too fussy, but I’m very particular about making sure they eat well. We eat with our eyes first – when food looks good, you want to eat it, even if you’re not very hungry. I get so excited when the boxes come back empty.' What do you put in the lunchboxes? 'I wouldn’t call them 'healthy,' but I try to keep a balance. I do sneak in some sweets. My kids aren’t big fans of fruits and veggies, but I always include them. No tomatoes, because I know they won’t touch them, but I’ll cut cucumbers or carrots into fun shapes. I also use an edible marker to draw on sandwiches, which might have cottage cheese, an omelet, cheese or sometimes chocolate spread. 'There are always a few options in the box. If I bake muffins or pancakes, I try to make them healthier with ingredients like soy milk and spelt flour – things they usually wouldn’t eat, but they don’t mind when it’s presented this way. I also make extra food so they can share with other kids. Of course, I follow all the allergy guidelines set by the school.' 'I also include little notes with good morning wishes or riddles, and I stick on motivational stickers like ‘Mom loves you’ or ‘From the heart,’ just to add more meaning to the box and show them I’m thinking of them.' Do you go all out for meals at home too? 'Actually, yes. I don’t cut food into shapes, but I’m still particular about presentation. If I’m making burgers, I’ll add a toothpick and wrap the fries in paper to make the meal feel special. The kids love it –they think they’re eating at a restaurant.' What does your husband think? (Laughs) 'He thinks I’m certifiably crazy. Every night, I write out a menu for the next day and plan how I’ll arrange the lunchboxes. Sometimes he texts me things like, ‘I married a crazy lady – love you, go to bed!’ But in the end, he goes along with it. After all, I’m doing it for his kids, too.' How do others react? 'Some people ask if I don’t have anything better to do and suggest I sleep more, but those who know me understand. My sister says there’s no way she’d wake up that early to make lunchboxes. But I love it. When I started sharing my lunchboxes online, I got so much positive feedback and questions from people. Sure, there are always going to be those who think it’s a waste of time, but I hear less of that now.' How much do you spend on this hobby? 'I’d rather not say – so my husband doesn’t find out!' (Laughs) 'Of course, it adds up, but most of the items I buy aren’t disposable. I invest in good quality containers that last a long time, but yes, I’m always looking for new things, and that costs money. 'I make sure the lunchboxes are high-quality and completely sealed, so they last for years. I decorate them with stickers, but if the box is lower quality, it’s a nightmare to peel them off. At the beginning of each school year, I buy three high-quality lunchboxes, and each one costs around 170 shekels ($45). I know it sounds excessive, but normal people can use the same box for several years – I'm just a bit more obsessed!' Belgian waffle-shaped casserole For several years now, the lunchbox craze has been thriving in Israel, drawing inspiration from Japan’s bento culture. A bento is a takeout meal packed in a compact box, designed to maximize space and feature visually appealing, neatly arranged food. In stores, you'll find dozens of accessories for decorating food, from cutters in various shapes to colorful skewers. On TikTok, there are thousands of videos teaching how to make a green apple look cool, Instagram is filled with perfectly styled lunchbox photos, and on Facebook, groups connect thousands of mothers who want to give their kids more than just a plain sandwich. One such group, Kids' Lunchboxes, has 37,000 members, mostly mothers, who share their creations, gather inspiration, and swap recipes. The group’s administrator, Shirel Kaniznikov from Kiryat Malachi, is a mother of two – ages 12 and 7 – who enjoy special lunchboxes every morning. 'My daughter is a very picky eater,' Shirel shares. 'When she was 3 and in preschool, she’d bring her lunchboxes back full. That’s how I discovered bento culture, but it didn’t help much – she still ate mostly cucumbers and cheese. 'When my son started kindergarten, I noticed he wasn’t eating what I packed either, even though he’s not picky. I realized he needed more stimulation, so I started using the accessories I’d bought for my daughter. One day, I cut his toast into a puzzle shape, another time I put the vegetables on a skewer. Suddenly, the boxes came back empty.' So you started putting in more effort. 'My mom used to give my older sister 20 shekels and send us to the corner store for bread and cheese. My sister would say, ‘Let’s buy a chocolate bar and a bun – Mom won’t know,’ and that was my breakfast for years. I didn’t grow up with balanced meals and only learned to eat fruits and vegetables as an adult. My mom, bless her, didn’t put much effort into it. 'I’m not judging her, but even as a kid, I told myself I’d do things differently when I became a mom. Now, when my mom sees the lunchboxes I make, she asks, ‘Where do you get the energy? How do you have the patience?’ But honestly, when I see my kids eating and enjoying their food, I know I’ve done my part. Yesterday, I made a casserole in the shape of a Belgian waffle, and my son ate the whole thing.' How long does it take? 'Since I don’t pack huge portions and I prepare some things ahead of time, it takes me about 20 minutes. Of course, if I’m making something special like a casserole, it might take an hour. But generally, the kids eat things that are pretty easy to prepare. How long does it take to cut two cucumbers? I love the kitchen – I’m quick.' What’s inside the lunchbox? 'At home, I’m a pretty laid-back mom, but when it comes to school, I want them to eat well. There’s always a protein like cheese, tuna or hummus, some bread, two kinds of veggies or a veggie and a fruit, and a little snack on the side. Today, for example, I added pretzels.' What kind of accessories do you buy, and where from? 'Mostly from AliExpress – tiny forks, skewers, cutters, baking papers, stickers… it’s a whole world. It’s become a hobby for me. You’d be shocked if you saw my storage unit at home.' How much do all these accessories cost? 'I’ve spent a lot, I’ll admit – I went a little overboard. But the kids give great feedback; they appreciate it. One time, I made my son a dinosaur-shaped casserole. He came home and told me excitedly how all the kids crowded around his table to see his lunchbox. I was on cloud nine. I love feeding people, and I love hearing compliments.' Andy Dorfman Graitzer, 42, from Kibbutz Geva near Afula, prepares a carefully crafted lunchbox every morning for her 8-year-old daughter, Alma. After Alma was diagnosed with celiac disease a few months before starting first grade, Andy wanted to make sure her daughter’s meals were enjoyable and safe. 'She didn’t always want to eat, and there wasn’t always food available for her. I wanted to give her something fun and tasty, so I started preparing a specially designed lunchbox every morning. It takes me about 20 minutes. Sometimes I use cutters to create fun shapes in the bread, or I make fruit skewers,' she explains. 'We work closely with a nutritionist, and I make sure that Alma’s lunch has a little of everything: hummus, omelets and cheese. Many parents in the celiac community struggle with preparing meals because gluten-free food, unfortunately, isn’t the same. For example, gluten-free bread hardens like a rock when it cools. In these groups, we help each other with new ideas for what to pack, and that helps me keep things varied.' What should go into a child’s lunchbox? Nutritionist Yael Yoslevitz from Maccabi Healthcare Services in northern Israel stresses the importance of a balanced breakfast or mid-morning meal. 'Breakfast, or break-fast, is the meal that breaks the overnight fast. It’s essential for maintaining focus, balanced moods and optimal learning and functioning abilities. A lunchbox should include foods from all food groups.' Recommendations for a balanced lunchbox: Whole grains and complex carbohydrates: Carbs are a key source of energy. Choose complex carbohydrates, which help regulate blood sugar and provide lasting fullness. Look for breads that contain at least 50% whole grains. Proteins from both animal and plant sources: Proteins are vital for building body tissues, like building blocks for growth. Sources include dairy, eggs, meats and legumes such as lentils, beans and chickpeas. Fruits and vegetables: These are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, essential for overall health. Aim for at least five servings of colorful fruits and vegetables daily, with an emphasis on vegetables. Healthy fats: Fats are necessary for absorbing vitamins, hormone production and storing energy. Include sources like olive oil, avocados, tahini and natural nut butters. It's also crucial to pack the lunch in a way that maintains freshness and appeals visually to children. Andy highlights the importance of variety: 'We wouldn’t want to eat the same thing every day, so why should kids? Let them choose from a range of options – like cold pasta with vegetables and tuna or last night’s casserole with cut-up veggies.' Packaging also plays a significant role. Choose a lunchbox together with your child to make the experience more enjoyable. Additionally, always send your kid to school with a large water bottle, ensuring they stay hydrated throughout the day. Adding fresh or frozen fruit, mint or lemon can make water more appealing to kids.

Iran warns Gulf states against allowing airspace use for attacks	Tehran has told Gulf states it would be 'unacceptable' if they allowed their airspace to be used against Iran and any such move would draw a response, a senior Iranian official said on Tuesday, amid concerns about possible Israeli retaliation for last week's Iranian missile attack. The official was speaking as Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi headed to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states for talks. The comments also followed discussions between Iran and Gulf Arab capitals last week on the sidelines of an Asia conference in Qatar, when Gulf states sought to reassure Iran of their neutrality in any conflict between Tehran and Israel. 'Iran made it clear that any action by a Persian Gulf country against Tehran, whether through the use of airspace or military bases, will be regarded by Tehran as an action taken by the entire group, and Tehran will respond accordingly,' the senior Iranian official told Reuters. 'The message emphasised the need for regional unity against Israel and the importance of securing stability. It also made clear that any assistance to Israel, such as allowing the use of a regional countryâ€™s airspace for actions against Iran, is unacceptable,' he said.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syqk411qk1g	2024-10-08T12:12:32-07:00

Watch: IDF uncovers Hezbollah tunnel crossing into Israel	The 20-meter-long underground tunnel with no exit on the Israeli side, was discovered near Zar'it in southern Lebanon’s western sector and has been under Israeli control for months; IDF also continues with targeted airstrikes against dozens of Hezbollah underground command centers, killing more than 50 field commanders The IDF located and dismantled a Hezbollah tunnel that crossed about 10 meters (33 feet) from Lebanon’s Marwahin area into Israeli territory near the community of Zar'it, the military reported on Tuesday. The tunnel, found several months ago, was blocked at the border and had no exit into Israeli territory. Its discovery was part of the IDF's efforts to dismantle Hezbollah’s terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon. IDF troops, including special units, searched the tunnel and found weapons, explosive devices, and anti-tank missiles. The tunnel was under IDF control to prevent its use for terrorist activities. The IDF has not identified any other tunnels crossing from Lebanon into Israel. The tunnel extended about 20 meters in total and was likely dug over the past two years, according to military estimates. 'It’s a purely tactical route with no immediate impact,' the military said. Meanwhile, the IDF continues its search after detecting launch tunnels on the Lebanese side near Maroun al-Ras in the eastern sector and after uncovering Hezbollah’s underground infrastructure in villages across the region. Dozens of underground Hezbollah command posts were hit in airstrikes on Monday night, killing more than 50 tactical commanders. The IDF had been targeting them for months. Commandos from the 98th Division, operating in southern Lebanon’s eastern sector as part of the ground offensive that began last week, reported encountering heavily fortified Hezbollah positions. These positions were concealed and built of tough stone, making them difficult to dismantle. 'We’re halfway through, and there’s still work ahead in southern Lebanon,' the military said. The IDF noted that its forces have successfully isolated and neutralized Hezbollah ambushes. Over the past week, the commandos killed about 200 Hezbollah fighters, many of whom had been sent to reinforce the group. Every depot destroyed contained hundreds of weapons. Troops also used deceptive tactics to expose the terrorists. The scale of Hezbollah’s infrastructure forced the commandos to use around 100 tons of explosives in the first days of the operation to destroy Radwan Force’s weapons bunkers, which had been prepared for an invasion into Israel’s Galilee. The tunnels were also sealed with concrete. Addressing the ongoing threat of mortars and rockets, including the heavy Burkan rockets still present in Shia towns like Taybeh and Bint Jbeil, the IDF said: 'We’re achieving cumulative gains. We’re not only fighting on the ground but also conducting extensive airstrikes. The overall success of our operations will bring residents back to their homes.' The IDF stated that its forces destroyed underground routes and dozens of combat sites, uncovering and eliminating hundreds of weapons. Some of these weapons, including rockets, were seized from a Hezbollah depot by soldiers from the 890th Paratroopers Battalion. Lt. Col. Yoni, the battalion commander, said hours before the depot’s destruction, 'We found seven crates full of rockets that were intended to target Israel – new and fully operational. Nothing will remain here.' The military continues limited, targeted ground raids and airstrikes in southern Lebanon, based on precise intelligence, with the goal of neutralizing Hezbollah's capabilities and safely returning northern residents to their homes. On Monday, the IAF conducted a series of strikes in southern Lebanon on underground command centers of Hezbollah’s units in southern Lebanon: Nasser Unit, Bader Unit, Aziz Unit, and the Radwan Forces in the area. According to IDF assessments, In the 24 hours since Monday, 50 targets of the Aziz Unit, 30 targets of the Nasser Unit, and 5 targets of the Bader Unit were struck. Additionally, around 10 targets of the Radwan Forces and Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters, as well as approximately 30 targets of the medium-range rocket unit in southern Lebanon, were targeted. IDF announced Tuesday that it eliminated least 50 terrorists, including six senior commanders from Hezbollah's Southern Front and the Radwan Forces. The senior terrorists that were eliminated were identified as: Ahmad Hassan Nazal, head of the attack sector in Bint Jbeil for the Radwan Forces; Hussein Talal Kamal, head of the Ghajar sector; Musa Diab Barakat, outgoing head of the Ghajar sector; Mahmoud Mus Karnib, operations chief for the Ghajar sector; Ali Ahmad Ismail, artillery commander for the Bint Jbeil sector; Abdullah Ali Dakik, artillery commander for the Ghajar sector Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: Apple App Store: >	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hy7lnx71kl	2024-10-08T12:00:18-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/12/16/H1xm5IgKqY/H1xm5IgKqY_0_0_3000_1688_0_small.jpg
US says cease-fire call shows Hezbollah on back foot	Hezbollah's call for a cease-fire on Tuesday shows the terrorist group is on the back foot, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a regular briefing on Tuesday. Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem said in a televised address on Tuesday the Iran-backed group's capabilities were intact and its fighters were pushing back Israeli ground incursions, despite the 'painful blows' inflicted by Israel in recent weeks. Qassem also said the group supported the efforts of Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally, to secure a cease-fire, without providing further details on any conditions demanded by Hezbollah.	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byrgsem11x	2024-10-08T11:44:33-07:00

Netanyahu confirms Israel eliminated 'Nasrallah’s replacement'	In televised message to Lebanon's residents, prime minister says IDF eliminated former terror group leader's heir apparent Hashem Safieddine as well as his successor Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday that Hashem Safieddine, former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's heir apparent, was eliminated in Lebanon. 'We took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah’s replacement, and the replacement of his replacement,' Netanyahu said. Safieddine was targeted during a meeting of Hezbollah officials in Beirut's Dahieh quarter last Thursday. He served as the head of Hezbollah's executive committee and was Nasrallah's cousin. The identity of Al-Din's replacement, which Netanyahu referred to, remains unclear at this time. 'This is a message to the people of Lebanon: Do you remember when your country was called the pearl of the Middle East? I do. So, what happened to Lebanon? A gang of tyrants and terrorists destroyed it. That's what happened. Lebanon was once known for its tolerance, for its beauty. Today, it's a place of chaos, a place of war,' Netanyahu said at the start of his message, broadcast in English. 'Israel withdrew from Lebanon 25 years ago. But the country that actually conquered Lebanon is not Israel. It's Iran. Iran, which finances and arms Hezbollah to serve Iran's interests at Lebanon's expense. Hezbollah has turned Lebanon into a stockpile of ammunition weapons and a forward Iranian military base. 'Israel has decided to put an end to this. We've decided to do whatever is necessary to return our people safely to their homes. Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel also has a right to win! And Israel will win! We have degraded Hezbollah’s capabilities; We took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah’s replacement, and the replacement of his replacement,' the prime minister continued. 'Today, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years. Now you, the Lebanese people, you stand at a significant crossroads. It is your choice. You can now take back your country. You can return it to a path of peace and prosperity. If you don’t, Hezbollah will continue to try to fight Israel from densely populated areas at your expense. 'It doesn't care if Lebanon is dragged into a wider war. Christians, Druze, Muslims – Sunnis and Shiites – all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah's futile war against Israel. Today I ask every mother and every father in Lebanon a simple question: Is it worth it? Because, it doesn't have to be that way,' Netanyahu said. 'I know you want a better future for your children. So I am speaking to all of you today. There is a better way. A better way for your children, for your cities, for your villages, for your country. You deserve to restore Lebanon to its days of tranquility; you deserve a Lebanon that is different. One Country – One Flag – One People. 'Don't let these terrorists destroy your future any more than they've already done. Stand up and take your country back. You have an opportunity that hasn't existed in decades. An opportunity to take care of the future of your children and grandchildren. You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza. It doesn't have to be that way. 'Each of you can take a step for your future. Even a small step. You can make a difference. I say to you, the people of Lebanon: Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end. Free your country from Hezbollah so that your country can prosper again, so that future generations of Lebanese and Israeli children will know neither war nor bloodshed, but will finally live together in peace,' Netanyahu concluded.

Jewish rep in Iran's parliament complains officials in Tehran com...	Dr. Homayoun Sameh attacked Israel as usual, but this time he also criticized regime officials in Tehran; 'Some officials of our country mistakenly use the word 'Jew' instead of 'Zionist' in their statements, which casts a shadow over the Jewish community in Iran' As Israel plans to possibly attack Iran in response to it launching 181 missiles at Israel last week, the representative of the Jewish community in the Iranian parliament, Dr. Homayoun Sameh, criticized regime officials in Tehran. In an interview with the media in Iran, he stated that 'all the Jews of the world should not be blamed for the crimes of the Zionist regime.' 'If a Jewish person commits a crime and tarnishes the name of Jews throughout the world, it is like ISIS, Taliban and Al-Qaida carrying out attacks all Muslims being blamed.' He added: 'They committed a huge massacre in the world, and Islam did not, so we should not blame all Jews when a person who considers himself a Jew commits a crime.' Sameh also attacked Israel. 'The actions taken by the Zionist regime are political, and its actions have nothing to do with the teachings of Moses, peace be upon him, and many Jews in the world have condemned the actions of the Zionists,' he said. Later in the interview, the Jewish representative criticized a number of regime officials. 'Unfortunately, some officials of our country mistakenly use the word 'Jew' instead of 'Zionist' in their statements, which casts a shadow over the Jewish community in Iran. Sameh, who serves as a member of the Health and Medical Committee of the Iranian Parliament, said that condemnations against Israel were published not only in Iran, but also in Western countries 'by Jewish associations such as American Jews.' According to him, the condemnations 'teach that they are angry about the crimes of the Zionists and consider them inhumane and against human rights.' He noted that 'the presence of the Zionist regime in the region strengthens the interests of the Western countries. 'They increase the sale of weapons for profit.' He added that 'all the countries of the world, whether they are Islamic or not, should coordinate to act against the Zionist regime, and resist in a practical way so that the crimes of this regime will stop.'

Families of hostages met with Qatari representatives, Israel's UN...	Danny Danon said that mediators are eager to reach a deal, adding: 'Every day the hostages remain in the tunnels, their chances of returning alive diminishes' Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, addressed ongoing negotiations for the release of hostages on Tuesday. 'There was an important meeting between the families of the hostages and the Qatari ambassador,' he said. While Danon didn't attend the meeting, his comments followed a report from the Saudi network Al Arabiya that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar had recently contacted Qatar after a prolonged period of silence, during which his status was uncertain. Danon noted that 'mediators, including Qatar, Egypt and especially the U.S., are working to advance the process. I hope this will gain momentum. We believe it will; we want negotiations and progress on a new deal. But military pressure is also important – the combination of both is crucial.' When asked about the meeting’s content, Danon didn’t share specifics. 'I will just say that the mediators are eager to see some progress and are using their influence and capabilities. We should welcome that,' he said. 'As much as we despise Hamas and are determined to destroy it, we know that every day the hostages remain in the tunnels, their chances of survival diminish. That’s why we must act as quickly as possible on all fronts.' Danon also discussed a UN ceremony marking the anniversary of October 7, which was attended by hundreds of ambassadors, diplomats and Jewish leaders. He emphasized its significance. 'At the UN, people constantly speak against Israel, forgetting October 7 and focusing only on the suffering of the Gazans and Lebanese. Even ambassadors who aren’t particularly supportive of us, when faced with a bereaved mother speaking about her two daughters murdered at the Nova music festival, or Rabbi Doron Peretz recounting how his son Daniel’s body is being held by Hamas, it’s hard to remain indifferent. That’s why the event was so important.' Danon also addressed the absence of UN Secretary-General António Guterres from the event, explaining, 'We have a very complex relationship. I’ve known him for many years—he used to come to my house for Shabbat dinners. But something changed in him. Since October 7 he has become extremely antagonistic. I proposed a dialogue to de-escalate tensions, but it hasn’t happened. In my opinion, the secretary-general needs to be far more objective.'

UK, Netherlands fear rise in terror when Israel retaliates agains...	UK's MI5 chief says UK experienced worrying rise in external terror threats coming from Tehran, Moscow and radical Islamic terror groups including ISIS The UK's MI5 intelligence agency Director General Ken McCallum warned Tuesday of threats to the UK coming from Russia, Iran and Islamist terrorist groups including the Islamic State (ISIS). McCallum made his remarks during the annual update on the threats facing the UK and his comments are considered unusual. According to the MI5 head, the UK is dealing with a 'staggering rise' in assassination attempts by Russia and Iran on its soil. He said that both of the UK's adversaries are hiring criminals 'to do their dirty work.' McCallum noted that MI5 and the police have foiled 20 Iranian plots over the past two years and warned that Tehran might expand its targets in the UK if Israel launches a strong retaliatory strike in response to last week’s missile attacks. McCallum said the war in the Middle East and Israel’s fighting with Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen could lead to terror attacks in the UK. Talking about Iran, he mentioned that the escalation in the Middle East increases the likelihood of 'an increase in — or broadening of -– Iranian state aggression in the UK' The number of MI5 investigations aimed at thwarting threats to national security has increased by 48% over the past year. McCallum explained that most of the threats have come from Iran, Russia and China. He added that Russia’s military intelligence agency is trying to sow chaos in the UK and other European countries, partly through sabotage and arson. In his statement, McCallum noted that over 750 Russian diplomats have been ousted from European countries since the invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, and said that 'the vast majority' of them were spies. The MI5 chief added that 75% of the counterterrorism cases the UK is dealing with are related to radical Islam, while the rest involve far-right terrorism. Meanwhile, Norway has raised its terrorism threat assessment to the second-highest level due to an increased risk of attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets, the national police directorate said on Tuesday. Last week police in neighboring Denmark charged two men suspected of detonating hand grenades near Israel's Copenhagen embassy, while police in Sweden are investigating a suspected shooting near the Israeli diplomatic mission in Stockholm. 'PST raises the terror threat level in Norway from moderate to high as a result of the ongoing escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. It is primarily the threat to Jewish and Israeli targets that has been further intensified,' local police said in a statement.

She enlisted in IDF to honor her fallen brother; now she serves a...	Driven by the memory of her brother, fallen IDF soldier Avichai, and the desire to honor his legacy, Shira Emuna Amsalem enlisted at age 35 to lift the morale of soldiers, creating inspiring content that reinforces their historical and cultural significance 'We lost an exceptional soldier, we lost Amsalem,' said Avichai's commander after he died. I thought to myself, there's no way Hamas wins and there's no soldier Amsalem; there was a soldier Amsalem, and now there isn't? I am a soldier Amsalem,' shares Shira Emuna Amsalem, sister of the late Master Sergeant (Res.) Avichai Amsalem, who fell in battle in the south a year ago. Despite dealing with a chronic lung disease, Shira Emuna chose to enlist in the IDF following her younger brother's death. She joined the Military Rabbinate at the age of 35. Avichai Amsalem was called up for reserve duty on October 8 and fell the next day, October 9, during an encounter with terrorists who had infiltrated and planned an attack. His father, Col. Gabi Amsalem, also joined the reserves in the Military Rabbinate at the start of the war. During the conflict, he was promoted from lieutenant colonel to colonel by the IDF Chief of Staff. Shira Emuna serves in the Military Rabbinate in the Jewish Consciousness Values department located near Lod, in central Israel – the military base where many bodies from the October 7 massacre were taken. 'This year was complex,' she reflects. 'I think the first year of mourning brings various challenges, experiencing everything for the first time: his birthday, every holiday without him. We threw ourselves into many commemorations, and everyone started to find their place. It was a year of waves, with many ups and downs.' Gabi Amsalem knows the military from the inside, but this year was different for him due to the war's scale and the personal loss: 'There is life before October 7 and life after October 7. Life changes, perspectives shift. The military activity helps me keep my head above water in this situation imposed on us.' A year of longing for a brother and son turned into action for them. The family says this is how Avichai would have wanted them to act after his death. 'Avichai was a very principled person. He left behind many values I lecture and discuss – values of kindness, integrity, excellence – at home, in studies, work and the army,' says his father. 'He always aspired to achieve more. He reached a special unit and excelled there, yet remained humble and modest. He never flaunted his achievements, and he had quite a few. In his work at Elbit, in his studies, and he never boasted about it.' After Avichai's death, his older sister sought to follow in his footsteps and eventually enlisted for reserve service as a content writer. Her enlistment was part of the 'Stage B' program, which allows those who served in civilian or national service outside the military to undergo a short basic training and join the reserve force. 'After 12th grade, I did national service, and I think it complements,' she says. 'When you're directed to help the people of Israel, you need to know your strengths. At 18, I knew what I could offer the people of Israel and what strengths I had. I was the coordinator of the Oz children's movement in the north and spent a year as an emmisary in the United States. Avichai's death caught me between jobs. My profession is writing and editing content, and there was a need here for a content writer in the unit, so I came to do what I could.' Strengthening the spirit Initially, the IDF was hesitant to place her in a role, but Shira Emuna was determined to enlist. 'When she enlisted, I felt the excitement of a father taking his child to first grade for the first time. The truth is, when she started first grade, I was the principal of her school,' says the emotional father, whose daughter serves close to his office. 'I helped her find a uniform, and we sent the photos to friends. Shira is known in the family for achieving the goals she sets for herself. They didn't want to enlist her, they showed her the door, she came through the window, they closed the window and she found another way in.' 'All the kids in the neighborhood asked me where the rifle was, and I had to explain that my role is to encourage those in uniform,' she shares. 'I remember when my dad saw me in uniform for the first time, he was very emotional. For me, it’s significant because I hadn’t worn a uniform until now. I always admired soldiers I saw on the street, and now I’m in uniform. A hundred years ago, we dreamed of a Jewish army. The fact that initially they didn’t want to enlist me and I fought for it makes it even more emotional.' Why didn't you say 'We lost Avichai, we paid a heavy price, now we are focusing on mourning and our recovery' Gabi says that 'Avichai would have told Shira Emuna and me – continue to do for the people of Israel. He wouldn’t have said, 'I did, I gave, I finished my inventory.' We are there contributing to the people of Israel. On a personal level, I feel I receive much more than I give. The very fact that I do a lot, am busy a lot, allows me to cope with the pain and feel the camaraderie of the people of Israel.' 'I feel I managed to channel my pain into action for the greater good,' says Shira Emuna. 'The evil acts of October 7 were also done to weaken our spirit, and I took on a role whose essence is to strengthen the spirit for myself and for religious female soldiers who sometimes feel a bit isolated in the places where they serve and need this reinforcement.' A reminder of the historical significance: Both have embraced the role of uplifting the spirit – supporting soldiers, boosting morale and providing talks and materials on the importance each soldier holds in history. 'Beyond everything the Military Rabbinate does, including handling casualties, there's a whole branch dedicated to the fighting spirit,' Gabi explains. 'When we lift the spirits of the troops, it enhances our ability to cope in tough times, and with this strength, we will also reach Simchat Torah. Our main focus this past year has been nurturing the fighting spirit. Shira Emuna creates content for female soldiers, there are multimedia products, and we bring lecturers, artists and actors to the units to help elevate the soldiers' morale.' 'The goal is to reach every soldier with our content,' Gabi says. 'We are focused on strengthening morale. You wouldn't believe how many soldiers desire and need this. We come during their limited free time and find the right moments for them, which is of tremendous importance.' 'When soldiers are overwhelmed with continuous tasks, at some point it becomes exhausting,' Shira Emuna says. 'It's tiring. The sleeping conditions aren't always five-star hotel quality. When someone arrives and gives you a pamphlet, a page or even a file via WhatsApp, suddenly you are reminded that you're part of a historical process spanning thousands of years, known as the people of Israel. Everything you do gains perspective, especially for a religious female soldier who sometimes enlists alone, sometimes in combat roles where there aren't many others like her. I create content for them to give them the spirit they need.' She continues: 'My writing draws inspiration from Jewish women throughout history. For Hanukkah, we wrote about Hannah and her seven sons, and for Purim about Esther. These are stories of heroism that were often behind the scenes until they succeeded. The writing can speak to a religious girl who may be alone on base.' 'When I'm in the field,' Gabi adds, 'I also see non-religious female soldiers who engage with Shira Emuna's content, and it resonates with them, and they connect to it.' They are now preparing for the anniversary of Avichai's death, carrying mixed emotions from the past year. 'My message is that we need to strengthen unity and togetherness within the people of Israel,' Gabi states. 'In the army, we create unity among soldiers, and it's important that we also connect all types of populations in the nation. Connection, embraces and closeness are crucial, and we hope it reaches all of Israel. There are disagreements, but they will diminish, and unity will prevail.' 'I believe everyone has a responsibility for connection and unity in the nation,' Shira Emuna says. 'The home front and the frontlines are two sides of the same coin. A strong home front empowers the frontlines.' The holiday season brings significant difficulty and complexity. 'The annual memorial for Avichai will be two days after Simchat Torah. On that holiday, he was called up from home, leaving behind a pregnant wife and two daughters,' Gabi recalls. 'On Simchat Torah, we'll feel it was the day he left home. Will I dance with a Torah scroll in the synagogue, or will I lack the strength? I don't know.' >	https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjpbtugy1l	2024-10-08T09:25:16-07:00	https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2024/10/07/SJhlaEW1ye/SJhlaEW1ye_0_613_1200_676_0_small.jpg

Following long period in which contact was lost with Hamas' leader, officials say Arab media report claiming he's alive is incorrect and his fate remains uncertain Israeli officials on Tuesday said recent reports claiming Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar made contact with Qatar are incorrect, amid uncertainty about his fate following a prolonged period in which contact with him was lost. 'It's not true, Sinwar didn't make contact with mediating countries,' the officials said. Israel has been investigating whether Sinwar was injured or killed in one of the IDF strikes in Gaza since September after contact with him was lost, according to the terror group. Last week, during a meeting attended by IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, a question mark was placed on his picture in a briefing held there. According to a report released on Monday, it seemed that Sinwar was still alive, but it seems now that the issue remains uncertain. A New York Times report published over the weekend noted that U.S. officials believe the mastermind of the October 7 massacre is still alive and making 'critical decisions,' even a year after October 7. Washington believes Sinwar is determined to see Israel embroiled in a full-scale war across the Middle East, especially with the IDF's entry into southern Lebanon for the first time since 2006. As a result, he has no intention of negotiating a hostage deal.

You told me you couldn’t breathe': Former hostages write to thei...	Aviva Siegel and Sapir Cohen, who experienced horror in Hamas captivity and were released in hostage deal recall ordeal in letters and ask for their loved ones not to lose hope Aviva Siegel was kidnapped on October 7 alongside her husband Keith from Kibbutz Kfar Aza and was released in the first hostage deal without him. Sapir Cohen was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz with her partner Sasha Trufanov, who is still being held in Gaza, along with Eitan Horn, who was with her in captivity. In letters they wrote, both women recount the difficult moments they experienced in captivity, along with those still left behind who are enduring the same hardships every day. Sapir Cohen was held in Gaza for 55 days before being released in the first hostage deal. She was kidnapped along with her partner, Sasha Trufanov, from his family's home in Nir Oz. In a letter she wrote to Eitan Horn, with whom she was held in captivity, Cohen shared: 'I remember the early days of captivity when you lay on the mattress without moving, eyes closed, trying to imagine you weren't part of this reality. Occasionally, there were whispers I couldn't understand because you were debating which language to speak in, wondering what would be safer.' 'After several days of hunger, one of the captors came by and handed out small chocolates. Each of us took one without hesitation, but you chose not to. I was surprised and wondered why and then you explained you simply couldn’t eat. Thoughts about what would happen tomorrow, and whether we’d even make it to that day, about the moment your parents were told you and your brother had been kidnapped, they paralyzed you,' she added. 'I remember the songs you sang to us, even the terrorists hummed along. When you didn’t have an appetite, you told me, 'Don’t worry Sapir, at least I’ll come back to Israel skinny and fit, ready to find a bride.'' 'We tried to encourage you to talk and open up over time. I remember you telling me that the Eitan in captivity wasn’t the same Eitan, that the difference was so vast. Eitan is a person full of joy and humor, always thinking of how to help others before himself, a gifted poet and not a bad singer at all. With time you decided to make a change, to set the fear aside and try to be the Eitan you were before you 'got lost,' and you truly made significant progress,' she wrote. 'I remember the day you said you saw the number 10 suddenly appear on the wall. You were convinced we would be released in 10 days. You were right; I was released, but you stayed behind along with other men who dreamed of their own moment of freedom. You all came to hug me, to say goodbye. I remember the tears. As usual, I was optimistic and said: 'Guys, no need to get emotional, we’ll see each other back in Israel in two days,'' she also recalled. 'You were half optimistic, half scared, wondering what would happen if something went wrong, if you'd be forgotten or if you weren't important enough. I want you to know that we’re fighting for you at every day and every moment. We will continue to say your names and won't stop this difficult, dark journey until you’re free. I remember the songs you sang to us, even the terrorists hummed along. When you didn’t have an appetite, you told me, 'Don’t worry Sapir, at least I’ll come back to Israel skinny and fit, ready to find a bride.'' Aviva Siegel to her husband Keith: ‘I can't understand how you're still in there.’ Aviva and Keith Siegel moved to Kibbutz Kfar Aza when they made aliyah from the U.S. 40 years ago. They were abducted from the kibbutz on October 7, and Aviva was released after 51 days as part of the hostage deal. Her husband is still being held by Hamas. In her letter, Aviva wrote: 'When I landed in the helicopter at Wolfson Children's Hospital and met our sweet children, I couldn’t believe I was there without you. I was in shock for at least a few weeks before I could even grasp that we were separated and that I’m here without you.' 'Do you remember the tunnel they took us to and left us alone there? Do you remember how hard it was to breathe? I remember looking at you, barely able to speak, and you told me you couldn’t breathe.' 'I remember we were there in that small room in Gaza and I came to tell you that they said I needed to leave. I looked at you and saw the fear in your eyes; you couldn't say a word. I looked at you and told you that I would be strong for you, and you would be strong for me, and I swear to you Keith, that’s the only thing that goes through my mind all day and all night. 'I’m staying strong for you so that you can stay strong for me and for the children and grandchildren. I truly hope you're managing to hold on there. Do you remember the tunnel they took us to and left us alone there? Do you remember how hard it was to breathe? I remember looking at you, barely able to speak, and you told me you couldn’t breathe,' she recalls, 'I looked at you and told you that everything was okay, that it just seemed that way. Deep inside, I believed those were our last moments; I saw your chest barely able to rise and I just prayed that you wouldn’t die, that I wouldn’t be left there alone with you dead next to me. Do you remember how hungry we were? How we begged them to fill our little water bottle that had been empty for an entire day?' 'I can't understand how you're still in there. I can't understand how the world is silent. I can't understand how people hear the terrible stories I tell of what we went through and what you're still going through, and the sun keeps rising and setting, while you're stuck in this nightmare,' Aviva continued. 'Keith, I beg you to believe that you'll come home. I ask you not to lose hope. I ask you not to stop imagining the moment when you’ll exit the helicopter and land in Israel with us. We’re all waiting for you so much. I can’t wait to make you the food you love, I can’t wait to tell you that Shay survived everything that happened in Kfar Aza and he’s okay, he’s crossing his fingers for you, hoping you're okay too,' she wrote. 'We're all dreaming and imagining the moment when we can hug you. And it will come, and it will be perfect, and we’ll slowly be able to start our new lives together.'

US senators in Jerusalem say no Saudi normalization is 'victory' ...	Sens. Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal hold news conference in Jerusalem during state visit and stress importance of Saudi normalization with Israel and action against Tehran Prominent U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Saudi Arabia and Israel on Tuesday to establish diplomatic ties by the end of the year, warning that the next U.S. administration is unlikely to be able to secure enough votes to support the deal. 'If by Christmas we do not have a normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran will have a strategic victory,' Graham said in a press conference from Jerusalem alongside Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal. The Biden administration is seeking to broker a normalization accord between the two countries that would include U.S. security guarantees for Gulf state Saudi Arabia, among other bilateral deals between Washington and Riyadh. 'We can get you a treaty through the Senate between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a defense agreement like you have in Japan and Australia, if you do it on President Biden's watch,' Graham, who is seen as close to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, told reporters. 'It has been a constant policy of the U.S. to try to avoid a nuclear-armed Iran… but attacking a nuclear facility right now is, perhaps, not the wisest course to take,' Blumenthal said, adding that further escalation of the war may not be in the best interests of Israel and the U.S. interests. 'I don’t know what targets Israel will pick, but I know it will respond,' Graham said. 'Missile defense worked very well, but eventually one will get through and kill Israelis. It’s just a matter of time, and that would trigger a massive response.' Democrat Joe Biden's term as president will end on Jan. 20. Graham, a longtime senator, is a key Republican in Congress with influence on foreign policy and national security matters. Graham, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, said he would travel to Saudi Arabia to meet de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and to the United Arab Emirates for talks with President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The UAE established relations with Israel in 2020 as part of the so-called Abraham Accords. Saudi officials, including Prince Mohammed, have discussed potentially establishing ties with Israel but over the past year insisted that it include at least the pathway to a Palestinian state, a markedly steeper challenge since the Gaza war erupted. Israeli-Saudi normalization could open the door to many other Arab and Muslim-majority nations forging ties with Israel and thus bolstering regional stability, given Riyadh's sway in the Muslim world as home to Islam's two holiest sites in Mecca and Media. Two-state solution 'dead' But even before the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Gaza's ruling Hamas terrorists that triggered the war, Netanyahu's right-wing government had rejected a 'two-state solution' to the conflict with the Palestinians. Graham said the two-state solution - an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel - had been 'dead' ever since the cross-border assault by Hamas gunmen, who killed about 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage a year ago. 'The Israeli public will not accept a Palestinian state as a result of this barbaric terrorist attack, because it's rewarding terrorism. I get that,' Graham said, but he added Israel could work with Riyadh, along with the UAE, on the Palestinian file. Riyadh has repeatedly called for an end to the war and said the two-state solution and regional stability are interdependent. Netanyahu has said that establishing diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia would lead to a 'historic reconciliation' between Arab states and Israel, and between Islam and Judaism and vowed to pursue an accord. Israel has diplomatic ties with a few Arab or Muslim-majority states including the UAE, Egypt, Jordan and Morocco.

Bandages and missing fingers: Iranian footage shows injured Hezbo...	Video of Hezbollah terrorists injured in pager attack shows them visiting a tomb in the city of Mashhad, with their hands and eyes bandaged after receiving medical treatment in Iran The Iranian news agency Mehr released footage of Hezbollah terrorists injured in pager and walkie talkie explosions across Lebanon last month. The video made public on Tuesday shows terrorists from the group with bandaged hands and eyes, likely from blast injuries. Some are even seen in wheelchairs. According to the agency, these Hezbollah terrorists are now in Iran receiving medical treatment. In the footage, they are shown visiting the tomb of Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha in the city of Mashhad. After the first pager explosion on September 18, Iranian media reported that the Iranian Red Crescent had transported 95 injured individuals from Lebanon to Iran for further treatment. 'Most of the injured suffered hand and eye wounds. Upon arrival in Iran, they were transferred to hospitals for continued care,' according to the head of the Red Crescent. The latest Mehr video highlights these hand injuries. Lebanese network MTV reported on September 18 that Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, who was also injured in the pager explosion, was flown from Beirut to Tehran to complete his treatment. Around 90 other injured individuals, along with their families, were on the same flight. In the days following his injury, Amani said: 'My injury is an honor, as I stood with the Lebanese people during this war crime.' While receiving treatment in Tehran, he was visited by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.

World unites in commemoration of October 7 and calls for release ...	Commemorations around world over marked first anniversary of Hamas attack, with events from the US to Europe honoring the victims; 'We are showing the world that despite the loud anti-Israel minority, the majority supports Israel' On Monday, commemorations were held around the world to mark the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas massacre, as communities honored the victims and raised awareness about the hostages still held in Gaza. In the United States, students from elementary to college levels participated in the 'Yellow Shirt Initiative,' organized by Club Z, a Jewish advocacy group. Students wore yellow to remember the victims of the attack and to call attention to the 101 hostages still in captivity, including seven American citizens and a baby, Kfir Bibas, kidnapped at nine months old. 'By wearing yellow, we are sending a clear message that none of us are alone,' said Masha Merkulova, founder of Club Z. 'We are showing the world that despite the loud anti-Israel minority, the majority supports Israel and the release of hostages.' 'Many students have encountered Jew hatred in their schools after October 7. They often feel alone and isolated. By fellow students, teachers, and strangers all wearing yellow to remember the horrors of October 7 and the hostages still in captivity, we are sending a clear and strong message that none of us are alone,' said Masha Merkulova, founder of Club Z. 'The families of the hostages will see that they are not forgotten. Club Z empowers us to have a voice and to learn how to lead change for good. I am proud of this student-led initiative. Together, we are showing the world that despite the loud anti-Israel minority, the majority supports Israel, supports the release of hostages from the hands of a terror organization and stands with humanity,' The yellow ribbon has been a popular emblem of support during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis (when 52 Americans were held in captivity in Tehran for 444 days), for military families during Operation Desert Storm and a symbol of a loved one who is missing or has been abducted (for example, Fiona Cameron wore yellow ribbons after her daughter Sasha was abducted in 1999). 'The yellow symbolizes awareness and support, it sends a message that we are all together, especially for those far from home,' explained Club Z teen Eli Fooksman, 'you don’t need to be Israeli or Jewish to mourn the loss of so many innocent lives on October 7 or to call for the unconditional release of children, women and men. It’s not an Israeli issue. It is a humanitarian issue.' In the Netherlands, around 2,000 people gathered in the town of Barneveld in a memorial event organized by Christians for Israel. The event featured prayers, speeches and a performance of the song Am Yisrael Chai led by Dutch Chief Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs. 'Anti-Zionism is antisemitism,' Rabbi Jacobs told the crowd, a message that resonated as attendees expressed solidarity with Israel. 'These 2,000 people here today are just a small part of the more than 60,000 members we have across the Netherlands,' said Frank van Oordt, CEO of Christians for Israel. 'We are here not only to mourn but to express hope—hope that even in the most difficult of times, love and solidarity can overcome hatred and violence.' 'Our love and support for Israel are boundless. We stood together today as a testament to the power of friendship and faith, and we will continue to do so in the days to come,' van Oordt said in his closing remarks. 'We stood here today, as we have stood for years, united in our belief that Israel deserves our support not just in words but in action,' said Christians for Israel Chairman Rev. Frank Heikoop, emphasizing the movement’s unwavering commitment to supporting Israel. 'This gathering shows the deep bond that exists between our nations.' In Vienna, the 104-year-old Wunderwerk Wien church hosted an event standing against rising antisemitism. Pastor Birgit Berchtold, who leads the Pentecostal-charismatic congregation, emphasized the church’s historical support for Israel, saying, 'As Christians, our faith compels us to stand with Israel not only in words but in action. We believe that by supporting Israel, we are living out our calling to love, honor and protect those who are persecuted.' Sweden also hosted a memorial service, with hundreds gathering at Kristet Center in Örebro to stand with Israel and honor the victims of the attack. Pastor Per-Åke Eliasson of Kristet Center affirmed his congregation’s support for Israel, saying, 'We refuse to be silent in the face of such evil. Our support for Israel is rooted in love, in faith, and in the belief that we must stand up against hatred wherever it exists.' He emphasized that their support goes beyond times of celebration. 'We stand with Israel not just in times of joy, but especially in times of suffering. Our voices will rise against injustice, and our prayers will strengthen those who fight for freedom and peace.' These commemorations, held in different parts of the world, underscored the global solidarity with Israel and the ongoing calls for the release of hostages and peace in the region.

Prominent U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Saudi Arabia and Israel on Tuesday to establish diplomatic ties by the end of the year, warning that the next U.S. administration is unlikely to be able to secure enough votes to support the deal. The Biden administration is seeking to broker a normalization accord between the two countries that would include U.S. security guarantees for Gulf state Saudi Arabia, among other bilateral deals between Washington and Riyadh. 'We can get you a treaty through the Senate between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a defense agreement like you have in Japan and Australia, if you do it on President Biden's watch,' Graham, who is seen as close to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, told reporters in Jerusalem. 'The next president will have a very difficult time getting 67 votes,' he said in reference to the two-thirds majority needed in the U.S. Senate to approve a defense treaty. Democrat Joe Biden's term as president will end on Jan. 20.

It’s my home' Rachel Edri, who survived a harrowing 17-hour hostage situation during Hamas' October 7 attack, has vowed to return to her home in Ofakim, where she and her husband, David, were held captive by five Hamas terrorists. Edri, 66, managed to deceive the terrorists, keeping them at bay with conversation and even offering them tea and cookies. After a complex rescue operation involving her son Evyatar, a police officer, both she and her husband were freed. David passed away four months after the ordeal, never fully recovering from the trauma. Edri's story has since become a symbol of resilience in Israel. Her likeness has been featured on the popular prime-time sketch show Eretz Nehederet (often dubbed 'the Israeli Saturday Night Live') and starred in a web comedy series. Her image has appeared in countless, online memes, murals and even tattoos. She has also been the subject of a documentary about her life which is set to air soon by public broadcaster Kan 11. Along with her son Evyatar, Edri has toured internationally, sharing her experience with Jewish communities. 'Over the past year, my mom and I lectured in London, Berlin and various places in the U.S., mainly for Jewish organizations like the Gush Etzion Foundation or Friends of Israel,' Evyatar said. 'It really helps me, and every time I share what we went through, it eases me emotionally,' Rachel added. However, Edri still struggles to cope with the loss of her beloved husband. 'David wasn’t just my husband, he was my best friend,' she said. 'We were together for 43 years and my best years were with him. When the terrorists put a gun to David’s head, they told him, 'You won’t be alive by morning.' David was in shock from that moment on. 'Even after we were rescued, he never returned to his past self. From that day, he withered before my eyes. I’m telling you this now and I can't stop crying. It got to the point where he couldn’t do anything on his own. For four months, I bathed him, dressed him and fed him. I took care of him all the time, praying to God, 'Don’t take away him from me.' 'He could barely speak anymore. I would ask him, 'David, tell me what hurts,' but he would stay silent. I’m not myself since he died. I have no days or nights without him. Every day when it gets dark, I curse it. It’s just another night of sleeping without him,' she recounted. Are you receiving psychological treatment? How do you spend your day? 'I receive close support from a wonderful social worker and I participate in support groups in Ofakim for senior women affected by October 7. As part of the groups, I attend classes and special events.' Where do you currently live? 'In a house in Ofakim with the rent paid by the government. The day after my first interview we were moved to a hotel, but I asked to return to Ofakim less than a month later. I wanted my peace, my spot and my kitchen.' Evyatar: 'Mom is living with my younger brother now. It's going to get even more complicated because she’s decided she wants to return to her previous home in Ofakim — despite everything that happened there and even though there’s now a memorial for the fallen near the house.' 'At first, we tried to dissuade her, saying, 'Why would you want these flashbacks and nightmares?' Ofakim’s mayor also approached us and offered to buy the house and turn it into a museum. But Mom refused. She said, 'I want to go back. I want to live and die in that house. It’s my home.' To me, her words are a victory. The house is currently under renovation, and she'll move in five months from now,' he added. Rachel, won't it be hard for you to return to live in the house with all those difficult memories? 'I’m sure it’ll be very hard to return to the place where this trauma took place. But I want to show the terrorists that I’m not afraid. I’m going back to the house where my children grew up and where my husband lived and I’m not planning to leave it until the day I die.'

40% of US Muslims deny October 7 atrocities, survey finds	Less than third of US Muslims believe terrorists engaged in acts of murder and rape during massacre; Harris put in tough position, balancing pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian voters to win critical swing state of Michigan and presidency Almost 4 in 10 U.S. Muslims (39%) believe that Hamas did not engage in acts of murder and rape during the October 7 attack on Israel, while only 31% acknowledge that Hamas terrorists did commit such acts, according to a new survey conducted by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, revealing significant divisions in how American Muslims view the terrorist group's actions that day. The survey, conducted by J.L. Partners, also found that 59% of American Muslims see the attack as an effort 'to advance the Palestinian cause,' compared to just 14% who, like 51% of the general American public, view it as motivated by a desire 'to kill Jews and seek the destruction of Israel.' The poll surveyed 1,000 respondents from the general public, with an additional 500 Muslim respondents. The findings underscore the complexity facing Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as she seeks to balance support from Jewish and Arab voters. Harris, a staunch supporter of Israel’s right to self-defense, has also expressed concern over civilian casualties in Gaza, drawing criticism from both sides. In Michigan, a key swing state with a significant Arab and Muslim population, Harris met with community leaders last week to hear their concerns, aware that losing their support could jeopardize her campaign. The survey shows that 49% of Muslims in the U.S. believe Harris is too pro-Israel, while 29% consider her position balanced. Only 7% feel she is overly supportive of Palestinians. These tensions are playing out as Harris faces tight races in several battleground states, with polls showing her lead within the margin of error in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan—states that are critical to her electoral strategy. The survey also highlights a key contrast in voting priorities. While 34% of Muslims in the U.S. identify the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the most important issue in the upcoming November 5 elections, only 4% of the general public shares this view, with most Americans prioritizing inflation and economic concerns.

Dozens of interceptions seen over northern Israel following Hezbo...	Rocket sirens blare in Haifa, Acre and other regions in northern Israel in two separate volleys shortly following Hezbollah deputy chief's speech; IDF says 85 rockets fired in first salvo from sector where IDF operations began overnight Dozens of rocket interceptions in two separate volleys were observed Monday afternoon in the skies over northern Israel, including Haifa, Acre and the surrounding areas, following a series of rocket sirens. Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency services said there were no immediate reports of injuries after conducting sweeps of the areas where alarms were triggered. The first barrage occurred shortly after a speech by Hezbollah Deputy Secretary-General Naim Qassem, following the assassination of the terrorist group's leader Hassan Nasrallah, by Israeli forces in Beirut. 'Attempts to pressure and intimidate us will fail. We are inspired by Nasrallah's strength, and we are his sons. He left behind a legacy of strong resistance across a wide front,' Qassem said, with a second rocket salvo fired about 30 minutes later. 'Israel aimed to eliminate the resistance and destroy the Palestinian people, but the Palestinian people cannot be defeated.' Qassem also remarked on Lebanon’s role, saying that 'the Lebanese front has exhausted the enemy' and indicated that Hezbollah would only consider a cease-fire if efforts by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri for a 21-day truce were successful. 'We support the political process led by Berri for a cease-fire. Until then, there will be no discussion,' Qassem said. The IDF reported that 'approximately 85 rockets were launched from Lebanon, and interception attempts were made. The details are under investigation.' The army added that Israeli forces struck Hezbollah terror targets in the Dahieh district of Beirut. The heavy rocket barrage on Haifa originated from a sector where IDF operations began Monday night. Earlier in the day, rocket sirens were also triggered in Tiberias and several nearby communities, including Mitzpeh, Kfar Hittim and Lavi. The IDF reported that 25 rockets had been fired from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted, while others landed in open areas. The Tiberias municipality confirmed that three rockets exploded in open fields, and no injuries were reported. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s official news agency reported that three people were killed in an airstrike in Suhmur, in the western Bekaa Valley. Earlier reports indicated airstrikes in several locations in southern Lebanon, including Sarfa, Arzoun, Alma al-Shaab and other areas near the Israeli border.

According to him, 'we draw inspiration from Nasrallah's strength. We are his sons. He left a legacy of steadfast resistance across a wide front. The Al-Aqsa Flood is an unusual event, which is the beginning of the change of the Middle East.' Qassem added that 'Israel's goal was to eliminate the resistance and destroy the Palestinian people. Without American support, the aggression would have stopped within a month.'	https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjle5uzyyx	2024-10-08T02:31:09-07:00
